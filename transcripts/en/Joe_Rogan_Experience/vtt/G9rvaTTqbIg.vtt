00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.630
<v Speaker 2>My kids are getting old enough now where their sports leagues no longer,</v>

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.883
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.280
<v Speaker 2>for awhile there I was just driving me crazy as it was apparent and go into a</v>

5
00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:13.880
<v Speaker 2>game and realizing that they weren't keeping score because they didn't want to</v>

6
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.853
<v Speaker 2>upset.</v>

7
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

8
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.140
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole reason why people get better.</v>

9
00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:18.890
<v Speaker 2>You fucks.</v>

10
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile the kids are keeping score.</v>

11
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:20.990
<v Speaker 2>The kids know for sure.</v>

12
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.330
<v Speaker 2>And kids don't want you to blow smoke up their ass.</v>

13
00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:23.541
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

14
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:23.960
<v Speaker 2>You don't want it.</v>

15
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.940
<v Speaker 2>They'd come off the court and if my,</v>

16
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

17
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.471
<v Speaker 2>I would like the,</v>

18
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:28.250
<v Speaker 2>the oldest boy,</v>

19
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.881
<v Speaker 2>a scooter,</v>

20
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:30.080
<v Speaker 2>he's 10 years old and he's,</v>

21
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 2>he plays a lot of Lacrosse.</v>

22
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:33.320
<v Speaker 2>He's been playing for five years and so he's,</v>

23
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.760
<v Speaker 2>he really likes it and he does.</v>

24
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.541
<v Speaker 2>He does well,</v>

25
00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:36.051
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

26
00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:38.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not raising the Division One champion there.</v>

27
00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:39.554
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

28
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.000
<v Speaker 2>But he plays other sports too.</v>

29
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.511
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

30
00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:43.010
<v Speaker 2>there's sort of a well-roundedness there.</v>

31
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.800
<v Speaker 2>But we came off the field one day and we were walking along and,</v>

32
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.023
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

33
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

34
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.880
<v Speaker 2>all the parents were kind of marching off and the game was over.</v>

35
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

36
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.131
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

37
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:52.521
<v Speaker 2>how do I do?</v>

38
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:52.851
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

39
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:53.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

40
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

41
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 2>you could've done better.</v>

42
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

43
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.151
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

44
00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:59.240
<v Speaker 2>I just get the impression he didn't try as hard as you could.</v>

45
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

46
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:02.180
<v Speaker 2>And he looked at me irritated,</v>

47
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

48
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.321
<v Speaker 2>He looked at me like,</v>

49
00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you didn't just say I did great.</v>

50
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.010
<v Speaker 2>And so he said,</v>

51
00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

52
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.651
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

53
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:08.660
<v Speaker 2>and I looked at him,</v>

54
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking along and I didn't realize the parents were within earshot.</v>

55
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.631
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

56
00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:11.751
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

57
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

58
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

59
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.711
<v Speaker 2>screwed.</v>

60
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Do you want me to blow smoke up your ass or do you want me to be honest with</v>

61
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:16.070
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

62
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.330
<v Speaker 2>And to his credit,</v>

63
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 2>he said you,</v>

64
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 2>and he'd be honest with me,</v>

65
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:20.150
<v Speaker 2>even though he wasn't happy about it.</v>

66
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:20.960
<v Speaker 2>The honesty.</v>

67
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.920
<v Speaker 2>So you should be honest with me.</v>

68
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.120
<v Speaker 2>And so we,</v>

69
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 2>we tell kids,</v>

70
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.710
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

71
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.670
<v Speaker 2>they know better.</v>

72
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:26.091
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

73
00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:29.120
<v Speaker 2>if you tell a kid that they're great and they're doing wonderful and they</v>

74
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:29.954
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

75
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 2>what did they take away from that?</v>

76
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 2>They take away from it that you're kind of bullshit,</v>

77
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

78
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.093
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

79
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 2>unless they're just super,</v>

80
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:37.304
<v Speaker 2>super young,</v>

81
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.031
<v Speaker 2>they pretty,</v>

82
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.470
<v Speaker 2>they get it at a pretty early age.</v>

83
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

84
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

85
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>here's something that's important to relate to children that you are not your</v>

86
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments.</v>

87
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>You are you,</v>

88
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.130
<v Speaker 1>and the only way you are going to get better at accomplishing things is to be a</v>

89
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent honest about the amount of effort you put in and what the actual</v>

90
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>result of that effort is.</v>

91
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a failure or a success that does not define you.</v>

92
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>The defines your participation in this particular activity.</v>

93
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:06.864
<v Speaker 1>It is not you.</v>

94
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>You are an individual that will hopefully learn from all of your endeavors,</v>

95
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>but you're never going to learn shit if you lie to yourself.</v>

96
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>He never going to learn shit.</v>

97
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 1>If somebody makes this,</v>

98
00:02:17.641 --> 00:02:21.540
<v Speaker 1>nobody scores a point in there are new winners and there are no losers in.</v>

99
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's amazing that that's not good because good voice by the way,</v>

100
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not good because there's going to be people out there that are fucking</v>

101
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>driven and psychotic and they're going to get ahead.</v>

102
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are task oriented and goal oriented it and they have an idea</v>

103
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>ahead of them going to try to figure out how to make this happen.</v>

104
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.741
<v Speaker 1>They have a goal,</v>

105
00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>they want to reach it,</v>

106
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>and if you're competing with that person and any form of life and they're not</v>

107
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:50.721
<v Speaker 1>burdened down by the bullshit that we give so many kids today,</v>

108
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.450
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have a massive advantage and this idea that this kid who's been</v>

109
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>coddled and treated like he's always going to be a winner,</v>

110
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>that somehow or another they're going to be happier fucking crazy</v>

111
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 2>kid camp process.</v>

112
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 2>What's true and what's not and the kid can't process criticism,</v>

113
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 2>constructive criticism,</v>

114
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.961
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

115
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 2>You don't just stand there and berate you're kid of course.</v>

116
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:12.050
<v Speaker 2>Now that's just as bad as the other.</v>

117
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

118
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.401
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

119
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:12.801
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

120
00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 2>They're the guys that stand on and everybody's seen them.</v>

121
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

122
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 2>The dads and sometimes the moms,</v>

123
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 2>it's down on the sideline and break their kid because kids jeopardizing his</v>

124
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 2>scholarship to some more on school morons.</v>

125
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.611
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

126
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:25.080
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

127
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I think you're absolutely right.</v>

128
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:27.904
<v Speaker 2>They've got to,</v>

129
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 2>the sooner they're able to assess that,</v>

130
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 2>that equation effort,</v>

131
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.221
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

132
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 2>and result and compare it to what's going on around them.</v>

133
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.901
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

134
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:38.141
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

135
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:38.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:42.060
<v Speaker 2>not everybody wins the lottery of life to a little bit.</v>

137
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that the problem with socialism and the idea of we should even out the</v>

138
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 2>playing field?</v>

139
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.171
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

140
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:48.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea that competition,</v>

141
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 2>you're a competition guy,</v>

142
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

143
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.080
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

144
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 2>a famous Democrat,</v>

145
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 2>John Kennedy said that life is unfair and in a different era,</v>

146
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's not fair.</v>

147
00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:57.701
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

148
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:57.851
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

149
00:03:57.851 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 2>just trying to bang a lot of checks and you can't,</v>

150
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 2>you can't dwell on the things that you don't have.</v>

152
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

153
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could've been born better looking.</v>

154
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 2>I could have been born taller.</v>

155
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.671
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

156
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 2>you've got to make the most,</v>

157
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 2>it's like playing poker.</v>

158
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 2>You got to play it.</v>

159
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 2>You could have the worst hand and you can win the pot.</v>

160
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.091
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

161
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:13.510
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

162
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

163
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 2>obviously is it easier to win the hand if you got right?</v>

164
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.180
<v Speaker 2>If you're a bad player,</v>

165
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 2>you'll win nothing cause everybody's going to drop.</v>

166
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

167
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 2>And so even getting the best hand,</v>

168
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.060
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna,</v>

169
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna you're going to play it right.</v>

170
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.130
<v Speaker 2>But you know it's not,</v>

171
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean if two people,</v>

172
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 2>if I want to hire somebody and the way they look I believe is going to help me</v>

173
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 2>earn more money because I think that having a more attractive person in</v>

174
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:40.090
<v Speaker 2>particular business position is going to somehow lead to greater sales.</v>

175
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really the only reason that you're going to pay somebody more</v>

176
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 2>money if they look good.</v>

177
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Like look it on,</v>

178
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

179
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:47.470
<v Speaker 2>I go on Fox television or CNBC,</v>

180
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 2>it's not an accident that all these women interviewing me are pretty hot,</v>

181
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

182
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean unattractive women could read the news and ask me questions just as good</v>

183
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.194
<v Speaker 2>as they can,</v>

184
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.340
<v Speaker 2>but they're hoping and they're betting that more guys like us are going to tune</v>

185
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 2>in to watch a hot chick interview me.</v>

186
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Then a home we won and they're probably right.</v>

187
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.071
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

188
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Because probably lots of the girls that are applying for these jobs,</v>

189
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 2>they're not getting hired.</v>

190
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

191
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you 100% but there,</v>

192
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 2>there's a fascinating thing that's going on today where competition is thought</v>

193
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 2>to be and somehow some way,</v>

194
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:19.270
<v Speaker 2>shape or form a negative thing.</v>

195
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.490
<v Speaker 2>And that this kind of competition,</v>

196
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 2>whether it's even capitalism itself is criticized,</v>

197
00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

198
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of people today that are in favor of socialism and it's one</v>

199
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 2>of the reasons why Bernie Sanders was so attractive is because like,</v>

200
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

201
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 2>you people that are not winning this crazy competition out there that don't have</v>

202
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:35.824
<v Speaker 2>any desire.</v>

203
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 2>We're going to even out this playing field and those people that are out there</v>

204
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 2>kicking ass and taking names,</v>

205
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 2>we're going to take some of that money and we're going to just give it to</v>

206
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:43.504
<v Speaker 2>everybody else.</v>

207
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

208
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:47.380
<v Speaker 2>That is the appeal of socialism because it appeals to the lowest common</v>

209
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:47.891
<v Speaker 2>denominator.</v>

210
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 2>That'll just appeal to ignorance.</v>

211
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.180
<v Speaker 2>But it appeals to greed because an envy like,</v>

212
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.331
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

213
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 2>this person has so much more than me and it's not fair.</v>

214
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 2>But here's the beauty of competition because this is why we want competition.</v>

215
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 2>We all want stuff,</v>

216
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.113
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

217
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

218
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 2>and so I want people competing to sell me stuff,</v>

219
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

220
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 2>I want to have as much as I can as far as consumer goods.</v>

221
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 2>That's what we all want.</v>

222
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 2>We want products and services that enhance our lives.</v>

223
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Speaker 2>And the way we get the best products,</v>

224
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 2>wait with the highest quality that deliver the most value at the lowest price is</v>

225
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 2>to have lots of competition.</v>

226
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 2>All kinds of people competing for my business.</v>

227
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.711
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

228
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 2>I've got some money to spend.</v>

229
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

230
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.111
<v Speaker 2>buy my product,</v>

231
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 2>buy my product.</v>

232
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 2>Competition is what's made is what makes sure that I get the best thing that is</v>

233
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:36.450
<v Speaker 2>soup</v>

234
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.980
<v Speaker 1>per hard to wrap your head around.</v>

235
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

236
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.160
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the big question,</v>

237
00:06:41.161 --> 00:06:41.341
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

238
00:06:41.341 --> 00:06:42.960
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't get paid the big bucks if it were,</v>

239
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.420
<v Speaker 1>the big question is why?</v>

240
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Like why do you think this is all happening?</v>

241
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Or do you ever use that word?</v>

242
00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Why is,</v>

243
00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:51.870
<v Speaker 1>why is a weird word,</v>

244
00:06:51.871 --> 00:06:52.111
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

245
00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:52.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

246
00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Why is it weird is happening?</v>

247
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:54.730
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

248
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

249
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.790
<v Speaker 1>what's causing it to happen?</v>

250
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.610
<v Speaker 1>What are the forces that caused it to happen ever?</v>

251
00:06:59.611 --> 00:07:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Why do you ever look at it all and go,</v>

252
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.490
<v Speaker 1>is there a purpose to all this?</v>

253
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.160
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

254
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.730
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

255
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

256
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.290
<v Speaker 3>and I think the answer is no.</v>

257
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.153
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

258
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.000
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

259
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

260
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.460
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason why.</v>

261
00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:09.911
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

262
00:07:09.911 --> 00:07:12.220
<v Speaker 3>just looking up into the sky,</v>

263
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.113
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

264
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:13.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

265
00:07:13.931 --> 00:07:16.300
<v Speaker 3>unless the purpose was to make it pretty sky,</v>

266
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.691
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

267
00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:20.260
<v Speaker 3>anything that we're seeing here on earth could have been done much with much</v>

268
00:07:20.261 --> 00:07:22.570
<v Speaker 3>less effort than making 100 billion galaxies.</v>

269
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.433
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

270
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:24.363
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

271
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.060
<v Speaker 3>there's no evidence than anything that we've learned about science or the</v>

272
00:07:28.061 --> 00:07:32.050
<v Speaker 3>universe that gives us a reason to believe that there's a purpose behind it all.</v>

273
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

274
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.790
<v Speaker 3>if anything,</v>

275
00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:35.020
<v Speaker 3>as time goes on,</v>

276
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.560
<v Speaker 3>the entropy of the universe is increasing and the university becoming more</v>

277
00:07:38.561 --> 00:07:39.940
<v Speaker 3>random and disorderly.</v>

278
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.321
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

279
00:07:41.321 --> 00:07:41.951
<v Speaker 3>I think that we're,</v>

280
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:42.251
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

281
00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:47.251
<v Speaker 3>riding a wave of a universe that is growing and expanding and cooling and</v>

282
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.810
<v Speaker 3>becoming more and more disorderly.</v>

283
00:07:49.811 --> 00:07:51.520
<v Speaker 3>And that's a finite amount of time.</v>

284
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.170
<v Speaker 3>So 14 billion years from the big bang to today sounds like a lot.</v>

285
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.100
<v Speaker 3>That's 1.4 times 10 to the 10 years.</v>

286
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.690
<v Speaker 3>But the future of the universe is enormously longer than that.</v>

287
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.190
<v Speaker 3>According to our best current theories.</v>

288
00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:07.030
<v Speaker 3>It's it's way.</v>

289
00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:08.860
<v Speaker 3>It's potentially infinitely long.</v>

290
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:09.401
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

291
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:13.300
<v Speaker 3>The last star is not going to burn out until a quadrillion years from now.</v>

292
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:18.610
<v Speaker 3>We are very close to the beginning of the history of the universe and,</v>

293
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.720
<v Speaker 3>but it's not forever.</v>

294
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.730
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't last an infinite amount of time.</v>

295
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.500
<v Speaker 3>So the universe is a femoral.</v>

296
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.930
<v Speaker 3>We human beings and living creatures are temporary structures within it.</v>

297
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.020
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that it's all for some big cosmic purpose,</v>

298
00:08:32.021 --> 00:08:33.490
<v Speaker 3>it seems to hold very little water.</v>

299
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever contemplate what,</v>

300
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.120
<v Speaker 1>what function human beings have in the,</v>

301
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:41.080
<v Speaker 1>in the university,</v>

302
00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:43.360
<v Speaker 1>the way we interface with reality,</v>

303
00:08:43.361 --> 00:08:44.860
<v Speaker 1>the way we interface with our,</v>

304
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.200
<v Speaker 1>the nature around us?</v>

305
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:47.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

306
00:08:47.741 --> 00:08:48.461
<v Speaker 3>I think that a,</v>

307
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:49.241
<v Speaker 3>we don't have the function.</v>

308
00:08:49.241 --> 00:08:51.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's the right way to think about what human beings are.</v>

309
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.900
<v Speaker 3>We should be glad to be alive,</v>

310
00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:54.190
<v Speaker 3>enjoy it while we're here,</v>

311
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

312
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 3>nice to each other and try to learn more about the universe.</v>

313
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 3>But it's not if we choose not to do that,</v>

314
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 3>that's not going against any preordained function that we have.</v>

315
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:05.191
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>

316
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 3>your own remarkably calm when you discuss these things.</v>

317
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

318
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.341
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>

319
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 3>do you have any existential angst?</v>

320
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:10.861
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any,</v>

321
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:11.580
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

322
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the other way around,</v>

323
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:13.441
<v Speaker 3>and honestly,</v>

324
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:13.981
<v Speaker 3>this is very,</v>

325
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:15.360
<v Speaker 3>very small amounts of data.</v>

326
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.223
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

327
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.063
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

328
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:22.310
<v Speaker 3>from what I can tell when personal tragedies strike people who were atheistic</v>

329
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:27.660
<v Speaker 3>cosmologists and scientists deal with it way better than people who think that</v>

330
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:30.840
<v Speaker 3>we're embedded in a matrix with a bigger purpose or a spiritual reality.</v>

331
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.703
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

332
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:32.581
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

333
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 3>Cause you get that this is,</v>

334
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.890
<v Speaker 3>this happened and you to have an infinite perspective.</v>

335
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:37.580
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

336
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.341
<v Speaker 3>Like when someone dies,</v>

337
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:38.941
<v Speaker 3>it's sad.</v>

338
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:40.020
<v Speaker 3>You can be sad,</v>

339
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.030
<v Speaker 3>but you see,</v>

340
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 3>you can't say,</v>

341
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:42.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

342
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.260
<v Speaker 3>it shouldn't have happened.</v>

343
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:43.821
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

344
00:09:43.821 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

345
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:44.791
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

346
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 3>these are the kinds of things that happen.</v>

347
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:56.240
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
