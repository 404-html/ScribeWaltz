00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.860
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

4
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Comicview frys three times.</v>

5
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:13.221
<v Speaker 1>so I mean like who was hosting the first one ever was lester barry who was a</v>

7
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>black circuit comic for the very religious.</v>

8
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

9
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.050
<v Speaker 1>The second time I did it was Arnez J in Miami and the third time third time was</v>

10
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>funny because I said by this point I go,</v>

11
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing comic view ever again.</v>

12
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.073
<v Speaker 1>Like I just,</v>

13
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Speaker 1>I've written that one off,</v>

14
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing it.</v>

15
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>It's always an awkward situation when I go there too.</v>

16
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.663
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

17
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm the only white guy.</v>

18
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.360
<v Speaker 1>The production is white and they put some weird responsibility on me to be like</v>

19
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.840
<v Speaker 1>the den mother of the comics,</v>

20
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 1>so I've like smoked cigarettes and I'd go outside and smoke a cigarette.</v>

21
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:45.061
<v Speaker 1>She was okay,</v>

22
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:45.590
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

23
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.351
<v Speaker 1>Who's everyone?</v>

24
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Jay's going to smoke if you want to smoke,</v>

25
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>go out now with him and everyone's got to be back in here in 15 minutes.</v>

26
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>And then she tried to get me all of their food tickets so I'd be responsible for</v>

27
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

28
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.683
<v Speaker 1>It was very bizarre.</v>

29
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.523
<v Speaker 1>Just because you're white.</v>

30
00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

31
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean I assume so.</v>

32
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>

33
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the black comics will do things like I'm gonna go out and smoke and</v>

34
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:04.261
<v Speaker 1>then go like,</v>

35
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:04.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 1>fuck a chick for five hours trying to come back 15 minutes for the show starts</v>

37
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>like that did happen.</v>

38
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>what they want you to do is just hang out all day waiting for this show to</v>

40
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

41
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

42
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.820
<v Speaker 1>they put you there at nine in the morning until night.</v>

43
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I went on at midnight.</v>

44
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

45
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

46
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>because they just don't want this wrangle everybody because they don't believe</v>

47
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.243
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>

48
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.170
<v Speaker 1>No belief they're going to stay there.</v>

49
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>They've done entire shows about how happy they are.</v>

50
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll do a show where the same joke gets repeated by different comedians.</v>

51
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

53
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

54
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>and so I went and did it.</v>

55
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Hart ended up hosting,</v>

56
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the last ever seasons,</v>

57
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>but it was called one mic stand and or something like that I think is what it's</v>

58
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:44.461
<v Speaker 1>called,</v>

59
00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:45.294
<v Speaker 1>one mic stand.</v>

60
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't called comic view.</v>

61
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>And Kevin called me and asked me if I wanted to do it or if I would do it.</v>

62
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.421
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

63
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:51.601
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

64
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want it to comic view anymore.</v>

65
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.461
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

66
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:54.221
<v Speaker 1>it's not common for you.</v>

67
00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:54.811
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>

68
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>They're flying people out now they're doing it all right.</v>

69
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.351
<v Speaker 1>And set it up good.</v>

70
00:01:58.351 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>And it was a,</v>

71
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.851
<v Speaker 1>when I signed the contract,</v>

72
00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>gets comic view presents one Mike Stand.</v>

73
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>They gave us a big speech before we taped anything and the guy was like,</v>

74
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>we're changing comic view,</v>

75
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be different.</v>

76
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>And the guys specifically said no more stool humping and dj hit it and pulling</v>

77
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>out fake teeth.</v>

78
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.353
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

79
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean we weren't three comics in before a guy was wearing fake teeth and</v>

80
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>fucking a stool.</v>

81
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean not even about weight when he's giving this speech to it,</v>

82
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>these same guys who were getting ready to fuck stools and put in fake teeth are</v>

83
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:32.611
<v Speaker 1>doing like,</v>

84
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:32.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:33.601
<v Speaker 1>like staring at him,</v>

86
00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:35.750
<v Speaker 1>give the speech and like nodding their heads like a,</v>

87
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>like Pachino speech in any given Sunday.</v>

88
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.211
<v Speaker 1>It's a good emotional,</v>

89
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:39.991
<v Speaker 1>powerful speech.</v>

90
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 1>How we're changing comic view now.</v>

91
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>And then they went and put the and they're like,</v>

92
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

93
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 1>let's go out there and show the world something.</v>

94
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>And then two minutes later you're like,</v>

95
00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Dj put that Shit back on,</v>

96
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>you can fuck a bitch with fake teeth to this one.</v>

97
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.523
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

98
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.630
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't agree more about DMT and,</v>

99
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.261
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

100
00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>the opening that it can give.</v>

101
00:02:59.861 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

102
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>

103
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 2>I had the great advantage of taking it for the first time with Terence Mckenna.</v>

104
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.220
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

105
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.890
<v Speaker 2>do you want to check this arch or.</v>

106
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

107
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.953
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

108
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 2>and that's pretty cool in a resume,</v>

109
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

110
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 2>first time you did DMT,</v>

111
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.373
<v Speaker 2>Terence Mckenna?</v>

112
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.363
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

113
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 2>I won't say where or when,</v>

114
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 2>because it could be put down on some record somewhere that's probably already</v>

115
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:24.010
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

116
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.843
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about it.</v>

117
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.973
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

118
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.010
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

119
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.731
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

120
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 2>it correspondent in many ways with what people talk about near death experiences</v>

121
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:39.511
<v Speaker 2>because I went out through light into a realm of great bliss and beauty.</v>

122
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 2>And then I came back and it was like coming back from a million miles away and</v>

123
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 2>just coming back into my body and as it were being born again.</v>

124
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.360
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>

125
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 2>it was very much like a death and rebirth experience for me.</v>

126
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.870
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

127
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.220
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

128
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

129
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 2>it was very,</v>

130
00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 2>very transformative.</v>

131
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 2>Incidentally,</v>

132
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

133
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.193
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

134
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to understand this American phenomenon with southern Baptists</v>

135
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that I think is the key to this is that I think when they</v>

136
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 2>talk about being born again,</v>

137
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 2>originally baptism was just that.</v>

138
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean now you can get this through dmt in five minutes,</v>

139
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 2>but at the time of John The baptist,</v>

140
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 2>you get it in five minutes through being drowned.</v>

141
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 2>People were lining up on the bank of the Jordan.</v>

142
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 2>They go in,</v>

143
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 2>he holds them under.</v>

144
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 2>If he held him under just long enough,</v>

145
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 2>you could actually induce a near death experience.</v>

146
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 2>No life review at the drowning man sees his life pass before him hold the amount</v>

147
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 2>of just long enough.</v>

148
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 2>And they'd have a near death experience almost guaranteed.</v>

149
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

150
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 2>occasionally they might,</v>

151
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 2>he might have done it too long,</v>

152
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:45.630
<v Speaker 2>but that was before litigation.</v>

153
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

154
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.080
<v Speaker 2>you might have litigation.</v>

155
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

156
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Good theory actually.</v>

157
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.391
<v Speaker 2>And then you see,</v>

158
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:55.580
<v Speaker 2>they come back and they said,</v>

159
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I've died.</v>

160
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.480
<v Speaker 2>I've seen the light,</v>

161
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.010
<v Speaker 2>I'd been born again.</v>

162
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm no longer afraid of death.</v>

163
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.880
<v Speaker 2>My life has been transformed in five minutes and the baptists were the people</v>

164
00:05:05.881 --> 00:05:10.881
<v Speaker 2>who revived baptism by total immersion in the 16th century and probably know in</v>

165
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.530
<v Speaker 2>America we don't hold them under that long because this is post litigation.</v>

166
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

167
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.543
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

168
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.881
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

169
00:05:17.881 --> 00:05:19.560
<v Speaker 2>when the Baptist first got going,</v>

170
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.260
<v Speaker 2>this idea of holding people aren't long enough.</v>

171
00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:26.880
<v Speaker 2>All their language is the language that relates to near death experiences.</v>

172
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.050
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think that to start with baptism by total immersion was just</v>

173
00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:31.884
<v Speaker 2>symbolic.</v>

174
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.210
<v Speaker 2>I think it was drowning.</v>

175
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>What's needed is,</v>

176
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.030
<v Speaker 2>is transparency.</v>

177
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.970
<v Speaker 2>What's needed is up.</v>

178
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the transparency is going to be an eventuality because of the</v>

179
00:05:40.441 --> 00:05:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>

180
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:41.370
<v Speaker 2>do you think?</v>

181
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Learning?</v>

182
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

183
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.741
<v Speaker 2>I think it is right.</v>

184
00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:44.490
<v Speaker 2>I think gets blown wide open.</v>

185
00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:49.491
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to keep secrets and it also erodes faith in the leadership</v>

186
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:50.334
<v Speaker 2>when like,</v>

187
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.290
<v Speaker 2>is this a democracy?</v>

188
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.950
<v Speaker 2>Is this a representative government or is it some sort of a weird dictatorship?</v>

189
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Because if it is a hello fuck,</v>

190
00:05:58.011 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 2>are you keeping that guy locked up?</v>

191
00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

192
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 2>how is Julian assange still locked up?</v>

193
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Because I need to know.</v>

194
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Please tell me what exactly he did that you need to export him to the United</v>

195
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>

196
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.121
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

197
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 2>he released some information,</v>

198
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>which is our information to citizens.</v>

199
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 2>This is not,</v>

200
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

201
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 2>information that should be kept secret from a king.</v>

202
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.480
<v Speaker 2>It's relationship.</v>

203
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.770
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

204
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 2>it's information that someone who was being paid with taxpayer dollars.</v>

205
00:06:24.871 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 2>I did a bunch of shit that the United States doesn't agree with.</v>

206
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was upset by the information that was released.</v>

207
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was upset by that video.</v>

208
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.460
<v Speaker 2>The collateral murder video.</v>

209
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was obsessed by this massive amount of data that showed there was a lot</v>

210
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:40.071
<v Speaker 2>of coercion,</v>

211
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 2>a lot of lies,</v>

212
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:41.330
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>

213
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 2>lot of stuff that we don't agree with.</v>

214
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>

215
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 2>this guy's like public enemy number one.</v>

216
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

217
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.970
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

218
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 2>that's so anti what we think of as the United States.</v>

219
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Completely contrary to everything in the United States stands for complainant on</v>

220
00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

221
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 2>And so in answer to your question,</v>

222
00:06:56.841 --> 00:06:57.561
<v Speaker 2>I would say yes,</v>

223
00:06:57.561 --> 00:07:02.561
<v Speaker 2>it is some kind of weird dictatorship posturing and posing as a,</v>

224
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.770
<v Speaker 2>as a democracy.</v>

225
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:04.604
<v Speaker 2>Because for,</v>

226
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 2>for democracy to be real,</v>

227
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:08.840
<v Speaker 2>you have to have complete openness of information.</v>

228
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 2>People must be told the truth.</v>

229
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Then they can vote and make decisions on the basis of facts.</v>

230
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 2>What we actually have in our society is the continual,</v>

231
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 2>very clever massaging and management of information.</v>

232
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.610
<v Speaker 2>So it ceases to be democracy.</v>

233
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.391
<v Speaker 2>When the voting,</v>

234
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 2>when the voting public are fed,</v>

235
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.160
<v Speaker 2>lies on the basis of which they,</v>

236
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 2>they make their decisions and vote that that isn't democracy anymore.</v>

237
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 2>That is in a way democracies are the worst kind of dictatorship because they</v>

238
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:40.790
<v Speaker 2>have this appearance of freedom,</v>

239
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 2>have this illusion of freedom.</v>

240
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.301
<v Speaker 2>And everybody can say,</v>

241
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:44.451
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

242
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:45.650
<v Speaker 2>it's great because I live in a,</v>

243
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.610
<v Speaker 2>in a democracy,</v>

244
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:46.881
<v Speaker 2>at least.</v>

245
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:48.140
<v Speaker 2>If you live in a dictatorship,</v>

246
00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:51.380
<v Speaker 2>you know you live in a dictatorship and there are certain parameters that you</v>

247
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 2>have to work your way round.</v>

248
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.350
<v Speaker 2>But when you live in a dictatorship that is posing as a democracy,</v>

249
00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.810
<v Speaker 2>it's more complicated.</v>
