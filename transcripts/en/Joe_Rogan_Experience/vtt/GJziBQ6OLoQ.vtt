1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm on my way over here and I'm </v>

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.641
<v Speaker 1>listening to this new radio lab podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then talking about this new </v>

5
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>technology that's available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

6
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:19.191
<v Speaker 1>this is the perfect thing to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to right when I'm coming to </v>

7
00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:19.191
<v Speaker 1>hang out with Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

8
00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a website called future of fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>news.com</v>

9
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>where they show this new technology on </v>
<v Speaker 1>display.</v>

10
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Well you know how adobe does photoshop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they can.</v>

11
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.850
<v Speaker 1>They can adjust images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can take 20 to 40 minutes to.</v>

12
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>They could do it with 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They prefer to do it with 40,</v>

13
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>40 minutes of recorded audio of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

14
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Then they run it through this machine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can have you say words you've </v>

15
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>never said thinking of you make sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've never made in those.</v>

16
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>In those little sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so like you could have a sentence</v>

17
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

18
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can have a sentence that says </v>

19
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.430
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey joe,</v>

20
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>you want to get something to eat after </v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast and they can intersect.</v>

21
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Hey Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a bunch of transgender hookers and</v>

22
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:03.501
<v Speaker 1>some heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to get something to eat and go </v>

23
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>hang out with them after the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would sound exactly like what you</v>

24
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:10.671
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks sound exactly like your own </v>

25
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:10.671
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure there's going to be experts</v>

26
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>that can analyze it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

27
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.080
<v Speaker 1>this is a fraud for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they're essentially saying is this </v>

28
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.080
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.941
<v Speaker 1>the infancy of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to get like experts to analyze </v>

30
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:20.941
<v Speaker 1>the audio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see it right there.</v>

31
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:25.060
<v Speaker 1>They'd synthesized Barack Obama's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>audio and they have them say things that</v>

32
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>he never said the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have him and George Bush going back</v>

33
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>and forth telling jokes to each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they never told.</v>

34
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

35
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>can we hear this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

36
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.160
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

37
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>So now can we think you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>find that.</v>

38
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find that.</v>

39
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>It might be on their website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't sound good when they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

41
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's in its infancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds like them talking,</v>

42
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds a little edited,</v>

43
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not flowing together.</v>

44
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:55.491
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But apparently they're able to break </v>

45
00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:57.681
<v Speaker 1>down faces to the point where say there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying that like if Jennifer </v>

46
00:01:57.681 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Aniston goes to China and she does a </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial for something,</v>

47
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>what they can do is have Jennifer </v>
<v Speaker 1>Aniston talk for a period of time and </v>

48
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.341
<v Speaker 1>they figured out how her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her voice moves and they take all these </v>

49
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:13.701
<v Speaker 1>images of her face and they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate it so accurately they can </v>

50
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>have someone speaking mandarin Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>where all the different,</v>

51
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:20.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different sounds they make and they </v>

52
00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:21.921
<v Speaker 1>could sync up her lips and her movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the movement of her face to what it </v>

53
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>would look like if she was making those </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual sounds,</v>

54
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 1>which is just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they can have a voice like a </v>

55
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.421
<v Speaker 1>mandarin speaking woman who could speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Chinese and you would see the exact </v>

56
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>correct movements from Jennifer </v>
<v Speaker 1>Aniston's mouth.</v>

57
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.070
<v Speaker 1>So it wouldn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how you watch like a movie </v>

58
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.070
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.000
<v Speaker 1>But let's hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's hear it.</v>

60
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Our parties have moved further and </v>
<v Speaker 2>further apart and it's harder and harder</v>

61
00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:55.111
<v Speaker 2>to find common ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I said in 2004 that there were </v>

62
00:02:56.021 --> 00:02:59.080
<v Speaker 2>no red states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue states through the United States of</v>

63
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 2>America was</v>

64
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.040
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could tell by the lips in that </v>

65
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.040
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Have you looked at his lips?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked fun,</v>

67
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>but that's just now like what's it going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like in a year?</v>

68
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>What's it going to be like in five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

69
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.660
<v Speaker 1>And this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what they're saying is that </v>

70
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.360
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at now is the future of </v>

71
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.561
<v Speaker 1>fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be able to recreate </v>

72
00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>people saying things that they never </v>
<v Speaker 1>said and it's going to be impossible for</v>

73
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:29.281
<v Speaker 1>you to tell the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how can that be used for the </v>

74
00:03:29.281 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Illuminati?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could it be used for anybody?</v>

75
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can see the problem is that good</v>

76
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>enough DC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh now we can do this.</v>

77
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

78
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:42.001
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say what would be good </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you never know what the end </v>

79
00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:42.001
<v Speaker 1>result of anything is going to be.</v>

80
00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:46.200
<v Speaker 1>When someone creates some sort of a mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>bending world changing technology like </v>

81
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:51.271
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only could be for bad because it's a </v>

82
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:51.271
<v Speaker 1>lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be alive.</v>

83
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it comes out of their mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a lie so that there's </v>

84
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>no way that could be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

85
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>but see what it is is the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>of technologists pushing boundaries.</v>

86
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.070
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their intention is not initially to do </v>

87
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.481
<v Speaker 1>something bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the interesting things </v>

88
00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:09.481
<v Speaker 1>about the radio lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably funny.</v>

89
00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Hold on because the radio lab podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to the technologists and they </v>

90
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.861
<v Speaker 1>confronted her with it and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable to watch this lady be </v>

91
00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>confronted with the idea like what if </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is used for evil?</v>

92
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Like what if it's used for fake news and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell that they don't.</v>

93
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>They're not even thinking about that.</v>

94
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Hardly all they're trying to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to do something that </v>

95
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.891
<v Speaker 1>nobody else can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when someone comes up with the </v>

96
00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:34.441
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can come up with some sort of a </v>

97
00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>voice manipulating technology like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a visual manipulating technology,</v>

98
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.320
<v Speaker 1>you've got to realize there's a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people that are probably closing </v>

99
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.371
<v Speaker 1>in on something like that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it becomes this mad race to get </v>

100
00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>something done and to make a shit ton of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

101
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 1>If you have something like that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be potentially worth who knows </v>

102
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.240
<v Speaker 1>ungodly sums of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to figure out a way you </v>

103
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.781
<v Speaker 1>could use that for good to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that they were saying is </v>

104
00:04:57.781 --> 00:05:01.920
<v Speaker 1>you could take recordings of Einstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's hours and hours and hours and </v>

105
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.660
<v Speaker 1>hours of recordings of Einstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could create a visual Einstein and </v>

106
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.891
<v Speaker 1>you could have a three d technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps or virtual reality technology </v>

107
00:05:10.891 --> 00:05:14.761
<v Speaker 1>where you're hanging out having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking conversation with Einstein and </v>

108
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 1>now step one.</v>

109
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step two is some sort of a neural </v>

110
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.191
<v Speaker 1>interface with virtual reality where </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of just looking at it through </v>

111
00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:29.731
<v Speaker 1>goggles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going into your mind in some sort </v>

112
00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:33.601
<v Speaker 1>of a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interfacing with the very neurons </v>

113
00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:33.601
<v Speaker 1>and the very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your visual cortex.</v>

114
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.410
<v Speaker 1>It's showing you images that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.520
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't really be seeing for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be great for brainwashing </v>

116
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.520
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

117
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

118
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>That's a no brainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

119
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Because we're brainwashed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they like fake news.</v>

120
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Just like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is perfect.</v>

121
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 1>No one gets out alive with this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the thing.</v>

122
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.220
<v Speaker 1>There's one thing that might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating about it is there's gonna be</v>

123
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:59.221
<v Speaker 1>no control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everyone's going to be able to </v>

124
00:05:59.221 --> 00:06:02.561
<v Speaker 1>eventually use something like this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they said that it would require like </v>

125
00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:05.620
<v Speaker 1>painstaking step by step a person going </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the data to see if they could </v>

126
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>figure out what was manipulated and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think they could find like 75 percent of</v>

127
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 1>the ones that have been manipulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now find the fake ones.</v>

128
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is the amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it takes to do that is astounding.</v>

129
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an.</v>

130
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 1>It's people to people time like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

131
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 1>You have to be sitting there like going </v>
<v Speaker 1>over it,</v>

132
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>looking at what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check that out,</v>

133
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 1>go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's this number right here?</v>

134
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Why is this off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>

135
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:33.881
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark that move on and they have to like </v>

136
00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:33.881
<v Speaker 1>do this over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll lifts her anomalies.</v>

137
00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:38.411
<v Speaker 1>Look for some sort of evidence that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been manipulated by a digital source or </v>

138
00:06:38.411 --> 00:06:43.001
<v Speaker 1>by some sort of a digital control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a phone or a computer or something like </v>

139
00:06:43.001 --> 00:06:47.141
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it'll be easy to tell from the </v>

140
00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:47.141
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

141
00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:47.740
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How good are photoshops?</v>

142
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Like the Photoshop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve,</v>

143
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 1>how good are some of his photoshops and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this dude is just having fun.</v>

144
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about that?</v>

145
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>Photoshop of A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Neil Armstrong where he's </v>

146
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.150
<v Speaker 1>standing on the moon and if like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shot,</v>

147
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.720
<v Speaker 1>there's a shot of him looking down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a selfie and then there's the </v>

148
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.340
<v Speaker 1>earth in the background and they proved </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a photo,</v>

149
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:12.370
<v Speaker 1>a photo shop already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they could just run it through </v>

150
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.370
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just basic shit.</v>

151
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.561
<v Speaker 1>And you could see that it was cut in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there was definitely some </v>

152
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:15.730
<v Speaker 1>manipulation of photos for press use </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

153
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Not just that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was 1969.</v>

154
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did it before that even they did it</v>

155
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 1>with the Gemini Space Program when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>did a defending that picture.</v>

156
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:24.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

157
00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

158
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Nobody defends that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

159
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they do or don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the craziest one is Michael Collins </v>

160
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:31.780
<v Speaker 1>because Michael Collins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can prove it.</v>

161
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.370
<v Speaker 1>The Gemini 15 picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took a test photo of him like in </v>

162
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.720
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a warehouse where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would strap him up with a harness and </v>

163
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.500
<v Speaker 1>they're showing them how to utilize this</v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment and then they blocked all that</v>

164
00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 1>shit out and reverse the image and try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pretend he was doing a spacewalk.</v>

165
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

166
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.720
<v Speaker 1>and maybe maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've seen so much on the moon.</v>

167
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.330
<v Speaker 1>This one's the best one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Even the moon.</v>

168
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just Michael Collins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you should see it because it's like,</v>

169
00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck would they do that?</v>

170
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Like they took a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a 100 percent.</v>

171
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:07.330
<v Speaker 1>This is not speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took a photo of him at a test </v>

172
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 1>facility where they would prepare </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves for walking on the moon.</v>

173
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.160
<v Speaker 1>The one on the left is then preparing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

174
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:18.340
<v Speaker 1>you could tell he's in a harness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of equipment around and </v>

175
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 1>he's hanging onto this thing and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling them like with this harness that</v>

176
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:25.751
<v Speaker 1>he's attached to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next one it says it's a </v>

177
00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:26.720
<v Speaker 1>spacewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same exact image.</v>

178
00:08:26.721 --> 00:08:30.620
<v Speaker 1>They just blacked it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just took all the stuff that was in</v>

179
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:35.621
<v Speaker 1>the background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the equipment and all the bullshit </v>

180
00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:35.720
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a blurry copy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See you can find a better copy of it.</v>

181
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.870
<v Speaker 1>But what they did was they made a fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>photo of a guy in space that photo's not</v>

182
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:46.001
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a photo of him in the test suit </v>

183
00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 1>and they just reversed it and blacked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the background.</v>

184
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.610
<v Speaker 1>They could get away with stuff like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then,</v>

185
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:50.780
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

186
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.780
<v Speaker 1>that's a better picture of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you got to get a,</v>

187
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.110
<v Speaker 1>that's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

188
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

189
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 3>just what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they did was take all that shit.</v>

190
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 3>What they did was unquestionably </v>
<v Speaker 3>deceptive.</v>

191
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 3>So the question is how much of that did </v>
<v Speaker 3>they do?</v>

192
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

193
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the question.</v>

194
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.680
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's even hard for the most hardcore of </v>

195
00:09:10.551 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 3>skeptics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even the most hardcore skeptics.</v>

196
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

197
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the fence about that moon thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

198
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's really.</v>

199
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.990
<v Speaker 3>No one's really saying yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went to the moon.</v>

200
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 3>Now even like Mick Westville shut up </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>

201
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's Niki.</v>

202
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:27.690
<v Speaker 3>We'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you're right at all.</v>

203
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:29.420
<v Speaker 3>I think he would definitely argue that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we went to the moon.</v>

204
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's getting paid for that.</v>

205
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:33.720
<v Speaker 3>So they come in and he's got to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the dude,</v>

206
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.300
<v Speaker 3>the dude backs up every official story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

207
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:41.301
<v Speaker 3>but people do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily because they're getting </v>

208
00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:43.671
<v Speaker 3>paid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do it because that's the mindset </v>

209
00:09:43.671 --> 00:09:43.671
<v Speaker 3>they're in.</v>

210
00:09:43.671 --> 00:09:46.100
<v Speaker 3>They're in this mindset like we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about someone else before the </v>

211
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.100
<v Speaker 3>podcast website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He makes money on his website.</v>

212
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm talking very little </v>
<v Speaker 3>money to be made of bumping things.</v>

213
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:53.970
<v Speaker 3>That's not the motivation for doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're a multimillionaire from </v>

214
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:53.970
<v Speaker 3>video games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

215
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.910
<v Speaker 3>he made a shit ton of money from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from selling video games.</v>

216
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:02.210
<v Speaker 3>He was like a some sort of a programmer </v>
<v Speaker 3>in video games and then he has a good </v>

217
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:07.101
<v Speaker 3>time debunking things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he has an official story </v>

218
00:10:07.101 --> 00:10:07.101
<v Speaker 3>mentalities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I would call it,</v>

219
00:10:07.101 --> 00:10:11.720
<v Speaker 3>where no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's people that are objective </v>

220
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.380
<v Speaker 3>and there's people that are debunkers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's a debunker and it doesn't </v>

221
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 3>necessarily mean he's wrong about a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of stuff,</v>

222
00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:21.921
<v Speaker 3>but it does mean that he goes into </v>
<v Speaker 3>things with the intention to debunk and </v>

223
00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:24.820
<v Speaker 3>the intention to almost always gravitate</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards an official stores.</v>

224
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 3>Every single t he blended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He believes Harvey Oswald acted alone.</v>

225
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a goof.</v>

226
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

227
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.400
<v Speaker 3>That one's goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He believes tower seven collapsed at </v>

228
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:37.950
<v Speaker 3>free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fall speed because the fires.</v>

229
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.810
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

230
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.700
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately I'm not a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>engineer.</v>

231
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:46.701
<v Speaker 3>I would like to know whether or not it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible to burn a building so bad </v>

232
00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:47.910
<v Speaker 3>inside that it does collapse like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>

233
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of it.</v>

234
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.190
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is talk to engineers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and architects.</v>

235
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:54.230
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could.</v>

236
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.960
<v Speaker 3>You could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could hear them.</v>

237
00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.440
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no architects that it outside of</v>

238
00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:06.441
<v Speaker 3>Nist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a government agents and there's no </v>

239
00:11:06.441 --> 00:11:06.441
<v Speaker 3>architects fighting for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

240
00:11:06.441 --> 00:11:11.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to debunk the tower seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's none in every account.</v>

241
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:14.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know that,</v>

242
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:19.590
<v Speaker 3>but there's got to be some architects </v>
<v Speaker 3>and engineers that don't think that that</v>

243
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.420
<v Speaker 3>building fell because it was demolished.</v>

244
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.140
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

245
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.970
<v Speaker 3>if you understand how it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's about 100,000</v>

246
00:11:26.971 --> 00:11:31.971
<v Speaker 3>architects and engineers and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>associations like the American </v>

247
00:11:31.971 --> 00:11:36.350
<v Speaker 3>Association of Architects in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's about a hundred thousand and </v>

248
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.520
<v Speaker 3>Richard Gauge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's one of them and he didn't know </v>

249
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:40.520
<v Speaker 3>anything about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought it was a,</v>

250
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:45.411
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't an inside job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took him years and then he didn't </v>

251
00:11:45.411 --> 00:11:48.621
<v Speaker 3>really know about tower seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of them don't know about power </v>

252
00:11:48.621 --> 00:11:48.621
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he does now,</v>

253
00:11:48.621 --> 00:11:53.090
<v Speaker 3>he discovered it and what he does now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll just go from convention to </v>

254
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 3>convention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting 15 architects down at a time and</v>

255
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:58.000
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 99 percent of them.</v>

256
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:03.330
<v Speaker 3>They all believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't even know there was a third </v>

257
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:03.330
<v Speaker 3>tower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was not in the media that much.</v>

258
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 3>They basically ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

259
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:08.500
<v Speaker 3>I think by this time everybody knows </v>
<v Speaker 3>about tower so they still don't know.</v>

260
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.380
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't.</v>

261
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.610
<v Speaker 3>You don't run on a mainstream media.</v>

262
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:17.730
<v Speaker 3>How could anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have talked about it enough </v>

263
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 3>online to the point now more than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still my now more than ever,</v>

264
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:23.881
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go to hear about that tower seven </v>

265
00:12:23.881 --> 00:12:23.881
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't really know the details.</v>

266
00:12:23.881 --> 00:12:23.881
<v Speaker 3>They just kind of just know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

267
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Speaker 3>You ever see the video that shows the </v>
<v Speaker 3>full collapse,</v>

268
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.500
<v Speaker 3>which takes a lot longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She the first collapsed.</v>

269
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:34.770
<v Speaker 3>It was the top of the thing falls into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the center and that's the elevations </v>

270
00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.300
<v Speaker 3>they explain architects and engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've sat with them.</v>

271
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:42.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm a structural engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you tell them this is what if </v>

272
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.381
<v Speaker 3>someone told you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone told you there's 85 columns </v>

273
00:12:46.381 --> 00:12:50.551
<v Speaker 3>that hold up tower shoving and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone told you about structional </v>

274
00:12:50.551 --> 00:12:50.740
<v Speaker 3>engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>told you,</v>

275
00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:52.960
<v Speaker 3>would you think he was crazy or would </v>
<v Speaker 3>you believe him?</v>

276
00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:55.180
<v Speaker 3>If he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it makes sense.</v>

277
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:56.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's common sense.</v>

278
00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.370
<v Speaker 3>The only way you're going to get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>building to come down like that,</v>

279
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.840
<v Speaker 3>any building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any structure,</v>

280
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.290
<v Speaker 3>is you have to blow up all 80 comps the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>

281
00:13:05.291 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise they won't go down like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

282
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.900
<v Speaker 3>that's common sense to someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>believes that government agencies have </v>

283
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:12.900
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

284
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.640
<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One column went and then it spiraled out</v>

285
00:13:15.641 --> 00:13:19.090
<v Speaker 3>of control because of fires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you talk to structural engineers,</v>

286
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:24.270
<v Speaker 3>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had Richard Gauge on my podcast </v>

287
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:24.270
<v Speaker 3>wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time it comes back,</v>

288
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.590
<v Speaker 3>he gets more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just piles on more because all I </v>

289
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:28.590
<v Speaker 3>gotta do is sit them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>

290
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:29.440
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the truth.</v>

291
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.790
<v Speaker 3>CSE ever debated someone who's like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposing viewpoint,</v>

292
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.510
<v Speaker 3>but it will debate on structural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know nobody's backing up.</v>

293
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.320
<v Speaker 3>This is what he's teaching them would </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

294
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.660
<v Speaker 3>because when they look into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's common sense.</v>

295
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.760
<v Speaker 3>Anybody knows you got to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you think that they know that it's </v>

296
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.771
<v Speaker 3>not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think they think that power tower </v>

297
00:13:49.771 --> 00:13:49.771
<v Speaker 3>seven was an inside job and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to debate it because they can't.</v>

298
00:13:49.771 --> 00:13:52.060
<v Speaker 3>When you really think they think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say that again,</v>

299
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.860
<v Speaker 3>so you think that people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>debunking it,</v>

300
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.140
<v Speaker 3>so like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's got this opinion,</v>

301
00:13:56.141 --> 00:14:00.130
<v Speaker 3>there's no architects and engineers </v>
<v Speaker 3>debunk it had already looked into that.</v>

302
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.620
<v Speaker 3>That's already been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's already been done.</v>

303
00:14:02.621 --> 00:14:06.670
<v Speaker 3>And set texts and engineers just </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree.</v>

304
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think there's any people to </v>

305
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:12.720
<v Speaker 3>find the video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find a video of a real.</v>

306
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's got a government agency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

307
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.900
<v Speaker 3>see if you can that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but doesn't that make sense?</v>

308
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:20.620
<v Speaker 3>What is sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an engineer told you,</v>

309
00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:23.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>struck a dude who build skyscrapers told</v>

310
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:25.210
<v Speaker 3>you to your face?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've been told to my face.</v>

311
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:30.420
<v Speaker 3>They said the only way that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you see it on video engineer after </v>

312
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:30.420
<v Speaker 3>engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after engineer.</v>

313
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.140
<v Speaker 3>Are they all crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The engineer,</v>

314
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.230
<v Speaker 3>engineer after Ingenico?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible when you look into it,</v>

315
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible for a building to </v>
<v Speaker 3>collapse like that unless all 80 columns</v>

316
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.700
<v Speaker 3>are blown up at the same time we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've covered this,</v>

317
00:14:42.701 --> 00:14:43.550
<v Speaker 3>but here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's common.</v>

318
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:48.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything about engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you have diesel fires to</v>

319
00:14:48.651 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 3>get out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it weakens the entire.</v>

320
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 3>Where it just collapses</v>

321
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.670
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you have,</v>

322
00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.940
<v Speaker 1>you have guests all the time that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>experts in fields that you're not </v>

323
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.311
<v Speaker 1>experts in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you sit here just find out </v>

324
00:15:03.311 --> 00:15:03.311
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>

325
00:15:03.311 --> 00:15:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they would ramble about some </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and then they find out that </v>

326
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.090
<v Speaker 1>they're making some of it up or this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it does happen,</v>

327
00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.670
<v Speaker 1>but as an engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who builds,</v>

328
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.010
<v Speaker 1>understand this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it make sense?</v>

329
00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

330
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like try to figure out like who resists </v>

331
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.320
<v Speaker 1>architects and engineers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it written down?</v>

332
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading right now an article from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Boston Globe that talks about truth </v>

333
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.940
<v Speaker 1>is nine slash 11 and Richard Gauges </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about and I think they they're </v>

334
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.630
<v Speaker 1>going to hold on that might have </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewed him in and I'm trying to </v>

335
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:34.630
<v Speaker 1>figure out what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're talking about.</v>

336
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.960
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be some artists that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a conversation or a debate with </v>

337
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:42.980
<v Speaker 1>someone who believes in you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly have fallen any other way.</v>

338
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

339
00:15:45.801 --> 00:15:50.801
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit like I don't know how my fucking </v>

340
00:15:50.801 --> 00:15:50.801
<v Speaker 1>computer works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

341
00:15:50.801 --> 00:15:50.801
<v Speaker 1>How do you know anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructs.</v>

342
00:15:50.801 --> 00:15:52.140
<v Speaker 1>How do you know anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Shit,</v>

343
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.660
<v Speaker 1>you know a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know,</v>

344
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.650
<v Speaker 1>but if somebody wanted to argue with me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the components and how they worked</v>

345
00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.870
<v Speaker 1>on a laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to let go.</v>

346
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably right after to talk to </v>

347
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.240
<v Speaker 1>some computer engineer who's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me the actual reality of it.</v>

348
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Build buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a mom I'm sure,</v>

349
00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:13.241
<v Speaker 1>but I just can't believe that the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that build buildings think it's an </v>

350
00:16:13.241 --> 00:16:13.250
<v Speaker 1>inside job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

351
00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if we said,</v>

352
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:20.140
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have been pretty impressive if 90 </v>

353
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:20.140
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty impressive.</v>

354
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.550
<v Speaker 1>It was a 50 percent would be impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

355
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Fifty percent would be impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about in the nineties.</v>

356
00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know where you getting that </v>

357
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:30.190
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting it from Richard Gage,</v>

358
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.500
<v Speaker 1>who's the head of architects and </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers was not 11 truth.</v>

359
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.640
<v Speaker 1>They add another couple of understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>but know.</v>

360
00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.290
<v Speaker 1>But he might be a little biased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

361
00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:44.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's the head of architects and </v>

362
00:16:44.291 --> 00:16:45.791
<v Speaker 1>engineers from nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 truth and he tells you that 90 </v>

363
00:16:45.791 --> 00:16:46.100
<v Speaker 1>percent of the architects and engineers </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there think it's an inside job,</v>

364
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:51.430
<v Speaker 1>it might be a little biased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true and I don't </v>

365
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.430
<v Speaker 1>think you do necessarily either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're.</v>

366
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.520
<v Speaker 1>We're just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it.</v>

367
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see an architect or an </v>

368
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.081
<v Speaker 1>engineer that disagreed with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to him about it and go over the </v>

369
00:17:02.081 --> 00:17:05.171
<v Speaker 1>data because until that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck they're </v>

370
00:17:05.171 --> 00:17:05.171
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

371
00:17:05.171 --> 00:17:05.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody argues with them.</v>

372
00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Nobody does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be.</v>

373
00:17:07.911 --> 00:17:09.860
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be someone who debunks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy.</v>

374
00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:14.861
<v Speaker 1>Everybody debunks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody know they definitely a smear </v>

375
00:17:14.861 --> 00:17:14.861
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding?</v>

376
00:17:14.861 --> 00:17:16.220
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't a smear campaign or is it just</v>

377
00:17:16.221 --> 00:17:18.890
<v Speaker 1>that they're saying things that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that aren't correct?</v>

378
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Not just him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just.</v>

379
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.480
<v Speaker 1>I understand it's common sense date </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

380
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just bright,</v>

381
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:30.100
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about making </v>

382
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.771
<v Speaker 1>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about what it </v>

383
00:17:32.771 --> 00:17:32.771
<v Speaker 1>takes for a building to collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

384
00:17:32.771 --> 00:17:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either.</v>

385
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it got hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe not just hot,</v>

386
00:17:37.341 --> 00:17:42.341
<v Speaker 1>it's diesel tanks were in the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to believe that.</v>

387
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.440
<v Speaker 1>I want to believe that it fires made it </v>
<v Speaker 1>hot and I don't want to believe they </v>

388
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.700
<v Speaker 1>blew it up because that's fucking scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

389
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 1>want to believe the fire.</v>

390
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:55.130
<v Speaker 3>If a fire is in a basement and the fire </v>
<v Speaker 3>has diesel fuel and it's burning it,</v>

391
00:17:55.151 --> 00:17:57.610
<v Speaker 3>some insane temperature in this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

392
00:17:57.611 --> 00:18:01.230
<v Speaker 3>Loads of diesel fuel down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what effect that has.</v>

393
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you?</v>

394
00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:03.390
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

395
00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure based on my life's </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

396
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:11.690
<v Speaker 3>that that's not going to bring down a </v>
<v Speaker 3>building fuel life experience based on </v>

397
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.680
<v Speaker 3>common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's common sense that,</v>

398
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.860
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for building the building's going to </v>

399
00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:18.860
<v Speaker 3>fall at free fall speed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

400
00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.641
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a engineer after engineer after </v>

401
00:18:22.641 --> 00:18:24.900
<v Speaker 3>engineer at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to believe them at some point.</v>

402
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>

403
00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you'd necessarily looked</v>
<v Speaker 3>into engineers at disagree.</v>

404
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.110
<v Speaker 3>I know there's a smear campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're okay,</v>

405
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.580
<v Speaker 3>but have you looked into the engineers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's none.</v>

406
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.890
<v Speaker 3>There's none,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no doubt.</v>

407
00:18:36.891 --> 00:18:40.320
<v Speaker 3>There's no documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no documentary mentoring.</v>

408
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.240
<v Speaker 3>Find a documentary if they have to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>a documentary for it to make sense.</v>

409
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:46.800
<v Speaker 3>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if it's an article?</v>

410
00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:49.170
<v Speaker 3>What if it's a peer reviewed paper?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if it's some sort of.</v>

411
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:50.360
<v Speaker 3>Those are all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

412
00:18:50.361 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 3>that's a smear campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's that side.</v>

413
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:54.420
<v Speaker 3>There's the elite that don't want this </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

414
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.550
<v Speaker 3>And then there's people trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth out.</v>

415
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.590
<v Speaker 3>So the elite have the control of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>media.</v>

416
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.750
<v Speaker 3>So how are you going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have paid shills or you don't think</v>

417
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.780
<v Speaker 3>you think that they dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would have dropped the ball big </v>

418
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.271
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like earnest byner in 1987 for the </v>

419
00:19:11.271 --> 00:19:11.271
<v Speaker 3>browns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would have dropped the ball if you're</v>

420
00:19:11.271 --> 00:19:13.890
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have paid shills online.</v>

421
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.480
<v Speaker 3>Strategically pushing the agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

422
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were we about to pull up?</v>

423
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.630
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of fake shit on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

424
00:19:21.631 --> 00:19:21.990
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

425
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.750
<v Speaker 4>As I was stuck on this Richard Gauge </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that I was trying to debunk,</v>

426
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.360
<v Speaker 4>see if anybody's debunking him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

427
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:28.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at.</v>

428
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.090
<v Speaker 3>He's just a character.</v>

429
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just looking around.</v>

430
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
<v Speaker 4>The Boston Globe article says that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a small vocal subset of people </v>

431
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.580
<v Speaker 4>of engineers that are with this Richard </v>
<v Speaker 4>Gauge Guide read.</v>

432
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:46.070
<v Speaker 3>I've never read that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like some overwhelming number.</v>

433
00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.020
<v Speaker 3>Just keep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep stirring.</v>

434
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.780
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard because it's fun.</v>

435
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.720
<v Speaker 3>It's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's exciting to think that there's some</v>

436
00:19:53.721 --> 00:19:58.721
<v Speaker 3>sort of a gigantic ball of super </v>
<v Speaker 3>geniuses that run the world and they </v>

437
00:19:58.721 --> 00:19:59.810
<v Speaker 3>decided to blow up tower seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's funny about the moon?</v>

438
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:01.760
<v Speaker 3>Fucked ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

439
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.220
<v Speaker 3>Talk about the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

440
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.240
<v Speaker 3>what's crazy about the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the hardest shit ever </v>

441
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.650
<v Speaker 3>accomplished?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The greatest by the human race.</v>

442
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.830
<v Speaker 3>The greatest accomplishment was landing </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the moon.</v>

443
00:20:15.831 --> 00:20:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

444
00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.220
<v Speaker 3>So you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit balls.</v>

445
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen.</v>

446
00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:21.980
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

447
00:20:21.981 --> 00:20:26.240
<v Speaker 3>But let's just at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the time the Internet is the biggest.</v>

448
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:26.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

449
00:20:26.991 --> 00:20:28.760
<v Speaker 3>But I'm just talking about like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical achievement.</v>

450
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:34.210
<v Speaker 3>Three dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got shot up in a rocket that were </v>

451
00:20:34.551 --> 00:20:37.720
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a orbiter and then the orbiter shot</v>

452
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.080
<v Speaker 3>out the lunar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the lamb,</v>

453
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.200
<v Speaker 3>and then it lands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They played golf,</v>

454
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:45.110
<v Speaker 3>Went Dune bug riding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did donuts in the sand.</v>

455
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 3>They get take pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get back</v>

456
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.980
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take off dock with that orbiter and then</v>

457
00:20:53.831 --> 00:20:56.650
<v Speaker 5>fly back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the hardest she'd ever.</v>

458
00:20:56.651 --> 00:20:59.140
<v Speaker 5>No one died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine?</v>

459
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:04.170
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine that second mission,</v>
<v Speaker 5>six months later they did it again when </v>

460
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:08.820
<v Speaker 5>when they had to break the news that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were going to use different </v>

461
00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.790
<v Speaker 5>astronauts because every mission they </v>
<v Speaker 5>use different astronauts.</v>

462
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:14.850
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't you think they would like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>show like have the same star over and </v>

463
00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.240

464
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.490
<v Speaker 5>Keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do know.</v>

465
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.910
<v Speaker 5>You're kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did it before.</v>

466
00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they don't want to keep doing it.</v>

467
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.300
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck you want me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if.</v>

468
00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.740
<v Speaker 5>What if I got it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank God.</v>

469
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.430

<v Speaker 5>Aldrin and Neil Armstrong,</v>

470
00:21:27.431 --> 00:21:32.431
<v Speaker 5>but they just fucking got an ego shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They started going to clubs and like </v>

471
00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:38.690
<v Speaker 5>they want to renegotiate their contract </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they probably went to the moon </v>

<v Speaker 5>cocky and wanted to renegotiate.</v>

486
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.270
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They made $8 per diem.</v>

488
00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.580
<v Speaker 5>When Uncle Sam folks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you raw dog,</v>

<v Speaker 5>he uses sand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uncle Sam uses broken class on his dick.</v>

490
00:22:22.991 --> 00:22:27.991
<v Speaker 5>When you guys went to the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why wouldn't you think there was enough?</v>

491
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.440
<v Speaker 5>That dude in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the dude in the middle,</v>

492
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:33.400
<v Speaker 5>in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't actually,</v>

493
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:38.630
<v Speaker 5>was hovering in an orbiter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was hovering in an orbiter and they </v>

494
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:43.291
<v Speaker 5>landed some little piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A Lunar Lander would have the land and </v>

495
00:22:43.481 --> 00:22:46.240
<v Speaker 5>then they took and they show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only time I ever,</v>

496
00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:51.241
<v Speaker 5>they got one shot of it taken off and </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever was filming it followed it all </v>

497
00:22:51.241 --> 00:22:55.010
<v Speaker 5>the way up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but who was the official story?</v>

498
00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:01.890
<v Speaker 5>There was a live remote controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they said that they could </v>

499
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:03.010
<v Speaker 5>control from for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>From Houston,</v>

500
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.400
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That works,</v>

501
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:11.040
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't get my phone to work on the </v>

502
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.580
<v Speaker 5>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Landings are so God damn ridiculous.</v>

503
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.700
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's video of them like just maybe a </v>

504
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.800
<v Speaker 5>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>feet in the air and they like filming </v>

505
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:22.800
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>making it look,</v>

506
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:22.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are many emulating.</v>

507
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.330
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That video stream.</v>

508
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:30.360
<v Speaker 5>That's a damning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The explaining what they were doing.</v>

509
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.660
<v Speaker 5>Well the video says that they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're at 30,000</v>

510
00:23:34.661 --> 00:23:36.760
<v Speaker 5>miles out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they're saying.</v>

511
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.250
<v Speaker 5>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Halfway to the moon,</v>

512
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:44.480
<v Speaker 5>that would like a 125,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>miles away from Earth.</v>

513
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.890
<v Speaker 5>So halfway halfway to and make it look </v>
<v Speaker 5>like never far away.</v>

514
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:51.260
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they look out their window,</v>

515
00:23:51.261 --> 00:23:54.130
<v Speaker 5>that little circle or whatever shape,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it was a rectangle,</v>

516
00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:59.140
<v Speaker 5>whatever the window it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the entire earth fills up all the glass </v>

517
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you're like still.</v>

518
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Well it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to remember they blocked out all</v>

519
00:24:04.801 --> 00:24:06.980
<v Speaker 1>the other windows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what was in damning about it.</v>

520
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.200
<v Speaker 1>What's damning about it is that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got this camera setup where they're </v>

521
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.921
<v Speaker 1>filming the blackness of the interior of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cabin and the circular window and </v>

522
00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:17.370
<v Speaker 1>it's circular windows supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent earth.</v>

523
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:22.400
<v Speaker 1>This little slice of earth with clouds </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it and shit and the blend that kind </v>

524
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.370
<v Speaker 1>of stands still trying to create the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's real.</v>

525
00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:24.990
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at that a hundred times.</v>

526
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:30.050
<v Speaker 1>It might've just been lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly what I think more than </v>

527
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:32.070
<v Speaker 1>anything more more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like,</v>

528
00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fake.</v>

529
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.320
<v Speaker 1>And now that the watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you could see.</v>

530
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.050
<v Speaker 1>You can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh this is just you gotta.</v>

531
00:24:40.051 --> 00:24:42.750
<v Speaker 1>You gotta go to the one where it shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual fake footage.</v>

532
00:24:42.751 --> 00:24:46.950
<v Speaker 1>This is the actual video is not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show the full thing where they pull away</v>

533
00:24:46.951 --> 00:24:51.951
<v Speaker 1>and you see the guys manipulated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dampers and pulling the things off the </v>

534
00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:55.311
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new reveals what it reveals that </v>

535
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:55.311
<v Speaker 1>they're in low earth orbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not really</v>

536
00:24:55.311 --> 00:25:00.210
<v Speaker 5>just looking at Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the little hole and they're </v>

537
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.240
<v Speaker 5>focusing on a little island.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Google Bart Sabril</v>

538
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.710
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had A.</v>

539
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.440
<v Speaker 1>I had dinner with this gentleman back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>

540
00:25:04.441 --> 00:25:09.441
<v Speaker 1>He's very nice guy and he's the guy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote a funny thing happened on the way </v>

541
00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:12.571
<v Speaker 1>to the moon and he's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced that they never went to the </v>

542
00:25:12.571 --> 00:25:13.750
<v Speaker 1>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a not a dumb guy.</v>

543
00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I had an interesting conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

544
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.850
<v Speaker 1>He's fully onboard and absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed and not,</v>

545
00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:22.060
<v Speaker 1>not that they couldn't do it or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

546
00:25:22.061 --> 00:25:23.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't get the footage of it,</v>

547
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.470
<v Speaker 1>but that they faked the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they never even did.</v>

548
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Everyone went out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people think that they couldn't </v>

549
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.351
<v Speaker 1>film it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went there but they couldn't film </v>

550
00:25:34.351 --> 00:25:34.351
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these,</v>

551
00:25:34.351 --> 00:25:36.271
<v Speaker 1>this fake film of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that there was other ways to track </v>

552
00:25:36.271 --> 00:25:36.280
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they went there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that believe that,</v>

553
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.610
<v Speaker 1>and then other people believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

554
00:25:37.611 --> 00:25:37.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

555
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.860
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all fake.</v>

556
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.980
<v Speaker 1>It's all fake from the jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shot them into low earth orbit.</v>

557
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.580
<v Speaker 1>They float around in low earth orbit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then drop back down.</v>

558
00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:46.520
<v Speaker 5>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was.</v>

559
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:49.320
<v Speaker 5>It's just a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just making money and they're.</v>

560
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:54.350
<v Speaker 5>And they're showing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a distraction for the va from </v>

561
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:59.181
<v Speaker 5>the Vietnam War.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All six missions during Richard Nixon </v>

562
00:25:59.181 --> 00:26:02.370
<v Speaker 5>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did one every six months with </v>

563
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:02.370
<v Speaker 5>different astronauts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one got hurt.</v>

564
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.090
<v Speaker 5>No one died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you kidding me?</v>

565
00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.760
<v Speaker 1>You ever see the video footage from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first man in space?</v>

566
00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:11.810
<v Speaker 1>The video footage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first manned space is so entirely </v>

567
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:11.810
<v Speaker 1>fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hilarious.</v>

568
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia?</v>

569
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:13.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy from Russia,</v>

570
00:26:13.471 --> 00:26:15.840
<v Speaker 1>the Russian guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did go into space,</v>

571
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.410
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have a fucking camera </v>
<v Speaker 1>crew inside the capsule with them.</v>

572
00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:24.650
<v Speaker 1>There's like opposing lights and </v>
<v Speaker 1>different like you could see like if </v>

573
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:25.950
<v Speaker 1>there's a distance between the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so fake.</v>

574
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:31.040
<v Speaker 1>It's always been propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put up Google fake video footage of </v>

575
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.150
<v Speaker 1>first man in orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

576
00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:36.150
<v Speaker 1>What was the Russian cat's name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first dude that went into orbit.</v>

577
00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:43.010
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a video footage of him inside </v>

<v Speaker 6>He would sambo the shit out of your </v>

582
00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:00.141
<v Speaker 6>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember there was like a few leg locks </v>

583
00:27:00.141 --> 00:27:00.141
<v Speaker 6>back in the day.</v>

<v Speaker 6>the craziest thing I found out I thought</v>

586
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:08.750
<v Speaker 6>heel hooks for sure were legal and sambo</v>
<v Speaker 6>and apparently they're not even legal </v>

<v Speaker 6>and samba.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 6>bars and it was because of the shoot and</v>

589
00:27:12.001 --> 00:27:17.001
<v Speaker 6>calf cranks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They all wear shoes and no heel hooks </v>

590
00:27:17.001 --> 00:27:17.001
<v Speaker 6>and samba.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I think gloves too,</v>

595
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:31.360
<v Speaker 6>but then I'm a broken record with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you find it video of just find fake </v>

<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

601
00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:45.540
<v Speaker 6>This is the moon landing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So Soviet moon landing.</v>

602
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.220
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>first man in orbit.</v>

603
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.950
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's inside the cockpit.</v>

604
00:27:49.951 --> 00:27:54.951
<v Speaker 6>It's like a NASA faking a earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>NASA first man and,</v>

605
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:03.470
<v Speaker 6>or regression.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not just put NASA faking or what was the</v>

606
00:28:03.751 --> 00:28:04.410
<v Speaker 6>guy's name?</v>

607
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Who was the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

608
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.900
<v Speaker 1>first man in orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's near Gagarin.</v>

609
00:28:09.901 --> 00:28:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so go Yuri Gagarin a video.</v>

610
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.190
<v Speaker 1>You could see the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he climbs into this thing.</v>

611
00:28:17.191 --> 00:28:22.191
<v Speaker 1>He takes off and then see if you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>find the first person like staring at </v>

612
00:28:23.731 --> 00:28:23.970
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

613
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.210
<v Speaker 6>There's a bunch of it where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so clearly not really happening.</v>

614
00:28:29.211 --> 00:28:30.220
<v Speaker 6>It's all fake,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

615
00:28:30.221 --> 00:28:32.170
<v Speaker 6>They're all faking it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Russians are faking it.</v>

616
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:37.200
<v Speaker 6>They're all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're all doing it together where </v>

617
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:37.200
<v Speaker 6>there's no real cold war.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there was a,</v>

618
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.490
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some sort of a</v>

619
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.880
<v Speaker 1>video on the analysis of that saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's light sources in there.</v>

620
00:28:42.881 --> 00:28:47.881
<v Speaker 1>There wouldn't be a light source inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>that cabin that you'd be able to film </v>

621
00:28:47.881 --> 00:28:51.211
<v Speaker 1>with and how far away with the camera </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be to capture this and they had </v>

622
00:28:51.211 --> 00:28:52.660
<v Speaker 1>these big ass clunky cameras and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't that kind of space.</v>

623
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:57.850
<v Speaker 6>Think about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>think about TV and the movies when they </v>

624
00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.020
<v Speaker 6>were born.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What were they ever about?</v>

625
00:29:00.021 --> 00:29:01.940
<v Speaker 6>Like what's really going on?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

626
00:29:01.941 --> 00:29:05.150
<v Speaker 6>I dream of Jeannie was right away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's right away.</v>

627
00:29:05.151 --> 00:29:07.370
<v Speaker 6>It's total bullshit right away from day </v>
<v Speaker 6>one.</v>

628
00:29:07.371 --> 00:29:12.371
<v Speaker 6>It's never.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was never a show about what life </v>

629
00:29:12.371 --> 00:29:14.741
<v Speaker 6>really is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was always bullshit right from the </v>

630
00:29:14.741 --> 00:29:14.741
<v Speaker 6>start,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right from the Getgo,</v>

631
00:29:14.741 --> 00:29:17.360
<v Speaker 6>propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They didn't create TV for entertainment.</v>

632
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.670
<v Speaker 6>You kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

633
00:29:19.671 --> 00:29:21.440
<v Speaker 6>let's entertain them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>CVC,</v>

634
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.890
<v Speaker 1>it's not like one super genius wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create something called TV and then they</v>

635
00:29:25.891 --> 00:29:30.120
<v Speaker 1>use that tv to manipulate the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is one super genius figures</v>

636
00:29:30.121 --> 00:29:35.121
<v Speaker 1>out a way to take a visual image and </v>
<v Speaker 1>projected into millions of different </v>

637
00:29:35.121 --> 00:29:36.800
<v Speaker 1>televisions at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's paying this?</v>

638
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologist,</v>

639
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:43.880
<v Speaker 1>so he figures out how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start things through this and then </v>

640
00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.420
<v Speaker 1>the powers that be realize what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulation you could get out of </v>

641
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:53.100
<v Speaker 1>something like that where you could show</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news every night and presidential </v>

642
00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:53.560
<v Speaker 1>addresses and then they started using it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their own good,</v>

643
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.470
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't created to control </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's brains.</v>

644
00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.680
<v Speaker 1>It was created because people have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherent desire to constantly innovate </v>

645
00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.370
<v Speaker 1>and make better and better shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know why we do it,</v>

646
00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:05.080
<v Speaker 1>but we're fucking obsessed with it.</v>

647
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.090
<v Speaker 1>So these technologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create it,</v>

648
00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:12.340
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so far smarter than any of the </v>

649
00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:12.340
<v Speaker 1>people that use it and manipulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

650
00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:16.920
<v Speaker 1>The people that created the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually understand how to make a </v>

651
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.180
<v Speaker 1>digital signal with your phone stream </v>
<v Speaker 1>live and periscope and a guy who was in </v>

652
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:25.531
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand can look at it in real time </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're talking about something </v>

653
00:30:25.531 --> 00:30:29.810
<v Speaker 1>would be a good idea for the Illuminati </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seek people like that out and hire </v>

654
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:30.310
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that be a good move?</v>

655
00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.610
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely a good hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go after those dudes wearing a man,</v>

656
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I think black male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um Damn.</v>

657
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:40.740
<v Speaker 1>You got them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Companies work directly with military </v>

658
00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.070
<v Speaker 1>and they get billy to military contracts</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make all kinds of shit they always </v>

659
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.940
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's computer stuff,</v>

660
00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.130
<v Speaker 1>whether it's surveillance equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I mean,</v>

661
00:30:48.131 --> 00:30:52.180
<v Speaker 1>there's lucrative contracts like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the big thing about the Iraq war,</v>

662
00:30:52.181 --> 00:30:52.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

663
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody was terrified of the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you had this guy who was the ceo of</v>

664
00:30:56.921 --> 00:31:01.921
<v Speaker 1>Halliburton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a company that cleans up after </v>

665
00:31:01.921 --> 00:31:06.061
<v Speaker 1>we blow shit up and that guy becomes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vice president and then they start </v>

666
00:31:06.061 --> 00:31:09.430
<v Speaker 1>getting these giant no bid contracts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>clean shit up after we blow it up.</v>

667
00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Like the money involved in something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that is insane,</v>

668
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking just hundreds of millions</v>

669
00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.290
<v Speaker 1>of dollars just flowing like water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

670
00:31:17.291 --> 00:31:20.650
<v Speaker 1>It's just constantly flowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about that,</v>

671
00:31:20.651 --> 00:31:25.651
<v Speaker 1>you think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be the case with </v>

672
00:31:25.651 --> 00:31:27.871
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they have the kind of money to throw </v>

673
00:31:27.871 --> 00:31:27.871
<v Speaker 1>that way towards the Afghan war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

674
00:31:27.871 --> 00:31:30.610
<v Speaker 1>what kind of black ops money do they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to make those jets unlimited?</v>

675
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Those stills crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking stealth.</v>

676
00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:37.891
<v Speaker 1>Generally as much trillions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly missing in the Pentagon at </v>

677
00:31:38.321 --> 00:31:42.670
<v Speaker 1>back in right before nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was two point 3 trillion missing from</v>

678
00:31:42.671 --> 00:31:43.080
<v Speaker 1>the Pentagon.</v>

679
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Literally a couple days before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

680
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:48.400
<v Speaker 1>the day before Donald Rumsfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows about that,</v>

681
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.380
<v Speaker 1>but like now I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like,</v>

682
00:31:50.381 --> 00:31:53.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17 trillion are missing two,</v>

683
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.680
<v Speaker 1>two point 3 trillion was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's all this money going?</v>

684
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trillions.</v>

685
00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Trillions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

686
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:04.770
<v Speaker 1>This is where it's at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's what you're saying is not </v>

687
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:04.770
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people are listening to this.</v>

688
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:09.571
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this that have never heard </v>

689
00:32:09.571 --> 00:32:09.571
<v Speaker 1>this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they think,</v>

690
00:32:09.571 --> 00:32:09.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

691
00:32:09.571 --> 00:32:14.100
<v Speaker 1>These guys are just making shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is some loony fucking left wing </v>

692
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:14.460
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

693
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:18.700
<v Speaker 1>You guys think that the government was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in on this and that it was all a scam to</v>

694
00:32:18.701 --> 00:32:21.250
<v Speaker 1>hide the fact that they'd stolen </v>
<v Speaker 1>trillions of dollars,</v>

695
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
<v Speaker 1>but they really did have a press </v>
<v Speaker 1>conference and it's really available </v>

696
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.811
<v Speaker 1>online and Donald Rumsfeld really does </v>
<v Speaker 1>look straight at the camera and he </v>

697
00:32:30.811 --> 00:32:32.680
<v Speaker 1>really does say they're missing </v>
<v Speaker 1>trillions of dollars.</v>

698
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Two point 3 trillion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion trillion.</v>

699
00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a thousand billion and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day</v>

700
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:45.700
<v Speaker 3>nine slash 11 hits a plane or a bomb </v>
<v Speaker 3>blows up a small little section of the </v>

701
00:32:48.441 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 3>Pentagon where all the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>auditing the Pentagon,</v>

702
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.630
<v Speaker 3>the Accounting Office blows up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone coincidence,</v>

703
00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:00.640

<v Speaker 3>It's a total coincidence that she could </v>

704
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:00.640
<v Speaker 3>really happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen to me,</v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one would ever kill someone for as </v>

706
00:33:04.781 --> 00:33:06.980
<v Speaker 3>little as two point $3,000,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not enough money to get people to</v>

707
00:33:06.981 --> 00:33:08.330
<v Speaker 3>kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not.</v>

708
00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.590
<v Speaker 3>People need more money to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People kill people for like 50,</v>

709
00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:18.440
<v Speaker 3>except she gave so really shitty guy who</v>

<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit is so corrupt and it's always been </v>

711
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.870
<v Speaker 3>listening to Donald Rumsfeld talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how dare you talk her over guy.</v>

713
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:32.890
<v Speaker 3>See if he could find the actual video of</v>
<v Speaker 3>him talking because it's pretty </v>

714
00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:32.990
<v Speaker 3>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a couple minutes.</v>

715
00:33:32.991 --> 00:33:34.930
<v Speaker 3>Donald Rumsfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

716
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:38.420
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of money down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas that carries a shitload of them.</v>

717
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.440
<v Speaker 3>Where'd it go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>son?</v>

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's not the full video of him </v>

720
00:33:46.601 --> 00:33:46.940
<v Speaker 3>actually saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nine slash 11.</v>

721
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
<v Speaker 3>Donald Rumsfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trillion guaranteed a bunch of no one </v>

722
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:52.450
<v Speaker 3>ever talked about it again.</v>

723
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:53.310
<v Speaker 3>The second one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

724
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.420
<v Speaker 3>What's crazy is it really didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought up after that.</v>

725
00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Let's listen to it on reinsurance.</v>

<v Speaker 3>in transactions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two point 3 trillion,</v>

<v Speaker 3>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one 10th of September ends according to </v>

729
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.361
<v Speaker 3>some estimates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We cannot track two point </v>

730
00:34:19.361 --> 00:34:19.361
<v Speaker 3>$3,000,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>in transactions.</v>

731
00:34:19.361 --> 00:34:24.130

<v Speaker 3>according to the accounting offices were</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroyed in the Pentagon to two point 3</v>

733
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.810
<v Speaker 3>trillion was never brought up again.</v>

<v Speaker 3>could take the trillions,</v>

736
00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:43.330
<v Speaker 3>but we got to make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to admit it and then everyone's </v>

737
00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:43.330
<v Speaker 3>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget about it.</v>

738
00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:44.890
<v Speaker 3>What did people say to that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the one,</v>

739
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:46.790
<v Speaker 3>one of those ones where what does </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

740
00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:51.500
<v Speaker 3>What do people say to the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>plane would hit the perfect spot to hide</v>

741
00:34:51.501 --> 00:34:54.770
<v Speaker 3>the two point three trillions of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 3>in debt to for you,</v>

742
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.590
<v Speaker 3>for someone to know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to admit to themselves,</v>

743
00:34:57.591 --> 00:35:02.591
<v Speaker 3>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody will admit the government is </v>

744
00:35:02.591 --> 00:35:04.280
<v Speaker 3>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when something gets brought up,</v>

745
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.770
<v Speaker 3>they're always believe in the government</v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

746
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:08.090
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>11.</v>

751
00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.420

<v Speaker 3>segments.</v>

755
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:29.670
<v Speaker 3>Things that make you go,</v>

758
00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 3>doing business with this organization </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you saw a speech by</v>

759
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.620
<v Speaker 1>the chairman of that organization and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>

760
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:44.640
<v Speaker 1>we're missing a $55,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you still want a new business with</v>

761
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:46.260
<v Speaker 1>this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this one.</v>

762
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Trillion's go missing from the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pentagon can account for six point 5 </v>

763
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:52.140
<v Speaker 1>trillion in tax payer cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cash.</v>

764
00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.990
<v Speaker 1>No one can but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everyone.</v>

765
00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:59.560
<v Speaker 1>The official story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe the official story that they </v>

766
00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.710
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't do that.</v>

767
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're are corrupt,</v>

768
00:36:02.611 --> 00:36:04.080
<v Speaker 1>but they wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

769
00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:04.860

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

770
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:06.930
<v Speaker 1>but they wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it doesn't make any sense.</v>

771
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.210
<v Speaker 1>The report review,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

772
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.990
<v Speaker 1>They cannot provide adequate </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentation for how it spent.</v>

773
00:36:12.991 --> 00:36:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Six point 5 trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is hilarious.</v>

774
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.020
<v Speaker 1>How do they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they not all go to jail?</v>

775
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.380
<v Speaker 1>How nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's going to jail.</v>

776
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Illuminati.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Your richest.</v>

778
00:36:24.211 --> 00:36:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Fuck I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is into satanism.</v>

779
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:31.550
<v Speaker 1>The people that go to people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the money that our taxes go to,</v>

780
00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.430
<v Speaker 1>like they have it.</v>

781
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Our taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we spend the money or we buy,</v>

782
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:35.730
<v Speaker 1>we get the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We sent it to them.</v>

783
00:36:35.731 --> 00:36:40.731
<v Speaker 1>They have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't account for six point 5 </v>

784
00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 1>trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so much money.</v>

785
00:36:41.491 --> 00:36:46.491
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like he's in the national debt </v>

786
00:36:46.491 --> 00:36:48.960
<v Speaker 1>like 13 trillion or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the national debt is higher.</v>

787
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:50.620
<v Speaker 1>I might've made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

788
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.080
<v Speaker 1>your trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it is?</v>

789
00:36:52.081 --> 00:36:55.760
<v Speaker 1>We think the national debt is to have no</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking I,</v>

790
00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.500
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what the data.</v>

791
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.740
<v Speaker 1>$6,000,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody's going to jail.</v>

792
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:04.890
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm saying is it's half of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be like half a national</v>

793
00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:05.730
<v Speaker 1>debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

794
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Nobody in the Illuminati goes to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail.</v>

795
00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:12.030
<v Speaker 1>That our national debt is 20 point 4 </v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion,</v>

796
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:17.300
<v Speaker 1>which we cannot pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't account for six point 5 </v>

797
00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.070
<v Speaker 1>trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why even account for it anymore?</v>

798
00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Just at this point.</v>

799
00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just say,</v>

800
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.410
<v Speaker 1>shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

801
00:37:22.411 --> 00:37:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Let's just cross our fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

802
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Well there was an article that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>written about,</v>

803
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:33.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that our country was going to </v>

804
00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.270
<v Speaker 1>descend slowly into something that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>on democracy anymore.</v>

805
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.170
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument you would make if you don't</v>

806
00:37:40.171 --> 00:37:45.171
<v Speaker 1>have to account for trillions of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you make us pay for the argument </v>

807
00:37:45.171 --> 00:37:46.050
<v Speaker 1>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might have already happened.</v>

808
00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Like where it's all about money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

809
00:37:48.451 --> 00:37:53.451
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What more money are you going to get </v>

810
00:37:53.451 --> 00:37:54.480
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six and a half trillion dollars,</v>

811
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:56.700
<v Speaker 1>like if it's really all just about money</v>
<v Speaker 1>and control,</v>

812
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:59.410
<v Speaker 1>that's a shitload of money and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the control?</v>

813
00:37:59.411 --> 00:38:04.411
<v Speaker 1>The control is it's rarely discussed </v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's all sorts of outrageous </v>

814
00:38:04.411 --> 00:38:06.420
<v Speaker 1>like transgender people using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's room.</v>

815
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Once you're in the Illuminati,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're above the motherfucking lot.</v>

816
00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's going to jail.</v>

817
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:15.180
<v Speaker 1>They're all fucking doing crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody goes to jail.</v>

818
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Nobody in the Pentagon's going to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>

819
00:38:17.941 --> 00:38:20.310
<v Speaker 1>No one in the CIA's going to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to jail.</v>

820
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:25.340
<v Speaker 1>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's crazy is that no one taught </v>

821
00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.500
<v Speaker 1>here a further mysteries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened to thousands of documents </v>

822
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.910
<v Speaker 1>that should be on file but aren't the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ige study found that F A.</v>

823
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:34.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did not document or or support why?</v>

824
00:38:34.051 --> 00:38:39.051
<v Speaker 1>The defense reporting system removed at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least 16,500,</v>

825
00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:44.680
<v Speaker 1>13 of one point 3 million records during</v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter three.</v>

826
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Fiscal year 2015 as a result of the data</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to prepare the fiscal year 2015 </v>

827
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:52.090
<v Speaker 1>egf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is.</v>

828
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.480
<v Speaker 1>A third quarter and year end financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>statements were unreliable and lacked </v>

829
00:38:58.361 --> 00:39:03.361
<v Speaker 1>and adequate audit trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just started yanking </v>

830
00:39:03.361 --> 00:39:03.940
<v Speaker 1>transactions and deleting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe them.</v>

831
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else?</v>

832
00:39:04.871 --> 00:39:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does that work?</v>

833
00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:08.200
<v Speaker 1>If they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they have black ops,</v>

834
00:39:08.201 --> 00:39:11.410
<v Speaker 1>like what we're talking about before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they have like area 51,</v>

835
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.140
<v Speaker 1>which is like groom lake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

836
00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:19.141
<v Speaker 1>that whole area in Nevada where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal to even get close to where they </v>

837
00:39:19.141 --> 00:39:20.410
<v Speaker 1>were supposedly develop and stealth </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombers and all that shit.</v>

838
00:39:20.411 --> 00:39:21.790
<v Speaker 1>They did all that stuff out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

839
00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.330
<v Speaker 1>How much they get and how do they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does that money work?</v>

840
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Because that is that where all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money's going to crazy military </v>

841
00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:31.390
<v Speaker 1>projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what does a black cop,</v>

842
00:39:31.391 --> 00:39:33.040
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if they say black ops,</v>

843
00:39:33.041 --> 00:39:38.041
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that why they cannot account for </v>

844
00:39:38.041 --> 00:39:38.041
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

845
00:39:38.041 --> 00:39:38.950
<v Speaker 1>isn't that makes sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're spending trillions of dollars</v>

846
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:42.070
<v Speaker 1>making these crazy fucking jets and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing.</v>

847
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

848
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.270
<v Speaker 1>but is that what it means?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's what it means.</v>

849
00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:51.830
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it means that this is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>some shit they get to just do whatever </v>

850
00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:53.640
<v Speaker 1>the fuck they want with and they build </v>
<v Speaker 1>these crazy bases and they do whatever.</v>

851
00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Sonic jets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

852
00:39:54.791 --> 00:39:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine the people at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the islands they have and shit.</v>

853
00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Queue management pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got pieces of land that we know </v>

854
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:06.780
<v Speaker 1>nothing about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what Janet budget has it like an </v>

855
00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:10.350
<v Speaker 1>area for classified programs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they spent like $59 billion on </v>

856
00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:10.840
<v Speaker 1>classified programs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

857
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.330
<v Speaker 1>so the six point 5 trillion is on top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

858
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe classified programs is one level </v>

859
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:21.360
<v Speaker 1>of top secret and it gets all the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to where we deconstruct alien </v>

860
00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.040
<v Speaker 1>spacecrafts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like that Robert Lasar type shit.</v>

861
00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.710
<v Speaker 1>You ever see that guys videos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

862
00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:30.340

<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

863
00:40:30.341 --> 00:40:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where I am still </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinated.</v>

864
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:36.400
<v Speaker 1>That guy's just a little tom because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still alive.</v>

865
00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine him on this podcast?</v>

866
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.530
<v Speaker 1>That would be free cash within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

867
00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:43.970
<v Speaker 1>I think he's really cool.</v>

868
00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:48.140
<v Speaker 1>You know what he's friends with John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lear and that guy says the most crazy,</v>

869
00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:53.820
<v Speaker 1>crazy sean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is his secrets are that there's </v>

870
00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.140
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's millions of people on Venus,</v>

871
00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:58.490
<v Speaker 1>there's millions of people on Mars </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

872
00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:03.810
<v Speaker 1>There's people all over the on every </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet and and they're just not telling </v>

873
00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:06.070
<v Speaker 1>us about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't John Lear like,</v>

874
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.980
<v Speaker 1>do you think that it's possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna throw this out there.</v>

875
00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's possible that John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lear,</v>

876
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.300
<v Speaker 1>who's like some soup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't he a super billionaire character?</v>

877
00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:17.590
<v Speaker 1>He was a former CIA pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in the CIA for many years.</v>

878
00:41:17.591 --> 00:41:22.591
<v Speaker 1>Once you're in the cio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in his but isn't any like some </v>

879
00:41:22.591 --> 00:41:25.501
<v Speaker 1>super wealthy businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how we're thinking about </v>

880
00:41:25.501 --> 00:41:27.991
<v Speaker 1>lear jets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jets is like his father created lear </v>

881
00:41:27.991 --> 00:41:29.020
<v Speaker 1>jets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is he a super wealthy businessman?</v>

882
00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:34.050
<v Speaker 1>He should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking if I was one of those </v>

883
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 1>guys and I was bored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might just be trolling</v>

884
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.530
<v Speaker 3>the fuck out of people telling them </v>
<v Speaker 3>about people on Mars.</v>

885
00:41:36.531 --> 00:41:38.300
<v Speaker 3>That's what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

886
00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.600
<v Speaker 3>He's doing it for fun and and they let </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

887
00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.980
<v Speaker 3>They let him in the Illuminati.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he does that and he's like,</v>

888
00:41:42.981 --> 00:41:44.540
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was already in.</v>

889
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:49.810
<v Speaker 3>He's probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you can't deny is things like </v>

890
00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:50.590
<v Speaker 3>Bohemian Grove.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what you can tonight.</v>

891
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:51.640
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm warm.</v>

892
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the skeptical side of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theories.</v>

893
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't get me wrong out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

894
00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:00.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going after anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to indict anybody.</v>

895
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:04.580
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's just too many people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are hypnotized to really stop anything.</v>

896
00:42:04.581 --> 00:42:06.650
<v Speaker 3>You can't stop these trillions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars missing.</v>

897
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:08.180
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's gonna?</v>

898
00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.170
<v Speaker 3>Who's gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop that.</v>

899
00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.360
<v Speaker 3>Here's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

900
00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:13.580
<v Speaker 3>it's a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too many people are hypnotized.</v>

901
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:14.300
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

902
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.510
<v Speaker 3>it's hopeless sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

903
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is that what you see,</v>

904
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:24.010
<v Speaker 3>these things that you can't deny and one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things he can't deny as Bohemian </v>

905
00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:27.821
<v Speaker 3>Grove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bohemian Grove is a place where these </v>

906
00:42:27.821 --> 00:42:30.701
<v Speaker 3>leaders and these bankers and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>elites of the world literally do get </v>

907
00:42:30.701 --> 00:42:35.111
<v Speaker 3>together and put it on fucking robes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get in front of a giant stone owl </v>

908
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.020
<v Speaker 3>and they have a like a ceremony and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>burned some sticks.</v>

909
00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:42.000
<v Speaker 3>They burn an effigy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the,</v>

910
00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.990
<v Speaker 3>when Alex Jones was the first guy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find that like you,</v>

911
00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:49.940
<v Speaker 3>you can criticize Alex Jones all you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want and a lot of it's deserved.</v>

912
00:42:49.941 --> 00:42:54.170
<v Speaker 3>He says a lot of crazy shit and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>character and he gets big and theatrical</v>

913
00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:59.171

1034
00:48:00.091 --> 00:48:01.740

<v Speaker 7>recent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was in the same.</v>

00:48:34.191 --> 00:48:35.200
<v Speaker 7>Was that July that you just looked down </v>
<v Speaker 7>the other one?</v>

1050
00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.350
<v Speaker 7>The other one was a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a female.</v>

1051
00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:38.060
<v Speaker 7>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1053
00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.070
<v Speaker 7>episode of the fucking house of cards.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Man,</v>

1054
00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.770
<v Speaker 7>isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So obviously who knows,</v>

1055
00:48:46.771 --> 00:48:49.350
<v Speaker 7>maybe that were really depressed and </v>
<v Speaker 7>they wanted to shoot their brains out.</v>

1056
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.000
<v Speaker 7>Maybe we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We don't know,</v>

1057
00:48:51.001 --> 00:48:53.160
<v Speaker 7>but I'm saying there's some fishy shit </v>
<v Speaker 7>going on there.</v>

1058
00:48:53.161 --> 00:48:54.210
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here's the fish.</v>

1059
00:48:54.211 --> 00:48:56.070
<v Speaker 7>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for sure.</v>

1060
00:48:56.190 --> 00:49:01.050
<v Speaker 7>Someone that works for the government </v>
<v Speaker 7>has had someone killed,</v>

1061
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:02.520
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>For sure.</v>

1062
00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:07.580
<v Speaker 7>Let's just go.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even Johnson was about to be indicted </v>

1063
00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.350
<v Speaker 7>for two murders before jfk got murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but let's start from the beginning.</v>

1064
00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.350
<v Speaker 7>It was that true?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

1065
00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:12.170
<v Speaker 7>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1066
00:49:12.171 --> 00:49:14.220
<v Speaker 7>And then let's start for somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 7>becomes president.</v>

1067
00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:14.820
<v Speaker 7>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's gone.</v>

1068
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:18.600
<v Speaker 7>Let's start from the beginning for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Someone,</v>

1069
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:23.280
<v Speaker 7>whether it was Nixon or whether it was </v>
<v Speaker 7>Theodore Roosevelt or Kennedy,</v>

1070
00:49:23.281 --> 00:49:27.420
<v Speaker 7>someone at some point in time wanted </v>
<v Speaker 7>someone dead.</v>

1071
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:32.530
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And they did it and then pulled it off </v>

1072
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:32.530
<v Speaker 7>and the best way to do it's called a </v>
<v Speaker 7>suicide.</v>

1073
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:37.250
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And make it look not like a suicide </v>

1074
00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:37.250
<v Speaker 7>because then you're sending a message.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They do it on purpose.</v>

1075
00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:41.600
<v Speaker 7>Here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If we all agree and I think every </v>

1076
00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.170
<v Speaker 7>reasonable person would agree that </v>
<v Speaker 7>somewhere in government somewhere,</v>

1077
00:49:43.171 --> 00:49:46.440
<v Speaker 7>at some point in time someone has </v>
<v Speaker 7>ordered someone killed and got away with</v>

1078
00:49:46.441 --> 00:49:46.810
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1079
00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:52.790
<v Speaker 7>So that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not so then the question is how many </v>

1080
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.790
<v Speaker 7>other times?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1081
00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.920
<v Speaker 7>How often did you find that chick who </v>
<v Speaker 7>recently got got a suicidal,</v>

1082
00:49:58.410 --> 00:49:59.580
<v Speaker 7>but hold on Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here's the thing.</v>

1083
00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:01.800
<v Speaker 7>You've got to think of military strikes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1084
00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:03.870
<v Speaker 7>If you're willing to authorize a </v>
<v Speaker 7>military strike,</v>

1085
00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.580
<v Speaker 7>you get to the point where you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>willing to say,</v>

1086
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:08.520
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do it like especially a drone strike.</v>

1087
00:50:08.521 --> 00:50:09.990
<v Speaker 7>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like this is the building,</v>

1088
00:50:09.991 --> 00:50:14.991
<v Speaker 7>the apartment building.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're 97 percent sure he's in the </v>

1089
00:50:14.991 --> 00:50:17.841
<v Speaker 7>building.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do we have the authorization like how </v>

1090
00:50:17.841 --> 00:50:19.851
<v Speaker 7>many civilians are dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 7>somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to </v>

1091
00:50:19.851 --> 00:50:19.851
<v Speaker 7>100?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1092
00:50:19.851 --> 00:50:20.310
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my authorization and they do it and they</v>

1093
00:50:20.311 --> 00:50:22.140
<v Speaker 7>launched that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anytime you do that,</v>

1094
00:50:22.141 --> 00:50:27.141
<v Speaker 7>if you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you can press that button and just </v>

1095
00:50:27.141 --> 00:50:27.560
<v Speaker 7>wipe out 100 people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>including the guy.</v>

1096
00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 7>Anytime</v>

1097
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:29.240
<v Speaker 1>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1098
00:50:29.241 --> 00:50:32.150
<v Speaker 1>you just killed 100 people that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do anything wrong.</v>

1099
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how easy is it going to be to kill some </v>

1100
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:39.491
<v Speaker 1>people that you think do a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong or annoying or keep fucking with </v>

1104
00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Michael Hastings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he get circumcised?</v>

1105
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.410
<v Speaker 1>He was a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He commit suicide.</v>

1106
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Michael Hastings was a journalist who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote for the rolling stone and he </v>

1107
00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:55.820
<v Speaker 1>followed around a general and he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck over there.</v>

1108
00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:01.150
<v Speaker 1>There was something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was that volcano that went </v>

1109
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.150
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>

<v Speaker 1>month?</v>

1111
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got stuck over there while the </v>

1112
00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:07.760
<v Speaker 1>volcanoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't fly into this shit because</v>

1113
00:51:07.761 --> 00:51:11.050
<v Speaker 1>if the sky was hazy around this area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1114
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.770
<v Speaker 1>so he stuck around and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:51:12.771 --> 00:51:17.771
<v Speaker 1>they got a little loose with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they joking around about stuff and he </v>

1116
00:51:17.771 --> 00:51:21.881
<v Speaker 1>was making jokes about Obama and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling stone reported it and he wound </v>

1117
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:23.660
<v Speaker 1>up getting retired.</v>

1118
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:28.930
<v Speaker 1>He retired and stepped down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to sort of step down because he </v>

1119
00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:30.920
<v Speaker 1>was in insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after he did that,</v>

1120
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:33.110
<v Speaker 1>like everybody was furious since this </v>
<v Speaker 1>report,</v>

1121
00:51:33.111 --> 00:51:38.111
<v Speaker 1>he got a shitload of death threats </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this guy was a serious general </v>

1122
00:51:38.111 --> 00:51:39.950
<v Speaker 1>and he really knew his shit and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>well respected amongst its troops and he</v>

1123
00:51:39.951 --> 00:51:44.951
<v Speaker 1>had a step down and he had it put those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in danger because this guy had an</v>

<v Speaker 1>like 120 miles an hour.</v>

<v Speaker 1>launched from the vehicle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the engine blew up and was on the.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you've got to be like alert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way too easy.</v>

1144
00:52:37.671 --> 00:52:42.671
<v Speaker 1>I have a good friend who told me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all journalists and writers are </v>

1145
00:52:43.011 --> 00:52:45.290
<v Speaker 1>taking this stuff when they need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that helps,</v>

1146
00:52:45.291 --> 00:52:46.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps.</v>

1147
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:51.400
<v Speaker 1>It absolutely helps put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the crash and there's the </v>

1148
00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:54.821
<v Speaker 1>engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If fucking launched a block away and </v>

1149
00:52:54.821 --> 00:52:58.280
<v Speaker 1>they think that the conspiracy theory is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they drove him,</v>

1150
00:52:58.281 --> 00:53:03.281
<v Speaker 1>not only drove him into a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would they set a bomb in his car and </v>

1151
00:53:03.281 --> 00:53:03.440
<v Speaker 1>that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1152
00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:08.210
<v Speaker 1>it slammed in the bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploded in the engine launch.</v>

1153
00:53:08.211 --> 00:53:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Look how far away the engineers look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the engine,</v>

1154
00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:14.780
<v Speaker 1>the upper right hand corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the car and they'll look at the </v>

1155
00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:14.870
<v Speaker 1>engine way up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It launched.</v>

1156
00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.500
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what my point was,</v>

1157
00:53:18.501 --> 00:53:20.240
<v Speaker 1>let me finish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fucked up his.</v>

1158
00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Even if the conspiracy theory that every</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and then</v>

1159
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.440
<v Speaker 5>politician,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone in power,</v>

1160
00:53:28.441 --> 00:53:32.430
<v Speaker 5>even maybe an entertainer has someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>suicided because they're in the elite,</v>

1161
00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:34.290
<v Speaker 5>they got all the connections and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>can get away with it.</v>

1162
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:37.740
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if that's not true,</v>

1163
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:39.570
<v Speaker 5>and that's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1164
00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:42.330
<v Speaker 5>and every suicide generally as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>suicide,</v>

1165
00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:46.890
<v Speaker 5>even though it looks weird and then they</v>
<v Speaker 5>make it look like when you,</v>

1166
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:48.030
<v Speaker 5>when you watched that movie that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1167
00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:53.070
<v Speaker 5>the documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Clinton chronicles on Youtube and </v>

1168
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:53.280
<v Speaker 5>you watch that man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1169
00:53:53.281 --> 00:53:58.281
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they make it look obvious to send a </v>

1170
00:53:58.281 --> 00:53:58.281
<v Speaker 5>message like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

1171
00:53:58.281 --> 00:54:00.930
<v Speaker 5>we got the corner in our pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to fuck with us.</v>

1172
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:03.870
<v Speaker 5>We can make anything happen and no one's</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to jail.</v>

1173
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.870
<v Speaker 5>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's the conspiracy theory.</v>

1174
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:10.020
<v Speaker 5>But if it's not a real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>damn,</v>

1175
00:54:10.021 --> 00:54:11.820
<v Speaker 5>that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1176
00:54:11.821 --> 00:54:14.310
<v Speaker 5>Run with that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a great idea.</v>

1177
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:19.790
<v Speaker 5>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're corrupt and you want to hold </v>

1178
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:22.611
<v Speaker 5>onto your power and you want to climb up</v>
<v Speaker 5>as high as you can in the political </v>

1179
00:54:22.611 --> 00:54:24.030
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a great idea,</v>

1180
00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:26.700
<v Speaker 5>right on the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go after the corner,</v>

1181
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.710
<v Speaker 5>whoever the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wherever you're where you're a mayor,</v>

1182
00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:34.720
<v Speaker 5>what we go after the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to own them and then there's </v>

1183
00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.240
<v Speaker 5>evidence that you look at stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>certain cases,</v>

1184
00:54:36.241 --> 00:54:40.260
<v Speaker 5>and it's obvious for certain cases they </v>
<v Speaker 5>fly in the corner,</v>

1185
00:54:40.261 --> 00:54:41.220
<v Speaker 5>they fly in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1186
00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:46.460
<v Speaker 5>it's so shady,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but why wouldn't it be and why wouldn't </v>

1187
00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:48.921
<v Speaker 5>you believe it will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what do you want the best one </v>

1188
00:54:48.921 --> 00:54:50.130
<v Speaker 5>to Enron whistleblower who shot himself </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the head.</v>

1189
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:53.400
<v Speaker 5>He shot himself in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1190
00:54:53.401 --> 00:54:55.490
<v Speaker 5>They do that on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an obvious one.</v>

1191
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:58.710
<v Speaker 5>If you were a detective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you enter a case like that?</v>

1192
00:54:58.711 --> 00:54:59.160
<v Speaker 5>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

1193
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.380
<v Speaker 5>someone got suicided but it looks fishy.</v>

1194
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.490
<v Speaker 5>Would you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

1195
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:05.610
<v Speaker 5>I'd suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't disrespect the family.</v>

1196
00:55:05.611 --> 00:55:07.260
<v Speaker 5>Just keep it a suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They told us it was.</v>

1197
00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:12.380
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would want to know what the fuck </v>

1198
00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:14.631
<v Speaker 5>really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if one of like one of your </v>

1199
00:55:14.631 --> 00:55:16.461
<v Speaker 5>relatives died or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they said she committed suicide and </v>

1200
00:55:16.461 --> 00:55:16.461
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>

1201
00:55:16.461 --> 00:55:16.860
<v Speaker 5>But then someone you know that knows </v>
<v Speaker 5>him,</v>

1202
00:55:16.861 --> 00:55:21.861
<v Speaker 5>said it wasn't suicide brow it wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to know the details or would </v>

1203
00:55:21.861 --> 00:55:24.420
<v Speaker 5>you say it wasn't suicide?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what the COP said.</v>

1204
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:29.630
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we should have respect for their </v>

1205
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.630
<v Speaker 5>soul and their family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just say that.</v>

1206
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.760
<v Speaker 5>Or would you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell me what the fuck happened.</v>

1207
00:55:29.761 --> 00:55:30.960
<v Speaker 5>What do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1208
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:32.460
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's natural.</v>

1209
00:55:32.461 --> 00:55:35.760
<v Speaker 5>If it's her family fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when it comes to stuff like,</v>

1210
00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.230
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1211
00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:39.720
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you look at Chris Cornell,</v>

1212
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.810
<v Speaker 5>him and his wife had a foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Him and Chester,</v>

1213
00:55:42.811 --> 00:55:43.650
<v Speaker 5>we're best friends.</v>

1214
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.170
<v Speaker 5>The conspiracy theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's true,</v>

1215
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:48.750
<v Speaker 5>but that we're gonna be found out some </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

1216
00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:50.910
<v Speaker 5>They found out some shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's be respectful.</v>

1217
00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:51.740
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't.</v>

1218
00:55:51.741 --> 00:55:52.600
<v Speaker 5>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1219
00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:56.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm not naming any names,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you got to look into it.</v>

1220
00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:58.260
<v Speaker 5>But it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy just died,</v>

1221
00:55:58.261 --> 00:56:00.190
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't think this is shit.</v>

1222
00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:01.390
<v Speaker 5>Do it on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1223
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:06.740
<v Speaker 5>that's why you should speculate it when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you find out the connection and the way </v>

1224
00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:08.670
<v Speaker 5>they died it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they made it.</v>

1225
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:14.150
<v Speaker 5>Chris Cornell had nine broken ribs and a</v>
<v Speaker 5>gash in the back of his head and hung </v>

1226
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.760
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1227
00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.370
<v Speaker 5>and they said the official story is from</v>
<v Speaker 5>the CPR,</v>

1228
00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:23.330
<v Speaker 5>the CPR.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was already dead when they got there </v>

1229
00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:23.330
<v Speaker 5>and they break nine ribs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't CPI,</v>

1230
00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 5>and there's a gash behind his head </v>
<v Speaker 5>behind his head</v>

1231
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:29.010
<v Speaker 7>when they cut them loose and he bangs </v>
<v Speaker 7>his head off the ground and he's </v>

1232
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:31.210
<v Speaker 7>hanging.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's hanging off a like one of those </v>

1233
00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:32.560
<v Speaker 7>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Someone killed him.</v>

1234
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.720
<v Speaker 7>When?</v>
<v Speaker 7>When?</v>

1235
00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:35.890
<v Speaker 7>When you look at the evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

1236
00:56:35.891 --> 00:56:37.960
<v Speaker 7>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He looked like he was murdered.</v>

1237
00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:41.050
<v Speaker 7>And then chester right before chester </v>
<v Speaker 7>dies the same way,</v>

1238
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:43.330
<v Speaker 7>the exact same way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's not do this man.</v>

1239
00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:46.250
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to even do this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Alright,</v>

1240
00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.480
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just looking into.</v>

1241
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:51.250
<v Speaker 7>Because I love Chester.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love Chester.</v>

1242
00:56:51.251 --> 00:56:53.470
<v Speaker 7>I Love Lincoln Park,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Lincoln Park,</v>

1243
00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:57.430
<v Speaker 7>Lincoln Park.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't understand the theories involved</v>

1244
00:56:57.431 --> 00:56:59.410
<v Speaker 7>in this guy's death,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially when he just died.</v>

1245
00:56:59.411 --> 00:57:03.060
<v Speaker 7>It just seems so disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I.</v>

1246
00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:04.890
<v Speaker 7>He was one of my favorite singers of all</v>
<v Speaker 7>time stand.</v>

1247
00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:09.900
<v Speaker 7>But if you really did just kill himself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like it seems so disrespectful to </v>

1248
00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.950
<v Speaker 7>speculate that he was murdered because </v>
<v Speaker 7>of some conspiracy theory.</v>

1249
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.100
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what the case is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I don't even want to talk about it.</v>

1250
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.300
<v Speaker 7>But do you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That you know what I said enough.</v>

1251
00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:21.160
<v Speaker 7>I don't need to say no more.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to get into trouble,</v>

1252
00:57:21.161 --> 00:57:24.700
<v Speaker 7>but I'm just okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not trying to put anybody in jail.</v>

1253
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.680
<v Speaker 7>I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I Love Lincoln Park.</v>

1254
00:57:26.681 --> 00:57:28.990
<v Speaker 7>I love Chester.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love Chris Cornell.</v>

1255
00:57:28.991 --> 00:57:30.980
<v Speaker 7>You can understand.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I understand.</v>

1256
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:34.480
<v Speaker 7>I just feel like you should really know </v>
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck are you talking about when</v>

1257
00:57:34.481 --> 00:57:36.930
<v Speaker 7>you talk about people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We were just talking about suicides.</v>

1258
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:41.950
<v Speaker 7>We were just talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We were just talking about is when you </v>

1259
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:44.530
<v Speaker 7>look at what they were into,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they were into that.</v>

1260
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:46.750
<v Speaker 7>They were into fighting that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1261
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.110
<v Speaker 7>And when you look at exactly how also </v>
<v Speaker 7>severely depressed,</v>

1262
00:57:50.111 --> 00:57:52.270
<v Speaker 7>there was also a lot of psychological </v>
<v Speaker 7>shit going on.</v>

1263
00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:53.650
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know man.</v>

1264
00:57:53.651 --> 00:57:55.330
<v Speaker 7>I don't know why people kill themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 7>period,</v>

1265
00:57:55.331 --> 00:57:56.230
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know why,</v>

1266
00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:58.290
<v Speaker 7>but wouldn't you want to do serious?</v>

1267
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.370
<v Speaker 7>There was some fish.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe I'll look into it.</v>

1268
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:06.390
<v Speaker 7>Talk about it until whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 7>reality has been that we were talking </v>

1269
00:58:07.151 --> 00:58:12.151
<v Speaker 7>about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're talking about all these crazy </v>

1270
00:58:12.151 --> 00:58:15.721
<v Speaker 7>suicides.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're talking about our that and then </v>

1271
00:58:15.721 --> 00:58:16.460
<v Speaker 7>this is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is time.</v>

1272
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:22.320
<v Speaker 7>This is when you should bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have not later when everyone forgets </v>

1273
00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.140
<v Speaker 7>about know any facts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so when you're bringing it.</v>

1274
00:58:23.141 --> 00:58:24.780
<v Speaker 7>I'm just telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sounds crazy.</v>

1275
00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:26.110
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Alright.</v>

1276
00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:27.640
<v Speaker 7>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I get it.</v>

1277
00:58:27.641 --> 00:58:28.710
<v Speaker 7>He was probably.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was.</v>

1278
00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:32.800
<v Speaker 7>He probably did it himself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He could have very well easily have done</v>

1279
00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:37.801
<v Speaker 7>it himself and the whole thing is just </v>
<v Speaker 7>connecting them to some conspiracy </v>

1280
00:58:37.801 --> 00:58:41.911
<v Speaker 7>without like a d because I care about it</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I care about a deep </v>

1281
00:58:41.911 --> 00:58:42.220
<v Speaker 7>understanding of the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I care about.</v>

1282
00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.350
<v Speaker 7>I care about them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't know how,</v>

1283
00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:45.820
<v Speaker 7>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how deep.</v>

1284
00:58:45.821 --> 00:58:47.320
<v Speaker 7>My understanding is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I believe you.</v>

1285
00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:48.670
<v Speaker 7>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't know how deep my understanding</v>

1286
00:58:48.671 --> 00:58:53.671
<v Speaker 7>is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to assume that just make this </v>

1287
00:58:53.671 --> 00:58:53.671
<v Speaker 7>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1288
00:58:53.671 --> 00:58:56.580
<v Speaker 7>but I've looked into it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What I assume you don't know who was </v>

1289
00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:56.580
<v Speaker 7>trying to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I assume you weren't there.</v>

1290
00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:58.530
<v Speaker 7>I assume that you don't know it as a </v>
<v Speaker 7>fact.</v>

1291
00:58:58.531 --> 00:59:03.531
<v Speaker 7>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Trust me that I looked into it and you </v>

1292
00:59:03.531 --> 00:59:03.531
<v Speaker 7>wear the shoe you have,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

1293
00:59:03.531 --> 00:59:03.531
<v Speaker 7>I sure you have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just,</v>

1294
00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:07.090
<v Speaker 7>it just me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel very sensitive about that stuff.</v>

1295
00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:07.640
<v Speaker 7>I get.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1296
00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:09.040
<v Speaker 7>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I totally get it.</v>

1297
00:59:09.041 --> 00:59:12.220
<v Speaker 7>Let's change the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's get into the UFC.</v>

1298
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:13.820
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Damien Maia,</v>

1299
00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.310
<v Speaker 7>can we turn the tie?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Rod Woodley,</v>

1300
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:18.000
<v Speaker 7>Tyron,</v>
<v Speaker 7>tyron tie rod,</v>

1301
00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:19.570
<v Speaker 7>Tyron,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tyron,</v>

1302
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.550
<v Speaker 7>tyron Woodley.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1303
00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:21.700
<v Speaker 7>That</v>

1304
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:27.230
<v Speaker 3>people thought that was a boring match,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for me there were tremendous data in</v>

1305
00:59:27.771 --> 00:59:31.550
<v Speaker 3>mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact like Damon goes down to one 70,</v>

1306
00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:36.740
<v Speaker 3>one 70 takes everybody down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's taking college wrestlers down left </v>

1307
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:38.920
<v Speaker 3>and right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but could he take down tyronn?</v>

1308
00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:42.560
<v Speaker 3>I thought I probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was that he was gonna hit</v>

1309
00:59:42.561 --> 00:59:44.270
<v Speaker 3>a wall there and he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to take that?</v>

1310
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Do down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be very,</v>

1311
00:59:45.801 --> 00:59:47.870
<v Speaker 3>very hard to take him down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we learned.</v>

1312
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.490
<v Speaker 3>What I learned from that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1313
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:54.640
<v Speaker 3>you got to get really good at shooting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and doing what Paul was an expert.</v>

1314
00:59:55.820 --> 01:00:00.820
<v Speaker 3>Paul says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the best ever I've ever seen an MMA </v>

1315
01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:01.730
<v Speaker 3>at making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulling guard option one,</v>

1316
01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:04.700
<v Speaker 3>you just made it like not option three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about the third option.</v>

1317
01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:08.150
<v Speaker 3>I would want my fighter to have the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>standup possible,</v>

1318
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.890
<v Speaker 3>the best takedowns possible.</v>

1319
01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:12.650
<v Speaker 3>Get on top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grounded pound and submit them.</v>

1320
01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.570
<v Speaker 3>Beat them on the feet of your beat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on beating them,</v>

1321
01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:18.500
<v Speaker 3>but if you're getting beat on the feet </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can't take the guy down,</v>

1322
01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:20.330
<v Speaker 3>you better know how to pull guard you </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotta.</v>

1323
01:00:20.331 --> 01:00:23.300
<v Speaker 3>You gotta know how to drag dudes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unorthodox ways,</v>

1324
01:00:23.301 --> 01:00:24.710
<v Speaker 3>not just the regular wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1325
01:00:24.711 --> 01:00:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Because you're going to hit tie Rod </v>
<v Speaker 3>Woodley,</v>

1326
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:28.010
<v Speaker 3>you gotta throw some flying in an artist</v>
<v Speaker 3>on him.</v>

1327
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:33.160
<v Speaker 3>You got to shoot deep enough just to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>a slight clench and have something </v>

1328
01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:33.160
<v Speaker 3>you're going to jump on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not with you,</v>

1329
01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.820
<v Speaker 3>not continue with the traditional </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling.</v>

1330
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.770
<v Speaker 3>You gotta shoot pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half guard,</v>

1331
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.100
<v Speaker 3>just like Andre Galvao did he when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>fought mma a few times,</v>

1332
01:00:40.101 --> 01:00:41.930
<v Speaker 3>that's all he did is shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

1333
01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:43.560
<v Speaker 3>sprawled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just pulled half guard below me.</v>

1334
01:00:43.561 --> 01:00:45.200
<v Speaker 3>Got Up double under hooks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got the bag.</v>

1335
01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:49.340
<v Speaker 3>You got to get creative the way Nogueira</v>
<v Speaker 3>be 10 Sylvia,</v>

1336
01:00:49.341 --> 01:00:50.480
<v Speaker 3>way back in the day.</v>

1337
01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.600
<v Speaker 3>Ten Sylvia could not get taken down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too tall,</v>

1338
01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.160
<v Speaker 3>Yada awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reach.</v>

1339
01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:58.010
<v Speaker 3>Nogueira was getting clipped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It couldn't take down.</v>

1340
01:00:58.011 --> 01:00:58.540
<v Speaker 3>Tim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sylvia,</v>

1341
01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:00.500
<v Speaker 3>what did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He shot the best he could.</v>

1342
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:04.580
<v Speaker 3>And when Tim Silvia countered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he pulled half guard.</v>

1343
01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:05.650
<v Speaker 3>He ended up in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1344
01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:06.040
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1345
01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.760
<v Speaker 3>in Deepak and boom with the momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got up,</v>

1346
01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:11.900
<v Speaker 3>swept him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was an indirect,</v>

1347
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:15.410
<v Speaker 3>unorthodox take is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you shoot pool guard and then sweep,</v>

1348
01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.480
<v Speaker 3>that's the take down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You end up in the same place.</v>

1349
01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.010
<v Speaker 3>So he went around the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1350
01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:21.170
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wall,</v>

1351
01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:25.250
<v Speaker 3>and he ended up guillotine him put a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guillotine from the top.</v>

1352
01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.480
<v Speaker 3>You got to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to.</v>

1353
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:30.560
<v Speaker 3>And you know when he was pulling guard </v>
<v Speaker 3>before Damien,</v>

1354
01:01:30.561 --> 01:01:35.561
<v Speaker 3>Maia did pull guard before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early in his career and he just wasn't </v>

1355
01:01:35.561 --> 01:01:36.500
<v Speaker 3>having it and he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't an option.</v>

1356
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:37.700
<v Speaker 3>Tyrons takedown defense.</v>

1357
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.400
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the take down defense.</v>

1358
01:01:40.401 --> 01:01:41.600
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the last option.</v>

1359
01:01:41.601 --> 01:01:46.601
<v Speaker 3>But this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about traditional </v>

1360
01:01:46.601 --> 01:01:48.551
<v Speaker 3>takedowns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about the art of watch Paul </v>

1361
01:01:48.551 --> 01:01:48.551
<v Speaker 3>Sas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would totally,</v>

1362
01:01:48.551 --> 01:01:52.730
<v Speaker 3>there's a time you can't just sit on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your butt and I think after talking to </v>

1363
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:55.720
<v Speaker 3>take with a guy like tyron woodley is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to get a wrestler </v>

1364
01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.751
<v Speaker 3>who's like an elite high caliber </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestler that's going to be able to </v>

1365
01:01:58.751 --> 01:02:02.651
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to take him down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think like a regular dude like </v>

1366
01:02:02.651 --> 01:02:04.280
<v Speaker 3>Damien Maia who's not a regular dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a world class grappler,</v>

1367
01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:06.970
<v Speaker 3>but just here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dominick Cruz is criticism of his,</v>

1368
01:02:06.971 --> 01:02:11.971
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his takedown temps that he wasn't </v>

1369
01:02:11.971 --> 01:02:11.971
<v Speaker 3>following through enough and what he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying technically was wrong.</v>

1370
01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1371
01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:18.850
<v Speaker 3>I think that if it was a real world </v>
<v Speaker 3>class grappler for a real,</v>

1372
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>top of the</v>

1373
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:24.980
<v Speaker 1>food chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amateur wrestling had one taken </v>

1374
01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>everybody down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is like the best wrestler.</v>

1375
01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>What he said about the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of Damien Maia take downs,</v>

1376
01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them anyways are against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fence.</v>

1377
01:02:32.191 --> 01:02:37.191
<v Speaker 1>He's really good at going double under </v>
<v Speaker 1>hooks and doing some inside trips or </v>

1378
01:02:37.191 --> 01:02:38.900
<v Speaker 1>outside trips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyron,</v>

1379
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:39.670
<v Speaker 1>defendant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that shit.</v>

1380
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else tyron did?</v>

1381
01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>He clipped him with a huge uppercut and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the very first exchange,</v>

1382
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>the very first time Damien tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>close the distance,</v>

1383
01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>tyron hit him with a vicious uppercut </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he fucked his left eye up.</v>

1384
01:02:50.011 --> 01:02:55.011
<v Speaker 1>Damien's left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fucked up from the very first </v>

1385
01:02:55.011 --> 01:02:57.141
<v Speaker 1>exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Damien shot low tire and hit him </v>

1386
01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>with a heart uppercut and just as his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I immediately swell up and it was fucked</v>

1387
01:02:58.921 --> 01:03:03.921
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that that played a factor </v>

1388
01:03:03.921 --> 01:03:03.921
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1389
01:03:03.921 --> 01:03:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Just tyrons game plan was in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's eyes,</v>

1390
01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:11.990
<v Speaker 1>wasn't fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the problem and like Dana felt </v>

1391
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:13.770
<v Speaker 1>like he should have finished them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And tyron his thought was,</v>

1392
01:03:13.771 --> 01:03:15.000
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is this guy's.</v>

1393
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:20.250
<v Speaker 1>It's his goal is to win the title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to come and try to beat me.</v>

1394
01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.590
<v Speaker 1>And when the title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm beating you,</v>

1395
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:27.950
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't I just keep doing what I'm </v>

1396
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.950
<v Speaker 1>doing and continue winning the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do anything,</v>

1397
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:29.670
<v Speaker 1>but if I changed tactics and make myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>more vulnerable.</v>

1398
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:35.030
<v Speaker 1>And he said he did get hit by a lefthand</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a couple left hands and that the </v>

1399
01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:35.030
<v Speaker 1>stunned them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess his attitude was,</v>

1400
01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:36.780
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this guy wants to win that title,</v>

1401
01:03:36.781 --> 01:03:38.520
<v Speaker 1>he's gotTa come and get it and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes get it.</v>

1402
01:03:38.521 --> 01:03:40.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to knock him the fuck out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if he doesn't come and get it,</v>

1403
01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:42.240
<v Speaker 1>why would I?</v>

1404
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Why would I go after him and put myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of position?</v>

1405
01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.220
<v Speaker 1>I would coach Woodley the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 1>lane.</v>

1406
01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.770
<v Speaker 1>I would be yelling from the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just keep doing what you're doing.</v>

1407
01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Don't one fucked up exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a shot in and take some trips.</v>

1408
01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tries to get up on his knees,</v>

1409
01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.130
<v Speaker 1>jumps on his back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that little scramble.</v>

1410
01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.320
<v Speaker 1>One little scramble like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

1411
01:04:01.321 --> 01:04:06.321
<v Speaker 1>you just fucked your whole shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damien is not the best punch her in the </v>

1412
01:04:06.321 --> 01:04:06.780
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not the worst either.</v>

1413
01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:10.500
<v Speaker 1>He can fuck you up if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make a mistake and if you rush in</v>

1414
01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:15.501
<v Speaker 1>and maybe he's reserved more energy than</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think he has and he fires a very </v>

1415
01:04:15.501 --> 01:04:16.470
<v Speaker 1>fast rate lefthand and catches you on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chin.</v>

1416
01:04:16.471 --> 01:04:18.630
<v Speaker 1>He could fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can fuck anybody up.</v>

1417
01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.700
<v Speaker 1>He's not incompetent on the feet.</v>

1418
01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:22.980
<v Speaker 1>He's just not at the same level as </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyron.</v>

1419
01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:24.750
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have the same movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tire.</v>

1420
01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Damien should would have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damien had kicks a more like maybe not </v>

1421
01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:34.821
<v Speaker 1>exactly like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more in the vein of Edson Barboza </v>

1422
01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Rodriguez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that be a whole nother </v>

1423
01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:40.460
<v Speaker 1>dimension?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blake doesn't even have to be like that.</v>

1424
01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:41.280
<v Speaker 1>How about just like Pedro his Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just attack the legs.</v>

1425
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Just make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the legs.</v>

1426
01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:45.300
<v Speaker 1>He's not doing that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very little boxing.</v>

1427
01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominick brought it up one time during </v>

1428
01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:50.450
<v Speaker 1>the broadcast because he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see Damien throw high kick,</v>

1429
01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:51.030
<v Speaker 1>a left high kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1430
01:04:51.031 --> 01:04:51.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I go,</v>

1431
01:04:51.661 --> 01:04:53.820
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen Damian throw a left </v>
<v Speaker 1>high kick?</v>

1432
01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.150
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1433
01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either.</v>

1434
01:04:56.821 --> 01:04:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's ever done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1435
01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:03.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disagreeing with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying I don't think I've ever </v>

1436
01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:03.360
<v Speaker 1>seen him try it.</v>

1437
01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Like he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's such a specialist and his </v>

1438
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:07.400
<v Speaker 1>specialty is just get you to the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>strangling.</v>

1439
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:09.630
<v Speaker 1>He should spend grounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would suggest.</v>

1440
01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:10.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ain't shit,</v>

1441
01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:15.420
<v Speaker 1>but I would like to see Damien Maia with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some with a adding to his arsenal,</v>

1442
01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:17.950
<v Speaker 1>adding kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adding more whiteboards like why not for</v>

1443
01:05:17.951 --> 01:05:19.720
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if he did,</v>

1444
01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:25.080
<v Speaker 1>the problem is it's like tyron is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>so fucking strong and so good at stuff </v>

1445
01:05:25.951 --> 01:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>and takedowns any hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so God damn hard.</v>

1446
01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like you'd have to be like on him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you got to figure out how to </v>

1447
01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:37.081
<v Speaker 1>actually get him to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have full control of him and good luck </v>

1448
01:05:37.081 --> 01:05:37.081
<v Speaker 1>with all that.</v>

1449
01:05:37.081 --> 01:05:39.440
<v Speaker 5>Remember Nogueira versus Mark Coleman?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1450
01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:44.490
<v Speaker 5>That that Mark Coleman was planning on </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to the ground with a Nogueira at </v>

1451
01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:46.010
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was at the height of pride.</v>

1452
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:51.470
<v Speaker 5>Mark Coleman's plan was to box with him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>use his wrestling to not go to the </v>

1453
01:05:52.371 --> 01:05:55.820
<v Speaker 5>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the plan the whole way through.</v>

1454
01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:59.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to box this Nogueira guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got an amazing guard,</v>

1455
01:05:59.450 --> 01:06:01.910
<v Speaker 5>amazing Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he ain't going to take me down.</v>

1456
01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.340
<v Speaker 5>I fucking wrestled the Columbus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>

1457
01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:05.960
<v Speaker 5>Didn't know Garrett.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take them down.</v>

1458
01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:08.090
<v Speaker 5>Fuck no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he didn't know what he did.</v>

1459
01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.990
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who can throw high kicks in,</v>

1460
01:06:11.991 --> 01:06:16.991
<v Speaker 5>a lot of head kicks usually don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're afraid of going to the </v>

1461
01:06:16.991 --> 01:06:16.991
<v Speaker 5>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the guys that could do that,</v>

1462
01:06:16.991 --> 01:06:21.281
<v Speaker 5>but guys that want to be on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 5>and don't mind being on their back and </v>

1463
01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:24.821
<v Speaker 5>are dangerous off the back and are known</v>
<v Speaker 5>for having a dangerous guard like </v>

1464
01:06:24.821 --> 01:06:25.520
<v Speaker 5>Nogueira.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could throw all the high kicks they</v>

1465
01:06:25.521 --> 01:06:27.710
<v Speaker 5>want and that's exactly what know Kara </v>
<v Speaker 5>did.</v>

1466
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:30.050
<v Speaker 5>He started throwing high kicks whizzing </v>
<v Speaker 5>by,</v>

1467
01:06:30.051 --> 01:06:34.400
<v Speaker 5>Mr Coleman's had and then one just </v>
<v Speaker 5>barely nipped his forehead.</v>

1468
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:36.880
<v Speaker 5>So Mark Coleman just snapped into </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrestling,</v>

1469
01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:38.990
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck these baseball bats.</v>

1470
01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:41.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to ground and pound this </v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker.</v>

1471
01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:44.540
<v Speaker 5>Take my chances in his garden.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He took him down.</v>

1472
01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:45.590
<v Speaker 5>He got triangle.</v>

1473
01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the glory days of Jujitsu.</v>

1474
01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a triangle arm bar.</v>

1475
01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:56.310
<v Speaker 1>And that you were out to exactly how I </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt back then.</v>

1476
01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how we got to fight to the </v>

1477
01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:04.341
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's by throwing head kicks and scaring </v>

1478
01:07:04.341 --> 01:07:05.020
<v Speaker 1>the motherfucker wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1479
01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:06.570
<v Speaker 1>cowboy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to do that a lot.</v>

1480
01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Cowboy has a nasty guard and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why guard is,</v>

1481
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the reasons why so loose </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his kicks,</v>

1482
01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.060
<v Speaker 1>because he doesn't mind if you take them</v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

1483

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the way the arms are </v>

1562
01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:38.140
<v Speaker 1>folding up here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1563
01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:38.140
<v Speaker 1>that's not a goon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1564
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:41.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a front naked truck yet is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1565
01:10:41.901 --> 01:10:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all like real leverage.</v>

1566
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:48.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you could tell if a guy goon </v>

1567
01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:49.670
<v Speaker 1>somebody just crushing their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good squeeze right there.</v>

1568
01:10:49.671 --> 01:10:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

1569
01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.780
<v Speaker 1>it's fitting in like a like keys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1570
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fitting in there perfectly.</v>

1571
01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Your squeeze has to be super high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get it to choke someone while being </v>

1572
01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:00.830
<v Speaker 1>mounted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh good Lord.</v>

1573
01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people have that?</v>

1574
01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:08.660
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tyron woodley thing is very tricky </v>

1575
01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:11.621
<v Speaker 1>because in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I see that he wanted to win the </v>

1576
01:11:11.621 --> 01:11:13.560
<v Speaker 1>fight period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the best way to win the fight.</v>

1577
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:18.830
<v Speaker 1>If this guy is only offering a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of offense and you could stuff </v>

1578
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:20.520
<v Speaker 1>that offense and land your shots and </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to pile up points,</v>

1579
01:11:20.521 --> 01:11:23.010
<v Speaker 1>which he did and don't ever put yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>at risk.</v>

1580
01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:28.280
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also get the Dana white point of </v>

1581
01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:28.280
<v Speaker 1>view where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to sell tickets.</v>

1582
01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Like people are paying to see you fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if people are holding up cell phones</v>

1583
01:11:31.471 --> 01:11:33.180
<v Speaker 1>and swinging them through the rafters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1584
01:11:33.181 --> 01:11:35.760
<v Speaker 1>because everybody's bored because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to watch it anymore.</v>

1585
01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:37.580
<v Speaker 1>And his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his thought is like,</v>

1586
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:39.150
<v Speaker 1>you got to sell tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1587
01:11:39.151 --> 01:11:42.360
<v Speaker 1>who's the greatest take down artists in </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC history?</v>

1588
01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:44.940
<v Speaker 1>George St Pierre to her same po versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>Woodley.</v>

1589
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Woodley apparently because of this </v>

1590
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:54.921
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about GSP versus </v>

1591
01:11:54.921 --> 01:11:54.921
<v Speaker 1>bisping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1592
01:11:54.921 --> 01:11:55.210
<v Speaker 1>they got to go to woodland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1593
01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the only guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If GSP just take woodley down,</v>

1594
01:11:57.631 --> 01:11:59.640
<v Speaker 1>nobody can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what if they just tried to take each</v>

1595
01:11:59.641 --> 01:12:04.641
<v Speaker 1>other down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth and everybody went crazy </v>

1596
01:12:04.641 --> 01:12:04.641
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took him down repeatedly.</v>

1597
01:12:04.641 --> 01:12:06.720
<v Speaker 1>If he didn't like he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be great too.</v>

1598
01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.310
<v Speaker 1>But what if he did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

1599
01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:11.920
<v Speaker 1>I want to see the fight because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

1600
01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:15.780
<v Speaker 1>because Woodley has a style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't like it,</v>

1601
01:12:15.781 --> 01:12:18.360
<v Speaker 1>some people like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people appreciate it or whatever.</v>

1602
01:12:18.361 --> 01:12:22.320
<v Speaker 1>But the only guy that has a shot to beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woodley,</v>

1603
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:27.030
<v Speaker 1>the only guy would be the best takedown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>best mma takedown artists of all time.</v>

1604
01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.490
<v Speaker 1>He has like a million takedowns in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>

1605
01:12:29.730 --> 01:12:32.370
<v Speaker 1>He's the only guy that would be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If GSP can do it,</v>

1606
01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:36.870
<v Speaker 1>no one can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also very good striker.</v>

1607
01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.530
<v Speaker 1>I think kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what you'd have GSP saying.</v>

1608
01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:42.330
<v Speaker 1>You got to go to the pro wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>angle.</v>

1609
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:47.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am tired of sitting at home watching </v>

1610
01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:50.721
<v Speaker 1>boring fights as bad gsp impression on </v>
<v Speaker 1>him saying like,</v>

1611
01:12:50.941 --> 01:12:52.480
<v Speaker 1>enough already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want my sound.</v>

1612
01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.640
<v Speaker 1>It sound like Arnold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenny made ivs.</v>

1613
01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1614
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Bisping's at one 95.</v>

1615
01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:01.110
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he saying,</v>

1616
01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:02.760
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be too hard to make one 70</v>

1617
01:13:02.761 --> 01:13:07.761
<v Speaker 1>without the ivs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was willing to fight either </v>

1618
01:13:07.761 --> 01:13:09.831
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was willing to do one 70 or </v>

1619
01:13:09.831 --> 01:13:09.831
<v Speaker 1>one add woodley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GSP would be huge.</v>

1620
01:13:09.831 --> 01:13:11.720
<v Speaker 1>That would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the biggest fight for.</v>

1621
01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not impressed with because who else </v>
<v Speaker 1>is there at one 70 that has a chance of </v>

1622
01:13:18.601 --> 01:13:19.680
<v Speaker 1>taking him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1623
01:13:19.681 --> 01:13:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Robbie lawler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since he just won,</v>

1624
01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:24.070
<v Speaker 1>you would have to look at Robbie's </v>
<v Speaker 1>contenders,</v>

1625
01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:29.180
<v Speaker 1>so he would just brawl with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's willing to brawl with them if you </v>

1626
01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:30.640
<v Speaker 1>can avoid the big bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he got hit with in the first fight,</v>

1627
01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:36.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you gotta think Robbie lawler is </v>

1628
01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:37.410
<v Speaker 1>coming off of five round war with Rory </v>
<v Speaker 1>Macdonald,</v>

1629
01:13:37.411 --> 01:13:42.411
<v Speaker 1>five round war with Carlos Condit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>war with Johny Hendricks war war,</v>

1630
01:13:43.171 --> 01:13:44.010
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

1631
01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.000
<v Speaker 1>It's all war.</v>

1632
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Every fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in his war.</v>

1633
01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:52.490
<v Speaker 1>So like I think the him having a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>off was giant and then he fought cowboy </v>

1634
01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:55.380
<v Speaker 1>and towards the end he was coming after </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowboy.</v>

1635
01:13:55.381 --> 01:13:58.710
<v Speaker 1>He was hurting cowboy to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit Cabo with some big shots.</v>

1636
01:13:58.711 --> 01:14:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I felt like a lot of people disagree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that decision,</v>

1637
01:14:01.111 --> 01:14:06.111
<v Speaker 1>but I felt like I give Robbie the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>round because he jumped all over cowboy </v>

1638
01:14:06.111 --> 01:14:07.860
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was enough to win the round,</v>

1639
01:14:07.861 --> 01:14:11.040
<v Speaker 1>although I think Cabo is getting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>better of the exchanges,</v>

1640
01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:16.290
<v Speaker 1>the NFL silting the volume of and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the impact when to Robbie second </v>

1641
01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:16.870
<v Speaker 1>round when to cowboy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty big.</v>

1642
01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:20.620
<v Speaker 1>But then Robbie rallied and the third </v>
<v Speaker 1>round and I think he dominated the third</v>

1643
01:14:20.621 --> 01:14:22.570
<v Speaker 1>round and I think you hurt cowboy a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

1644
01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that would have been an amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>five round fight.</v>

1645
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:27.430
<v Speaker 1>That would have been an incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember who won the fight?</v>

1646
01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Robbie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One very close decision.</v>

1647
01:14:29.321 --> 01:14:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a split decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1648
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:35.290
<v Speaker 1>My grade five bring a scrambled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a great fight.</v>

1649
01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.970
<v Speaker 1>It was a great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both gave.</v>

1650
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Both took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1651
01:14:38.021 --> 01:14:39.460
<v Speaker 1>it was war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was chaos,</v>

1652
01:14:39.690 --> 01:14:44.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in cowboy definitely caught them </v>

1653
01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:44.690
<v Speaker 1>with some clean shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit him some real good.</v>

1654
01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The body as well.</v>

1655
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Cowboy landed a lot of great shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1656
01:14:47.531 --> 01:14:52.531
<v Speaker 1>Robbie looked like Robbie again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked like the Robbie lawler that </v>

1657
01:14:52.531 --> 01:14:52.531
<v Speaker 1>won the title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a killer.</v>

1658
01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:57.570
<v Speaker 1>He looked like the same spooky dude that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just keeps coming after you until he </v>

1659
01:14:57.570 --> 01:15:00.871
<v Speaker 1>puts you away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he looked like in the third </v>

1660
01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:00.871
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third round,</v>

1661
01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:01.630
<v Speaker 1>particular really looked like he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling back into the old groove again.</v>

1662
01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.070
<v Speaker 1>So there's him.</v>

1663
01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:05.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1664
01:15:05.410 --> 01:15:10.410
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeing Rory Macdonald over in beltour </v>

1665
01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:11.080
<v Speaker 1>looking better than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking better than ever.</v>

1666
01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.730
<v Speaker 1>When he took down Paul daily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he,</v>

1667
01:15:13.731 --> 01:15:16.090
<v Speaker 1>he cracked Paul on the feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get hit with shit.</v>

1668
01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Took Paul down and strangled the shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of him.</v>

1669
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:19.910
<v Speaker 1>And the way he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch it,</v>

1670
01:15:19.911 --> 01:15:20.770
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1671
01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Like Rory Macdonald might be the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>welterweight on the planet.</v>

1672
01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Like he might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might write,</v>

1673
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:26.290
<v Speaker 1>be there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1674
01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:28.180
<v Speaker 1>you've got to remember he beat Tyron </v>
<v Speaker 1>Woodley.</v>

1675
01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Remember that fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

1676
01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Roy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut him down.</v>

1677
01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Shut down that big overhand right </v>
<v Speaker 1>compressed against the cage.</v>

1678
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if I had a gas.</v>

1679
01:15:37.481 --> 01:15:42.481
<v Speaker 1>Two Thousand 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he fought tyron woodley before </v>

1680
01:15:42.481 --> 01:15:46.021
<v Speaker 1>he fought Robbie lawler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was one of those elimination </v>

1681
01:15:46.021 --> 01:15:46.021
<v Speaker 1>was that was a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1682
01:15:46.021 --> 01:15:50.521
<v Speaker 1>it'd be really by decision and the also </v>
<v Speaker 1>be Damien Maia and he survived being </v>

1683
01:15:50.521 --> 01:15:50.680
<v Speaker 1>mounted by Damien mine in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>

1684
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Damien took him down mouth to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He defended and then he fucked Damien up</v>

1685
01:15:54.521 --> 01:15:58.210
<v Speaker 1>and the second and third rounds and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>still peaking duties like 26.</v>

1686
01:15:58.810 --> 01:16:00.910
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the best in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without a doubt.</v>

1687
01:16:00.911 --> 01:16:03.150
<v Speaker 1>He might be the best without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:05.210
<v Speaker 1>It bums me out seeing him over at Bella </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tor.</v>

1689
01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:09.130
<v Speaker 1>I think that kid is sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Kelvin coming back down to one 70?</v>

1690
01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.520
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he can make it for sure.</v>

1691
01:16:12.521 --> 01:16:15.250
<v Speaker 1>I think if Calvin had the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline that Chris Weidman has to get</v>

1692
01:16:15.251 --> 01:16:18.160
<v Speaker 1>down to 85.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Weidman's a huge guy.</v>

1693
01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:22.060
<v Speaker 1>He has to have real discipline to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>that 185 pound limit.</v>

1694
01:16:22.061 --> 01:16:24.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean he has to really watch his </v>
<v Speaker 1>calories because you walk around it.</v>

1695
01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know it's well north of </v>
<v Speaker 1>200 pounds,</v>

1696
01:16:27.881 --> 01:16:29.470
<v Speaker 1>so he's a big guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1697
01:16:29.471 --> 01:16:32.590
<v Speaker 1>according to Ray Longo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt Serra that like Chris is on the big</v>

1698
01:16:32.591 --> 01:16:37.591
<v Speaker 1>side of 85,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he could easily be on the small </v>

1699
01:16:37.591 --> 01:16:37.690
<v Speaker 1>side of 205,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1700
01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:39.550
<v Speaker 1>And then do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about these new weight</v>

1701
01:16:39.551 --> 01:16:41.350
<v Speaker 1>class?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like the athletic commissions.</v>

1702
01:16:41.351 --> 01:16:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to add 65,</v>

1703
01:16:43.661 --> 01:16:48.661
<v Speaker 1>75,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95 and I think to 20 to 25 to the UFC </v>

1704
01:16:48.671 --> 01:16:53.671
<v Speaker 1>going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the use is going to do </v>

1705
01:16:53.671 --> 01:16:53.671
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they should.</v>

1706
01:16:53.671 --> 01:16:54.520
<v Speaker 1>I think they should go every 10 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not every five pounds,</v>

1707
01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:56.950
<v Speaker 1>but every 10 pounds like it the way it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1708
01:16:57.010 --> 01:16:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like it just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense every.</v>

1709
01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:03.230
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't need to or something.</v>

1710
01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:05.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

1711
01:17:05.501 --> 01:17:08.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind the big jumps really find </v>
<v Speaker 1>your spot.</v>

1712
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.800
<v Speaker 1>We don't need more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll just be.</v>

1713
01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.030
<v Speaker 1>It'll just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1714
01:17:11.031 --> 01:17:13.370
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you keep it the way it is,</v>

1715
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:15.650
<v Speaker 1>but who knows what they're going to do?</v>

1716
01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we need more weight classes.</v>

1717
01:17:18.351 --> 01:17:22.790
<v Speaker 1>I think there's two big jumps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the jump of like one 85 to two.</v>

1718
01:17:22.791 --> 01:17:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>

1719
01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:26.180
<v Speaker 1>As a 20 pound jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's huge.</v>

1720
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:28.760
<v Speaker 1>The difference between a guy who's 85 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guy was two,</v>

1721
01:17:28.761 --> 01:17:30.080
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five is significant.</v>

1722
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:32.860
<v Speaker 1>The amount of power that guy has over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 85 pounders.</v>

1723
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to spot 55.</v>

1724
01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:40.210
<v Speaker 1>It's too many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too many tweeners like Diego </v>

1725
01:17:40.210 --> 01:17:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Sanchez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diego Sanchez is probably a 65 or you </v>

1726
01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:42.970
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little too small for 70.</v>

1727
01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe too big for 55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a few of those guys.</v>

1728
01:17:44.571 --> 01:17:46.280
<v Speaker 1>He's gotten down to 45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1729
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Not good though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean not.</v>

1730
01:17:48.370 --> 01:17:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Not fought like to Diego Sanchez of old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1731
01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it should sustain them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 55 is spot.</v>

1732
01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hard for him to even make </v>

1733
01:17:58.380 --> 01:17:58.380
<v Speaker 1>that though.</v>

1734
01:17:58.380 --> 01:17:58.700
<v Speaker 1>If you could let them fight at 65,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd have all his energy.</v>

1735
01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.770
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like get.</v>

1736
01:18:00.771 --> 01:18:03.680
<v Speaker 1>It totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fighting,</v>

1737
01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:04.850
<v Speaker 1>it's just fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1738
01:18:04.851 --> 01:18:07.190
<v Speaker 1>let's not diluted we got enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need more.</v>

1739
01:18:07.191 --> 01:18:12.191
<v Speaker 1>We don't have everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't have to be like just all </v>

1740
01:18:12.191 --> 01:18:12.191
<v Speaker 1>systematically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair.</v>

1741
01:18:12.191 --> 01:18:12.191
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think that's the case.</v>

1742
01:18:12.191 --> 01:18:16.661
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we have enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we get a room for more </v>

1743
01:18:16.661 --> 01:18:16.661
<v Speaker 1>champions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we'd have more super fights.</v>

1744
01:18:16.661 --> 01:18:21.580
<v Speaker 1>We'd have more guys rise to the top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the division and it will be easier to </v>

1745
01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:22.310
<v Speaker 1>match them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way easier to match up a 75 with an</v>

1746
01:18:22.311 --> 01:18:26.660
<v Speaker 1>85 than it is to match up a 70 with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>85 or 55 with an 85.</v>

1747
01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.680
<v Speaker 1>It's just like the gaps are too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have too much already.</v>

1748
01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:33.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hard to keep track of shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it is.</v>

1749
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's an argument for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1750
01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:38.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it though.</v>

1751
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:41.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it gives people more options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think heavyweights,</v>

1752
01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:43.400
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives them more options.</v>

1753
01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:45.500
<v Speaker 1>I would also like to see a super </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight division.</v>

1754
01:18:45.501 --> 01:18:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see a full on freak </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1755
01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I want to see the mountain from game of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrones.</v>

1756
01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.140
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that guy learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1757
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:56.530
<v Speaker 1>He's like 330 fucking pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that guy that picks up those </v>

1758
01:18:56.530 --> 01:18:57.410
<v Speaker 1>stone balls and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I'm talking about?</v>

1759
01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Carries cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those dudes.</v>

01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:01.520
<v Speaker 1>How big is he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1766
01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.410
<v Speaker 1>He's got a beard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like one of those Iceland guys,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's six foot nine.</v>

1805

<v Speaker 7>he's like staring him down like he's </v>

1939
01:27:08.381 --> 01:27:08.381
<v Speaker 7>still ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>

1940
01:27:08.381 --> 01:27:11.030
<v Speaker 7>Roberto Duran was a wild motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 7>back.</v>

1941
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:16.060
<v Speaker 7>You mentioned if after Michael Mike </v>
<v Speaker 7>Tyson knocked out Michael spinks.</v>

1942
01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:18.800
<v Speaker 7>Then when they get in the post binding </v>
<v Speaker 7>or interview,</v>

1943
01:27:18.810 --> 01:27:20.030
<v Speaker 7>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll eat his children.</v>

1944
01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.460
<v Speaker 7>I can't imagine him saying that after </v>
<v Speaker 7>the fight people will go,</v>

1945
01:27:22.461 --> 01:27:27.461
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck ways.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We have Michael spinks children at </v>

1946
01:27:27.461 --> 01:27:28.820
<v Speaker 7>finance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So this is,</v>

1947
01:27:28.821 --> 01:27:29.960
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the first fight.</v>

1948
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:34.250
<v Speaker 7>At the very end seconds he goes to shake</v>
<v Speaker 7>his hand.</v>

1949
01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:35.290
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck you.</v>

1950
01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:36.530
<v Speaker 7>So he comes near.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm looking at this,</v>

1951
01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.020
<v Speaker 7>what the Fuck Outta here?</v>
<v Speaker 7>He pushes them away.</v>

1952
01:27:39.021 --> 01:27:40.720
<v Speaker 7>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that was after the first fight.</v>

1953
01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.040
<v Speaker 7>After the fight was over,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he pushed him.</v>

1954
01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:43.760
<v Speaker 7>Riley's fucking screaming at him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>

1955
01:27:43.761 --> 01:27:46.220
<v Speaker 7>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1956
01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:51.020
<v Speaker 7>And when did he say that thing to sugar </v>
<v Speaker 7>ray's wife before for this fight?</v>

1957
01:27:51.021 --> 01:27:51.870
<v Speaker 7>For this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1958
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
<v Speaker 7>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He got into Ted.</v>

1959
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:54.860
<v Speaker 7>Did that to get in his head.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1960
01:27:54.861 --> 01:27:57.520
<v Speaker 7>well he was just that guy to the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Apparently there was a,</v>

1961
01:27:57.710 --> 01:28:01.700
<v Speaker 7>there was an article written where they </v>
<v Speaker 7>went to visit him and Panama and uh,</v>

1962
01:28:01.730 --> 01:28:05.870
<v Speaker 7>he took a cat and he picked it up by the</v>
<v Speaker 7>tail and smashed against a wall.</v>

1963
01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.070
<v Speaker 7>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1964
01:28:07.071 --> 01:28:12.071
<v Speaker 7>according to the movie it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He had moments where he got out of </v>

1965
01:28:12.071 --> 01:28:16.901
<v Speaker 7>control,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but generally it was a very good guy in </v>

1966
01:28:16.901 --> 01:28:16.901
<v Speaker 7>the movie.</v>

1967
01:28:16.901 --> 01:28:17.630
<v Speaker 7>Two movies are weird.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if they're true,</v>

1968
01:28:18.110 --> 01:28:20.200
<v Speaker 7>but apparently he did that too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've read the story.</v>

1969
01:28:20.210 --> 01:28:25.210
<v Speaker 7>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what the story might be </v>

1970
01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:25.210
<v Speaker 7>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm like,</v>

1971
01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:25.210
<v Speaker 7>if he was that crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1972
01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:27.680
<v Speaker 7>living on the streets in Panama,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like becoming a savage boxer.</v>

1973
01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:29.570
<v Speaker 7>He was so good too,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

1974
01:28:29.571 --> 01:28:34.571
<v Speaker 7>He was ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And when he beat up Davey Moore and </v>

1975
01:28:34.571 --> 01:28:38.051
<v Speaker 7>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you remember that David Morris was </v>

1976
01:28:38.051 --> 01:28:38.051
<v Speaker 7>thought to be the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like in everybody thought after no moss.</v>

1977
01:28:38.051 --> 01:28:41.120
<v Speaker 7>Roberto Duran was done.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they had this kid stud boxer,</v>

1978
01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:43.790
<v Speaker 7>David,</v>
<v Speaker 7>more world champion at 1:54,</v>

1979
01:28:43.791 --> 01:28:45.350
<v Speaker 7>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was after no months.</v>

1980
01:28:45.410 --> 01:28:47.600
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was the comeback fight.</v>

1981
01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:50.540
<v Speaker 7>Roberto Duran,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when he was really fully back,</v>

1982
01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:52.770
<v Speaker 7>he boxed up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>David Morgan stopped him,</v>

1983
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:57.790
<v Speaker 7>was a tremendous upset because David </v>
<v Speaker 7>Moore was a lot bigger than them to </v>

1984
01:28:57.790 --> 01:28:57.790
<v Speaker 7>white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1985
01:28:57.790 --> 01:28:59.510
<v Speaker 7>David was black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>David wound up getting killed,</v>

1986
01:28:59.690 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>working on a car fucked</v>

1987
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:07.160
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to fix his car and he </v>

1988
01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:07.160
<v Speaker 1>fucked up with the Jack and it crushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1989
01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:11.490
<v Speaker 1>They could be conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes or no and look into it.</v>

1990
01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1991
01:29:16.261 --> 01:29:18.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw the UFC this weekend.</v>

1992
01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you see where I fucked up and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed Daniel cormay after he had</v>

1993
01:29:21.451 --> 01:29:23.520
<v Speaker 1>been knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

1994
01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:26.500
<v Speaker 1>here's something that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think that somehow or another,</v>

1995
01:29:26.501 --> 01:29:28.860
<v Speaker 1>a doc told me not to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did it.</v>

1996
01:29:28.861 --> 01:29:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Nobody said anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a 100 percent my fuck up.</v>

1997
01:29:32.490 --> 01:29:37.490
<v Speaker 1>And it was also my idea in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>place to stop interviewing fighters </v>

1998
01:29:37.490 --> 01:29:39.880
<v Speaker 1>after they'd been knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was 100 percent my idea.</v>

1999
01:29:39.881 --> 01:29:42.000
<v Speaker 1>And how often did it happen before in </v>
<v Speaker 1>championship fights?</v>

2000
01:29:42.001 --> 01:29:43.020
<v Speaker 1>It happened often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2001
01:29:43.530 --> 01:29:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Almost always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether a guy got knocked out or Tko or </v>

2002
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:51.630
<v Speaker 1>submitted or last decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would interview the winter and I would</v>

2003
01:29:51.631 --> 01:29:53.610
<v Speaker 1>interview the loser every time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time,</v>

2004
01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:56.760
<v Speaker 1>unless they ran out of the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has happened before.</v>

2005
01:29:57.090 --> 01:30:02.090
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're just on running on instincts </v>

2006
01:30:02.090 --> 01:30:02.090
<v Speaker 1>and this is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2007
01:30:02.090 --> 01:30:06.540
<v Speaker 1>I was there for Gonzaga versus cro cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember Gonzaga head kick,</v>

2008
01:30:06.541 --> 01:30:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Cro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cop,</v>

2009
01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:12.440
<v Speaker 1>and just fucking into oblivion and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was bad and I interviewed Cro Cop </v>

2010
01:30:12.601 --> 01:30:16.110
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dude had no idea what I was talking</v>

2011
01:30:16.111 --> 01:30:16.770
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2012
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:19.890
<v Speaker 1>And I remember saying to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the production team at the time,</v>

2013
01:30:19.891 --> 01:30:20.370
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2014
01:30:20.371 --> 01:30:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should interview guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>after they get knocked out like that.</v>

2015
01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:27.500
<v Speaker 1>That was my nice my saying like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm.</v>

2016
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:33.030
<v Speaker 1>The one time it happened again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was with allister and after when </v>

2017
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:36.231
<v Speaker 1>Alistair overeem fuss deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mule chick and he remembered this </v>

2018
01:30:36.231 --> 01:30:36.420
<v Speaker 1>gating that didn't really happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remembered a steep,</v>

2019
01:30:36.421 --> 01:30:38.160
<v Speaker 1>a tapping rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't really happen.</v>

2020
01:30:38.610 --> 01:30:39.780
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this poor guy,</v>

2021
01:30:40.050 --> 01:30:45.050
<v Speaker 1>like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really has this memory in his head </v>

2022
01:30:45.050 --> 01:30:45.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's just not correct because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>just got knocked the fuck out.</v>

2023
01:30:46.110 --> 01:30:48.180
<v Speaker 1>He got knocked unconscious on </v>
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>

2024
01:30:48.181 --> 01:30:53.181
<v Speaker 1>like completely flat line and then a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes later I'm asking him to be </v>

2025
01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:53.181
<v Speaker 1>coherent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2026
01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was my idea to stop doing this and</v>

2027
01:30:57.241 --> 01:30:59.660
<v Speaker 1>the UFC agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like,</v>

2028
01:31:00.130 --> 01:31:05.130
<v Speaker 1>like they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to stop doing it and I viol </v>

2029
01:31:05.130 --> 01:31:06.870
<v Speaker 1>violated my own idea and I just did it </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

2030
01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:08.970
<v Speaker 1>This is what happened after the fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>was over.</v>

2031
01:31:08.971 --> 01:31:12.150
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight was crazy.</v>

2032
01:31:12.151 --> 01:31:17.151
<v Speaker 1>Shocking how violent the ending was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because John Really did fucking hate </v>

2033
01:31:18.121 --> 01:31:23.121
<v Speaker 1>Daniel and Daniel I think really did </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate John or at least had real anger.</v>

2034
01:31:23.401 --> 01:31:26.100
<v Speaker 1>There was real emotions with these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was insane.</v>

2035
01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:31.280
<v Speaker 1>It was intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When John landed that fucking head kick </v>

2036
01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:32.610
<v Speaker 1>and you saw him moving in for the kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he,</v>

2037
01:31:32.850 --> 01:31:37.850
<v Speaker 1>he stopped them right in front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got on top of him and just blasted </v>

2038
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:37.850
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2039
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:40.620
<v Speaker 1>It was like right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember looking over and I'm like,</v>

2040
01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just dropping del close real </v>

2041
01:31:45.650 --> 01:31:46.260
<v Speaker 1>close to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty close,</v>

2042
01:31:46.261 --> 01:31:51.261
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was like right off to </v>

2043
01:31:51.261 --> 01:31:52.110
<v Speaker 1>my right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I remember correctly.</v>

2044
01:31:52.190 --> 01:31:54.300
<v Speaker 1>You had a good look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a real good look at it.</v>

2045
01:31:54.570 --> 01:31:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously I'm cage side.</v>

2046
01:31:56.161 --> 01:31:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I got a good look at everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had a real good look at that.</v>

2047
01:31:58.891 --> 01:32:00.910
<v Speaker 1>It intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was intense and it was also.</v>

2048
01:32:00.911 --> 01:32:02.800
<v Speaker 1>I felt like there was a couple of shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many,</v>

2049
01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:05.320
<v Speaker 1>so I remember being stunned like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2050
01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of John Jones,</v>

2051
01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.860
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also a big fan of Daniel and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fan of both of them.</v>

2052
01:32:11.861 --> 01:32:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I know they don't like each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like both of them.</v>

2053
01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I liked them independently.</v>

2054
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:17.950
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't help the fact their enemies,</v>

2055
01:32:17.951 --> 01:32:20.620
<v Speaker 1>but I love hanging out with John and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>love hanging out with Danny.</v>

2056
01:32:20.621 --> 01:32:22.750
<v Speaker 1>I love doing commentary with Daniel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that guy.</v>

2057
01:32:23.290 --> 01:32:26.980
<v Speaker 1>So I would never do anything to make him</v>
<v Speaker 1>look bad.</v>

2058
01:32:27.190 --> 01:32:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I just got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in shock.</v>

2059
01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:34.560
<v Speaker 1>There was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was confused because he got knocked </v>

2060
01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:36.901
<v Speaker 1>out so he was confused that why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight was stopped and said he was mad </v>

2061
01:32:37.361 --> 01:32:42.361
<v Speaker 1>that they stopped the fight because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>just didn't understand because he just </v>

2062
01:32:42.361 --> 01:32:43.390
<v Speaker 1>been chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was arguing with big John.</v>

2063
01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:46.960
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hear the exact words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he was arguing with Dana.</v>

2064
01:32:47.410 --> 01:32:49.060
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hear the exact words that </v>
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>

2065
01:32:49.150 --> 01:32:54.150
<v Speaker 1>but Dana was in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you got to realize when a Kao like </v>

2066
01:32:54.150 --> 01:32:58.021
<v Speaker 1>that happens in a world championship </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and you're standing in the </v>

2067
01:32:58.021 --> 01:33:01.471
<v Speaker 1>octagon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're surrounded by all these people </v>

2068
01:33:01.471 --> 01:33:01.471
<v Speaker 1>screaming and cheering.</v>

2069
01:33:01.471 --> 01:33:05.460
<v Speaker 1>The fucking noise is so loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to figure out what the fuck is</v>

2070
01:33:05.831 --> 01:33:08.860
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I couldn't figure out what Daniel and</v>

2071
01:33:08.861 --> 01:33:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Dana were arguing about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Dane,</v>

2072
01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:12.550
<v Speaker 1>his whole head was red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

2073
01:33:12.610 --> 01:33:14.530
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fight was amazing.</v>

2074
01:33:14.531 --> 01:33:19.531
<v Speaker 1>He fought your heart out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I couldn't tell exactly what he </v>

2075
01:33:19.531 --> 01:33:19.531
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you'd hold your head up high.</v>

2076
01:33:19.531 --> 01:33:20.020
<v Speaker 1>It was a great fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff,</v>

2077
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:25.350
<v Speaker 1>but I think Daniel was still trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out why the fight was stopped </v>

2078
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:26.230
<v Speaker 1>because it just had happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd just woken up.</v>

2079
01:33:26.530 --> 01:33:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Then he realized he got head kicked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he was really sad and then he was </v>

2080
01:33:31.530 --> 01:33:34.861
<v Speaker 1>upset and I went to go talk to him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally as I'm going to talk to him,</v>

2081
01:33:36.431 --> 01:33:38.320
<v Speaker 1>he's turning to me and I have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>microphone.</v>

2082
01:33:38.321 --> 01:33:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I interviewing him?</v>

2083
01:33:39.821 --> 01:33:41.890
<v Speaker 1>After he got knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>

2084
01:33:42.130 --> 01:33:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't even realize what I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

2085
01:33:43.601 --> 01:33:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I was just in shock almost like I went </v>
<v Speaker 1>on instinct and I'm interviewing him.</v>

2086
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:49.990
<v Speaker 1>If I had a chance to stop and think I </v>
<v Speaker 1>should have been like,</v>

2087
01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:51.580
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been Kao don't do it.</v>

2088
01:33:51.730 --> 01:33:53.830
<v Speaker 1>So in the middle of me even talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

2089
01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I say I normally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to interview fighters after</v>

2090
01:33:56.921 --> 01:33:58.990
<v Speaker 1>they've been knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like I was stuck.</v>

2091
01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:04.080
<v Speaker 1>I was already there talking to him and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to leave and walk away from </v>

2092
01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:06.460
<v Speaker 1>them and I really do care about that guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great deal.</v>

2093
01:34:06.461 --> 01:34:09.910
<v Speaker 1>And I just watched him get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now watch him.</v>

2094
01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:12.770
<v Speaker 1>His heart's pouring out and he's crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2095
01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:15.580
<v Speaker 1>when he was realizing that he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked out and he lost the fight.</v>

2096
01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.790
<v Speaker 1>It was all awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2097
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.080
<v Speaker 1>so I put it a Po.</v>

2098
01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:22.030
<v Speaker 1>It was haunting me all night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2099
01:34:22.031 --> 01:34:25.210
<v Speaker 1>nobody had said anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody from the UFC got mad at me.</v>

2100
01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:28.000
<v Speaker 1>No one said anything to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was just me thinking,</v>

2101
01:34:28.001 --> 01:34:29.140
<v Speaker 1>why did I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2102
01:34:29.141 --> 01:34:34.141
<v Speaker 1>why did I interview him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have interviewed him even </v>

2103
01:34:34.141 --> 01:34:34.870
<v Speaker 1>though we used to do it for every fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2104
01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:39.220
<v Speaker 1>it was the right move to stop doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And ironically it was my idea.</v>

2105
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:41.380
<v Speaker 1>It was my move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if other guy.</v>

2106
01:34:41.381 --> 01:34:46.381
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if Brian standstill </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews guys after they've been </v>

2107
01:34:46.381 --> 01:34:46.381
<v Speaker 1>knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he does though,</v>

2108
01:34:46.381 --> 01:34:50.790
<v Speaker 1>because Brian Actually said thank you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me for that because he got interviewed </v>

2109
01:34:50.921 --> 01:34:54.370
<v Speaker 1>after he got knocked out by vandelay and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he remembers thinking,</v>

2110
01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:57.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know what the fuck and they're</v>

2111
01:34:57.590 --> 01:35:02.590
<v Speaker 1>interviewing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to keep it together for the </v>

2112
01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:02.590
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>

2113
01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:02.590
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

2114
01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:05.981
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair to interview a fighter </v>

2115
01:35:05.981 --> 01:35:05.981
<v Speaker 1>after they've been knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fucked up man.</v>

2116
01:35:05.981 --> 01:35:07.420
<v Speaker 1>There's no other way to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2117
01:35:07.421 --> 01:35:08.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2118
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:10.550
<v Speaker 1>if I could go back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely would have taken it back.</v>

2119
01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I definitely wouldn't have interviewed </v>
<v Speaker 1>him because I feel,</v>

2120
01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he sent me a text message saying </v>

2121
01:35:18.010 --> 01:35:18.440
<v Speaker 1>it's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say anything crazy,</v>

2122
01:35:18.441 --> 01:35:21.260
<v Speaker 1>so it's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2123
01:35:21.261 --> 01:35:22.710
<v Speaker 1>he could have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2124
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:24.520
<v Speaker 1>he could have said I never got stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have said,</v>

2125
01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could,</v>

2126
01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:30.280
<v Speaker 1>you don't think anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if somebody doesn't explain to him </v>

2127
01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:32.531
<v Speaker 1>well enough what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it takes a few seconds and you </v>

2128
01:35:32.531 --> 01:35:36.191
<v Speaker 1>forget again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing about guys have </v>

2129
01:35:36.191 --> 01:35:36.191
<v Speaker 1>been knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you say,</v>

2130
01:35:36.191 --> 01:35:39.701
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I got knocked out and I asked you at </v>

2131
01:35:39.701 --> 01:35:39.701
<v Speaker 1>what happened and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2132
01:35:39.701 --> 01:35:40.380
<v Speaker 1>this dude just punched you in your jaw </v>
<v Speaker 1>and knocked you out.</v>

2133
01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:41.630
<v Speaker 1>And be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>

2134
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

2135
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Like as a few seconds later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start asking again when you get </v>

2136
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:47.950
<v Speaker 1>knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real weird.</v>

2137
01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.230
<v Speaker 1>So it's a huge fuck up on my part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>

2138
01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I was in shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>

2139
01:35:53.050 --> 01:35:58.050
<v Speaker 1>It was so ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The final barrage was so ferocious and </v>

2140
01:35:58.251 --> 01:36:00.560
<v Speaker 1>there was the way it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Way John did it when you heard them,</v>

2141
01:36:00.710 --> 01:36:03.680
<v Speaker 1>once he knew he heard them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just started going after him.</v>

2142
01:36:03.710 --> 01:36:06.440
<v Speaker 1>And one of the spookiest things that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

2143
01:36:06.441 --> 01:36:07.550
<v Speaker 1>was he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he tripped him,</v>

2144
01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:13.520
<v Speaker 1>see what he tripped him like Daniel's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like sort of stumbling back and John </v>

2145
01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:16.991
<v Speaker 1>just sorta scoops his leg out from under</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and Trypsin Daniel Falls back and </v>

2146
01:36:16.991 --> 01:36:20.951
<v Speaker 1>John just moves in on him and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell Daniel just couldn't get his feet </v>

2147
01:36:20.951 --> 01:36:22.400
<v Speaker 1>back under them and John just jumped on </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and just marked them.</v>

2148
01:36:23.150 --> 01:36:25.160
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] did great on his feet for </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile there.</v>

2149
01:36:25.161 --> 01:36:30.161
<v Speaker 3>He did great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was really impressed with John </v>

2150
01:36:30.161 --> 01:36:32.390
<v Speaker 3>John Stryker to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He throws so much unorthodox.</v>

2240
01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:39.810
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you know when you're on a </v>

2241
01:40:39.810 --> 01:40:39.810
<v Speaker 3>plane and going overseas and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 3>crashed out at night,</v>

<v Speaker 3>faces on people on a planet.</v>

2246
01:40:48.491 --> 01:40:51.330
<v Speaker 3>And you were in there too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you were wide awake though.</v>

2247
01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:54.300
<v Speaker 3>You're wide awake and all of these like </v>

<v Speaker 7>greatest photoshops of all time.</v>

2249
01:40:59.471 --> 01:41:04.471
<v Speaker 7>I don't know where it's at though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's just a price that you pay if </v>

2250
01:41:04.471 --> 01:41:05.250
<v Speaker 7>you're going to be a part of that world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that world,</v>

2251
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:08.740
<v Speaker 7>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you get an insane amount of glory,</v>

2252
01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:13.860
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you only get that glory because </v>

2253
01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:13.860
<v Speaker 7>there's a risk of getting the opposite </v>
<v Speaker 7>of that.</v>

2254
01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:14.860
<v Speaker 7>Jamie Foxx was talking about the other </v>
<v Speaker 7>day.</v>

<v Speaker 7>speeches ever.</v>

2265
01:41:42.730 --> 01:41:44.950
<v Speaker 7>It made people reevaluate how they feel </v>
<v Speaker 7>about them.</v>

2266
01:41:45.190 --> 01:41:47.350
<v Speaker 7>Some people lost all respect.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want to hear that.</v>

2267
01:41:47.351 --> 01:41:52.351

2268
01:41:52.351 --> 01:41:53.170
<v Speaker 7>and coaches and hair play.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's kind of telling the truth,</v>

2269
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:55.670
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's just fascinating to listen to.</v>

2270
01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:59.150

<v Speaker 6>openly gay in football.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How many guys does one or two?</v>

2392
01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:07.880
<v Speaker 6>There's that one guy came out right </v>
<v Speaker 6>before the draft and you got right now </v>

2393
01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:08.670
<v Speaker 6>there's a few now about how many.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean not tons.</v>

2394
01:47:08.671 --> 01:47:12.750
<v Speaker 6>It's probably equal to the population.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe like 10 percent.</v>

2395
01:47:13.130 --> 01:47:14.730
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well way football.</v>

2396
01:47:14.810 --> 01:47:16.240
<v Speaker 6>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Guys,</v>

2397
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:21.390
<v Speaker 6>why do you think there's 50 openly gay </v>
<v Speaker 6>football players want to believe?</v>

2398
01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:24.570
<v Speaker 6>I want to believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2399
01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:26.310
<v Speaker 6>Google going to say I'm going to say </v>
<v Speaker 6>too.</v>

2400
01:47:26.311 --> 01:47:28.890
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You say to say to I say five.</v>

2401
01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:30.120
<v Speaker 6>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what do you say?</v>

2402
01:47:31.530 --> 01:47:36.200
<v Speaker 6>Say something I wasn't saying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll just be right close to the average.</v>

2403
01:47:36.210 --> 01:47:37.680
<v Speaker 6>So it's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Eight to 10 percent.</v>

2404
01:47:37.681 --> 01:47:42.681
<v Speaker 6>So it's probably like 30,</v>
<v Speaker 6>$40 out of the closet is what I'm </v>

2405
01:47:42.681 --> 01:47:42.681
<v Speaker 6>talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2406
01:47:42.681 --> 01:47:42.681
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

2407
01:47:42.681 --> 01:47:47.091
<v Speaker 6>That's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The national average is not considered </v>

2408
01:47:47.091 --> 01:47:47.091
<v Speaker 6>out of the closet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does it?</v>

2409
01:47:47.091 --> 01:47:48.330
<v Speaker 6>Nationally?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just how many people are gay?</v>

2410
01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:53.360
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but how many people are out of the </v>

2411
01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.521
<v Speaker 6>closet in the NFL?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I say there's one or two says there's </v>

2412
01:47:55.521 --> 01:47:58.401
<v Speaker 6>been a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there have been 11 known gay </v>

2413
01:47:58.401 --> 01:47:58.401
<v Speaker 6>players.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nana and they all got.</v>

2414
01:47:58.401 --> 01:47:58.401
<v Speaker 6>Come on.</v>

2415
01:47:58.401 --> 01:48:00.950
<v Speaker 1>They're all there now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting.</v>

2416
01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:03.920
<v Speaker 1>We're not that open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No guys are not that open.</v>

2417
01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:06.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about how many players there are.</v>

2418
01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2419
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Now let's go this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What percentage of the population is gay</v>

2420
01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:14.540
<v Speaker 1>versus what percentage of the population</v>
<v Speaker 1>is out of the closet?</v>

2421
01:48:15.290 --> 01:48:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you had to guess</v>

2422
01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:21.630
<v Speaker 6>of all of all the gay people in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>United States,</v>

2423
01:48:21.631 --> 01:48:25.230
<v Speaker 6>I would say I'm going to guess 50 </v>
<v Speaker 6>percent are out of the closet.</v>

2424
01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.250
<v Speaker 6>Fifty one new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thirty or out of the.</v>

2425
01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:30.540
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it could be 30.</v>

2426
01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.550
<v Speaker 6>It could be 10.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It could be 10.</v>

2427
01:48:32.670 --> 01:48:35.220
<v Speaker 6>Depending on where you live.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're in California,</v>

2428
01:48:35.221 --> 01:48:38.010
<v Speaker 6>you're still in the closet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're probably a UFC fighter.</v>

2429
01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Were you around when the Edmonton fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens?</v>

2430
01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Are you around during that week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What day you got to do a fight </v>

2431
01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:55.630
<v Speaker 1>companion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a kind of interesting.</v>

2432
01:48:55.890 --> 01:49:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is totally unrelated to this </v>

2433
01:49:00.890 --> 01:49:00.890
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is actually,</v>

2434
01:49:00.890 --> 01:49:00.890
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>September ninth.</v>

2435
01:49:00.890 --> 01:49:01.270
<v Speaker 1>September ninth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2436
01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Is that a Saturday?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2437
01:49:02.561 --> 01:49:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2438
01:49:04.751 --> 01:49:09.751
<v Speaker 1>I'm there on Friday it Edmonton for um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing two shows at this </v>

2439
01:49:12.670 --> 01:49:14.060
<v Speaker 1>auditorium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2440
01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:16.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jubilee auditorium to two shows that</v>

2441
01:49:16.741 --> 01:49:18.880
<v Speaker 1>this theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not doing the paper due the next</v>

2442
01:49:18.881 --> 01:49:19.430
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2443
01:49:20.210 --> 01:49:22.330
<v Speaker 1>So we'll do a fight compatible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go back home.</v>

2444
01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird because it's a,</v>

2445
01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:28.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a main event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mighty mouse versus a Ray Borg.</v>

2446
01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:30.700
<v Speaker 1>And Amanda Nunez Ares Valentina </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shevchenko,</v>

2447
01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:36.300
<v Speaker 1>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're anticipating that </v>

2448
01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:36.300
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high pay per view cell.</v>

2449
01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

2450
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.200
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2451
01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:39.490
<v Speaker 1>it's on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See.</v>

2452
01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I would like to get callan and shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but shops become too fucking successful.</v>

2453
01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 1>He's too successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking</v>

2454
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.020
<v Speaker 3>baller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's traveling all over the place.</v>

2455
01:49:50.021 --> 01:49:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Selling out everywhere he's selling out </v>
<v Speaker 3>theaters has been doing standup for like</v>

2456
01:49:53.051 --> 01:49:54.810
<v Speaker 3>six weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sounds out.</v>

2457
01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:58.930
<v Speaker 3>He's been doing it more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been doing it like a year,</v>

2458
01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:01.630
<v Speaker 3>but he's selling out everywhere down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

2459
01:50:01.631 --> 01:50:03.240
<v Speaker 3>He did what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2460
01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.660
<v Speaker 3>I was telling all these other comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

2461
01:50:04.661 --> 01:50:06.250
<v Speaker 3>you see what you've seen here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2462
01:50:06.251 --> 01:50:09.430
<v Speaker 3>this is what happens when an athlete </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows you how lazy you guys are.</v>

2463
01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:11.590
<v Speaker 3>Like this guy was like just starting </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

2464
01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:14.860
<v Speaker 3>but he actually works at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does like a ton of sets.</v>

2465
01:50:14.861 --> 01:50:16.900
<v Speaker 3>He writes a ton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he actually puts in the time,</v>

2466
01:50:16.901 --> 01:50:21.901
<v Speaker 3>like that's what athletes do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comics like to pretend they're working </v>

2467
01:50:21.901 --> 01:50:25.230
<v Speaker 3>and they fuck off a lot and keep doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same machine material for 10 years </v>

2468
01:50:25.230 --> 01:50:26.910
<v Speaker 3>and shop is like out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

2469
01:50:27.070 --> 01:50:29.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm no expert at comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

2470
01:50:29.410 --> 01:50:32.500
<v Speaker 3>I think in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot like Jujitsu.</v>

2471
01:50:32.530 --> 01:50:37.530
<v Speaker 3>You gotta practice and refund.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot like writing music because </v>

2472
01:50:37.530 --> 01:50:37.530
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2473
01:50:37.530 --> 01:50:39.490
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to rely on just going up</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and riff and fuck,</v>

2474
01:50:39.491 --> 01:50:41.050
<v Speaker 3>good luck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck.</v>

2475
01:50:41.070 --> 01:50:43.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like trying to write a song like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2476
01:50:43.151 --> 01:50:45.070
<v Speaker 3>we're going to record a song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have no idea what we're going to do,</v>

2477
01:50:45.071 --> 01:50:47.010
<v Speaker 3>but we're going to jam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he all right,</v>

2478
01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:49.150
<v Speaker 3>and then we'd go and that's the hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>song.</v>

2479
01:50:49.330 --> 01:50:51.640
<v Speaker 3>The odds of that happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super slim.</v>

2480
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:54.520
<v Speaker 3>You've got to record a jam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick out a little pieces,</v>

2481
01:50:54.610 --> 01:50:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Polish it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>add this two months later,</v>

2482
01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:58.930
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a middle part.</v>

2483
01:50:58.931 --> 01:51:02.230
<v Speaker 3>Now a month later you got the intro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all coming together.</v>

2484
01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:04.120
<v Speaker 3>Might take eight months to get that bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

2485
01:51:04.121 --> 01:51:09.121
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just constantly going back and </v>

2486
01:51:09.121 --> 01:51:10.441
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how music is put together and </v>

2487
01:51:10.441 --> 01:51:12.451
<v Speaker 3>that's how Jujitsu's put together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to constantly refine your </v>

2488
01:51:12.451 --> 01:51:12.451
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

2489
01:51:12.451 --> 01:51:13.390
<v Speaker 3>You're out there getting ready,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing wrong?</v>

2490
01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:15.760
<v Speaker 3>What's working?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's stick to what's working with.</v>

2491
01:51:15.790 --> 01:51:18.220
<v Speaker 3>Add some new shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learning from other people,</v>

2492
01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:23.460
<v Speaker 3>techniques and being open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding that your body is magical </v>

2493
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:29.790
<v Speaker 3>and it'll do anything you wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just got to tell it over and over </v>

2494
01:51:29.790 --> 01:51:30.970
<v Speaker 3>and over again to a point where it does </v>
<v Speaker 3>it by itself,</v>

2495
01:51:30.971 --> 01:51:34.510
<v Speaker 3>without you even knowing what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going on and it's unconscious.</v>

2496
01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:36.610
<v Speaker 3>You could do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could play piano,</v>

2497
01:51:36.611 --> 01:51:38.620
<v Speaker 3>you can play a guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2498
01:51:38.630 --> 01:51:39.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried guitar,</v>

2499
01:51:39.671 --> 01:51:41.890
<v Speaker 3>but it's too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just didn't practice.</v>

2500
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:43.510
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody could play guitar.</v>

2501
01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:45.960
<v Speaker 3>Anybody could play guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can play piano songs.</v>

2502
01:51:45.970 --> 01:51:50.970
<v Speaker 3>Your neurons fire correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just your hands move just takes </v>

2503
01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:52.330
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got in a motorcycle accident and you</v>

2504
01:51:52.331 --> 01:51:54.850
<v Speaker 3>smash your hands and you're like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't play piano,</v>

2505
01:51:55.180 --> 01:51:57.310
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just saying if you have normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>limbs,</v>

2506
01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:59.200
<v Speaker 3>you could play piano,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could play guitar,</v>

2507
01:51:59.201 --> 01:52:00.100
<v Speaker 3>you can do anything.</v>

2508
01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:01.480
<v Speaker 3>You could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do anything.</v>

2509
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:04.330
<v Speaker 3>You can learn Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can box.</v>

2510
01:52:04.331 --> 01:52:09.331
<v Speaker 3>You can play basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He never played basketball in your life </v>

2511
01:52:09.331 --> 01:52:11.290
<v Speaker 3>and you're 55 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you practiced hard for a year,</v>

2512
01:52:11.410 --> 01:52:15.250
<v Speaker 3>it'd be I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know people don't want to believe that</v>

2513
01:52:15.251 --> 01:52:17.260
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for them to believe it because</v>

2514
01:52:17.261 --> 01:52:22.261
<v Speaker 3>they're not reminded of it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why a lot of people coming from </v>

2515
01:52:22.261 --> 01:52:26.011
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and martial arts in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they become successful because through </v>

2516
01:52:26.011 --> 01:52:30.240
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu you're constantly reminded that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can suck at something and then you </v>

2517
01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:33.010
<v Speaker 3>get pretty good at it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>mastered and then it's unconscious.</v>

2518
01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:37.120
<v Speaker 3>You reminded that every time you go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu everyday you're reminded,</v>

2519
01:52:37.121 --> 01:52:39.340
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do this with anything,</v>

2520
01:52:39.490 --> 01:52:41.020
<v Speaker 3>and people do it with their business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go,</v>

2521
01:52:41.050 --> 01:52:44.740
<v Speaker 3>all I gotta do is do hustle in the in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gi,</v>

2522
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu of business</v>

2523
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:48.980
<v Speaker 5>and make it happen or whatever you want </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do.</v>

2524
01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:50.420
<v Speaker 5>You're reminded like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

2525
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:52.640
<v Speaker 5>You like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I say magical,</v>

2526
01:52:52.641 --> 01:52:57.641
<v Speaker 5>it's not a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is magical because your body will do </v>

2527
01:52:57.641 --> 01:53:00.281
<v Speaker 5>shit on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you like when you're doing </v>

2528
01:53:00.281 --> 01:53:00.740
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes I come up with moves.</v>

2529
01:53:00.741 --> 01:53:05.741
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the fuck I did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did something I have no idea and then </v>

2530
01:53:05.741 --> 01:53:09.401
<v Speaker 5>it comes up again because I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>programmed and drilled my body so much </v>

2531
01:53:09.401 --> 01:53:13.181
<v Speaker 5>and has so many things that I trained it</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do a on instincts that it's kind of </v>

2532
01:53:13.311 --> 01:53:18.311
<v Speaker 5>like a suggestion thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you hit youtube and they kind </v>

2533
01:53:18.311 --> 01:53:18.311
<v Speaker 5>of know what you like and here's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>suggestions,</v>

2534
01:53:18.311 --> 01:53:23.200
<v Speaker 5>like your body will go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He always does this and he always does </v>

2535
01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:23.330
<v Speaker 5>that and he always does this </v>
<v Speaker 5>unconsciously.</v>

2536
01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:26.330
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he might like this and then you're like,</v>

2537
01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:27.050
<v Speaker 5>oh shit.</v>

2538
01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:32.050
<v Speaker 5>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like your body can someone else </v>

2539
01:53:32.050 --> 01:53:32.050
<v Speaker 5>came up with that and then the next time</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do like,</v>

2540
01:53:32.050 --> 01:53:36.610
<v Speaker 5>there it is again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how most of the moves that are </v>

2541
01:53:36.610 --> 01:53:40.601
<v Speaker 5>transitions that I get good at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They come up like on their own and then </v>

2542
01:53:40.601 --> 01:53:41.340
<v Speaker 5>the third time we got I got it and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>I videotape,</v>

2543
01:53:41.370 --> 01:53:43.170
<v Speaker 5>but then I've videotaped myself doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2544
01:53:43.171 --> 01:53:43.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit,</v>

2545
01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:45.650
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even know I was doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just like,</v>

2546
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:49.070
<v Speaker 5>your body will make shit up for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You everybody.</v>

2547
01:53:49.071 --> 01:53:50.720
<v Speaker 5>Not just me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's everybody.</v>

2548
01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:54.270
<v Speaker 5>You just gotta learn how to capture it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like comedy p.</v>

2549
01:53:54.290 --> 01:53:59.290
<v Speaker 5>people love comedy because they go see a</v>
<v Speaker 5>comedian and he's saying all this shit </v>

2550
01:53:59.290 --> 01:53:59.510
<v Speaker 5>that they agree with and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>laughing and going,</v>

2551
01:53:59.511 --> 01:54:01.220
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that this,</v>

2552
01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:04.460
<v Speaker 5>this comedian is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He saying shit that if you're laughing,</v>

2553
01:54:04.461 --> 01:54:05.250
<v Speaker 5>you agree with that.</v>

2554
01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:10.360
<v Speaker 5>Like you all the shit that he said </v>
<v Speaker 5>you've set and people around you have </v>

2555
01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:15.191
<v Speaker 5>said it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just didn't notice it as something </v>

2556
01:54:15.191 --> 01:54:15.270
<v Speaker 5>to use on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So once you.</v>

2557
01:54:15.410 --> 01:54:17.660
<v Speaker 5>It's just like music when you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every time you listen to music,</v>

2558
01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:22.720
<v Speaker 5>like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anytime I listen to music and I like </v>

2559
01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:22.720
<v Speaker 5>something musically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is rare,</v>

2560
01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:24.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to find out everything about </v>
<v Speaker 5>that song.</v>

2561
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:26.630
<v Speaker 5>There's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't ever get lazy with that.</v>

2562
01:54:26.690 --> 01:54:29.990
<v Speaker 5>I find out who sang the song,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I downloaded the song,</v>

2563
01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:33.500
<v Speaker 5>I analyze a song like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is it about this song that makes it</v>

2564
01:54:33.501 --> 01:54:35.970
<v Speaker 5>so great?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why am I getting chills listening to the</v>

2565
01:54:35.971 --> 01:54:37.910
<v Speaker 5>song?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do I have this song on repeat?</v>

2566
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:39.230
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's.</v>

2567
01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:43.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm trained musically to always try to </v>
<v Speaker 5>capture golden nuggets.</v>

2568
01:54:43.641 --> 01:54:44.710
<v Speaker 5>Every time I hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2569
01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:49.780
<v Speaker 5>I'll be in a middle of a conversation in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Japan at Tgi Fridays in Tokyo and in the</v>

2570
01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:55.900
<v Speaker 5>distance a song would come on and I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the conversation with some people and I </v>

2571
01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:55.900
<v Speaker 5>hear it and it just.</v>

2572
01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:58.850
<v Speaker 5>I know that I tell the people I'm with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll be right back.</v>

2573
01:54:58.851 --> 01:55:00.730
<v Speaker 5>I gotta find out what the song is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll write it down them.</v>

2574
01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:03.230
<v Speaker 5>I just do the other Dj.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's kind of a DJ thing.</v>

2575
01:55:03.650 --> 01:55:07.650
<v Speaker 5>So my point is it's same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu.</v>

2576
01:55:07.651 --> 01:55:11.000
<v Speaker 5>It same thing with comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's same thing with music.</v>

2577
01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:13.580
<v Speaker 5>You just gotTa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all around you.</v>

2578
01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:18.820
<v Speaker 5>You just gotTa look for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to train yourself to look </v>

2579
01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:21.371
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you have to write shit on your </v>

2580
01:55:21.371 --> 01:55:21.371
<v Speaker 5>hand to train,</v>
<v Speaker 5>remind yourself,</v>

2581
01:55:21.371 --> 01:55:21.371
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>think about.</v>

2582
01:55:21.371 --> 01:55:26.210
<v Speaker 5>Then once that becomes your instinct </v>
<v Speaker 5>once looking for shit and recognizing </v>

2583
01:55:26.210 --> 01:55:28.110
<v Speaker 5>should always be on the call for Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like uh,</v>

2584
01:55:28.370 --> 01:55:33.370
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like editors do to edit videos every </v>

2585
01:55:33.370 --> 01:55:33.370
<v Speaker 5>time they're watching a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are they doing?</v>

2586
01:55:33.370 --> 01:55:35.340
<v Speaker 5>They're breaking down the editing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're right,</v>

2587
01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:37.700
<v Speaker 5>of course like movie makers are breaking</v>
<v Speaker 5>down the lighting.</v>

2588
01:55:37.701 --> 01:55:40.880
<v Speaker 5>They're watching them and we feel the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hidden directors of movies,</v>

2589
01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:42.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of ways,</v>

2590
01:55:42.471 --> 01:55:44.370
<v Speaker 5>like the directors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get all these ideas,</v>

2591
01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:49.600
<v Speaker 3>they put it together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of times you'd get on a </v>

2592
01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:52.280
<v Speaker 3>television show as well to editor will </v>
<v Speaker 3>make these passes at things when they </v>

2593
01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:53.520
<v Speaker 3>give you like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an editor's first cut.</v>

2594
01:55:53.521 --> 01:55:54.630
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of times it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2595
01:55:54.631 --> 01:55:56.010
<v Speaker 3>the director would look at and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked that.</v>

2596
01:55:56.011 --> 01:55:56.970
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

2597
01:55:57.210 --> 01:55:59.610
<v Speaker 3>You don't get any better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to have an editor who,</v>

2598
01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:01.550
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows this.</v>

2599
01:56:01.610 --> 01:56:02.030
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2600
01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:07.040
<v Speaker 3>You got to be talented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not just some slave that's gonna cut </v>

2601
01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:09.921
<v Speaker 3>shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of talent and the </v>

2602
01:56:09.921 --> 01:56:09.960
<v Speaker 3>editing you to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in television shows.</v>

2603
01:56:09.961 --> 01:56:12.230
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or I guess in movies too,</v>

2604
01:56:12.750 --> 01:56:13.370
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2605
01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:16.810
<v Speaker 3>I get the editors that I got working </v>
<v Speaker 3>from his hot level.</v>

2606
01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Amazing that editor like that movies are</v>
<v Speaker 3>still in a theater now,</v>

2607
01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:24.550
<v Speaker 3>so one of the rare things you do when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go somewhere like just to,</v>

2608
01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:26.180
<v Speaker 3>to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2609
01:56:26.670 --> 01:56:29.520
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of art where it's not live,</v>

2610
01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:34.700
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go to a place still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they still have them like that and </v>

2611
01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:35.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I'd been brainwashed </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I love,</v>

2612
01:56:35.850 --> 01:56:40.850
<v Speaker 3>I love to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just saying it's weird because </v>

2613
01:56:40.850 --> 01:56:41.670
<v Speaker 3>it's like one of the few places we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

2614
01:56:41.970 --> 01:56:44.820
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll go and take in media at a,</v>

2615
01:56:44.821 --> 01:56:46.110
<v Speaker 3>at a specific location.</v>

2616
01:56:46.110 --> 01:56:48.660
<v Speaker 3>We all meet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we go for a live show,</v>

2617
01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:51.170
<v Speaker 3>we'll go for a live show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you,</v>

2618
01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:55.270
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to go to see like have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fake band somewhere.</v>

2619
01:56:56.130 --> 01:56:59.170
<v Speaker 3>Gigantic screen that's like a 100 times </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger than you.</v>

2620
01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:02.060
<v Speaker 3>And the sound is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2621
01:57:02.061 --> 01:57:07.061
<v Speaker 3>So there's all that crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's cool sitting with people and </v>

2622
01:57:07.061 --> 01:57:07.420
<v Speaker 3>when they laugh you laugh and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>continual.</v>

2623
01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:10.050
<v Speaker 3>You want to laugh more when there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people around,</v>

2624
01:57:10.051 --> 01:57:15.051
<v Speaker 3>but you run the risk of douchebags run </v>
<v Speaker 3>the risk that people talk and people </v>

2625
01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:20.130
<v Speaker 3>talk and the people that do that violate</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sacred laws of the movie theater.</v>

2654
01:58:30.501 --> 01:58:31.380
<v Speaker 3>there that there's like a 15 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the population.</v>

2655
01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:34.560
<v Speaker 3>Eventually another generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those will be all gone and fake.</v>

2656
01:58:34.561 --> 01:58:37.620
<v Speaker 3>Tits would just be accepted by all men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fake ass.</v>

2657
01:58:37.650 --> 01:58:42.650
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to take a couple of </v>

2658
01:58:42.650 --> 01:58:42.650
<v Speaker 3>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to happen.</v>

2659
01:58:42.650 --> 01:58:42.650
<v Speaker 3>This.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

2661
01:58:44.891 --> 01:58:47.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst shit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The don't get it.</v>

2662
01:58:47.471 --> 01:58:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Girls don't even think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2663
01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:53.880
<v Speaker 1>but the gray area is this fat thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing and what is not a fake </v>

2664
01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:58.411
<v Speaker 1>ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're taking fat grafting fat </v>

2665
01:58:58.411 --> 01:58:59.100
<v Speaker 1>that's still grow parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do some squats,</v>

2666
01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:02.440
<v Speaker 1>do some squats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody could have a great body,</v>

2667
01:59:02.441 --> 01:59:04.450
<v Speaker 1>just do some squats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that's not true.</v>

2668
01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:06.620
<v Speaker 1>There's some people out there that got </v>
<v Speaker 1>some fucked up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>

2673
01:59:17.650 --> 01:59:20.010
<v Speaker 1>They think they have no choice to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fat.</v>

2674
01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Stuff's want to reengineer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The older you get,</v>

2675
01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:28.040
<v Speaker 1>the more women eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I was reading this thing about </v>

2676
01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:30.541
<v Speaker 1>Crispr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're starting to use crispr for </v>

2677
01:59:30.541 --> 01:59:33.001
<v Speaker 1>a Jew for embryos now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they think they're really close to </v>

2678
01:59:33.001 --> 01:59:33.640
<v Speaker 1>genetically engineering.</v>

2679
01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:36.760
<v Speaker 1>The first people that become viable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual humans.</v>

2680
01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what Crispr is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2681
01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:42.330
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like photoshop for jeans.</v>

2682
01:59:42.890 --> 01:59:47.890
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at this scientist edit </v>
<v Speaker 1>human embryos for the first time in the </v>

2683
01:59:47.890 --> 01:59:47.890
<v Speaker 1>US.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

2684
01:59:47.890 --> 01:59:52.690
<v Speaker 1>they're using this new technology which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is way more complicated than my puny </v>

2685
01:59:52.690 --> 01:59:57.601
<v Speaker 1>brain has the ability to describe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a gene editing tool called </v>

2686
01:59:57.601 --> 01:59:58.990
<v Speaker 1>crispr and there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an episode,</v>

2687
01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:04.020
<v Speaker 1>another episode of radio lab that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>about crispr that it might be like a </v>

2688
02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:06.910
<v Speaker 1>good way for you to get an entertaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>but descriptive,</v>

2689
02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:08.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation of it.</v>

2690
02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:09.430
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2691
02:00:09.490 --> 02:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be able to at least </v>

2692
02:00:14.490 --> 02:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>someday in the future if this keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

2693
02:00:14.490 --> 02:00:19.350
<v Speaker 1>they keep perfecting this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be able to edit things </v>

2694
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:22.021
<v Speaker 1>out of people like they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to take away the the gene for </v>

2695
02:00:22.021 --> 02:00:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2696
02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:23.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2697
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:25.670
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know?</v>

2698
02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always say shit like in the future </v>

2699
02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>doing it now and they're doing it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's real science behind this.</v>

2700
02:00:33.821 --> 02:00:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Like you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could follow the science.</v>

2701
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:39.790
<v Speaker 1>They're editing things the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making photoshop the same way.</v>

2702
02:00:39.791 --> 02:00:42.400
<v Speaker 1>They're making that new thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows them to edit videos.</v>

2703
02:00:42.401 --> 02:00:45.430
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna edit genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about those contact lenses where you</v>

2704
02:00:45.431 --> 02:00:50.020
<v Speaker 1>can play video games and you're seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>some Microsoft made and stuff?</v>

2705
02:00:50.050 --> 02:00:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they have that yet.</v>

2706
02:00:51.461 --> 02:00:56.461
<v Speaker 1>I think they have glasses so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they have contact </v>

2707
02:00:56.461 --> 02:00:56.461
<v Speaker 1>lenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contact Lenses.</v>

2708
02:00:56.590 --> 02:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Retinal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2709
02:00:57.970 --> 02:00:59.720
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could do it with a,</v>

2710
02:00:59.850 --> 02:01:01.390
<v Speaker 1>with the glass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Google.</v>

2711
02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:03.070
<v Speaker 1>You ever see Google glass?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever put that on?</v>

2712
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:06.220
<v Speaker 1>It was weird that Google glass isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>around anymore.</v>

2713
02:01:06.221 --> 02:01:08.500
<v Speaker 1>They've got some new applications for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2714
02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:11.440
<v Speaker 1>But what it was like was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2715
02:01:11.590 --> 02:01:14.800
<v Speaker 1>like a glass frame and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This little thing in front of you like a</v>

2716
02:01:14.801 --> 02:01:19.801
<v Speaker 1>little window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tiny little tv that was sitting </v>

2717
02:01:19.801 --> 02:01:22.501
<v Speaker 1>in front of your eyes because it's clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on that little window you could see </v>

2718
02:01:22.501 --> 02:01:24.190
<v Speaker 1>through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could also see like a navigation</v>

2719
02:01:24.250 --> 02:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>directions and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could google things and have it </v>

2720
02:01:29.250 --> 02:01:29.740
<v Speaker 1>brought up in front of you and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>steal shit.</v>

2721
02:01:30.670 --> 02:01:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some,</v>

2722
02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:34.300
<v Speaker 1>some movie shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was like the Internet,</v>

2723
02:01:34.570 --> 02:01:37.240
<v Speaker 1>like you're making phone calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know these guys,</v>

2724
02:01:37.241 --> 02:01:38.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

2725
02:01:38.441 --> 02:01:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea who people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2726
02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>don't</v>

2727
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:42.070
<v Speaker 7>like drinking it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2728
02:01:42.071 --> 02:01:42.770
<v Speaker 7>You need to stab.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2729
02:01:42.771 --> 02:01:47.771
<v Speaker 7>let's not do it while the podcast going </v>
<v Speaker 7>on and just sucking on that thing and </v>

2730
02:01:47.771 --> 02:01:47.771
<v Speaker 7>chewing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A spoon.</v>

2731
02:01:48.570 --> 02:01:49.910
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 7>You got a spoon or no?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Eddie Bravo.</v>

2735
02:02:01.061 --> 02:02:03.490
<v Speaker 7>Abandoned you in the middle of a podcast</v>
<v Speaker 7>for a knife.</v>

2736
02:02:03.590 --> 02:02:06.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You offered it defaults.</v>

2737
02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:11.980
<v Speaker 4>Cave shakes blowing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now their stock's going through the </v>

2738
02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:11.980
<v Speaker 4>roof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What were we just talking about?</v>

2739
02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:16.130
<v Speaker 4>This ar stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is going to be built into apple's </v>

2740
02:02:16.130 --> 02:02:18.150
<v Speaker 4>new operating system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>allows you to read how big something is.</v>

2741
02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:23.180
<v Speaker 4>It's a virtual tape measure that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just hold your camera up to stuff and </v>

2742
02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:23.880
<v Speaker 4>you can talk like they're right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're showing you that is how accurate</v>

2743
02:02:23.881 --> 02:02:27.720
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like it see the tape measure staying</v>

2744
02:02:27.721 --> 02:02:32.721
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're measuring the size of a picture </v>

2745
02:02:32.721 --> 02:02:34.740
<v Speaker 4>frame diagonally and it stays in space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2746
02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:36.330
<v Speaker 4>if I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you get what I'm saying,</v>

2747
02:02:36.331 --> 02:02:39.720
<v Speaker 4>like I do the three d space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it knows where you're modeling depending</v>

2748
02:02:39.721 --> 02:02:41.850
<v Speaker 4>on how far away you are from it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>

2749
02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:47.060
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other weird thing is by watching </v>

2750
02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:47.160
<v Speaker 4>that show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the planet of the Apps,</v>

2751
02:02:47.161 --> 02:02:50.970
<v Speaker 4>they just started on apple music,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it was in the first episode.</v>

2752
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:54.900
<v Speaker 4>The Sky shows an APP that he made that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think apple bought.</v>

2753
02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:58.140
<v Speaker 4>Eventually they're adding into this </v>
<v Speaker 4>operating system.</v>

2754
02:02:58.260 --> 02:03:02.550
<v Speaker 4>They're mapping the inside of every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere that your camera can take,</v>

2755
02:03:02.551 --> 02:03:04.560
<v Speaker 4>a place or a shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2756
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:09.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inside here eventually we'll be all </v>

2757
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.950
<v Speaker 4>mapped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this guy said that he,</v>

2758
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:11.580
<v Speaker 4>he would own the map.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why apple bottoms.</v>

2759
02:03:11.581 --> 02:03:16.581
<v Speaker 4>Now apple's going to own it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're essentially going to be able </v>

2760
02:03:16.581 --> 02:03:16.581
<v Speaker 4>to have the inside three d maps of </v>
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>

2761
02:03:16.581 --> 02:03:20.991
<v Speaker 4>in every building in the world or at </v>
<v Speaker 4>least wherever and telling me what that </v>

2762
02:03:20.991 --> 02:03:20.991
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

2763
02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:25.350
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's built into the phone.</v>

2764
02:03:25.351 --> 02:03:30.351
<v Speaker 4>So there's other cool stuff too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they can map everything just based </v>

2765
02:03:30.351 --> 02:03:30.900
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll get there eventually.</v>

2766
02:03:30.901 --> 02:03:31.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2767
02:03:31.231 --> 02:03:33.720
<v Speaker 4>so they did something came out about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Roombas,</v>

2768
02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:38.840
<v Speaker 4>like the room are currently tracking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the inside of everybody's houses and </v>

2769
02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:40.170
<v Speaker 4>apartments and I don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hell they're going to do with that data,</v>

2770
02:03:40.171 --> 02:03:44.610
<v Speaker 4>but people got scared they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>sell it to someone can be good.</v>

2771
02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:46.260
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is that going to be good?</v>

2772
02:03:46.380 --> 02:03:47.970
<v Speaker 4>We're doing this to protect you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How?</v>

2773
02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:51.900
<v Speaker 4>It's not about protection necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it could be used.</v>

2774
02:03:51.901 --> 02:03:54.180
<v Speaker 4>You guys have trillions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 4>missing.</v>

2775
02:03:54.210 --> 02:03:56.100
<v Speaker 4>It could be useful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same people,</v>

2776
02:03:56.101 --> 02:03:56.460
<v Speaker 4>Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2777
02:03:56.461 --> 02:04:01.461
<v Speaker 4>I mean if Jesus Christ you keep making </v>
<v Speaker 4>these things are not people as the </v>

2778
02:04:01.461 --> 02:04:05.460
<v Speaker 4>Illuminati that run the government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This can help blind pizza technologists.</v>

2779
02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:07.440
<v Speaker 4>These are people that are creating the </v>
<v Speaker 4>greatest stuff.</v>

2780
02:04:07.730 --> 02:04:08.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

2781
02:04:09.170 --> 02:04:10.440
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2782
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:12.420
<v Speaker 7>I mean this is not the illuminati making</v>
<v Speaker 7>this stuff.</v>

2783
02:04:12.421 --> 02:04:13.160
<v Speaker 7>Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is,</v>

2784
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:15.350
<v Speaker 7>this is technologist as apple.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2785
02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:17.100
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>
<v Speaker 7>apple's not the fucking Illuminati.</v>

2786
02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:20.160
<v Speaker 7>I didn't sell the apple did get in </v>
<v Speaker 7>trouble recently.</v>

2787
02:04:20.310 --> 02:04:22.320
<v Speaker 7>Do you know what they did in China?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>

2788
02:04:22.321 --> 02:04:27.321
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they made a deal with the Chinese </v>

2789
02:04:27.321 --> 02:04:28.701
<v Speaker 7>government to um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to take aps down from their APP store </v>

2790
02:04:28.701 --> 02:04:32.160
<v Speaker 7>that allow you to circumnavigate their,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a censorship system.</v>

2791
02:04:32.610 --> 02:04:37.610
<v Speaker 7>People were very,</v>
<v Speaker 7>very upset at them because what </v>

2792
02:04:37.610 --> 02:04:40.370
<v Speaker 7>essentially is a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're saying that apps are illegal in </v>

2793
02:04:40.370 --> 02:04:43.221
<v Speaker 7>China,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so they're not allowing them on the </v>

2794
02:04:43.221 --> 02:04:45.081
<v Speaker 7>apple store,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they're illegal in China because </v>

2795
02:04:45.081 --> 02:04:45.870
<v Speaker 7>they allow them to get away from </v>
<v Speaker 7>government censorship.</v>

2796
02:04:46.050 --> 02:04:49.380
<v Speaker 7>So government censorship has a certain </v>
<v Speaker 7>lock down on what you're allowed to look</v>

2797
02:04:49.381 --> 02:04:51.690
<v Speaker 7>at online.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here it is.</v>

2798
02:04:51.930 --> 02:04:56.930
<v Speaker 7>Apple Removes Apps from the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 7>store that help Internet users of aid </v>

2799
02:04:56.930 --> 02:04:56.930
<v Speaker 7>censorship.</v>

2800
02:04:56.930 --> 02:05:00.870
<v Speaker 7>Very disappointing to people because </v>
<v Speaker 7>they feel like apple kind of like,</v>

2801
02:05:00.871 --> 02:05:03.900
<v Speaker 7>feels like maybe they have to do this </v>
<v Speaker 7>other New York Times trying to get us to</v>

2802
02:05:03.901 --> 02:05:05.190
<v Speaker 7>pay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How dare you?</v>

2803
02:05:05.191 --> 02:05:07.860
<v Speaker 7>New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No one's paying for articles online.</v>

2804
02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:11.520
<v Speaker 7>Just stop,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just stop with the FEC pays for articles</v>

2805
02:05:11.521 --> 02:05:13.010
<v Speaker 7>online.</v>

<v Speaker 7>still have your old.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you ever get one of your in a hotel </v>

2807

<v Speaker 7>and they offer you the USA Today to see </v>
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck the world pay attention to</v>

2808
02:05:20.130 --> 02:05:24.210
<v Speaker 7>man USA Today.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's like a CNN of newspapers.</v>

2809
02:05:24.510 --> 02:05:29.510
<v Speaker 7>If you had to guess like what percentage</v>
<v Speaker 7>of people actually read the whole USA </v>

2810
02:05:31.110 --> 02:05:31.680
<v Speaker 7>Today?</v>

<v Speaker 7>No Way.</v>

2812
02:05:34.710 --> 02:05:37.560
<v Speaker 7>Less than one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Less than one for sure.</v>

2813
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:42.030
<v Speaker 7>One hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that was just making a point to,</v>

2814
02:05:42.070 --> 02:05:47.070
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's just like a e entertainment news </v>

<v Speaker 7>a comical meme about the president body </v>
<v Speaker 7>slamming you,</v>

02:06:57.721 --> 02:07:01.390
<v Speaker 7>of you and me in a wrestling statue with</v>
<v Speaker 7>the dudes grabbing the Dudek.</v>

2845
02:07:01.450 --> 02:07:02.150
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

2846
02:07:02.250 --> 02:07:04.050
<v Speaker 7>That's what photoshop,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Steve,</v>

2847
02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:10.450
<v Speaker 7>but what it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My point is that they would get so mad </v>

2848
02:07:10.450 --> 02:07:12.780
<v Speaker 7>at that that they would go after the guy</v>
<v Speaker 7>who made it.</v>

2849
02:07:12.810 --> 02:07:15.540
<v Speaker 7>That sort of reinforces the side of </v>
<v Speaker 7>trump.</v>

2850
02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:19.540
<v Speaker 7>Like people don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They don't understand that if you,</v>

2851
02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:22.230
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have something that's comical,</v>

2852
02:07:22.290 --> 02:07:27.290
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like that meme of Donald Trump's slam </v>

2853
02:07:27.290 --> 02:07:30.000
<v Speaker 7>and CNN and then you go find the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 7>was just joking around,</v>

2854
02:07:30.210 --> 02:07:32.820
<v Speaker 7>made a little animated Gif joking </v>
<v Speaker 7>around,</v>

2855
02:07:32.821 --> 02:07:33.540
<v Speaker 7>put it online.</v>

2856
02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:35.620
<v Speaker 7>I thought it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everybody a laugh,</v>

2857
02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:37.930
<v Speaker 7>you know all he smashed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In fact fake news.</v>

2858
02:07:37.931 --> 02:07:38.790
<v Speaker 7>Ha Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 7>ha ha.</v>

2859
02:07:39.090 --> 02:07:42.850
<v Speaker 7>And you go and scare that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You go and scare that guy.</v>

2860
02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:44.140
<v Speaker 7>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's going on?</v>

2861
02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:46.450
<v Speaker 7>You know what's scarier?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're CNN.</v>

2862
02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:51.660
<v Speaker 7>What's scarier than that is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 7>still people that watch that shit every </v>

2863
02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:52.020
<v Speaker 7>day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2864
02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:55.240
<v Speaker 7>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>after knowing that you're going to still</v>

2865
02:07:55.241 --> 02:07:57.950
<v Speaker 7>watch it and believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The other thing was the store,</v>

2866
02:07:57.951 --> 02:08:01.060
<v Speaker 7>they made up about Russian contacts </v>
<v Speaker 7>about,</v>

2867
02:08:01.061 --> 02:08:06.061
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's like three reporters had to </v>

2868
02:08:06.061 --> 02:08:08.071
<v Speaker 7>resign.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was store that was on cnn to like </v>

2869
02:08:08.071 --> 02:08:09.040
<v Speaker 7>greatly exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think CNN is,</v>

2870
02:08:09.610 --> 02:08:12.490
<v Speaker 7>they just want to start shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's not the one to make money.</v>

2871
02:08:12.670 --> 02:08:14.860
<v Speaker 7>They just want to start shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's part.</v>

2872
02:08:14.861 --> 02:08:19.861
<v Speaker 7>I think it's part of the agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think this is what I think they feel </v>

2873
02:08:19.861 --> 02:08:23.860
<v Speaker 7>like if there's an enemy out there and </v>
<v Speaker 7>the enemy is the new president,</v>

2874
02:08:24.070 --> 02:08:29.070
<v Speaker 7>they think there's an enemy and they </v>
<v Speaker 7>feel like they're going to war with the </v>

2875
02:08:29.070 --> 02:08:31.321
<v Speaker 7>enemy and when you have a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 7>soldiers that are going to war for the </v>

2876
02:08:31.321 --> 02:08:33.010
<v Speaker 7>enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some of them do some unscrupulous shit.</v>

2877
02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:38.100
<v Speaker 7>Like these people that got.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They had to resign because the story </v>

2878
02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:39.670
<v Speaker 7>with Russia with the fake facts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I forget what the actual thing was,</v>

2879
02:08:39.671 --> 02:08:43.650
<v Speaker 7>but CNN disavowed their article,</v>
<v Speaker 7>pulled it down,</v>

2880
02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:48.660
<v Speaker 7>removed it whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Three journalists leaving CNN after </v>

2881
02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:49.360
<v Speaker 7>retracted article.</v>
<v Speaker 7>CNN journalists,</v>

2882
02:08:49.361 --> 02:08:52.840
<v Speaker 7>including the executive editor in charge</v>
<v Speaker 7>of a new investigative unit,</v>

2883
02:08:52.930 --> 02:08:55.650
<v Speaker 7>have resigned after the publication of a</v>
<v Speaker 7>Russia,</v>

2884
02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:58.420
<v Speaker 7>Russia related article that was </v>
<v Speaker 7>retracted.</v>

2885
02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:01.210
<v Speaker 7>So you can go into details as you wanted</v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

2886
02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:02.710
<v Speaker 7>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What if.</v>

2887
02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:07.660
<v Speaker 7>What if the CNN Donald Trump feud is </v>
<v Speaker 7>like pro wrestling?</v>

2888
02:09:07.870 --> 02:09:12.870
<v Speaker 7>What if they're just laughing and </v>
<v Speaker 7>they're just slinging shit back and </v>

2889
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:15.811
<v Speaker 7>forth talking to a guy the other day </v>
<v Speaker 7>that thinks that he thinks it's all </v>

2890
02:09:15.811 --> 02:09:15.820
<v Speaker 7>about setting up China,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said said,</v>

2891
02:09:15.821 --> 02:09:18.940
<v Speaker 7>it's all about us going to war these </v>
<v Speaker 7>other countries.</v>

2892
02:09:19.660 --> 02:09:22.270
<v Speaker 7>He thinks there's all these distractions</v>
<v Speaker 7>are happening and that's what's.</v>

2893
02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:27.420
<v Speaker 7>And positioning North Korea and China on</v>
<v Speaker 7>the side of North Korea and you know </v>

2894
02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:27.550
<v Speaker 7>it's crazy by North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the most.</v>

2895
02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:29.800
<v Speaker 7>They're the most demonized country on </v>
<v Speaker 7>the planet.</v>

2896
02:09:29.801 --> 02:09:34.801
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're always testing missiles or </v>

2897
02:09:34.801 --> 02:09:34.801
<v Speaker 7>testing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>miss it.</v>

2898
02:09:34.801 --> 02:09:37.380
<v Speaker 7>Since the Korean War.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know how many countries they've </v>

2899
02:09:37.380 --> 02:09:38.380
<v Speaker 7>invaded and killed innocent civilians?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Zero.</v>

2900
02:09:38.590 --> 02:09:40.990
<v Speaker 7>How many countries have we invaded and </v>
<v Speaker 7>killed?</v>

2901
02:09:40.991 --> 02:09:45.130
<v Speaker 7>Millions of civilians like 20 or 30 </v>
<v Speaker 7>since the Korean War,</v>

2902
02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:48.400
<v Speaker 7>but they're the bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're the bad guy.</v>

2903
02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:50.860
<v Speaker 7>They're not invading anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They've never invaded anybody.</v>

2904
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:55.090
<v Speaker 7>We invade people all the fucking time </v>
<v Speaker 7>and kill innocent children and come on,</v>

2905
02:09:55.390 --> 02:09:59.530
<v Speaker 7>this is a big show going on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's nothing that's true,</v>

2906
02:09:59.531 --> 02:10:03.070
<v Speaker 7>but it is a dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like what's a scary dictatorship?</v>

2907
02:10:03.071 --> 02:10:04.440
<v Speaker 7>They have no control.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2908
02:10:04.441 --> 02:10:04.670
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

2909
02:10:04.690 --> 02:10:09.690
<v Speaker 7>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not the people who have been there </v>

2910
02:10:09.690 --> 02:10:09.690
<v Speaker 7>and studied it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No one disagrees,</v>

2911
02:10:09.690 --> 02:10:12.890
<v Speaker 7>Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's out of control at a prison </v>

2912
02:10:12.890 --> 02:10:12.890
<v Speaker 7>country.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2913
02:10:12.890 --> 02:10:14.710
<v Speaker 7>They're all in prison by the show.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's,</v>

2914
02:10:15.310 --> 02:10:17.800
<v Speaker 7>there's no show and Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they do.</v>

2915
02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:21.290
<v Speaker 7>They do and it is scary,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they're a minor league problem,</v>

2916
02:10:21.291 --> 02:10:23.300
<v Speaker 7>like in comparison to a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 7>problems that are in the line.</v>

2917
02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:27.130
<v Speaker 7>I don't believe that because CNN pushes </v>
<v Speaker 7>it so everybody approaches it.</v>

2918
02:10:27.140 --> 02:10:32.140
<v Speaker 7>Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think there's no one out there that's </v>

2919
02:10:32.140 --> 02:10:32.140
<v Speaker 7>saying that North Korea is not a </v>
<v Speaker 7>military threat.</v>

2920
02:10:32.140 --> 02:10:33.190
<v Speaker 7>Are there not some sort of a military </v>
<v Speaker 7>dictatorship?</v>

2921
02:10:33.230 --> 02:10:34.250
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a distraction</v>

2922
02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:39.380
<v Speaker 3>thing on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's that many people </v>

2923
02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:40.840
<v Speaker 3>out there and never invaded anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've invaded the country,</v>

2924
02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:45.140
<v Speaker 3>but this guy's still a psychopath that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>running this whole country in 2017.</v>

2925
02:10:45.380 --> 02:10:49.520
<v Speaker 3>That scares the fuck out of psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we got a lot of people did Michael.</v>

2926
02:10:49.521 --> 02:10:51.680
<v Speaker 3>Malice does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an author that I had on the podcast</v>

2927
02:10:51.681 --> 02:10:53.210
<v Speaker 3>that wrote a book about Kim Jong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uhm,</v>

2928
02:10:53.690 --> 02:10:56.130
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was describing was a una ill,</v>

2929
02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:59.060
<v Speaker 3>ill isn't a new guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2930
02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:01.430
<v Speaker 3>that's the young guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kim.</v>

2931
02:11:01.490 --> 02:11:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Kim Jong Un is the dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dad.</v>

2932
02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:06.860
<v Speaker 3>The Dad is the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The new one.</v>

2933
02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:07.590
<v Speaker 3>The new one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2934
02:11:07.690 --> 02:11:10.760
<v Speaker 3>so that was Kim Jong Il,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's called dear reader.</v>

2935
02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:15.900
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good book and interesting to find </v>

2936
02:11:15.900 --> 02:11:18.521
<v Speaker 3>out how fucked up it is over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a system that's set up so that </v>

2937
02:11:18.521 --> 02:11:19.880
<v Speaker 3>everybody's in prison by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody tells on everybody else,</v>

2938
02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:25.240
<v Speaker 3>like their setup to tell on each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the people that have escaped and </v>

2939
02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:28.910
<v Speaker 3>they've left and gone to South Korea and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll tell the stories about the </v>

2940
02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:28.910
<v Speaker 3>prison camps.</v>

2941
02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:29.730
<v Speaker 3>People are born in prison camps over </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2942
02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:31.670
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think their prisoner actors.</v>

2943
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:32.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

2944
02:11:32.691 --> 02:11:35.900
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get mad because I say that.</v>

2945
02:11:35.901 --> 02:11:40.901
<v Speaker 3>Why am I going to get killed for saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>a whole group of the whole country's a </v>

2946
02:11:40.901 --> 02:11:44.831
<v Speaker 3>bunch of actors to getting a check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the presenters and they're </v>

2947
02:11:44.831 --> 02:11:44.831
<v Speaker 3>forced to do parades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2948
02:11:44.831 --> 02:11:46.340
<v Speaker 3>they're definitely prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They definitely forced to pray.</v>

2949
02:11:46.341 --> 02:11:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2950
02:11:47.060 --> 02:11:48.950
<v Speaker 3>like the whole country's a prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2951
02:11:48.951 --> 02:11:49.790
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I said,</v>

2952
02:11:49.791 --> 02:11:52.460
<v Speaker 3>but they're not actors acting when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're being filmed.</v>

2953
02:11:52.461 --> 02:11:54.020
<v Speaker 3>The guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're acting.</v>

2954
02:11:54.170 --> 02:11:56.870
<v Speaker 3>They're not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not being sincere.</v>

2955
02:11:56.871 --> 02:11:58.970
<v Speaker 3>They're acting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're forced to act the prisoners.</v>

2956
02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:04.480
<v Speaker 3>But wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that this country is under </v>

2957
02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:07.301
<v Speaker 3>the control of a military dictatorship </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everyone's terrified of doing </v>

2958
02:12:07.301 --> 02:12:07.340
<v Speaker 3>anything wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think that.</v>

2959
02:12:07.341 --> 02:12:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you think that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>In what way they're.</v>

2963
02:12:15.670 --> 02:12:19.220
<v Speaker 3>They're acting like they're in love with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kim Jong.</v>

2964
02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:20.630
<v Speaker 3>Terrified.</v>

2966
02:12:21.670 --> 02:12:23.630
<v Speaker 3>that's they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were arrested.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Not crying hard enough like people did </v>

<v Speaker 3>get the same haircut.</v>

2971
02:12:38.630 --> 02:12:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Look into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

2972
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:44.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a fake story that everyone thinks</v>

2973
02:12:44.031 --> 02:12:49.031
<v Speaker 3>is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he got a haircut and he made every </v>

<v Speaker 3>get killed or something or get thrown in</v>

2975

<v Speaker 3>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never saw that you.</v>

2976
02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:57.420
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe did maybe that gangster high top </v>

2977
02:12:57.420 --> 02:13:01.010
<v Speaker 3>fade or die because motherfuckers don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>like high top fade or die.</v>

2978
02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:01.850
<v Speaker 3>They don't have shit.</v>

2979
02:13:01.850 --> 02:13:04.220
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean they don't have nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons?</v>

2980
02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:05.810
<v Speaker 3>You don't think so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2981
02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:08.540
<v Speaker 3>let's just bring you to a Washington DC </v>
<v Speaker 3>and clean this up.</v>

2982
02:13:08.590 --> 02:13:09.560
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

2983
02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:11.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2984
02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:13.640
<v Speaker 3>robin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trillions of dollars I think.</v>

2985
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:18.910
<v Speaker 3>I think you should not believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything coming from the mainstream </v>

2986
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:18.910
<v Speaker 3>media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>

2987
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:20.660
<v Speaker 3>If they're all pushing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it can't be the truth.</v>

2988
02:13:21.390 --> 02:13:26.390
<v Speaker 3>North Korea themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they definitely launched a </v>

2989
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:28.871
<v Speaker 3>missile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The missile they launched yesterday say </v>

2990
02:13:28.871 --> 02:13:28.871
<v Speaker 3>they don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2991
02:13:28.871 --> 02:13:29.550
<v Speaker 3>Who's they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they said.</v>

2992
02:13:29.570 --> 02:13:31.550
<v Speaker 3>That Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>

2993
02:13:31.930 --> 02:13:33.300
<v Speaker 3>They're all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all mainstream media.</v>

2994
02:13:33.420 --> 02:13:35.790
<v Speaker 3>So do you think they're all in on it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a distraction.</v>

2995
02:13:35.791 --> 02:13:40.791
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some serious shit going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on in Washington DC and they need that </v>

2996
02:13:40.791 --> 02:13:40.791
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2997
02:13:40.791 --> 02:13:44.280
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sending out missiles again and </v>

2998
02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:44.280
<v Speaker 3>everyone's afraid of world war three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's two gangs.</v>

2999
02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:50.480
<v Speaker 3>Not Anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've invaded 30 countries or 20 or 30 </v>

3000
02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:50.760
<v Speaker 3>countries since the Korean War.</v>

3001
02:13:50.850 --> 02:13:55.850
<v Speaker 3>We've killed millions of innocent people</v>
<v Speaker 3>on some bullshit ass wars and we're </v>

3002
02:13:55.850 --> 02:13:58.010
<v Speaker 3>worried about North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>

3003
02:13:58.020 --> 02:13:58.950
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

3004
02:13:58.951 --> 02:14:03.951
<v Speaker 3>that we're brainwashed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe they are a military </v>

3005
02:14:03.951 --> 02:14:05.820
<v Speaker 3>dictatorship with nuclear power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very suspect experts.</v>

3006
02:14:05.850 --> 02:14:09.300
<v Speaker 3>Latest North Korean missile could strike</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boston in New York City.</v>

3007
02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:11.010
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Skeptical.</v>

3008
02:14:11.011 --> 02:14:12.360
<v Speaker 3>Hippo face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3009
02:14:12.590 --> 02:14:14.310
<v Speaker 3>this is a trap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3010
02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:16.930
<v Speaker 3>Got a beautiful haircut though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

3011
02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know in the Korean War we made </v>

3012
02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:22.630
<v Speaker 3>this mainstream news?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We made 18 cities disappearing.</v>

3013
02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:24.700
<v Speaker 3>It was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they did,</v>

3014
02:14:24.970 --> 02:14:29.970
<v Speaker 3>they made the Soviets get the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Soviets left and and after the </v>

3015
02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:32.940
<v Speaker 3>Korean War,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States was like,</v>

3016
02:14:32.941 --> 02:14:34.830
<v Speaker 3>what are we going to do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>China says we'll take over.</v>

3017
02:14:34.890 --> 02:14:37.830
<v Speaker 3>So since the Korean War,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hasn't been officially Soviets.</v>

3018
02:14:37.831 --> 02:14:40.860
<v Speaker 3>The Soviets officially left and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>China took over.</v>

3019
02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:43.860
<v Speaker 3>They kind of manage it and govern it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it does.</v>

3020
02:14:43.890 --> 02:14:47.280
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just like a little prison </v>
<v Speaker 3>country that they use to.</v>

3021
02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:49.200
<v Speaker 3>They used as the bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

3022
02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:52.800
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be surprised if Kim junk </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't even live in Korea.</v>

3023
02:14:53.670 --> 02:14:55.300
<v Speaker 3>Just all Hologram does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>

3024
02:14:55.301 --> 02:14:58.170
<v Speaker 3>Just take videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you watch the videos easily faked,</v>

3025
02:14:58.230 --> 02:15:00.180
<v Speaker 3>easily fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no proof of anything.</v>

3026
02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:01.950
<v Speaker 3>There's no proof of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

3027
02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:04.320
<v Speaker 3>They're showing video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but missile going up.</v>

3028
02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that after they still in </v>

3029
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:10.230
<v Speaker 3>trillions of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we we shouldn't believe shed a smart man</v>

3030
02:15:10.231 --> 02:15:14.340
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't believe shit that the missiles </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are getting launched in the area.</v>

3031
02:15:14.370 --> 02:15:17.610
<v Speaker 3>So all the people like missiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>missiles say that.</v>

3032
02:15:18.130 --> 02:15:23.130
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I assume they don't have </v>

3033
02:15:23.130 --> 02:15:23.130
<v Speaker 3>missiles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we thought they.</v>

3034
02:15:23.130 --> 02:15:24.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about North Korea.</v>

3035
02:15:24.001 --> 02:15:26.610
<v Speaker 3>They have missiles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they tell you,</v>

3036
02:15:26.730 --> 02:15:28.620
<v Speaker 3>that the Russians and the Russian sell </v>
<v Speaker 3>them shit.</v>

3037
02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:31.620
<v Speaker 3>That's what the Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Russians,</v>

3038
02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:34.620
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say they who's they?</v>

3039
02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:38.300
<v Speaker 3>The same people that stole the trillions</v>
<v Speaker 3>of dollars,</v>

3040
02:15:38.301 --> 02:15:40.970
<v Speaker 3>stole the trillions are also running CNN</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3041
02:15:41.010 --> 02:15:42.930
<v Speaker 3>It's all connected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all connected.</v>

3042
02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Definitely that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the truth.</v>

3043
02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:46.530
<v Speaker 3>They are all connected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>

3044
02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:51.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can have everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected if they're going back and </v>

3045
02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:51.620
<v Speaker 3>forth with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3046
02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:52.440
<v Speaker 3>look what's happening in between Fox </v>
<v Speaker 3>News and CNN,</v>

3047
02:15:52.650 --> 02:15:53.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at,</v>

3048
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:54.480
<v Speaker 3>look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the,</v>

3049
02:15:54.481 --> 02:15:54.750
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3050
02:15:54.751 --> 02:15:58.250
<v Speaker 3>the internal battery gets fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3051
02:15:58.290 --> 02:16:03.290
<v Speaker 3>He was a Republican and Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fake fucking and not really in </v>

3052
02:16:03.290 --> 02:16:05.010
<v Speaker 3>competition with each other either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't care who gets more ratings,</v>

3053
02:16:05.011 --> 02:16:07.170
<v Speaker 3>more money individually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Individually.</v>

3054
02:16:07.171 --> 02:16:09.570
<v Speaker 3>People are worried about their own check</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their own family.</v>

3055
02:16:09.690 --> 02:16:10.860
<v Speaker 3>So individually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

3056
02:16:11.070 --> 02:16:16.070
<v Speaker 3>but at the top it's just a show and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't believe she had coming from them </v>

3057
02:16:16.070 --> 02:16:17.790
<v Speaker 3>too much fake and six moon landings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

3058
02:16:17.791 --> 02:16:18.660
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me ask you this.</v>

3059
02:16:18.990 --> 02:16:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where do you think.</v>

3060
02:16:20.980 --> 02:16:25.980
<v Speaker 3>Because one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened for sure is as time has moved </v>

3061
02:16:25.980 --> 02:16:29.451
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as technology has gotten more and more </v>

3062
02:16:29.451 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 3>powerful and the ability to do all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that</v>

3063
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:35.010
<v Speaker 1>we can do now with our phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the information that you can get </v>

3064
02:16:35.010 --> 02:16:37.471
<v Speaker 1>like almost instantly with your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when is it going to reach a point </v>

3065
02:16:37.471 --> 02:16:40.891
<v Speaker 1>where no one has any control over anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else because it seems to me that that's </v>

3066
02:16:40.891 --> 02:16:45.421
<v Speaker 1>inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems to me that the idea of these big </v>

3067
02:16:45.421 --> 02:16:48.250
<v Speaker 1>units of these big groups having control</v>
<v Speaker 1>over massive amounts of people.</v>

3068
02:16:48.490 --> 02:16:53.490
<v Speaker 1>I think at a certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if technology keeps moving the way it </v>

3069
02:16:53.490 --> 02:16:57.121
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more people have more and more </v>

3070

02:21:50.340 --> 02:21:54.030
<v Speaker 5>but apparently adrenalize blood is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>most potent,</v>

3184
02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:56.980
<v Speaker 5>so they scare the kids and they kill him</v>
<v Speaker 5>and suck.</v>

3185
02:21:57.050 --> 02:22:00.180
<v Speaker 5>Either they drink their blood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a conspiracy theory.</v>

3186
02:22:00.270 --> 02:22:04.470
<v Speaker 5>That's a conspiracy theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're already seeing this with.</v>

3187
02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:07.180
<v Speaker 5>We're being well being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Slowly get.</v>

3188
02:22:07.750 --> 02:22:10.590
<v Speaker 5>If the blood is good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for old people,</v>

3189
02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:14.580
<v Speaker 5>I bet some billionaire is going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about booking toddler blood?</v>

3190
02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:17.790
<v Speaker 5>What about that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about newborn baby blood?</v>

3191
02:22:17.940 --> 02:22:20.000
<v Speaker 5>I bet they're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think about</v>

3192
02:22:20.050 --> 02:22:21.820
<v Speaker 7>stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Thing about stem cells.</v>

3193
02:22:21.821 --> 02:22:26.821
<v Speaker 7>Getting placental stem cells would think</v>
<v Speaker 7>about all the kidnaps or embryotic </v>

3194
02:22:26.821 --> 02:22:29.310
<v Speaker 7>700,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>to a million kidnaps a year,</v>

3195
02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:34.670
<v Speaker 7>so I think they're just taking babies </v>
<v Speaker 7>and using them to make rich people stay </v>

3196
02:22:34.670 --> 02:22:37.791
<v Speaker 7>alive forever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What if you were rich and fucking </v>

3197
02:22:37.791 --> 02:22:37.980
<v Speaker 7>psychopath kid you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>We'll let you do that.</v>

3198
02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:43.040
<v Speaker 7>We can use crispr to artificially </v>
<v Speaker 7>engineered a bunch of headless kids and </v>

3199
02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:45.150
<v Speaker 7>you take the blood out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Didn't even know you got it.</v>

3200
02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:48.810
<v Speaker 7>Blood is working right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't want you to think baby blood would</v>

3201
02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:50.070
<v Speaker 7>be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It wouldn't be a shock.</v>

3202
02:22:50.071 --> 02:22:52.200
<v Speaker 7>Or if you found out that baby blood is </v>
<v Speaker 7>the best,</v>

3203
02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:54.150
<v Speaker 7>right you this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>would that be a shock?</v>

3204
02:22:54.180 --> 02:22:58.110
<v Speaker 7>Is it immoral to have a warehouse filled</v>
<v Speaker 7>with headless fake kids?</v>

3205
02:22:58.410 --> 02:23:00.430
<v Speaker 7>They don't have any head.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They never did have a hat.</v>

3206
02:23:00.450 --> 02:23:05.450
<v Speaker 7>They were engineered with Crispr to have</v>
<v Speaker 7>no head and you have them hooked up to </v>

3207
02:23:05.450 --> 02:23:09.081
<v Speaker 7>this thing and there's still some blood </v>
<v Speaker 7>into these vats and you go there and </v>

3208
02:23:09.081 --> 02:23:13.551
<v Speaker 7>they tap you and you have to like look </v>
<v Speaker 7>up and recognize that these artificial </v>

3209
02:23:13.551 --> 02:23:13.710
<v Speaker 7>people got to be real blood.</v>

3210
02:23:13.900 --> 02:23:15.330
<v Speaker 7>If blood,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're real people,</v>

3211
02:23:15.331 --> 02:23:18.330
<v Speaker 7>they just don't have any heads.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they never have a chance to be alive.</v>

3212
02:23:18.331 --> 02:23:20.910
<v Speaker 7>They're connected to some machine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is this a movie?</v>

3213
02:23:21.270 --> 02:23:22.260
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

3214
02:23:22.350 --> 02:23:25.080
<v Speaker 7>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's kind of like the Matrix,</v>

3215
02:23:25.081 --> 02:23:26.880
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kind of like the Matrix but,</v>

3216
02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:32.000
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we already know teen blood is </v>

3217
02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.340
<v Speaker 7>helping old people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's 25 year olds is what they </v>

3218
02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:37.131
<v Speaker 7>said for an adult with based on the fact</v>
<v Speaker 7>that teen blood is better than getting </v>

3219
02:23:37.171 --> 02:23:38.430
<v Speaker 7>like a 50 year old black.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

3220
02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:39.570
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

3221
02:23:39.571 --> 02:23:44.571
<v Speaker 7>So that's what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Toddler blood would be better than team </v>

3222
02:23:44.571 --> 02:23:44.571
<v Speaker 7>black.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3223
02:23:44.571 --> 02:23:45.690
<v Speaker 7>here's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe you're right.</v>

3224
02:23:45.900 --> 02:23:47.010
<v Speaker 7>Here's the other thing that goes the </v>
<v Speaker 7>other way,</v>

3225
02:23:47.011 --> 02:23:50.130
<v Speaker 7>which is even more fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They took the blood of old mice and they</v>

3226
02:23:50.131 --> 02:23:53.490
<v Speaker 7>put it into to the young mice and the </v>
<v Speaker 7>young man started acting old,</v>

3227
02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:56.880
<v Speaker 7>which is kind of fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

3228
02:23:57.160 --> 02:24:00.240
<v Speaker 7>Like there's something in the blood and </v>
<v Speaker 7>they're trying to isolate what it is.</v>

3229
02:24:00.241 --> 02:24:03.060
<v Speaker 7>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like it just makes sense.</v>

3230
02:24:03.061 --> 02:24:04.220
<v Speaker 7>It's easy to believe like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

3231
02:24:04.230 --> 02:24:06.810
<v Speaker 7>young blood is probably better than old </v>
<v Speaker 7>blood.</v>

3232
02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:08.250
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's probably better.</v>

3233
02:24:08.350 --> 02:24:10.290
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's where everything comes from.</v>

3234
02:24:10.291 --> 02:24:13.250
<v Speaker 7>It comes from the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everything could blood is this.</v>

3235
02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:15.960
<v Speaker 7>Cannabis reverses aging process in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>brain.</v>

3236
02:24:15.961 --> 02:24:20.070
<v Speaker 7>Studies suggest researchers restore the </v>
<v Speaker 7>memory performance of Methuselah,</v>

3237
02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:26.220
<v Speaker 7>methuselah mice to a juvenile stage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>

3238
02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:29.190
<v Speaker 7>Regressed to a two month old.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>

3239
02:24:29.550 --> 02:24:31.830
<v Speaker 7>Using a cannabis active ingredient.</v>

3240
02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:33.170
<v Speaker 11>Whoa.</v>

3241
02:24:34.370 --> 02:24:35.810
<v Speaker 7>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>

3242
02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:40.310
<v Speaker 7>Treatment opens up new options when it </v>
<v Speaker 7>comes to treating dementia.</v>

3243
02:24:40.610 --> 02:24:42.890
<v Speaker 7>Now imagine if we read was what you </v>
<v Speaker 7>needed.</v>

3244
02:24:43.130 --> 02:24:45.590
<v Speaker 7>I just hardcore edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We need to act.</v>

3245
02:24:45.650 --> 02:24:48.050
<v Speaker 7>Ask Joey some questions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He does have some stories.</v>

3246
02:24:48.060 --> 02:24:53.060
<v Speaker 7>We know for a fact that cannabis </v>
<v Speaker 7>basically like 90 percent cure seizures </v>

3247
02:24:54.471 --> 02:24:58.700
<v Speaker 7>and kids and and even in animals,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a dog dogs that have seizures.</v>

3248
02:24:58.850 --> 02:25:01.580
<v Speaker 7>You give him some cannabis oil,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but let me ask you this,</v>

3249
02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:03.950
<v Speaker 7>why does it fuck with your memory?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How come when we're high?</v>

3250
02:25:03.951 --> 02:25:05.390
<v Speaker 7>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck was I just talking about?</v>

3251
02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:09.270
<v Speaker 7>My theory is this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like there's a difference between a</v>

3252
02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:13.790
<v Speaker 7>forgetting something and misplacing </v>
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>

3253
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:17.660
<v Speaker 7>Like when you go out to vegas and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>get hammered and you black out,</v>

3254
02:25:18.050 --> 02:25:23.050
<v Speaker 7>there's no way someone's going to say </v>
<v Speaker 7>anything to you that's going to make </v>

3255
02:25:23.050 --> 02:25:24.310
<v Speaker 7>that memory come back of this or that.</v>

3256
02:25:24.330 --> 02:25:25.030
<v Speaker 5>They can say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3257
02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:30.120
<v Speaker 5>and then you grow and then you grabbed </v>
<v Speaker 5>her and then you picked her up and then </v>

3258
02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:30.120
<v Speaker 5>you told to get the fuck out of here and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

3259
02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:30.190
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember any of that.</v>

3260
02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:35.340
<v Speaker 5>You lost your memory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even them reminding you and telling you </v>

3261
02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:35.710
<v Speaker 5>about what happened there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You lost your memory,</v>

3262
02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:38.610
<v Speaker 5>but now when you're stone and you've got</v>
<v Speaker 5>all this shit going on,</v>

3263
02:25:38.660 --> 02:25:39.390
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3264
02:25:39.820 --> 02:25:43.060
<v Speaker 5>we'd make blood rushes to your head so </v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got so much shit going on.</v>

3265
02:25:43.150 --> 02:25:46.000
<v Speaker 5>Shit gets misplaced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You forgot what you were talking about,</v>

3266
02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:48.370
<v Speaker 5>but if someone reminds you of what you </v>
<v Speaker 5>were talking about,</v>

3267
02:25:48.490 --> 02:25:49.060
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3268
02:25:49.061 --> 02:25:50.710
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you're back on track.</v>

3269
02:25:50.860 --> 02:25:54.010
<v Speaker 5>You didn't eat any booze in that respect</v>
<v Speaker 5>because.</v>

3270
02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:59.160
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a difference between actually a </v>

3271
02:25:59.160 --> 02:25:59.770
<v Speaker 5>forgetting something and not remembering</v>
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>

3272
02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:01.120
<v Speaker 5>It just complete.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did it.</v>

3273
02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:01.780
<v Speaker 5>You were drunk.</v>

3274
02:26:01.810 --> 02:26:03.190
<v Speaker 5>You did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't remember it.</v>

3275
02:26:03.390 --> 02:26:05.560
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing anybody can do to bring </v>
<v Speaker 5>it back.</v>

3276
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:07.690
<v Speaker 5>They can tell you all about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could watch it on video.</v>

3277
02:26:07.810 --> 02:26:12.810
<v Speaker 5>It ain't coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the memory of you watching the </v>

3278
02:26:12.810 --> 02:26:12.810
<v Speaker 5>video will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will,</v>

3279
02:26:12.810 --> 02:26:12.810
<v Speaker 5>will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will stay in your brain,</v>

3280
02:26:12.810 --> 02:26:15.570
<v Speaker 5>but no memories of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's never coming back with weed.</v>

3281
02:26:15.910 --> 02:26:18.220
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about all this shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have.</v>

3282
02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:23.240
<v Speaker 5>It's you start,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you start digressing and moving to this </v>

3283
02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:23.240
<v Speaker 5>and jumping all over the place and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what did I just say?</v>

3284
02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:25.390
<v Speaker 5>If someone reminded you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll come back.</v>

3285
02:26:25.391 --> 02:26:26.080
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3286
02:26:26.081 --> 02:26:27.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember ever talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3287
02:26:27.551 --> 02:26:28.720
<v Speaker 5>You were just talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3288
02:26:28.721 --> 02:26:30.250
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's different.</v>

3289
02:26:30.260 --> 02:26:35.260
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget sometimes when I'm talking </v>

3290
02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:35.260
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't feel yet.</v>

3291
02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:36.340
<v Speaker 5>Moments or instances or facts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you were blackout drunk,</v>

3292
02:26:36.341 --> 02:26:38.460
<v Speaker 5>you were a couple of times.</v>

3293
02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:40.200
<v Speaker 5>Hey Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Coffees,</v>

3294
02:26:40.220 --> 02:26:41.370
<v Speaker 5>those little things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3295
02:26:41.380 --> 02:26:44.260
<v Speaker 5>Everybody has gotten those moments </v>
<v Speaker 5>where.</v>

3296
02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:49.360
<v Speaker 5>Lockout,</v>

02:33:35.231 --> 02:33:37.450
<v Speaker 4>So I'm looking at this video up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not brand new,</v>

3461
02:33:37.451 --> 02:33:42.451
<v Speaker 4>which I thought it was brand new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This lady was living in this guy's </v>

3462
02:33:42.451 --> 02:33:45.001
<v Speaker 4>addict for a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a year and the way he found out </v>

3463
02:33:45.001 --> 02:33:48.100
<v Speaker 4>as he put a camera in because he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>finding food missing from his apartment.</v>

3464
02:33:48.130 --> 02:33:53.130
<v Speaker 4>Like in this kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this lady was living in his attic and </v>

3465
02:33:53.130 --> 02:33:53.130
<v Speaker 4>climbing down when he was gone to like </v>
<v Speaker 4>take it.</v>

3466
02:33:53.310 --> 02:33:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Shower food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a year.</v>

3467
02:33:59.251 --> 02:34:00.990
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it might've been a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer.</v>

3468
02:34:00.991 --> 02:34:03.720
<v Speaker 3>It could have been a little less like 54</v>
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>

3469
02:34:04.260 --> 02:34:06.870

<v Speaker 7>I wonder how often that happens.</v>

3543
02:37:21.620 --> 02:37:25.760
<v Speaker 7>It's not unusual to find unwelcome bats,</v>
<v Speaker 7>squirrels or termites in the attic,</v>

3544
02:37:26.570 --> 02:37:28.100

3550
02:37:41.441 --> 02:37:43.870
<v Speaker 4>This happened a few times to other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3551

3554
02:37:52.310 --> 02:37:54.021

<v Speaker 7>bringing food home and they changed the </v>
<v Speaker 7>locks and then they say,</v>

<v Speaker 7>and then you have to.</v>

3558
02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:03.480

<v Speaker 7>to prove that it's your house.</v>

02:39:14.921 --> 02:39:18.640
<v Speaker 7>she was about to move in some woman who </v>
<v Speaker 7>had just moved in and she had been there</v>

3590
02:39:18.641 --> 02:39:21.370
<v Speaker 7>for like two weeks and she changed the </v>
<v Speaker 7>locks and she was like,</v>

3591

02:39:26.371 --> 02:39:29.100

<v Speaker 7>Is it a scam or is it real?</v>

3593
02:39:29.101 --> 02:39:34.101
<v Speaker 7>It could be a scam on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Could be she's lying or it could be </v>

3594
02:39:34.101 --> 02:39:37.771
<v Speaker 7>someone ran a scam on her and got her to</v>
<v Speaker 7>pay rent for a house and she really </v>

<v Speaker 7>It's funny</v>

3673
02:43:12.930 --> 02:43:14.400
<v Speaker 1>with bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be hanging out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He wasn't just hanging out with bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was hanging out with them deep into </v>

3675
02:43:19.410 --> 02:43:22.231
<v Speaker 1>the late season were the only ones that </v>

<v Speaker 1>where the starving ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was in a danger zone.</v>

3677
02:43:24.130 --> 02:43:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Like most of the time those bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're around bears that are </v>

3678
02:43:29.130 --> 02:43:29.130
<v Speaker 1>eating salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even in danger.</v>

<v Speaker 7>animals and they're one of the rare </v>

3752
02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:56.180
<v Speaker 7>animals that only eats meat,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like they only killed things.</v>

3753
02:46:56.450 --> 02:47:01.450
<v Speaker 7>Like what do bears eat?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Berries and she got a polar bear versus </v>

3754
02:47:01.450 --> 02:47:01.450

3757
02:47:09.131 --> 02:47:09.131
<v Speaker 7>fuck them up in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They swim and swim that good.</v>

3758

<v Speaker 7>lion that's guarding or cubs pair in the</v>

3767

<v Speaker 7>They just take this captured mountain </v>
<v Speaker 7>lion and bear and they just,</v>

<v Speaker 7>She's just trying to keep that therapy </v>

3772
02:47:42.070 --> 02:47:45.410
<v Speaker 7>for the kids because if you just have </v>
<v Speaker 7>cameras set up where a mountain lion </v>

<v Speaker 7>stay away,</v>

3774
02:47:47.271 --> 02:47:48.500
<v Speaker 7>use a zoom lens.</v>

3775
02:47:48.500 --> 02:47:49.730
<v Speaker 7>There's a bunch of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3776
02:47:49.731 --> 02:47:54.731
<v Speaker 7>they've gotten a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 7>really incredible encounters between </v>

3777
02:47:54.731 --> 02:47:57.890
<v Speaker 7>animals just by filming hundreds and </v>
<v Speaker 7>hundreds and hundreds of hours.</v>

3778
02:47:58.220 --> 02:47:59.900
<v Speaker 7>You stay in the field for months at a </v>
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>

3779
02:47:59.901 --> 02:48:03.200
<v Speaker 7>You see things like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look at this lion and the bear.</v>

3780
02:48:03.500 --> 02:48:05.420
<v Speaker 7>Those are some good camera angles,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so get this,</v>

02:48:05.421 --> 02:48:07.970
<v Speaker 7>but that's a black bear.</v>

<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>

3783
02:48:10.490 --> 02:48:15.490
<v Speaker 7>That's not a big bear.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a small bear and a big line </v>

<v Speaker 7>Somebody put them together.</v>

3787
02:48:19.010 --> 02:48:20.570
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no other way.</v>

3788
02:48:21.450 --> 02:48:25.500
<v Speaker 7>Black lines are only in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The pairs are only in North America.</v>

3789
02:48:25.501 --> 02:48:26.760

<v Speaker 6>I think they're just go to back.</v>

3812
02:49:24.850 --> 02:49:29.850
<v Speaker 6>What about a full grown chimp versus a </v>

<v Speaker 6>Especially the cats.</v>

3816
02:49:35.651 --> 02:49:38.920
<v Speaker 6>Bigger like a full grown cat can be like</v>
<v Speaker 6>900 pounds.</v>

3817
02:49:38.921 --> 02:49:40.480
<v Speaker 6>Plus Hydros can swim,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3818

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do they go into water?</v>

3819
02:49:42.010 --> 02:49:43.270
<v Speaker 6>They could swim underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3820
02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:46.800
<v Speaker 6>Tiger versus great white.</v>

3822
02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:51.910
<v Speaker 6>always go for cat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the great white,</v>

3823
02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:52.490
<v Speaker 6>so much bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Still a cat.</v>

3824
02:49:55.930 --> 02:50:00.700
<v Speaker 6>There's a picture of a surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think a tiger would take a fucking.</v>

3825
02:50:00.790 --> 02:50:02.380
<v Speaker 6>They're taken out.</v>

<v Speaker 6>White.</v>

3827
02:50:03.911 --> 02:50:05.650

<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>

3828
02:50:05.740 --> 02:50:10.740
<v Speaker 6>They try to eat cages and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they'd be able to do </v>

3829
02:50:10.740 --> 02:50:11.440
<v Speaker 6>anything with it though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's too much.</v>

02:50:11.710 --> 02:50:12.370
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>They figured out that you could swim </v>

3834
02:50:21.290 --> 02:50:24.361
<v Speaker 6>with all sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now the sharks are like if it hit them </v>

3835
02:50:24.361 --> 02:50:28.531
<v Speaker 6>at the right time or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could swim with sharks except for </v>

3901
02:53:18.350 --> 02:53:21.540
<v Speaker 6>The other one right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He has no idea.</v>

3902
02:53:21.990 --> 02:53:23.700
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's right there.</v>

3904
02:53:27.720 --> 02:53:30.300
<v Speaker 6>Wave.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that is right underneath them.</v>

3905
02:53:31.080 --> 02:53:33.600
<v Speaker 6>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck all that.</v>

02:53:34.380 --> 02:53:36.240
<v Speaker 6>He has no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He has no idea.</v>

3907
02:53:36.241 --> 02:53:39.810

<v Speaker 6>You sharks all the time.</v>

3909
02:53:42.391 --> 02:53:47.391
<v Speaker 6>They were about to go on some surfer and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then they take a fucking wave and he </v>

3910
02:53:47.391 --> 02:53:51.301
<v Speaker 6>saved his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do they probably are near death often.</v>

3911
02:53:54.120 --> 02:53:57.690
<v Speaker 6>Those guys are so gangster guys like </v>
<v Speaker 6>Kelly slater and.</v>

3912
02:53:58.410 --> 02:53:59.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck that.</v>

<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3914
02:54:02.020 --> 02:54:04.080
<v Speaker 6>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know that's brainwashed.</v>

3915
02:54:04.081 --> 02:54:05.100
<v Speaker 6>All that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it worked.</v>

3916
02:54:05.240 --> 02:54:08.090
<v Speaker 6>I was brainwashed as a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This</v>

3917
02:54:08.100 --> 02:54:08.890
<v Speaker 7>was about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3918
02:54:08.891 --> 02:54:13.891
<v Speaker 7>when it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the inspiration was some real </v>

3919
02:54:13.891 --> 02:54:16.951
<v Speaker 7>shark.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was real shark attack in </v>

3920
02:54:16.951 --> 02:54:16.951
<v Speaker 7>freshwater.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's real crazy.</v>

3921
02:54:16.951 --> 02:54:17.220
<v Speaker 7>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a shark,</v>

3922
02:54:17.300 --> 02:54:22.300
<v Speaker 7>a bull shark that swims from the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 7>up rivers into fresh water and can get </v>

3923
02:54:22.300 --> 02:54:26.761
<v Speaker 7>as far north as Illinois and then the </v>
<v Speaker 7>most aggressive sharks day and they </v>

3924
02:54:26.761 --> 02:54:28.750
<v Speaker 7>killed a bunch of people in a river in </v>
<v Speaker 7>New Jersey.</v>

3925
02:54:29.890 --> 02:54:34.890
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it was like the early 19 </v>

3926
02:54:34.890 --> 02:54:36.961
<v Speaker 7>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want to say like the 19 thirties or </v>

3927
02:54:36.961 --> 02:54:38.971
<v Speaker 7>some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They killed a bunch of people in our </v>

3928
02:54:38.971 --> 02:54:39.660
<v Speaker 7>fresh water river in New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so these people would be swimming.</v>

3929
02:54:39.670 --> 02:54:40.670
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's go swimming.</v>

3930
02:54:40.700 --> 02:54:41.530
<v Speaker 7>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everybody,</v>

3931
02:54:41.531 --> 02:54:43.600
<v Speaker 7>and they didn't know shit back then and </v>
<v Speaker 7>then just see.</v>

3932
02:54:43.610 --> 02:54:48.250
<v Speaker 7>Just just get torn apart by sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it had happened.</v>

3933
02:54:48.251 --> 02:54:49.480
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>where's that one?</v>

3934
02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:54.970
<v Speaker 7>Indiana side of the Ohio River,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the Indiana side of the Ohio River.</v>

3935
02:54:55.030 --> 02:54:57.520
<v Speaker 7>And they catch a fucking bull shark.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you?</v>

3936
02:54:57.530 --> 02:54:59.530
<v Speaker 7>Not Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That is that thing.</v>

3937
02:54:59.531 --> 02:55:03.530
<v Speaker 7>Got All the way up the river in fresh </v>
<v Speaker 7>water.</v>

3938
02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:05.810
<v Speaker 7>They're the only shark that we know that</v>
<v Speaker 7>can do that.</v>

3939
02:55:05.811 --> 02:55:07.670
<v Speaker 7>And Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Weirdly,</v>

3940
02:55:07.671 --> 02:55:12.671
<v Speaker 7>it's one of the most aggressive sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think we know of any other </v>

3941
02:55:12.671 --> 02:55:12.830
<v Speaker 7>sharks that go up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fresh water like that.</v>

3942
02:55:12.831 --> 02:55:14.180
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not the only one.</v>

3943
02:55:15.950 --> 02:55:18.560
<v Speaker 7>I think that's the only one to travel up</v>
<v Speaker 7>rivers.</v>

3944
02:55:18.561 --> 02:55:21.890
<v Speaker 7>They have been known to travel as far up</v>
<v Speaker 7>as Indiana in the Ohio River.</v>

3945
02:55:21.891 --> 02:55:26.891
<v Speaker 7>Although I've been recorded attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're probably responsible for the </v>

3946
02:55:26.891 --> 02:55:30.641
<v Speaker 7>majority of nearshore shark attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>including many attacks attributed to </v>

3947
02:55:30.641 --> 02:55:34.370
<v Speaker 7>other sharks and see if he could find </v>
<v Speaker 7>the inspiration for the movie jaws,</v>

3948
02:55:35.510 --> 02:55:39.380
<v Speaker 7>Shark attacks in New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because it was all in fresh water.</v>

3949
02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:42.680
<v Speaker 7>That's what's fucked up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't even like the movie jaws where</v>

3950
02:55:42.681 --> 02:55:46.500
<v Speaker 7>it was actually in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like these people had no idea that.</v>

3951
02:55:46.550 --> 02:55:49.340
<v Speaker 7>No idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nineteen 16.</v>

3952
02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:54.170
<v Speaker 7>Imagine all that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People were like babies back then.</v>

3953
02:55:54.500 --> 02:55:59.500
<v Speaker 7>They didn't know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They just landed on the coast of </v>

3954
02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:00.320
<v Speaker 7>America.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nineteen 16.</v>

3955
02:56:00.321 --> 02:56:02.120
<v Speaker 7>How long you've been there?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

3956
02:56:02.121 --> 02:56:04.400
<v Speaker 7>17,</v>
<v Speaker 7>76 to 1916.</v>

3957
02:56:04.460 --> 02:56:07.220
<v Speaker 7>People just got their no airplane there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A hundred years.</v>

3958
02:56:07.370 --> 02:56:09.080
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's crazy.</v>

3959
02:56:09.860 --> 02:56:14.600
<v Speaker 7>Like thanked 1916 in 2017 when you can </v>
<v Speaker 7>sit back and think about it.</v>

3960
02:56:14.870 --> 02:56:18.440
<v Speaker 7>Nineteen 16 was essentially a 100 years </v>
<v Speaker 7>ago.</v>

3961
02:56:18.441 --> 02:56:23.080
<v Speaker 7>One hundred one years ago and just a </v>
<v Speaker 7>hundred years before that you got 18,</v>

3962
02:56:23.100 --> 02:56:25.430
<v Speaker 7>1600 years before that you got 17.</v>
<v Speaker 7>16.</v>

3963
02:56:25.700 --> 02:56:30.700
<v Speaker 7>So it's like the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>country still hunt couple of hundred </v>

3964
02:56:30.700 --> 02:56:32.210
<v Speaker 7>years into the beginning of the country </v>
<v Speaker 7>and that was just 100 years ago.</v>

3965
02:56:33.020 --> 02:56:34.190
<v Speaker 7>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>White Shark attack.</v>

3966
02:56:34.191 --> 02:56:36.310
<v Speaker 7>Five people near the Jersey shore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Huh?</v>

3967
02:56:36.370 --> 02:56:41.370
<v Speaker 7>This is a different story.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Unless they called it a great white </v>

3968
02:56:41.370 --> 02:56:42.560
<v Speaker 7>shark and it was a bull shark.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that.</v>

3969
02:56:44.970 --> 02:56:47.850
<v Speaker 7>I think that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's a different story.</v>

3970
02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:53.150
<v Speaker 7>There was a bunch of attacks on a river </v>
<v Speaker 7>in New Jersey in the early 19 hundreds.</v>

3971
02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.370
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that's the one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's a different one.</v>

3972
02:56:56.580 --> 02:57:01.580
<v Speaker 7>There's obviously been a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 7>attacks spring lake and into twin creek </v>

3973
02:57:02.070 --> 02:57:04.080
<v Speaker 7>zen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It rode great white.</v>

3974
02:57:04.440 --> 02:57:06.660
<v Speaker 7>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the one that's a great wide.</v>

3975
02:57:06.661 --> 02:57:07.650
<v Speaker 7>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's different.</v>

3976
02:57:07.770 --> 02:57:11.190
<v Speaker 7>I thought it was a bull shark.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's just what this says.</v>

3977
02:57:11.820 --> 02:57:12.930
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's,</v>

3978
02:57:12.931 --> 02:57:15.270
<v Speaker 7>when's the story from the stores?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is Nineteen Sixteen,</v>

3979
02:57:15.580 --> 02:57:17.340
<v Speaker 7>2012.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3980
02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:19.800
<v Speaker 7>if it's in the Smithsonian,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you gotta think that's probably right.</v>

3981
02:57:19.920 --> 02:57:21.720
<v Speaker 7>I could've swore it was bull sharks </v>
<v Speaker 7>though.</v>

3982
02:57:21.980 --> 02:57:25.290
<v Speaker 7>And it killed more than one person </v>
<v Speaker 7>either way.</v>

3983
02:57:25.291 --> 02:57:27.120
<v Speaker 7>Fuck sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3984
02:57:28.830 --> 02:57:30.150
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't fuck with the ocean.</v>

3985
02:57:30.510 --> 02:57:31.560
<v Speaker 7>Do you go fishing?</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3986
02:57:31.810 --> 02:57:32.790
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't do it.</v>

3987
02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:34.410
<v Speaker 7>Now I'll probably get into it for my </v>
<v Speaker 7>son.</v>

3988
02:57:34.800 --> 02:57:35.970
<v Speaker 7>I'll probably get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He likes it,</v>

3989
02:57:36.150 --> 02:57:38.490
<v Speaker 7>but I ain't trying to go way out in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>ocean.</v>

3990
02:57:38.491 --> 02:57:43.491
<v Speaker 7>I have no desire and it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I like watching it on dvds and shit the </v>

3991
02:57:43.491 --> 02:57:47.331
<v Speaker 7>deep.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you know that the deepest part of </v>

3992
02:57:47.331 --> 02:57:47.331
<v Speaker 7>the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

3993
02:57:47.331 --> 02:57:47.331
<v Speaker 7>I forget what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 7>James Cameron,</v>

3994
02:57:47.331 --> 02:57:48.840
<v Speaker 7>where he goes down that submarine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's like A.</v>

3995
02:57:49.020 --> 02:57:50.820
<v Speaker 7>There's like a trench.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

3996
02:57:51.020 --> 02:57:56.020
<v Speaker 7>I like shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of mysterious shit that </v>

3997
02:57:56.020 --> 02:57:56.020
<v Speaker 7>goes on there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you know where the best place to go?</v>

3998
02:57:56.020 --> 02:57:58.020
<v Speaker 7>Shark fishing in the world is South </v>
<v Speaker 7>Africa right off.</v>

3999
02:57:58.021 --> 02:58:01.710
<v Speaker 7>Catalina really did.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's one of the best in the world.</v>

4000
02:58:01.711 --> 02:58:04.620
<v Speaker 7>They catch these giant Maaco sharks and </v>
<v Speaker 7>they taste good.</v>

4001
02:58:04.680 --> 02:58:07.530
<v Speaker 7>You can eat them for those people get </v>
<v Speaker 7>mad at you though.</v>

4002
02:58:07.620 --> 02:58:09.630
<v Speaker 7>That's a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People get mad if you.</v>

4003
02:58:09.631 --> 02:58:11.460
<v Speaker 7>If you eat sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you kill sharks,</v>

4004
02:58:11.570 --> 02:58:12.390
<v Speaker 7>he will get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4005
02:58:12.391 --> 02:58:13.740
<v Speaker 7>they shouldn't be mad at that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But they,</v>

4006
02:58:13.741 --> 02:58:15.690
<v Speaker 7>they don't get mad if you killed like a </v>
<v Speaker 7>tuna.</v>

4007
02:58:16.560 --> 02:58:21.560
<v Speaker 7>Tuna's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But sharks are bad because people have </v>

4008
02:58:21.560 --> 02:58:22.860
<v Speaker 7>been brainwashed into thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 7>people eat shark fin soup and they waste</v>

4009
02:58:22.861 --> 02:58:27.861
<v Speaker 7>the shark.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So then people start thinking of shark </v>

4010
02:58:27.861 --> 02:58:28.110
<v Speaker 7>fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like they think of trophy hunting.</v>

4011
02:58:28.360 --> 02:58:30.570
<v Speaker 7>I think of like killing lions or </v>
<v Speaker 7>something like that.</v>

4012
02:58:30.571 --> 02:58:35.571
<v Speaker 7>You're just killing it for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're not eating it like they don't </v>

4013
02:58:35.571 --> 02:58:38.600
<v Speaker 7>realize they go shop for food you like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nobody does a Japanese do now they just </v>

4014
02:58:38.600 --> 02:58:43.341
<v Speaker 7>kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They kill them because they're getting </v>

4015
02:58:43.341 --> 02:58:45.081
<v Speaker 7>in the way of their tune and production </v>
<v Speaker 7>to the trailing the eight and they make </v>

4016
02:58:45.081 --> 02:58:46.970
<v Speaker 7>Dolphin Burger's really?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>

4017
02:58:47.260 --> 02:58:49.350
<v Speaker 7>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>seems wrong.</v>

4018
02:58:50.160 --> 02:58:53.190
<v Speaker 7>They trap them in a cove and just </v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking Harpoon into math.</v>

4019
02:58:53.340 --> 02:58:55.470
<v Speaker 7>When they were doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they were just killing them because they</v>

4020
02:58:55.471 --> 02:58:57.330
<v Speaker 7>were getting in the way of their tune.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That only shit.</v>

4021
02:58:57.360 --> 02:58:59.700
<v Speaker 7>They're not going to just waste that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That set.</v>

4022
02:59:00.710 --> 02:59:03.180
<v Speaker 7>Have you watched?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've seen a documentary.</v>

4023
02:59:03.181 --> 02:59:05.850
<v Speaker 7>It could be bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but seem legit,</v>

4024
02:59:05.851 --> 02:59:07.650
<v Speaker 7>but isn't it weird?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It feels weird,</v>

4025
02:59:07.651 --> 02:59:08.780
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like eating a,</v>

4026
02:59:09.240 --> 02:59:11.520
<v Speaker 7>eating a dolphin seems fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The Japanese,</v>

4027
02:59:11.521 --> 02:59:13.560
<v Speaker 7>like they were totally into killing </v>
<v Speaker 7>whales all the time.</v>

4028
02:59:13.561 --> 02:59:14.860
<v Speaker 7>Or do they still do whaling?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4029
02:59:16.080 --> 02:59:17.250
<v Speaker 7>that's pretty fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

4030
02:59:17.550 --> 02:59:19.680
<v Speaker 7>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They use it for all kinds of stuff,</v>

4031
02:59:19.681 --> 02:59:21.150
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They would eat the whale blubber,</v>

4032
02:59:21.410 --> 02:59:22.800
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one of the things they do now,</v>

4033
02:59:22.890 --> 02:59:23.710
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

4034
02:59:23.760 --> 02:59:28.710
<v Speaker 7>they should kill whales under the false </v>
<v Speaker 7>pretense of a.</v>

4035
02:59:28.770 --> 02:59:33.770
<v Speaker 7>they're trying to do scientific research</v>
<v Speaker 7>that allowed to do some scientific </v>

4036
02:59:33.770 --> 02:59:38.391
<v Speaker 7>research on whales,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so they kill a few whales and then they </v>

4037
02:59:38.391 --> 02:59:40.020
<v Speaker 7>take those whales,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they kill and they sell whatever parts.</v>

4038
02:59:41.320 --> 02:59:44.490
<v Speaker 7>Smart gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The illuminati.</v>

4039
02:59:44.491 --> 02:59:46.230
<v Speaker 7>I'd be like green,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like that shit.</v>

4040
02:59:46.320 --> 02:59:47.970
<v Speaker 7>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a little monotony.</v>

4041
02:59:47.971 --> 02:59:51.600
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a Japanese fishing market </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's always been doing that.</v>

4042
02:59:51.810 --> 02:59:55.110
<v Speaker 7>They've been selling and buying and </v>
<v Speaker 7>killing whales forever,</v>

4043
02:59:55.350 --> 02:59:58.520
<v Speaker 7>and so then when these new environmental</v>
<v Speaker 7>standards got raised,</v>

4044
02:59:58.680 --> 02:59:59.220
<v Speaker 7>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh yeah,</v>

4045
02:59:59.221 --> 03:00:01.830
<v Speaker 7>well we have to do a little research you</v>
<v Speaker 7>to do a little research.</v>

4046
03:00:02.070 --> 03:00:04.920
<v Speaker 7>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Those that company or that group,</v>

4047
03:00:04.921 --> 03:00:06.560
<v Speaker 7>the sea shepherds,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you know who they are?</v>

4048
03:00:06.610 --> 03:00:11.610
<v Speaker 7>They're the ones who bust people who </v>
<v Speaker 7>were wailing in illegal whaling because </v>

4049
03:00:11.610 --> 03:00:15.081
<v Speaker 7>otherwise you gotta think you find some </v>
<v Speaker 7>whaling boat in the middle of the </v>

4050
03:00:15.081 --> 03:00:18.291
<v Speaker 7>fucking ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Think I begged the goddamn ocean is </v>

4051
03:00:18.291 --> 03:00:19.270
<v Speaker 7>there's a boat out there somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the middle of it that's whaling.</v>

4052
03:00:19.500 --> 03:00:20.580
<v Speaker 7>How are you going to find them?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What are you gonna?</v>

4053
03:00:20.581 --> 03:00:25.581
<v Speaker 7>Do they go out there and ram these boats</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they'd shoot like air guns or </v>

4054
03:00:25.581 --> 03:00:25.581
<v Speaker 7>something like that?</v>

4055
03:00:25.581 --> 03:00:26.790
<v Speaker 7>Don't like water,</v>
<v Speaker 7>water,</v>

4056
03:00:26.791 --> 03:00:31.791
<v Speaker 7>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They do a bunch of shit to try to </v>

4057
03:00:31.791 --> 03:00:32.040
<v Speaker 7>disrupt it and then they try to expose.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Isn't there a TV show about it?</v>

4058
03:00:32.270 --> 03:00:35.260
<v Speaker 7>Think so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whale warriors or some point.</v>

4059
03:00:35.450 --> 03:00:37.530
<v Speaker 7>They shouldn't be fucking with whales </v>
<v Speaker 7>and dolphins.</v>

4060
03:00:39.140 --> 03:00:41.050
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're too smart and I was okay.</v>

<v Speaker 7>we think.</v>

03:02:02.801 --> 03:02:07.801
<v Speaker 7>about is the beak.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think they have like a classic </v>

4094
03:02:07.801 --> 03:02:08.950
<v Speaker 7>brain like we think of.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look at that.</v>

4095
03:02:09.220 --> 03:02:14.220
<v Speaker 7>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Through a little tiny hole right at the </v>

4096
03:02:14.220 --> 03:02:14.220
<v Speaker 7>end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Scoop it up with a net psych.</v>

4097
03:02:16.210 --> 03:02:19.180
<v Speaker 7>He tried too hard,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I saw a common bitch.</v>

4098
03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:22.660
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Eat Octopus.</v>

4099
03:02:22.720 --> 03:02:23.630
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Damn.</v>

4100
03:02:24.430 --> 03:02:29.430
<v Speaker 7>I think dad does too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think there's some octopus </v>

4101
03:02:29.430 --> 03:02:29.430
<v Speaker 7>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4102
03:02:29.430 --> 03:02:30.850
<v Speaker 7>I don't think they're nice north.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think Canada,</v>

4103
03:02:30.910 --> 03:02:33.370
<v Speaker 7>they're worried that were assholes and </v>
<v Speaker 7>they're probably right,</v>

4104
03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:36.370
<v Speaker 7>but I don't think there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 7>morals going on the octopus community.</v>

4105
03:02:36.700 --> 03:02:39.640
<v Speaker 7>Do you ever see that one video of </v>
<v Speaker 7>octopuses that were taken out?</v>

4106
03:02:39.641 --> 03:02:43.250
<v Speaker 7>Sharks in an aquarium.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They had this big ass aquarium.</v>

4107
03:02:43.270 --> 03:02:44.500
<v Speaker 7>They kept missing sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're like,</v>

4108
03:02:44.501 --> 03:02:49.501
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like someone's killing our sharks and </v>

4109
03:02:49.501 --> 03:02:52.801
<v Speaker 7>then they put a video.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They set it up and I found that the </v>

4110
03:02:52.801 --> 03:02:53.200
<v Speaker 7>octopus always get busted with cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4111
03:02:53.880 --> 03:02:58.880
<v Speaker 7>There's so many hidden camera videos </v>
<v Speaker 7>like pet octopuses getting out of their </v>

4112
03:02:58.880 --> 03:02:58.880
<v Speaker 7>aquarium.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

4113
03:02:58.980 --> 03:03:03.980
<v Speaker 7>And going into another aquarium,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a jack in the fish and then climbing </v>

4114
03:03:03.980 --> 03:03:03.980
<v Speaker 7>back in.</v>

4115
03:03:03.980 --> 03:03:05.370
<v Speaker 7>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do they attack each other as attack each</v>

4116
03:03:05.371 --> 03:03:06.850
<v Speaker 7>other?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a very good question.</v>

4117
03:03:06.910 --> 03:03:08.920
<v Speaker 7>Octopus wars.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure they have them.</v>

4118
03:03:08.921 --> 03:03:10.300
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look how he fucks.</v>

4119
03:03:10.301 --> 03:03:13.300
<v Speaker 7>This shark doesn't have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a tiny shark.</v>

4120
03:03:13.660 --> 03:03:16.630
<v Speaker 7>It is a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like a toddler still doesn't have a</v>

4121
03:03:16.631 --> 03:03:21.631
<v Speaker 7>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you know that they feel like they're </v>

4122
03:03:21.631 --> 03:03:24.340
<v Speaker 7>pretty sure that they found fossil </v>
<v Speaker 7>evidence of enormous suction cups,</v>

4123
03:03:24.341 --> 03:03:29.341
<v Speaker 7>which would indicate that at one point </v>
<v Speaker 7>in time there was a thing like a </v>

4124
03:03:29.341 --> 03:03:32.090
<v Speaker 7>cracking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like an enormous hundred foot long </v>

4125
03:03:32.090 --> 03:03:35.580
<v Speaker 7>octopus.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I believe that the private I'd probably </v>

<v Speaker 3>They're saying 100 percent beef.</v>

4237
03:08:12.420 --> 03:08:13.960
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

03:08:19.360 --> 03:08:21.410
<v Speaker 3>day saying $100,</v>

4240
03:08:21.410 --> 03:08:22.440
<v Speaker 3>hundred per 100 percent beef is actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the name.</v>

4243
03:08:26.011 --> 03:08:28.320

<v Speaker 3>So when they say 100 percent beef,</v>

4244
03:08:28.500 --> 03:08:31.890
<v Speaker 3>that's just the name of the company that</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes the beat.</v>

4245
03:08:31.980 --> 03:08:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I read that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

4258
03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:06.801
<v Speaker 3>shut down like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to make a product </v>

<v Speaker 3>called 100 percent real beef.</v>

4262
03:09:13.740 --> 03:09:18.740
<v Speaker 3>create a fake meat and call it a 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent real beef and that was the name </v>

4263

<v Speaker 3>of the meat,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>

4325
03:11:59.080 --> 03:12:01.310
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had it happen to me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4339
03:12:30.080 --> 03:12:31.820
<v Speaker 1>And then the second one in 2003 was </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

4340
03:12:31.821 --> 03:12:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Cadaver Cadaver?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4342
03:12:35.360 --> 03:12:36.380
<v Speaker 1>They don't pop out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4343
03:12:36.410 --> 03:12:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Did it pop out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how it ripped before slid out </v>

4344
03:12:41.410 --> 03:12:41.410
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4345
03:12:41.410 --> 03:12:42.410
<v Speaker 1>the first one felt um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4346
03:12:42.510 --> 03:12:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I tore it kicking the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was tired and I was doing rounds on </v>

4347
03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:48.950
<v Speaker 1>the bag and I threw a kick and my leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>was planted and it didn't.</v>

4348
03:12:48.951 --> 03:12:51.080
<v Speaker 1>My foot didn't pivot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just doing rounds,</v>

4349
03:12:51.140 --> 03:12:54.410
<v Speaker 1>was real tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to put it out exactly.</v>

4350
03:12:54.411 --> 03:12:59.411
<v Speaker 1>And I was 21 and I think I'd heard it </v>
<v Speaker 1>before then I just didn't realize how </v>

4351
03:12:59.411 --> 03:12:59.510
<v Speaker 1>bad I'd heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I heard it again.</v>

4352
03:12:59.511 --> 03:13:04.511
<v Speaker 1>It popped like I felt it explode in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gym and then I went to the hospital and </v>

4353
03:13:05.121 --> 03:13:06.670
<v Speaker 1>they checked it out and the whole deal.</v>

4354
03:13:06.670 --> 03:13:08.110
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

4355
03:13:08.220 --> 03:13:10.700
<v Speaker 1>I've eventually got it fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other one.</v>

4356
03:13:11.180 --> 03:13:11.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

4357
03:13:11.960 --> 03:13:15.140
<v Speaker 1>I heard it a couple different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Anyway,</v>

4358
03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:17.000
<v Speaker 1>point is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it blew out.</v>

4359
03:13:17.290 --> 03:13:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my second one that I got done,</v>

4360
03:13:19.880 --> 03:13:23.060
<v Speaker 1>it was introduced to class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in half guard,</v>

4361
03:13:23.090 --> 03:13:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I was on top and someone had the lock </v>
<v Speaker 1>down sideways.</v>

4362
03:13:26.720 --> 03:13:28.550
<v Speaker 1>So instead of straightening me out </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>

4363
03:13:28.760 --> 03:13:33.760
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know where your leg bends and </v>

4364
03:13:33.760 --> 03:13:33.760
<v Speaker 1>extends it hyper extends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it went this way,</v>

4365
03:13:33.760 --> 03:13:37.840
<v Speaker 1>like against the side of the knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just was a weird angle and he </v>

4366
03:13:37.840 --> 03:13:38.510
<v Speaker 1>straightened his leg out and it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>popped up.</v>

4367
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:42.500
<v Speaker 1>You can hear it snap like a carrot snap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't even know it was broken.</v>

4368
03:13:42.920 --> 03:13:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just really painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next day I was actually </v>

4369
03:13:47.920 --> 03:13:47.920
<v Speaker 1>walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4370
03:13:48.140 --> 03:13:50.720
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't think anything was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just really sore.</v>

4371
03:13:50.900 --> 03:13:53.900
<v Speaker 1>And then I was moving some stuff around </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my office and it just went.</v>

4372
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:56.420
<v Speaker 1>It just fell out of the socket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slipped out,</v>

4373
03:13:56.421 --> 03:13:57.170
<v Speaker 1>gave out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4374
03:13:57.320 --> 03:14:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Just gave out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I knew that feeling before because </v>

4375
03:14:02.320 --> 03:14:05.351
<v Speaker 1>of my other knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then did you have to straighten it </v>

4376
03:14:05.351 --> 03:14:05.351
<v Speaker 1>out and pop it back in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4377
03:14:05.351 --> 03:14:05.351
<v Speaker 1>it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't a problem because it wasn't.</v>

4378
03:14:05.351 --> 03:14:06.800
<v Speaker 1>There was no meniscus tear on the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

4379
03:14:06.980 --> 03:14:09.260
<v Speaker 1>The left one had meniscus tear as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember?</v>

4380
03:14:09.261 --> 03:14:11.220
<v Speaker 1>One time I blew that out in class and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

4381
03:14:11.300 --> 03:14:12.680
<v Speaker 1>my leg locked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>

4382
03:14:12.681 --> 03:14:13.580

<v Speaker 1>I prefer it.</v>

4408
03:15:10.640 --> 03:15:15.640

4410
03:15:18.971 --> 03:15:21.221
<v Speaker 5>that you crank like in 1910 and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>liked that you control the anymore.</v>

4411
03:15:21.570 --> 03:15:26.570
<v Speaker 5>If they made them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would get them maybe what have you </v>

4412
03:15:26.570 --> 03:15:26.570
<v Speaker 5>had to start your car by cranking?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4413
03:15:26.570 --> 03:15:29.390
<v Speaker 5>but you don't feel like there's some fun</v>
<v Speaker 5>and shifting the gears.</v>

4414
03:15:29.480 --> 03:15:33.030
<v Speaker 5>I know what it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4415
03:15:33.050 --> 03:15:37.730
<v Speaker 5>what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is my first car was a 1977 pinto station</v>

4416
03:15:37.731 --> 03:15:41.120
<v Speaker 5>wagon and I got it for $550 and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 5>stick shift.</v>

4417
03:15:41.210 --> 03:15:42.900
<v Speaker 5>I always wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4418
03:15:43.130 --> 03:15:44.780
<v Speaker 5>the cheaper cars were always stick </v>
<v Speaker 5>shift.</v>

4419
03:15:44.810 --> 03:15:49.810
<v Speaker 5>I could only afford to stick shift.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The more expensive cars had the </v>

4420
03:15:49.810 --> 03:15:49.810
<v Speaker 5>automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I guess it was just,</v>

4421
03:15:49.810 --> 03:15:49.980
<v Speaker 5>I was</v>

4422
03:15:49.980 --> 03:15:51.480
<v Speaker 7>brainwashed into thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fuck,</v>

4423
03:15:51.481 --> 03:15:55.020
<v Speaker 7>one of these days I'm going to be able </v>
<v Speaker 7>to drive an automatic fuck this bag.</v>

4424
03:15:55.021 --> 03:15:58.260
<v Speaker 7>You will bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I think it was just a mind fuck.</v>

4425
03:15:58.350 --> 03:16:01.170
<v Speaker 7>So once I was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>once I got my first automatic car,</v>

<v Speaker 7>you could just,</v>

4427
03:16:03.900 --> 03:16:06.960
<v Speaker 7>I had a bunch of automatics and then I </v>
<v Speaker 7>got a stick shift.</v>

4428
03:16:07.350 --> 03:16:10.350
<v Speaker 7>I had a bunch of muscle cars and then I </v>
<v Speaker 7>got an Audi.</v>

4429
03:16:10.351 --> 03:16:15.351
<v Speaker 7>Fox is a tiny little Audi car.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a little front wheel drive car </v>

4430
03:16:17.010 --> 03:16:20.060
<v Speaker 7>and it was a stick shift.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was like a zippy little car like me.</v>

4431
03:16:20.850 --> 03:16:21.810
<v Speaker 7>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

4432

<v Speaker 7>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love like shifting the gears,</v>

4433
03:16:24.330 --> 03:16:29.330
<v Speaker 7>but it wasn't until I got my first NSX,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nsx,</v>

4434
03:16:29.850 --> 03:16:34.850
<v Speaker 7>Nsx in 95 or six,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe 97,</v>

4435
03:16:35.350 --> 03:16:39.060
<v Speaker 7>97 and then I had another one that I got</v>
<v Speaker 7>in like 2004.</v>

4436
03:16:39.350 --> 03:16:40.290
<v Speaker 7>It was a bad ass car.</v>

4437
03:16:40.380 --> 03:16:43.050
<v Speaker 7>Love those things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're so different now.</v>

4438
03:16:43.440 --> 03:16:48.210
<v Speaker 7>Now the new NSX is like this big </v>
<v Speaker 7>technological spaceship thing.</v>

4439
03:16:48.270 --> 03:16:49.410
<v Speaker 7>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's dope.</v>

4440
03:16:49.690 --> 03:16:51.450
<v Speaker 7>It's going.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think so,</v>

4441
03:16:51.690 --> 03:16:53.280
<v Speaker 7>but it's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I liked.</v>

4442
03:16:53.340 --> 03:16:55.370
<v Speaker 7>I liked the little cars that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're,</v>

4443
03:16:55.400 --> 03:16:58.050
<v Speaker 7>you're in control of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like A.</v>

4444
03:16:58.140 --> 03:17:03.140
<v Speaker 7>I don't like the big electronic car.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why I like the Porsche because </v>

4445
03:17:03.140 --> 03:17:05.160
<v Speaker 7>that thing's light.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's light and you control everything.</v>

4446
03:17:05.161 --> 03:17:07.350
<v Speaker 7>You feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You feel the road like,</v>

4447
03:17:07.360 --> 03:17:09.900
<v Speaker 7>like if you're in a sports car for me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a fast car,</v>

4448
03:17:10.110 --> 03:17:12.810
<v Speaker 7>you want to feel everything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Makes it exciting.</v>

4449
03:17:12.840 --> 03:17:15.150
<v Speaker 7>You don't get any of that Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I dunno.</v>

4450
03:17:15.240 --> 03:17:18.510
<v Speaker 7>Maybe don't even like liver or was that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't even like liver.</v>

4451
03:17:18.620 --> 03:17:20.760
<v Speaker 7>Like you and I are very different.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh No,</v>

4452
03:17:20.770 --> 03:17:22.290
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't let you sliced hearts.</v>

4453
03:17:22.330 --> 03:17:25.760
<v Speaker 7>There is an Nsx that looks incredible </v>
<v Speaker 7>leadership.</v>

4454
03:17:25.920 --> 03:17:27.210
<v Speaker 7>It's already out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

4455
03:17:27.780 --> 03:17:31.170
<v Speaker 7>Not only is an out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They just released an Nsx gt three,</v>

4456
03:17:31.500 --> 03:17:34.260
<v Speaker 7>so if you want to race,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you want to be a racecar driver,</v>

4457
03:17:34.380 --> 03:17:36.750
<v Speaker 7>they'll sell you one of those and it </v>
<v Speaker 7>costs a half a million bucks.</v>

4458
03:17:36.810 --> 03:17:39.270
<v Speaker 7>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a beast of a car man.</v>

4459
03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:41.610
<v Speaker 7>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a Honda.</v>

4460
03:17:41.790 --> 03:17:44.520
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to call it an Acura,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's a Honda,</v>

4461
03:17:44.820 --> 03:17:49.620
<v Speaker 7>which means is this not going to break?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You could drive that thing forever.</v>

4462
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:54.830
<v Speaker 7>Those things will have unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 7>reliability as opposed to like say a car</v>

4463
03:17:55.471 --> 03:17:57.950
<v Speaker 7>that my ancestors made.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

4464
03:17:57.951 --> 03:17:59.970
<v Speaker 7>you get something Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 7>good luck.</v>

4465
03:17:59.971 --> 03:18:04.971
<v Speaker 7>But is it really Japanese?</v>
<v Speaker 7>If they're making it in Mexico as they </v>

4466
03:18:04.971 --> 03:18:05.490
<v Speaker 7>megan that Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't they make Honda's in Mexico?</v>

4467
03:18:05.750 --> 03:18:07.730
<v Speaker 7>Toyota's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what I thought.</v>

4468
03:18:07.740 --> 03:18:12.740
<v Speaker 7>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know they make some of them in </v>

4469
03:18:12.740 --> 03:18:12.740
<v Speaker 7>America.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They make nissans and that's even worse.</v>

4470
03:18:12.740 --> 03:18:12.740
<v Speaker 7>Really.</v>

4471
03:18:15.960 --> 03:18:17.310
<v Speaker 7>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

4472
03:18:17.311 --> 03:18:20.100
<v Speaker 7>Is it considered.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now we're talking about breaking down.</v>

4473
03:18:21.340 --> 03:18:23.820
<v Speaker 7>There's a awesome American cars,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but yeah,</v>

4474
03:18:23.821 --> 03:18:28.821
<v Speaker 7>but if they just use standards developed</v>
<v Speaker 7>by the Japanese and once they have </v>

4475
03:18:28.821 --> 03:18:29.640
<v Speaker 7>standards developed by the Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like what does it say?</v>

4476
03:18:29.710 --> 03:18:31.200
<v Speaker 7>I'm making them in Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ohio.</v>

4477
03:18:31.410 --> 03:18:32.010
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's right.</v>

4478
03:18:32.011 --> 03:18:33.960
<v Speaker 7>The NSX is being made in Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's right.</v>

4479
03:18:34.020 --> 03:18:35.580
<v Speaker 7>I forgot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that good or bad?</v>

4480
03:18:35.670 --> 03:18:40.670
<v Speaker 7>Was real good for Americans in Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We want a good job making sex as far as </v>

4481
03:18:40.891 --> 03:18:42.930
<v Speaker 7>a reliability.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know what?</v>

4482
03:18:42.931 --> 03:18:45.060
<v Speaker 7>Everything's automated now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>See that's the thing.</v>

4483
03:18:45.061 --> 03:18:47.680
<v Speaker 7>It's not like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're dealing with skilled craftsman.</v>

4484
03:18:47.681 --> 03:18:49.480
<v Speaker 7>You're dealing with programmers and </v>
<v Speaker 7>shit,</v>

4485
03:18:49.910 --> 03:18:53.230
<v Speaker 7>but like assembly line should have some.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's some.</v>

4486
03:18:53.231 --> 03:18:57.250
<v Speaker 7>That was the thing about the corvette </v>
<v Speaker 7>factory in Bowling Green,</v>

4487
03:18:57.251 --> 03:18:58.930
<v Speaker 7>Kentucky.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like those people,</v>

4488
03:18:58.931 --> 03:19:01.360
<v Speaker 7>they've put together those corvettes by </v>
<v Speaker 7>themselves.</v>

4489
03:19:01.361 --> 03:19:05.380
<v Speaker 7>Like there's a lot that's going on </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a animated automated rather.</v>

4490
03:19:05.380 --> 03:19:07.810
<v Speaker 7>But there's a lot that's going on by </v>
<v Speaker 7>hand to get this shit.</v>

4491
03:19:07.870 --> 03:19:10.060
<v Speaker 7>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're making cars.</v>

4492
03:19:10.510 --> 03:19:12.400
<v Speaker 7>So what is this guy doing right here </v>
<v Speaker 7>with this thing?</v>

4493
03:19:12.880 --> 03:19:13.620
<v Speaker 7>The factory,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>

4494
03:19:13.621 --> 03:19:15.280
<v Speaker 7>I just kind of skipped ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4495
03:19:15.281 --> 03:19:17.770
<v Speaker 7>What's happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's hard to tell what it is.</v>

4496
03:19:19.060 --> 03:19:20.710
<v Speaker 7>They're flipping the thing upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

4497
03:19:20.711 --> 03:19:23.260
<v Speaker 7>they're working on the chassis.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is the bottom of the car.</v>

4498
03:19:23.440 --> 03:19:28.440
<v Speaker 7>These things are just what they are now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what the car looks like on the </v>

4499
03:19:28.440 --> 03:19:30.220
<v Speaker 7>inside before they put the seats in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>drive train and all that stuff,</v>

4500
03:19:30.540 --> 03:19:34.060
<v Speaker 7>but with these things are now it's all </v>
<v Speaker 7>done by these robots.</v>

4501
03:19:34.061 --> 03:19:36.580
<v Speaker 7>Someone controlling it real time or is </v>
<v Speaker 7>it on a program?</v>

4502
03:19:36.600 --> 03:19:39.220
<v Speaker 7>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would bet it's probably on a program.</v>

4503
03:19:40.030 --> 03:19:43.570
<v Speaker 7>There's probably someone controlling it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they're probably just pressing start</v>

4504
03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:48.990
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Probably lock it into place and this </v>

4505
03:19:48.990 --> 03:19:48.990
<v Speaker 7>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean the way it's stacking everything,</v>

4506
03:19:49.020 --> 03:19:49.290
<v Speaker 7>hold on.</v>

4507
03:19:49.300 --> 03:19:54.300
<v Speaker 7>Some of the things that they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 7>now though mean these cars are so </v>

4508
03:19:54.300 --> 03:19:58.951
<v Speaker 7>precise.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're so different than anything that </v>

4509
03:19:58.951 --> 03:19:59.440
<v Speaker 7>existed like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 7>30 years ago.</v>

4510
03:19:59.920 --> 03:20:03.190
<v Speaker 7>Like this car,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it might not be like the most,</v>

4511
03:20:04.430 --> 03:20:06.850
<v Speaker 7>the fastest,</v>
<v Speaker 7>best engineered cars in the world,</v>

4512
03:20:06.851 --> 03:20:11.851
<v Speaker 7>but it's one of them and it's just that </v>
<v Speaker 7>the horsepower wars are so out of </v>

4513
03:20:11.851 --> 03:20:15.811
<v Speaker 7>control right now that a car like this </v>
<v Speaker 7>is almost kind of overlooked because </v>

4514
03:20:15.811 --> 03:20:19.060
<v Speaker 7>there's so many insane high performance </v>
<v Speaker 7>cars now.</v>

4515
03:20:19.090 --> 03:20:23.260
<v Speaker 7>I mean there's so many that are zero to </v>
<v Speaker 7>60 in three seconds.</v>

4516
03:20:24.460 --> 03:20:29.460
<v Speaker 7>What they're doing now is just making </v>
<v Speaker 7>these unbelievable spaceships that are </v>

4517
03:20:29.460 --> 03:20:31.330
<v Speaker 7>regular person could buy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you have the money.</v>

4518
03:20:31.420 --> 03:20:36.420
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to be a race car driver.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to be like super </v>

4519
03:20:36.420 --> 03:20:40.831
<v Speaker 7>qualified to handle this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You could just get a car that's 600 </v>

4520
03:20:40.831 --> 03:20:43.420
<v Speaker 7>horsepower,</v>
<v Speaker 7>four wheel drive drives like a demon.</v>

4521
03:20:43.690 --> 03:20:46.490
<v Speaker 7>I mean you could just go out and buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The Tesla,</v>

4522
03:20:46.491 --> 03:20:48.430
<v Speaker 7>the model three,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like 35 grand,</v>

4523
03:20:48.431 --> 03:20:49.510
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Crazy.</v>

4524
03:20:50.270 --> 03:20:53.290
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're buying a model three,</v>

4525
03:20:53.370 --> 03:20:55.270
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're buying a fucking spaceship.</v>

4526
03:20:55.720 --> 03:21:00.720
<v Speaker 7>Like everything is automated.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This guy's a using torque wrenches that </v>

4527
03:21:00.720 --> 03:21:01.870
<v Speaker 7>everything's all set to the exact amount</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're supposed to crank.</v>

4528
03:21:01.871 --> 03:21:05.320
<v Speaker 7>Things like everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nothing is left to the imagination.</v>

4529
03:21:05.500 --> 03:21:08.140
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's cool to make like an old classics,</v>

4530
03:21:08.141 --> 03:21:10.120
<v Speaker 7>like a new version,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the charger and all that.</v>

4531
03:21:10.220 --> 03:21:10.640
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

4532
03:21:11.380 --> 03:21:14.280
<v Speaker 7>Do model t's in a new version.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>

4533
03:21:14.380 --> 03:21:19.380
<v Speaker 7>those things are so like ergonomically </v>
<v Speaker 7>clumsy and so poorly designed in terms </v>

4534
03:21:20.021 --> 03:21:25.021
<v Speaker 7>of like aerodynamics and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you try to take a model t on the </v>

4535
03:21:25.021 --> 03:21:25.360
<v Speaker 7>highway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that shit would just fall over.</v>

4536
03:21:25.780 --> 03:21:27.880
<v Speaker 7>Like once you got to like add,</v>
<v Speaker 7>make it right though.</v>

4537
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:29.860
<v Speaker 7>But the wind resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you get to like 80.</v>

4538
03:21:29.860 --> 03:21:31.840
<v Speaker 7>You're not trying to go fast.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just like a,</v>

4539
03:21:31.870 --> 03:21:33.100
<v Speaker 7>like a Harley.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

4540
03:21:33.160 --> 03:21:34.870
<v Speaker 7>like a cruiser,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

4541
03:21:35.080 --> 03:21:36.340
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe.</v>

4542
03:21:36.610 --> 03:21:37.420
<v Speaker 7>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they go,</v>

4543
03:21:37.540 --> 03:21:39.940
<v Speaker 7>they had those cruisers that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>those fifties type cars.</v>

4544
03:21:39.941 --> 03:21:41.550
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like dragster things.</v>

4545

<v Speaker 6>That is Bugatti auction in his face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a man.</v>

<v Speaker 6>One point five,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one point $9,000,000</v>

4661
03:26:57.631 --> 03:27:02.631
<v Speaker 6>bid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because the number was still much lower </v>

4662
03:27:02.631 --> 03:27:02.631
<v Speaker 6>than floyd was hoping to get.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder what he paid for.</v>

4663
03:27:02.631 --> 03:27:05.270
<v Speaker 6>It didn't sell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Somebody offered one point $9 million.</v>

4664
03:27:05.290 --> 03:27:07.770
<v Speaker 6>He's like not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

4665
03:27:07.990 --> 03:27:11.850

<v Speaker 6>Oh my goodness.</v>

4666
03:27:12.180 --> 03:27:16.250
<v Speaker 6>So it was reported he was expecting to </v>
<v Speaker 6>make a profit and someone tried to short</v>

4667
03:27:16.260 --> 03:27:16.450
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

4668
03:27:16.600 --> 03:27:18.600
<v Speaker 6>The same one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now this is the white one.</v>

4669
03:27:18.720 --> 03:27:20.550
<v Speaker 6>The one we just saw was the black one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4670
03:27:20.551 --> 03:27:21.810
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4671
03:27:21.811 --> 03:27:25.290
<v Speaker 6>The only people that could afford that </v>
<v Speaker 6>or people don't give a shit about that.</v>

4672
03:27:25.670 --> 03:27:27.000
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think floyd is just.</v>

4673
03:27:27.090 --> 03:27:30.060
<v Speaker 6>His whole thing is about just being the </v>
<v Speaker 6>oldest baller guys,</v>

4674
03:27:30.160 --> 03:27:35.160
<v Speaker 6>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>guys that are in the memorabilia there </v>

4675
03:27:35.160 --> 03:27:35.250
<v Speaker 6>usually broke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't have that much money.</v>

4676
03:27:35.620 --> 03:27:38.220
<v Speaker 6>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not a memorabilia thing.</v>

4677
03:27:38.400 --> 03:27:40.110
<v Speaker 6>One hundred people on the planet could </v>
<v Speaker 6>have,</v>

4678
03:27:40.200 --> 03:27:41.740
<v Speaker 6>could afford to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

4679
03:27:42.160 --> 03:27:45.520
<v Speaker 6>And they're not impressed by having </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone celebrity.</v>

4680
03:27:45.640 --> 03:27:47.690
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They are.</v>

4681
03:27:48.220 --> 03:27:51.970
<v Speaker 6>It's more than 100 millionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A billionaire is going to be going to be</v>

4682
03:27:51.971 --> 03:27:54.730
<v Speaker 6>treated that it's a floyd mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his car,</v>

4683
03:27:55.310 --> 03:27:58.690
<v Speaker 6>but it's obvious that it's flipping it </v>
<v Speaker 6>like they're too smart for that shit,</v>

4684
03:27:58.720 --> 03:28:02.170
<v Speaker 6>but if they wanted to get it and drive </v>
<v Speaker 6>around and let everybody know in 2013 it</v>

4685
03:28:02.171 --> 03:28:05.620
<v Speaker 6>says they sold their 400th day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ron Jesus.</v>

4686
03:28:06.160 --> 03:28:11.160
<v Speaker 6>So 400 people have bought go out of 400.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Over a million dollars.</v>

4687
03:28:13.540 --> 03:28:15.220
<v Speaker 6>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a lot of money.</v>

4688
03:28:15.940 --> 03:28:20.410
<v Speaker 6>Four hundred million dollars at cars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder what it costs to actually make.</v>

4689
03:28:20.470 --> 03:28:24.610
<v Speaker 6>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 6>50 Bucks and it cost like $20,000</v>

4690
03:28:24.611 --> 03:28:25.450
<v Speaker 6>in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

4691
03:28:25.451 --> 03:28:28.420
<v Speaker 6>let's get this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I bet this a website that shows how much</v>

4692
03:28:28.421 --> 03:28:30.580
<v Speaker 6>does it actually cost to build a </v>
<v Speaker 6>Bugatti?</v>

4693
03:28:30.581 --> 03:28:33.580
<v Speaker 6>I want to say $300,000.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to say</v>

4694
03:28:36.550 --> 03:28:39.900
<v Speaker 6>because it's so expensive that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>people making it will charge more.</v>

4695
03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:42.610
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because it's probably going to be</v>

4696
03:28:45.380 --> 03:28:46.770
<v Speaker 6>$300,000.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4697
03:28:46.870 --> 03:28:48.410
<v Speaker 6>you agree with me?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What did you say?</v>

4698
03:28:48.411 --> 03:28:49.580
<v Speaker 6>I said $300.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wait a minute.</v>

4699
03:28:49.940 --> 03:28:50.320
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I ripped.</v>

4700
03:28:50.340 --> 03:28:50.930
<v Speaker 6>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4701
03:28:50.931 --> 03:28:52.310
<v Speaker 6>we'll see if we're right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll see if for both.</v>

4702
03:28:52.311 --> 03:28:57.311
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's a reasonable reasonable </v>

4703
03:28:57.311 --> 03:29:00.221
<v Speaker 6>thing to imply.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For Volkswagen loses six point two $5 </v>

4704
03:29:00.621 --> 03:29:03.530
<v Speaker 6>million on each one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They sell what Volkswagen loses.</v>

4705
03:29:03.540 --> 03:29:05.270
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wait a minute.</v>

4706
03:29:06.560 --> 03:29:09.770
<v Speaker 6>They lose 6 million when they sell it </v>
<v Speaker 6>for 3 million,</v>

4707
03:29:10.190 --> 03:29:12.290
<v Speaker 6>so it costs $9.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Million to make.</v>

4708
03:29:12.410 --> 03:29:14.730
<v Speaker 6>I'm looking.</v>

<v Speaker 7>the best when it comes to accidents.</v>

4773
03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:12.470
<v Speaker 7>Accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would say like a dodge.</v>

4774
03:32:12.471 --> 03:32:14.530
<v Speaker 7>Ram.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Volvo is like known for that,</v>

4775
03:32:14.531 --> 03:32:15.660
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are they still number one,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Do they still make the strongest frames?</v>

4779
03:32:23.300 --> 03:32:24.650
<v Speaker 7>Because basically that's what it comes </v>
<v Speaker 7>down to.</v>

4780
03:32:24.651 --> 03:32:25.860
<v Speaker 7>Who's making the strongest frame?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4781
03:32:25.930 --> 03:32:30.930
<v Speaker 7>Not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's also like how the body responds to </v>

4782
03:32:30.930 --> 03:32:30.930
<v Speaker 7>impact,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how it,</v>

<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how it's engineered delivers the best.</v>

4785

4789
03:32:44.120 --> 03:32:49.120

<v Speaker 7>as far as the accident crash test </v>

4790

4792
03:32:51.201 --> 03:32:54.530

<v Speaker 7>but what about them?</v>

4793
03:32:54.590 --> 03:32:58.120
<v Speaker 7>I would say it would have to be like a </v>
<v Speaker 7>ram or a Chevy Silverado.</v>

4794
03:32:58.121 --> 03:33:00.330
<v Speaker 7>It's got to be though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because that's what they specialize in.</v>

<v Speaker 7>I've seen one of those before in real </v>

4806
03:33:31.600 --> 03:33:31.820
<v Speaker 7>life as far as side impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4807
03:33:31.821 --> 03:33:36.821
<v Speaker 7>I think they.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of those cars have airbags and </v>

4808
03:33:36.821 --> 03:33:38.891
<v Speaker 7>shit now and they just.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Their pillars are designed to a certain </v>

4809
03:33:38.891 --> 03:33:40.470
<v Speaker 7>amount of impact and they give in with </v>
<v Speaker 7>stuff too.</v>

4810
03:33:41.070 --> 03:33:46.070
<v Speaker 7>I saw a car accident the other day </v>
<v Speaker 7>though at an intersection and it was a </v>

4811
03:33:46.070 --> 03:33:48.660
<v Speaker 7>dodge ram truck in like some little peon</v>
<v Speaker 7>Corolla.</v>

4812
03:33:49.010 --> 03:33:54.010
<v Speaker 7>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They hadn't had on the Corolla was </v>

4813
03:33:54.010 --> 03:33:58.191
<v Speaker 7>destroyed and then when I see people </v>
<v Speaker 7>driving relative babies and tiny little </v>

4814
03:33:58.191 --> 03:34:00.450
<v Speaker 7>cars and the car seats like right next </v>
<v Speaker 7>door.</v>

4815
03:34:00.670 --> 03:34:02.190
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's rather scary.</v>

4816
03:34:02.310 --> 03:34:03.540
<v Speaker 7>That's a scary one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

4817
03:34:03.541 --> 03:34:04.990
<v Speaker 7>One that'll fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know what?</v>

4818
03:34:04.991 --> 03:34:06.150
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's your baby.</v>

4819
03:34:06.180 --> 03:34:08.040
<v Speaker 7>Think about how many cars are on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>road.</v>

4820
03:34:08.070 --> 03:34:13.070
<v Speaker 7>How rarely they slam into each other.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Most of the time people keep it </v>

4821
03:34:13.070 --> 03:34:13.070
<v Speaker 7>together.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Most of the time.</v>

4822
03:34:13.070 --> 03:34:17.810
<v Speaker 7>Most of the Times I kind of think the </v>
<v Speaker 7>traffic kind of filters out bad drivers </v>

4823
03:34:17.831 --> 03:34:19.590
<v Speaker 7>because bad drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're not going to laugh.</v>

4824
03:34:19.600 --> 03:34:21.780
<v Speaker 7>They're going to wreck,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so we'll usually.</v>

4825
03:34:21.781 --> 03:34:25.200
<v Speaker 7>We're left with people that have seen </v>
<v Speaker 7>rex and they're like,</v>

4826
03:34:25.330 --> 03:34:26.670

<v Speaker 7>this has been maybe 35 years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She doesn't drive on the freeway.</v>

4832
03:34:39.990 --> 03:34:41.850
<v Speaker 7>She was like scared of death of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>freeway.</v>

4833
03:34:42.260 --> 03:34:45.750
<v Speaker 7>It was a horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 7>freely accident and she won't ever drive</v>

4834

<v Speaker 7>on the freeway.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've seen some bad ones and bad ones </v>
