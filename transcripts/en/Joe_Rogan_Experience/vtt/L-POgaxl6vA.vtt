13
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.100
<v Speaker 2>always on the mixed martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a message board that said that he went </v>

14
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.291
<v Speaker 2>from a 90 something dollar verizon bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>to an $18 bill with the same use.</v>

15
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 2>If that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

16
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm paraphrasing the numbers.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the exact numbers.</v>

18

<v Speaker 2>but I know that I've gotten so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive feedback about Tang and joey's </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like there's two versions of it.</v>

37
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 2>There's a five point eight inch and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>six point three inch.</v>

38
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck are you talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>

39
00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 2>That's not a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I going to do it?</v>

40
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:50.980
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

41
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 2>that's a half of Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick wanting to fit in your pocket.</v>

43
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nonsense.</v>

44
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 2>That's a crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that is.</v>

45
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's some cross crossover world thing </v>

46
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 2>that you have to have a man purse to </v>
<v Speaker 2>carry that around.</v>

47
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Or a woman and woman would be excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was a girl and I had a bag,</v>

48
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls are allowed to carry purses,</v>

49
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 2>which is so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

50
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 2>there's one thing they have got us </v>
<v Speaker 2>whipped with this society,</v>

51
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:18.810
<v Speaker 2>not women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but society has got us whipped with this</v>

52
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 2>stupid idea that somehow or another a </v>
<v Speaker 2>man is not allowed to carry a purse.</v>

53
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the Robin Hood days,</v>

54
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 2>those motherfuckers had shoulder bags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

55
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.400
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to wear a backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A backpack.</v>

56
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm a fucking schoolkid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gives me a hard time with it,</v>

57
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 2>but if I wear a fanny pack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will look at me like somewhere.</v>

58
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 2>God Damn freaking nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you folks,</v>

59
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:45.081
<v Speaker 2>we got to take back the fanny pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to take back the fanny pack </v>

60
00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:45.180
<v Speaker 2>and maybe even introduce a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>purse.</v>

61
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 2>How about them apples?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get yourself a purse,</v>

62
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 2>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

63
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a little man purse.</v>

64
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.920
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that there's something somehow </v>

65
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 2>or another feminine or weak about </v>
<v Speaker 2>carrying around</v>

66
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 3>a bag is a perplexing aspect of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

67
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

68
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 3>We are allowed to carry certain bags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're carrying like a military style</v>

69
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Duffel bag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>

70
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.060
<v Speaker 3>but you're not allowed to have a purse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't go through the airport with a </v>

71
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.060
<v Speaker 3>purse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dudes will laugh at you.</v>

72
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Dudes with backpacks carrying duffle </v>
<v Speaker 3>bags will laugh at you.</v>

73
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:23.100
<v Speaker 3>If you've got a purse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll give you a scar,</v>

74
00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 3>but it's fucking purse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

75
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 3>A purse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

76
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 3>You got to fucking put that difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the fucking person.</v>

77
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 3>A backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on here?</v>

78
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

80
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 3>and I can't have a fucking purse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is nonsense.</v>

81
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 3>We have subjected ourselves to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsense that we just have accepted over</v>

82
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:45.800
<v Speaker 3>the years and now it's become culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian Redbank.</v>

83
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.150
<v Speaker 3>God bless you for breaking the mold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Young man guys.</v>

84
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 3>Zantax keeps your Zantac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that context?</v>

85
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 3>Is that hurt from drinking too much?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heartburn?</v>

86
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 3>Medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take heartburn.</v>

87
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:57.020
<v Speaker 3>Medicine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

88
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Silly Bitch.</v>

89
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm anyway tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What Tim does is it allows you to,</v>

90
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

91
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.020
<v Speaker 3>if you go to Rogan.ting.com,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could save some money,</v>

92
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:13.021
<v Speaker 3>save 25 bucks off their service,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they allow you to do is buy </v>

93
00:04:13.021 --> 00:04:15.000
<v Speaker 3>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the highest end android phones and uh,</v>

94
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.680
<v Speaker 3>and put it on a network,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sprint network,</v>

95
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 3>but cancel whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's yours.</v>

96
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:25.591
<v Speaker 3>It's your phone too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of stupid shit that goes </v>

97
00:04:25.591 --> 00:04:26.760
<v Speaker 3>along with the cell phone contracts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

98
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one big one is the fact that if you,</v>

99
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

100
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 3>most people don't realize what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal they're making when they make it.</v>

101
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 3>But when you cancel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you cancel you,</v>

102
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 3>you got to pay them.</v>

103
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 3>You can't just quit because you owe them</v>
<v Speaker 3>like hundreds of dollars.</v>

104
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 3>It gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets fucking stupid.</v>

105
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.410
<v Speaker 3>And if someone is in a position where </v>
<v Speaker 3>$300 is like a make or break for the </v>

106
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 3>month for them and you really want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get out of your,</v>

107
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:49.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>x cell phone,</v>

108
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight and t,</v>

109
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:55.321
<v Speaker 3>whether it's verizon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever it is you to fucking pain up </v>

110
00:04:55.321 --> 00:04:58.680
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't really get the deal that you </v>

111
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.900
<v Speaker 3>got is you're paying off that phone over</v>
<v Speaker 3>a several year period or you know,</v>

112
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 3>over a certain amount of time period and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sort of add that to your bill.</v>

113
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.710
<v Speaker 3>So if you just decide to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't really get that phone for two</v>

114
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.750
<v Speaker 3>99.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a $700 phone for to 99 because </v>

115
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 3>they worked it into your deal that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>pay the rest of it over time.</v>

116
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.430
<v Speaker 3>So that's what's going on.</v>

117
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 3>That's why you can't just cancel and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like what kinds of stupid shit is</v>

118
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:20.650
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just cut that out of the equation.</v>

119
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 3>That's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This complicates things.</v>

120
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.260
<v Speaker 3>Let's also have it so people can share </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and then spray it with.</v>

121
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 3>One of the coolest things about using </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sprint network is it's not like Tang</v>

122
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 3>has its own little funky network that </v>
<v Speaker 3>only works and like weird spots.</v>

123
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a huge network that works </v>

124
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.080
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and the waiting has it set </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

125
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.660
<v Speaker 3>If you don't use all of their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of their bandwidth.</v>

126
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 3>If you don't use all of their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

127
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:50.170
<v Speaker 3>all of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather they'll give you a credit on your</v>

128
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:55.171
<v Speaker 3>unused service,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you use less than you thought you </v>

129
00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:58.741
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tear drops you down and credit you the </v>

130
00:05:58.741 --> 00:05:59.790
<v Speaker 3>difference on your next bill.</v>

<v Speaker 3>actually evil and that they just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most evil company ever.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Mitch Hedberg is job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

<v Speaker 4>They got.</v>

196
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.970
<v Speaker 4>They got a good salesman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if it's the same chance or </v>

197
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:37.890
<v Speaker 4>taken that you've taken with the post </v>
<v Speaker 4>office because the post office,</v>

198
00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:40.410
<v Speaker 4>if you're like a drug dealer and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>sent drugs through the mail,</v>

199
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.450
<v Speaker 4>you don't think it's like a federal </v>
<v Speaker 4>massive with Tommy Chunk,</v>

203
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.350
<v Speaker 5>I think ups has a private company.</v>

204
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.660
<v Speaker 4>You're still doing something over state </v>

<v Speaker 6>issue,</v>

249
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.020
<v Speaker 6>people really communicate like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just flippantly with people in public </v>

250
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.400
<v Speaker 6>that are in positions like the Tsa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the way she was communicating with </v>

251
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.271
<v Speaker 6>people but just like so short and so </v>
<v Speaker 6>curt with people and so shitty just </v>

252
00:11:16.271 --> 00:11:21.071
<v Speaker 6>right off the bat is if someone was </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing something to her by having her do </v>

<v Speaker 6>that's some offensive shit man.</v>

254
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.280
<v Speaker 6>When people get consumed with you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just because their job sucks.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'll be up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll we could have a nice little smile </v>

257
00:11:32.411 --> 00:11:32.411
<v Speaker 6>at each other and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and walk about,</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's not going to take care of the baby.</v>

260
00:11:35.271 --> 00:11:36.440
<v Speaker 6>And the extra time.</v>

<v Speaker 6>it's a thing,</v>

262
00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:45.221
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a thing with people in New York </v>

263
00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:45.920
<v Speaker 6>that I noticed this weekend and I dot I </v>
<v Speaker 6>forgot about,</v>

264
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.160
<v Speaker 6>but there's that continence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that curtness that people have </v>

265
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.101
<v Speaker 6>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the real short with folks and folks </v>

266
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:54.101
<v Speaker 6>are shortly with each other and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

267
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:54.101
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

268
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:55.690
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

269
00:11:55.691 --> 00:11:58.480
<v Speaker 3>when that went away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that went away after nine slash 11.</v>

270
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.250
<v Speaker 3>I remember always thinking that New York</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

271
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.100
<v Speaker 3>there was like a certain hostility to </v>
<v Speaker 3>New York that I didn't appreciate.</v>

272
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing,</v>

273
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:08.860
<v Speaker 3>amazing city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking crazy.</v>

274
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:10.300
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monolithic.</v>

275
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like more beautiful than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains.</v>

276
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:17.911
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's created by men when that </v>

277
00:12:17.911 --> 00:12:19.381
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker is lit up at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more beautiful than even the </v>

278
00:12:19.381 --> 00:12:20.170
<v Speaker 3>mountains themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm looking at it and I'm like,</v>

279
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:25.171
<v Speaker 3>this is like really like one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect creations by man as far as like </v>

280
00:12:25.171 --> 00:12:29.520
<v Speaker 3>one of the most amazing things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone's ever created and put on this </v>

281
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:29.520
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

282
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.080
<v Speaker 3>but you can't have that many people </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

283
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.210
<v Speaker 3>They just get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get tired of each other.</v>

284
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.010
<v Speaker 3>They get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get shitty with each other.</v>

285

<v Speaker 7>but ups can just open to whatever the </v>

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.671
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You train them and there's a big </v>

471
00:20:07.671 --> 00:20:08.100
<v Speaker 3>difference is that dogs are dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't worry about weirdness.</v>

477
00:20:16.531 --> 00:20:19.440

<v Speaker 3>one day and ripping my throat out.</v>

478
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:23.400

<v Speaker 4>my fucking pants.</v>

504
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.160
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't as big as the big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>but it was probably like 70 or 80 </v>

506
00:21:38.161 --> 00:21:38.161
<v Speaker 4>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked like a coyote.</v>

507

<v Speaker 4>It was moving across the road and y'all </v>
<v Speaker 4>coyote is like stiff,</v>

509
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.850
<v Speaker 4>assumed it was a coyote because it seems</v>
<v Speaker 4>wild animal running across the road.</v>

510

<v Speaker 4>your headlights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was probably about,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>70 pounds that,</v>

<v Speaker 8>pull out like a cell phone.</v>

584
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.960
<v Speaker 8>We should just do it once for fun.</v>

585
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:10.610
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

586
00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:15.680
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the issue with the mountain lions where </v>

587
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.231
<v Speaker 3>they're seeing more of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one of them that cut a </v>

588
00:25:17.231 --> 00:25:18.140
<v Speaker 3>tranquilized yesterday in Glendale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about this.</v>

589
00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.820
<v Speaker 3>I saw one last week in Santa Barbara and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

590
00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:25.400
<v Speaker 3>of course there was the big one in Santa</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monica that they killed,</v>

591
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:29.360
<v Speaker 3>which I think was about a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not using dogs.</v>

592
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:34.361
<v Speaker 3>The hunt them anymore in California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They changed the regulations and when </v>

593
00:25:34.361 --> 00:25:37.961
<v Speaker 3>you changed the regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have more mountain </v>

594
00:25:37.961 --> 00:25:40.241
<v Speaker 3>lions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's still legal to hunt mountain </v>

595
00:25:40.241 --> 00:25:40.241
<v Speaker 3>lions because they're trying to keep the</v>
<v Speaker 3>population under control.</v>

596
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:45.460
<v Speaker 3>But by not allowing hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these dogs hunter say that's the most </v>

597
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.530
<v Speaker 3>effective way to kill mountain lions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>still incredibly difficult.</v>

598
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.660
<v Speaker 3>What kind of dogs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They use hounds.</v>

599
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.720
<v Speaker 3>They use hunting dogs and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these specially trained dogs are </v>

600
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.531
<v Speaker 3>designed to go find mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They find mountain lions and they treat </v>

601
00:25:59.531 --> 00:26:02.811
<v Speaker 3>them and then the hunter shoots him and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's almost the only way to catch </v>

602
00:26:02.811 --> 00:26:02.811
<v Speaker 3>these fucking things.</v>

603
00:26:02.811 --> 00:26:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they are in the woods.</v>

604
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.120
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you talk to me about an </v>

605
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.000
<v Speaker 3>intelligence like nature intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their way fucking smarter than you,</v>

606
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.100
<v Speaker 3>they know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to get below you.</v>

607
00:26:13.101 --> 00:26:16.590
<v Speaker 3>They're going to stay above you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know that it's harder to run uphill</v>

608
00:26:16.591 --> 00:26:18.920
<v Speaker 3>and downhill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The the like,</v>

609
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:24.010
<v Speaker 3>they have like instinctual things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you as a city person that's wandering </v>

610
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:27.461
<v Speaker 3>through the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what the fuck is going </v>

611
00:26:27.461 --> 00:26:27.461
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you,</v>

612
00:26:27.461 --> 00:26:29.000
<v Speaker 3>you literally need dogs to find them </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're too fast.</v>

613
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:34.030
<v Speaker 3>They're just going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to hear you walk in and </v>

614
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:34.030
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

615
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.611
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck out of their cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their big giant cats that are living in </v>

616
00:26:36.611 --> 00:26:38.750
<v Speaker 3>the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we have this weird attachment,</v>

617
00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to like certain aspects of what </v>

618
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.420
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be legal when it comes </v>

619
00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:46.420
<v Speaker 3>managing</v>

620
00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.390
<v Speaker 6>the wildlife around us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you got to be really fucking careful</v>

621
00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:53.391
<v Speaker 6>about allowing predators to take hold.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean you gotta be really careful </v>

622
00:26:53.391 --> 00:26:57.740
<v Speaker 6>because right now we're fine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if the balance can shift and you </v>

623
00:26:58.231 --> 00:27:03.231
<v Speaker 6>start getting to know Australia </v>
<v Speaker 6>crocodile situation where this place is </v>

624
00:27:03.231 --> 00:27:06.891
<v Speaker 6>in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't fucking go because if you go </v>

625
00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:09.531
<v Speaker 6>you will get eaten by crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they will come and they will </v>

626
00:27:09.531 --> 00:27:10.860
<v Speaker 6>fucking get you and there's too many of </v>
<v Speaker 6>them and you know,</v>

627
00:27:10.861 --> 00:27:12.210
<v Speaker 6>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just areas of the water,</v>

628
00:27:12.211 --> 00:27:13.860
<v Speaker 6>you can't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you go there,</v>

629
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 6>you're going to get God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just gonna happen.</v>

630
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:20.730
<v Speaker 6>I don't find that acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just don't find that acceptable.</v>

631
00:27:20.731 --> 00:27:23.280
<v Speaker 6>I think the idea behind it is </v>
<v Speaker 6>ridiculous.</v>

632
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:27.060
<v Speaker 6>Ninety percent of everything that's ever</v>
<v Speaker 6>existed as extinct 90 fucking present.</v>

633
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there'd be any problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can't bear the crocodiles.</v>

634
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.240
<v Speaker 6>I mean it would be kind of cool to keep </v>
<v Speaker 6>them around and look at,</v>

635
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:38.450
<v Speaker 6>but if it had to do with like crocodiles</v>
<v Speaker 6>overpopulating and starting to fucking </v>

636
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:39.420
<v Speaker 6>kill people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't.</v>

637
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.930
<v Speaker 6>You can't think about them as being like</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of us.</v>

638
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.830
<v Speaker 6>You can't think about them as being like</v>
<v Speaker 6>they are part of nature now.</v>

639
00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.080
<v Speaker 6>That's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Godzilla mountain lions.</v>

<v Speaker 6>might as well get,</v>

641

<v Speaker 6>That's a monster.</v>

645
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.440
<v Speaker 6>That's a God damn monster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a mountain lion and we are working </v>

646
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.490
<v Speaker 6>so hard to conserve and protect these </v>
<v Speaker 6>killers,</v>

647
00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.830
<v Speaker 6>these things that need to kill every </v>
<v Speaker 6>day.</v>

648
00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:19.160
<v Speaker 6>These monsters that run faster than us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>jump higher than us and only killed </v>

649
00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.571
<v Speaker 6>things with their face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's all they do and they can kill you</v>

650
00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.130
<v Speaker 6>and even if you have a knife,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it could still probably kill you.</v>

651
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.730
<v Speaker 6>Even if you have two knives,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'd probably kill you.</v>

652
00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.300
<v Speaker 4>Even if you're trained.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't give a fuck.</v>

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:23.500
<v Speaker 6>They're just conditioned to maybe do or </v>
<v Speaker 6>not bite you to bite you or not,</v>

693
00:30:23.721 --> 00:30:24.790
<v Speaker 6>but you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hm?</v>

694
00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.410
<v Speaker 6>What should I do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have to think about it,</v>

695
00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.420
<v Speaker 6>but they might just decide to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>bite you.</v>

696
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.060
<v Speaker 6>But if you feed them and if you keep </v>
<v Speaker 6>feeding them,</v>

697
00:30:32.061 --> 00:30:33.650
<v Speaker 6>you stay with them and you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

<v Speaker 6>They'll accept you,</v>

700
00:30:38.651 --> 00:30:38.990
<v Speaker 6>but if you die,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're not going to cry.</v>

701
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:43.430
<v Speaker 6>They don't give a flying fuck about you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and if they were hungry and they thought</v>

702
00:30:43.431 --> 00:30:45.410
<v Speaker 6>they could eat you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of course they would eat you.</v>

703
00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:50.620
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't matter how long you've been </v>

<v Speaker 3>morning and see dead pigeons or </v>

<v Speaker 3>a pigeon landing.</v>

766
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:40.610
<v Speaker 3>And then this thing coming behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grabbing it and ripping his fucking head</v>

767
00:33:40.611 --> 00:33:45.611
<v Speaker 3>off like a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just ripped his head off and started </v>

768
00:33:45.611 --> 00:33:45.740
<v Speaker 3>eating it without the fucking head right</v>
<v Speaker 3>there on Vista,</v>

769
00:33:45.741 --> 00:33:50.741
<v Speaker 3>on sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to the Museum of natural history </v>

770
00:33:50.741 --> 00:33:50.741
<v Speaker 3>and tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the two of you,</v>

771
00:33:50.741 --> 00:33:50.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to see.</v>

772
00:33:50.741 --> 00:33:55.581
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing the thing hanging the waylon </v>

773
00:33:55.581 --> 00:33:55.581
<v Speaker 3>top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

774
00:33:55.581 --> 00:33:56.150
<v Speaker 3>it's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dinosaurs alone.</v>

775
00:33:56.470 --> 00:34:00.440
<v Speaker 3>That means it's gigantic skeletons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have incredible place,</v>

776
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:02.540
<v Speaker 3>but they showed the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

777
00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:06.590
<v Speaker 3>the transition between the dinosaur and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bird and you know,</v>

778
00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:07.850
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a dinosaur.</v>

779
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.740
<v Speaker 3>Like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They explained the whole thing,</v>

780
00:34:09.741 --> 00:34:13.130
<v Speaker 3>like the dinosaurs that survived became </v>
<v Speaker 3>birds.</v>

781
00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:18.820
<v Speaker 3>When you see an eagle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that crazy country monster that </v>

782
00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.211
<v Speaker 3>represents our country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what a perfect thing to represent </v>

783
00:34:22.211 --> 00:34:22.211
<v Speaker 3>our country.</v>

784
00:34:22.211 --> 00:34:23.240
<v Speaker 3>Like we always thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always thought the eagles proud.</v>

785
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:28.300
<v Speaker 3>Eagles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both the Eagle is a county monster from </v>

786
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.721
<v Speaker 3>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That somehow or another I managed to </v>

787
00:34:31.721 --> 00:34:31.721
<v Speaker 3>stay alive and as long as you keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving it birds,</v>

788
00:34:31.721 --> 00:34:35.850
<v Speaker 3>it'll let you fucking hold it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only.</v>

789
00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.620
<v Speaker 3>The thing about eagles is they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite big enough to kill us.</v>

790
00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.840
<v Speaker 3>They're not quite big enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

791
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:46.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm a kill and Eagle man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll probably get fucked up a little </v>

792
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:46.900
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get scratched up a bit,</v>

793
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.650
<v Speaker 3>but if I get ahold of an eagle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to kill that fucking thing.</v>

794
00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:49.600
<v Speaker 3>Take the finger off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

795
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:52.850
<v Speaker 3>Probably fucked me up pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll probably be cut up pretty hard,</v>

796
00:34:52.851 --> 00:34:55.730
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to kill that fucking eagle and</v>

797
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:57.350
<v Speaker 3>he knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows it.</v>

798
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:58.690
<v Speaker 3>He looks at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

799
00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:03.730
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you just tell a little too big </v>

800
00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:03.730
<v Speaker 3>because then he goes only like 50 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>

801
00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:03.860
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

802
00:35:03.861 --> 00:35:08.861
<v Speaker 3>they looked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're pretty fucking scary and </v>

803
00:35:08.861 --> 00:35:08.861
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

804
00:35:08.861 --> 00:35:08.861
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will fucking hurt you,</v>

805
00:35:08.861 --> 00:35:10.580
<v Speaker 3>but most likely they're not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to take you out,</v>

806
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.410
<v Speaker 3>but they've tried to pick up kids and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

807

<v Speaker 2>than a bald eagles.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like animal skin clothes.</v>

890
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in a harsh,</v>

891
00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:06.180
<v Speaker 2>harsh world and he's got this eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These got trained and this.</v>

893
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes after a fucking wolf man.</v>

894
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a gangster bird.</v>

895
00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.540
<v Speaker 2>That's mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to talk about that?</v>

896
00:39:17.541 --> 00:39:20.950
<v Speaker 2>That's like the wolf is like almost the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top of the food chain.</v>

897
00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.530
<v Speaker 2>It probably thinks it is the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>food chain.</v>

898
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>

899
00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Bird knows what a terrifying feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>that must be to be a Goddamn wolf and </v>

900
00:39:32.291 --> 00:39:34.300
<v Speaker 2>still be scared of this evil bird.</v>

901
00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:39.420
<v Speaker 2>Look how it takes it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just swoops down and grabs the bull </v>

902
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:40.150
<v Speaker 2>by the back of the neck and just starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>jacking it.</v>

903
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this wolf could easily just fucking </v>

904
00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:45.380
<v Speaker 2>attack this bird?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

905
00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:50.820
<v Speaker 2>you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the birds are stronger than </v>

906
00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:50.820
<v Speaker 2>you think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

907
00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.390
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really primitive man.</v>

908
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:57.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not like we look at them like </v>

909
00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:59.611
<v Speaker 2>they're all fluffy and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you look at their musculature and </v>

910
00:39:59.611 --> 00:40:03.601
<v Speaker 2>the way they're designed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not designed like any other </v>

911
00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:05.020
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We sort of associate their size with the</v>

912
00:40:05.021 --> 00:40:07.660
<v Speaker 2>way we would view like a mammal that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that size.</v>

913
00:40:07.661 --> 00:40:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

914
00:40:07.991 --> 00:40:10.210
<v Speaker 2>that's not that big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>

915
00:40:10.211 --> 00:40:11.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

916
00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.320
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A puppy or something in or a dog rather,</v>

917
00:40:14.321 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 2>that was that big was trying to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>after.</v>

918
00:40:15.821 --> 00:40:18.550
<v Speaker 2>You think that a dog that's only 60 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds,</v>

919
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:19.660
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be able to kill you.</v>

920
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:23.780
<v Speaker 2>That what kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a Golden Eagle now that I've.</v>

921
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.420
<v Speaker 2>They killed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing would have claw.</v>

922
00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could the claw and the neck and then </v>

00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:00.470
<v Speaker 2>you're watching madness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're watching 100 percent pure,</v>

954
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:04.430
<v Speaker 2>unfiltered madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you just watching it.</v>

955
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:09.610
<v Speaker 2>All you think of is what kind of twisted</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit is this guy doing when he's not </v>

956
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.720
<v Speaker 2>doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're that far out there,</v>

957
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:14.250
<v Speaker 2>you're that far out there that you're </v>

<v Speaker 2>Or do you think Wolverine Versus Wolf?</v>

962
00:42:23.331 --> 00:42:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Who would win if I had a guest pull up </v>
<v Speaker 2>that left the eagles?</v>

965
00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

966
00:42:32.291 --> 00:42:34.520
<v Speaker 2>it's like a Badger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Badger,</v>

967
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Badger family.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

971
00:42:43.741 --> 00:42:48.741

<v Speaker 2>They call him wolverine because the </v>

972
00:42:48.741 --> 00:42:49.800
<v Speaker 2>whole idea of wolverine is wolverine was</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be built like Sean Sherk and</v>

1038
00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.120
<v Speaker 3>While we're really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really going on right now,</v>

1039
00:45:57.121 --> 00:46:00.460
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking scary whether it's Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's going on.</v>

1040
00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well one good thing.</v>

1041
00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:06.540
<v Speaker 3>The post office ain't gonna fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes now that you see that close on </v>

1042
00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.951
<v Speaker 3>Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting in November for mail delivery </v>

1043
00:46:09.951 --> 00:46:09.951
<v Speaker 3>on Saturday.</v>

1044
00:46:09.951 --> 00:46:10.110
<v Speaker 3>No more mail on Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>November.</v>

1045
00:46:10.111 --> 00:46:12.450
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just changed on the Monday.</v>

1046
00:46:12.451 --> 00:46:17.451
<v Speaker 3>They found Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody opened their mouth and so are </v>

1047
00:46:17.451 --> 00:46:19.800
<v Speaker 3>you fucking serious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get my copy of my fucking time street.</v>

1048
00:46:19.801 --> 00:46:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck it is magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1049
00:46:21.571 --> 00:46:26.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really wondered whether or not we </v>

1050
00:46:26.571 --> 00:46:26.571
<v Speaker 3>would be better off with a privatization</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

1051
00:46:26.571 --> 00:46:28.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think ups does an awesome job.</v>

1052
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:29.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're amazing.</v>

1053
00:46:29.551 --> 00:46:30.960
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the postal service,</v>

1054
00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:35.360
<v Speaker 3>the only issues that I've ever had with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the postal service is going to the,</v>

1055
00:46:35.361 --> 00:46:39.240
<v Speaker 3>the actual place to the actual place and</v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting in line.</v>

1056
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:40.500
<v Speaker 3>That's the only issue that I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>had.</v>

1057
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:45.830
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that you should have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>government company that does what </v>

1058
00:46:45.931 --> 00:46:48.480
<v Speaker 3>private companies do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like why would you even need it?</v>

1059
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would you need a,</v>

1060
00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:52.770
<v Speaker 3>why do you need a post office?</v>

1061
00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:53.830
<v Speaker 3>Why do you need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1062
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:54.530
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1063
00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:59.570
<v Speaker 3>the post office as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as it exists is great but shouldn't </v>

1064
00:46:59.570 --> 00:46:59.570
<v Speaker 3>exist because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1065
00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:00.810
<v Speaker 3>of the market because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1066
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:03.600
<v Speaker 3>it fills a spot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1067
00:47:03.601 --> 00:47:08.601
<v Speaker 3>Like why should it be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why should it be the government that </v>

1068
00:47:08.601 --> 00:47:08.601
<v Speaker 3>does that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>

1069
00:47:08.601 --> 00:47:09.250
<v Speaker 3>One of the weird questions that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>signing.</v>

1070
00:47:09.251 --> 00:47:14.251
<v Speaker 3>In an ideal world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be great if the government did </v>

1071
00:47:14.251 --> 00:47:17.151
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In an ideal world it'd be great if we </v>

1072
00:47:17.151 --> 00:47:17.151
<v Speaker 3>could trust everybody to handle </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

1073
00:47:17.151 --> 00:47:19.170
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like everything gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>handled best when it gets treated.</v>

1074
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1075
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:26.090
<v Speaker 3>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you have like government </v>

1076
00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:26.090
<v Speaker 3>organizations that are taking places </v>
<v Speaker 3>that could be taken place by business,</v>

1077
00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:28.320
<v Speaker 3>you sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're controlling things and regulating</v>

1078
00:47:28.321 --> 00:47:33.321
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously in the post office it </v>

1079
00:47:33.321 --> 00:47:33.321
<v Speaker 3>works great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't work great in the DMV,</v>

1080
00:47:33.321 --> 00:47:35.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work great in the TSA.</v>

1081
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:37.330
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of places where it doesn't</v>

1082
00:47:37.331 --> 00:47:37.840
<v Speaker 3>work great.</v>

1083
00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.340
<v Speaker 8>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jonathan winters died.</v>

1084
00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:43.410
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I heard sex.</v>

1085
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.460
<v Speaker 3>Why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1086
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:52.510
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate to bring this up and keep going </v>

1087
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:54.441
<v Speaker 3>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why is it that like the post office </v>

1088
00:47:54.441 --> 00:47:56.500
<v Speaker 3>had all those shootings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1089
00:47:56.501 --> 00:47:57.390
<v Speaker 3>what happened there?</v>

1090
00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.860
<v Speaker 8>Just because the workers were </v>
<v Speaker 8>overworked.</v>

1091
00:47:59.861 --> 00:48:04.861
<v Speaker 8>I mean if you look at if you go to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>post office back in the day because it </v>

1092
00:48:04.861 --> 00:48:05.720
<v Speaker 8>doesn't happen anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like the shootings don't have anymore.</v>

1093
00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:11.200
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know why it's not happening </v>

1094
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.321
<v Speaker 8>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but there was a time like if you go to </v>

1095
00:48:13.321 --> 00:48:13.321
<v Speaker 8>the post office now and you just look at</v>
<v Speaker 8>the people that are working there,</v>

1096
00:48:13.321 --> 00:48:15.520
<v Speaker 8>that looks like the most miserable job </v>
<v Speaker 8>ever.</v>

1097
00:48:15.521 --> 00:48:18.880
<v Speaker 8>They're just sitting there nonstop from </v>
<v Speaker 8>eight in the morning,</v>

1098
00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:24.460
<v Speaker 3>but he just used stamps.com,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lightened the load and then there would </v>

1099
00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:25.680
<v Speaker 3>be less work and everybody could show </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck out.</v>

1100
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:29.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You imagine that's a thankless job man.</v>

1101
00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:34.550
<v Speaker 8>I didn't even check my mail and like I </v>
<v Speaker 8>don't check my mail except maybe once a </v>

1102
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:35.100
<v Speaker 8>month now and it's like the worst idea </v>
<v Speaker 8>in the rub because I'll,</v>

1103
00:48:35.101 --> 00:48:38.040
<v Speaker 8>I'll check it and there's like all these</v>
<v Speaker 8>bills and like late payments and stuff,</v>

1104
00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:40.980
<v Speaker 8>but I hate the mail so much that now it </v>
<v Speaker 8>literally,</v>

1105
00:48:40.981 --> 00:48:45.981
<v Speaker 8>it's like a stack this big of mail once </v>
<v Speaker 8>a month and only about five percent of </v>

1106
00:48:45.981 --> 00:48:48.990
<v Speaker 8>it is something that I need you to pick </v>
<v Speaker 8>up the mail it gets delivered to you now</v>

1218
00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:47.480
<v Speaker 4>So if you left your dog in the yard,</v>

1241
00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:43.050

<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who moved to a place,</v>

1242
00:54:43.051 --> 00:54:45.600
<v Speaker 3>he had a Barky dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm poisoned his dog,</v>

1243
00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:47.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1244
00:54:47.371 --> 00:54:50.640
<v Speaker 3>that's a crazy shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1245
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:55.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can understand that you ever have a </v>

1246
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.670
<v Speaker 3>problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sucks.</v>

1247
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.800
<v Speaker 3>It sucks it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guy has a barky dog,</v>

1248
00:54:55.801 --> 00:54:58.530
<v Speaker 3>but poisoning the dog is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1249
00:54:58.531 --> 00:55:00.060
<v Speaker 3>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1250
00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:02.330
<v Speaker 3>it was a big area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lived in like a,</v>

1251
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:07.790
<v Speaker 3>a big rural area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So his dog wasn't even on leash like </v>

1252
00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:08.370
<v Speaker 3>because his dog was allowed to roam </v>
<v Speaker 3>free,</v>

1253
00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:13.760
<v Speaker 3>but apparently people didn't like it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this new dog live in the </v>

1254
00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:13.770
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood and start barking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they just poisoned it,</v>

1255
00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:16.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We're all,</v>

1259
00:55:26.701 --> 00:55:28.770
<v Speaker 3>we're all lovers of animals that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>trust,</v>

1260
00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:32.940

<v Speaker 3>to spray dogs and the fence.</v>

1265
00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:46.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a sociopathic sort of thing.</v>

1266
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:50.650
<v Speaker 3>That little dog do you have.</v>

1267
00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.660
<v Speaker 8>It's not even real.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not even real man.</v>

1268
00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:59.690
<v Speaker 8>Is Your dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Your dogs don't even really marked for </v>

1269
00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:00.210
<v Speaker 8>his first time last night for days.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And did you come?</v>

1270
00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:01.050
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no he didn't.</v>

1271
00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:03.030
<v Speaker 8>He,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have mirrors in my bedroom,</v>

1272
00:56:03.031 --> 00:56:07.410
<v Speaker 8>like I'm on the doors and he just sits </v>
<v Speaker 8>there and stares at Adam self because he</v>

1273
00:56:07.411 --> 00:56:08.370
<v Speaker 8>doesn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Verus,</v>

1274
00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:13.580
<v Speaker 8>and finally last night he went crazy on </v>
<v Speaker 8>the mirrors and just barked his first </v>

1275
00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:13.580
<v Speaker 8>time it was.</v>

<v Speaker 8>It's ridiculous.</v>

1278
00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:16.800
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I found something.</v>

1279
00:56:16.801 --> 00:56:18.440
<v Speaker 8>I've been cleaning out my office.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

1280
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:21.360
<v Speaker 8>I found something the other day and it </v>
<v Speaker 8>completely opened up like,</v>

1281
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 8>like a memory that I completely forgot </v>
<v Speaker 8>about</v>

1282
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.530
<v Speaker 5>when I was younger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is so crazy.</v>

1283
00:56:26.531 --> 00:56:31.531
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe I forgot this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We used to have this thing called time </v>

1284
00:56:31.531 --> 00:56:31.531
<v Speaker 5>and temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you guys remember?</v>

1285
00:56:31.531 --> 00:56:33.820
<v Speaker 5>Do you guys have where you live?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where you called a phone number?</v>

1286
00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.550
<v Speaker 5>Like the time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is the temperature?</v>

1287
00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:37.150
<v Speaker 5>Remember that?</v>

1288
00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.610
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sense a call,</v>

1289
00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:41.250
<v Speaker 4>your mother will almost fucking kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1290
00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:46.280
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>80 bucks and fucking time and I got a </v>

1291
00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.800
<v Speaker 4>fucking collapsed all over the house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember that when I was a kid I had a</v>

1292
00:56:49.801 --> 00:56:54.801
<v Speaker 4>calling card and if I didn't know the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time I could use my calling card and a </v>

1293
00:56:54.801 --> 00:56:59.390
<v Speaker 4>fucking phone booth and call and get the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time and temperature that wants to put </v>

1294
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.390
<v Speaker 4>his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That</v>

1295
00:56:59.390 --> 00:57:03.360
<v Speaker 5>the one in Ohio was free I think and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was just a phone number you call it.</v>

1296
00:57:03.361 --> 00:57:08.361
<v Speaker 5>But what happened is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is at one point something broke where </v>

1297
00:57:08.361 --> 00:57:11.520
<v Speaker 5>like anyone else that was calling could </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk to the other people listening.</v>

1298
00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.030
<v Speaker 5>So it became a chat room for like three </v>
<v Speaker 5>months.</v>

1299
00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:16.950
<v Speaker 5>You would call time and temperature and </v>
<v Speaker 5>suddenly here like,</v>

1300
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:17.820
<v Speaker 5>hello,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you there?</v>

1301
00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:18.810
<v Speaker 5>Anyone there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

1302
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.620
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm here.</v>

1303
00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:21.540
<v Speaker 5>How are you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you start talking to people.</v>

1304
00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:26.720
<v Speaker 5>So I met this girl on top on time and </v>
<v Speaker 5>temperature and I got her phone number </v>

1305
00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:33.440
<v Speaker 5>and then we started talking for like two</v>
<v Speaker 5>weeks and she said she went to a </v>

1306
00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:36.180
<v Speaker 5>different school and all this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then she was a virgin and she was like,</v>

1307
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:39.660
<v Speaker 5>I will pay you $100 if you sleep with </v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

1308
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.890
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1309
00:57:40.891 --> 00:57:41.880
<v Speaker 5>I will take that money.</v>

1310
00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.410
<v Speaker 5>I was 17,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like $100.</v>

1311
00:57:43.411 --> 00:57:45.180
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she,</v>

1312
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:47.790
<v Speaker 5>I was kinda scared of how she looked and</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything like that.</v>

1313
00:57:47.791 --> 00:57:52.791
<v Speaker 5>She came over to my.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was when I lived with my mom and my </v>

1314
00:57:52.791 --> 00:57:53.070
<v Speaker 5>mom was out of town.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She came over one weekend,</v>

1315
00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:58.490
<v Speaker 5>never met this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just talk to her a few times on the </v>

1316
00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:00.471
<v Speaker 5>phone that are on time and temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She comes over and she was like a lot </v>

1317
00:58:00.471 --> 00:58:00.471
<v Speaker 5>older,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'm 17.</v>

1318
00:58:00.471 --> 00:58:02.450
<v Speaker 5>She was probably like 30 and I was like </v>
<v Speaker 5>alright.</v>

1319
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:07.530
<v Speaker 5>And she.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But she acted like she was in high </v>

1320
00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:07.530
<v Speaker 5>school the whole time and I just was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1321
00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:08.840
<v Speaker 5>I guess she's in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like I knew,</v>

1322
00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:11.460
<v Speaker 5>I knew that she was older,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1323
00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:14.880
<v Speaker 5>and then she wrote me a check with her </v>
<v Speaker 5>name on it and I was like,</v>

1324
00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:16.770
<v Speaker 5>oh you have a checkbook or wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's cool.</v>

1325
00:58:16.770 --> 00:58:18.150
<v Speaker 5>Like I was 17,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have a,</v>

1326
00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:23.400
<v Speaker 5>but she could write checks and I fucked </v>
<v Speaker 5>her and I've now looking back at it.</v>

1327
00:58:24.541 --> 00:58:29.541
<v Speaker 5>I never even thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was totally an older chick that was </v>

1328
00:58:29.541 --> 00:58:30.390
<v Speaker 5>fucking younger guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she,</v>

1329
00:58:30.391 --> 00:58:33.960
<v Speaker 5>I was underage and she paid me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a hooker at 17.</v>

1330
00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:39.290
<v Speaker 5>That was time and whether one of and </v>
<v Speaker 5>pick up kids because kids can kids.</v>

1331
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:45.470
<v Speaker 5>Only kids were doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I remember like this was like a </v>

1332
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.470
<v Speaker 5>chat line for kids and I will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1333
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480
<v Speaker 5>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1334
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:48.900
<v Speaker 5>Worthington.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she was just some crazy freak bitch.</v>

1335
00:58:48.901 --> 00:58:50.320
<v Speaker 5>It was fucking 17 year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1336
00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.630
<v Speaker 5>meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm on time and temperature.</v>

1337
00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.760
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then she know you were 17.</v>

1338
00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:54.600
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1339
00:58:54.601 --> 00:58:59.601
<v Speaker 5>I said I went to high school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She said she went to this other high </v>

1340
00:58:59.601 --> 00:58:59.601
<v Speaker 5>school that was like 20 minutes away.</v>

1341
00:58:59.601 --> 00:59:00.570
<v Speaker 5>It's possible that she just did a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>meth.</v>

1342
00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.040
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Honestly,</v>

1343
00:59:02.041 --> 00:59:04.110
<v Speaker 5>when she first came over I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1344
00:59:04.111 --> 00:59:06.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the person's mom.</v>

1345
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:09.310
<v Speaker 5>But then she was the girl and then she </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1346
00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.120
<v Speaker 5>we didn't barely talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember she walked in and we talk for</v>

1347
00:59:12.121 --> 00:59:17.121
<v Speaker 5>a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just turned off the lights in my </v>

1348
00:59:17.121 --> 00:59:17.121
<v Speaker 5>living room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We fucked on the floor and she gave me a</v>

1349
00:59:17.121 --> 00:59:18.790
<v Speaker 5>check and she left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like in and out half hours,</v>

1350
00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:22.110
<v Speaker 5>but you spend the money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It took a while to cash a check because</v>

1351
00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:24.590
<v Speaker 8>I didn't have a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a checking account and so I had to like,</v>

1352
00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:28.050
<v Speaker 8>I think I had to like get a cashier at a</v>
<v Speaker 8>grocery store or something.</v>

1353
00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:29.250
<v Speaker 8>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I spent the money.</v>

1354
00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:34.350
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally forgot about it though.</v>

1355
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:37.960
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't it be an amazing reality show </v>
<v Speaker 3>to follow that woman around?</v>

1356
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:43.200
<v Speaker 3>Like if you could go back in time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just watch how she did it in the age of </v>

1357
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:46.951
<v Speaker 3>no Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fine young guys and meet them </v>

1358
00:59:46.951 --> 00:59:47.470
<v Speaker 3>somewhere and just fuck them and pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

1359
00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:50.770
<v Speaker 3>Actually Pam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how crazy was that chick?</v>

1360
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:55.950
<v Speaker 3>Do you think she was that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe it was just like a one time </v>

1361
00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:59.101
<v Speaker 3>thing where she just lost her mind and </v>
<v Speaker 3>got caught up in the thrill of the </v>

1362
00:59:59.101 --> 00:59:59.101
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1363
00:59:59.101 --> 00:59:59.101
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1364
00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.720
<v Speaker 3>Think about how creepy that movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because again,</v>

1365
01:00:01.721 --> 01:00:06.721

<v Speaker 3>the bottom of the stairs at the comedy </v>

1366
01:00:06.721 --> 01:00:07.720
<v Speaker 3>store and watch the checks coming in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the bathroom.</v>

1367
01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:13.240
<v Speaker 3>Will you guys do is way out of why the </v>
<v Speaker 3>telephone when somebody's going to be </v>

1368
01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.901
<v Speaker 3>drunk and somebody should have never </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken down that painful history.</v>

1369
01:00:16.931 --> 01:00:19.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should put a payphone back there.</v>

1370
01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:20.540
<v Speaker 3>They should find a payphone.</v>

1371
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:23.480
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They took it down and they also took the</v>

1372
01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:25.670
<v Speaker 8>wind down at the Improv that used to be </v>
<v Speaker 8>outside of it.</v>

1373
01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:31.590
<v Speaker 8>They shouldn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you know it's still there at the </v>

<v Speaker 8>window so it's like perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So you can go to the stairs outside and </v>

1376
01:00:37.261 --> 01:00:39.020
<v Speaker 8>just sit there and look down and see any</v>
<v Speaker 8>girls in the bathroom.</v>

<v Speaker 3>about that on the phone or on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

1382
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:52.780
<v Speaker 3>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never done it.</v>

1383
01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Really creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sitting down by the phone waiting for </v>

<v Speaker 3>Say that.</v>

1391
01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:15.820
<v Speaker 3>I've noticed they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1392
01:01:15.821 --> 01:01:18.820
<v Speaker 3>and I could probably tell you someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>should fucking black that out,</v>

1393
01:01:18.821 --> 01:01:19.720
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just call them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Call the manager and they have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're going to have to.</v>

1395
01:01:22.781 --> 01:01:23.920
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just fucked it up.</v>

1396
01:01:23.921 --> 01:01:27.480
<v Speaker 3>We've all done things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's one of the fucking life.</v>

1397
01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:32.900
<v Speaker 3>You're not gonna be able to pull that </v>
<v Speaker 3>off anymore because you talked about on </v>

1398
01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:35.371
<v Speaker 3>the podcast and the comedy store's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have to fix that or they'll be </v>

1399
01:01:35.371 --> 01:01:37.921
<v Speaker 3>liable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny because every time you have </v>

1400
01:01:37.921 --> 01:01:37.921
<v Speaker 3>to let them know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1401
01:01:37.921 --> 01:01:40.531
<v Speaker 3>if you let go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you better let them know for real </v>

1402
01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:40.531
<v Speaker 3>because people are going to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in the pocket.</v>

1403
01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:40.570
<v Speaker 3>That's a big issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1404
01:01:40.571 --> 01:01:42.010
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're making it out like it's not a big</v>

1405
01:01:42.011 --> 01:01:45.100
<v Speaker 3>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but looking in on girls like fixing of a</v>

1406
01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:47.890
<v Speaker 3>mirror or a window to look into girls </v>
<v Speaker 3>while they shit.</v>

1407
01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.000
<v Speaker 3>That's like a seriously against the law </v>
<v Speaker 3>and seriously creepy.</v>

1408
01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:53.180
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I agree,</v>

1409
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:58.530
<v Speaker 8>but you're just joking around about it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm saying that every time I have a </v>

1410
01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:01.691
<v Speaker 8>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm with a girl and she goes to the </v>

1411
01:02:01.691 --> 01:02:01.691
<v Speaker 8>bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's the one thing I say,</v>

1412
01:02:01.691 --> 01:02:02.390
<v Speaker 8>make sure those things are shut when you</v>
<v Speaker 8>go in there.</v>

1413
01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:04.280
<v Speaker 8>Blind things stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1414
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.310
<v Speaker 8>I mean if you go in there as a girl </v>
<v Speaker 8>though and you see it,</v>

1415
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:08.420
<v Speaker 8>it's obvious like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all right,</v>

1416
01:02:08.421 --> 01:02:10.370
<v Speaker 8>there's an open window right here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I should shut this.</v>

1417
01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:12.200
<v Speaker 3>That shit's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be there.</v>

1418
01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:14.290
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Girls shouldn't have to be,</v>

1419
01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.570
<v Speaker 3>especially in a place where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>serving alcohol.</v>

1420
01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:21.680
<v Speaker 3>The last thing that should have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen as a girl should have to worry </v>

1421
01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:21.680
<v Speaker 3>about who could</v>

1422
01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:22.500
<v Speaker 10>possibly looking through a window while </v>
<v Speaker 10>she shitting.</v>

1423
01:02:22.501 --> 01:02:22.740
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

1424
01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.620
<v Speaker 4>that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's complete nonsense.</v>

1425
01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:26.440
<v Speaker 4>Fix that.</v>

1426
01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:31.030
<v Speaker 7>You just eat edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Careful.</v>

1427
01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:34.120
<v Speaker 7>You're a dangerous man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Champions going to be jamming.</v>

1428
01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:39.570
<v Speaker 7>These edibles are potent shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sterile cap at the whole bag it 130 that</v>

1429
01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:41.220
<v Speaker 7>this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1430
01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:44.050
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like a tootsie roll.</v>

1431
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:46.390
<v Speaker 7>Fucking kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing.</v>

1432
01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.770
<v Speaker 7>By next year in California that's going </v>
<v Speaker 7>to be like zombies.</v>

1433
01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:54.100
<v Speaker 7>They will be zombies because they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to double this.</v>

1434
01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:58.630
<v Speaker 7>This is for fucking loads.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're going to double this.</v>

1435
01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.670
<v Speaker 7>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't say it.</v>

1436
01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:04.710
<v Speaker 7>Don't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People are going to be walking around </v>

1437
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.710
<v Speaker 7>with shirts ripped open</v>

1438
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:08.790
<v Speaker 4>zombies and shit and that is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>crib.</v>

1439
01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:10.890
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've all had the,</v>

1440
01:03:10.891 --> 01:03:11.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1441
01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember looking through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>peephole over that.</v>

1442
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.100
<v Speaker 4>You don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

1443
01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:21.170
<v Speaker 4>it was just fucking crazy shit that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>try to think of all the crazy women that</v>

1444
01:03:21.571 --> 01:03:25.440
<v Speaker 4>I met through that over the years and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the different situations.</v>

1445
01:03:25.441 --> 01:03:30.441
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could write a book and it's kind of </v>

1446
01:03:30.441 --> 01:03:30.441
<v Speaker 4>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1447
01:03:30.441 --> 01:03:31.400
<v Speaker 4>the comedy story saying disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what the,</v>

1448
01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:36.550
<v Speaker 4>the beautiful thing about the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 4>store was the comradery between </v>

1449
01:03:36.550 --> 01:03:40.371
<v Speaker 4>contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we all sit in that back and hang </v>

1450
01:03:40.371 --> 01:03:40.371
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a,</v>

1451
01:03:40.371 --> 01:03:41.310
<v Speaker 4>there was so much camaraderie and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>guess still is.</v>

1452
01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:46.380
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's like having an employee meeting </v>

1453
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:46.380
<v Speaker 10>with,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

1454
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:46.380
<v Speaker 10>your,</v>
<v Speaker 10>your peers every night.</v>

1455
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:46.380
<v Speaker 10>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it was,</v>

1456
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.320
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it was so loosely regulated.</v>

1457
01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:49.810
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's getting more tighter now,</v>

1458
01:03:49.811 --> 01:03:51.080
<v Speaker 10>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

1459
01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:56.170
<v Speaker 10>we kind of have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It should have probably been tighter a </v>

1460
01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:56.740
<v Speaker 10>long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but the real issue was always,</v>

1461
01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.040
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>how do you,</v>

1462
01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:02.680
<v Speaker 10>how do you run a club and run a business</v>
<v Speaker 10>and then still sort of let the comedians</v>

1463
01:04:02.681 --> 01:04:05.260
<v Speaker 10>do whatever the fuck they want.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Sometimes it doesn't work out.</v>

1464
01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.690
<v Speaker 10>Comedians wreck your blades,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1465
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:11.160
<v Speaker 10>that's why I always try to contribute to</v>
<v Speaker 10>that place as much as I could.</v>

1466
01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:15.430
<v Speaker 10>Like is like I would do it for free.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I paid for the sound system there.</v>

1467
01:04:15.431 --> 01:04:15.830
<v Speaker 10>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what?</v>

1468
01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:17.550
<v Speaker 10>You need to go back there and pay for </v>
<v Speaker 10>any sentences.</v>

1469
01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:19.690
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's bullshit.</v>

1470
01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:23.560
<v Speaker 10>I'm sure it has a sound system.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I bought in like 2001 or some shit,</v>

1471
01:04:23.561 --> 01:04:24.730
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's an old sound.</v>

1472
01:04:24.731 --> 01:04:28.720
<v Speaker 10>So it's scary there too because I do the</v>
<v Speaker 10>show up in the belly room and,</v>

1473
01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:33.750
<v Speaker 10>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>up in the belly room is like falling </v>

1474
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:35.731
<v Speaker 10>apart like you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>like I went to plug something in and </v>

1475
01:04:35.731 --> 01:04:35.731
<v Speaker 10>like all the electricity went out and </v>
<v Speaker 10>then I'm like,</v>

1476
01:04:35.731 --> 01:04:37.870
<v Speaker 10>these,</v>
<v Speaker 10>these outlets are not legal.</v>

1477
01:04:37.890 --> 01:04:40.480
<v Speaker 10>Like this is impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Like you would like,</v>

1478
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:41.520
<v Speaker 10>I'll turn on,</v>
<v Speaker 10>light</v>

1479
01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:43.370

<v Speaker 4>keep it up,</v>

1480
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:44.750

<v Speaker 4>There's gonna be people that are </v>

1482
01:04:49.751 --> 01:04:50.330
<v Speaker 4>thinking big conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1483

<v Speaker 4>finest in Los Angeles.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Remember this shit the size of a finger </v>
<v Speaker 3>we started taking on the road was like,</v>

1775
01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:40.950
<v Speaker 3>That early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me start taking 2005.</v>

1776
01:17:40.951 --> 01:17:43.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was way earlier.</v>

1777
01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way later than that.</v>

1778
01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.060
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1779
01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:50.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was before 2006 because I </v>

1780
01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:52.620
<v Speaker 3>remember it was a Mike Young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't make a Gig and Ari came instead</v>

1781
01:17:52.621 --> 01:17:57.621
<v Speaker 3>of her and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Denver and he fucking destroyed and </v>

1782
01:17:57.621 --> 01:17:58.890
<v Speaker 3>he was only doing comedy a few years </v>
<v Speaker 3>back then,</v>

1783
01:17:59.090 --> 01:17:59.720

<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1785
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:05.500

<v Speaker 3>crowd he'd ever had and then like his </v>

1786
01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:10.250

<v Speaker 3>Like when I write things on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times I run.</v>

1830
01:19:53.351 --> 01:19:53.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1831
01:19:53.771 --> 01:19:55.750
<v Speaker 3>how's that going to be conveyed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1832
01:19:55.751 --> 01:19:57.170
<v Speaker 3>It's only 140 characters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you.</v>

1833
01:19:57.171 --> 01:20:00.790
<v Speaker 3>When I hear you say something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly what you're saying.</v>

1834
01:20:00.791 --> 01:20:03.130
<v Speaker 3>I know where it's coming from anew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your inflection,</v>

1835
01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:05.230
<v Speaker 3>your pause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seriousness in your voice,</v>

1836
01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.020
<v Speaker 3>the intensity in your tone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever,</v>

1837
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:09.480
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying.</v>

1838
01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.730
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to express yourself on </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter,</v>

1839
01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:14.760
<v Speaker 3>but on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where people grow to love human.</v>

1840
01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:19.820
<v Speaker 3>Then they see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hear that voice on twitter when </v>

1841
01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:19.820
<v Speaker 3>they read your tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know you,</v>

1842
01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:19.940
<v Speaker 3>they know your voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1843
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:22.470
<v Speaker 3>you know who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they see that in your twenties.</v>

1844
01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:23.460
<v Speaker 3>Then it works.</v>

1845
01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:26.880
<v Speaker 3>But it's a lot of things on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people,</v>

1846
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:29.290
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had an issue this week or um,</v>

1847

<v Speaker 3>pretty obvious jokes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>about male vegans.</v>

1853
01:20:42.991 --> 01:20:43.540
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Male feminists.</v>

1858
01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:52.710

<v Speaker 3>feminist,</v>

<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1880
01:21:36.930 --> 01:21:39.630
<v Speaker 3>it all started out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got pissed off and I talked about this</v>

1881
01:21:39.631 --> 01:21:40.830
<v Speaker 3>a little bit on the ice house </v>
<v Speaker 3>chronicles.</v>

1882
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:46.070
<v Speaker 3>So there was some lady that was saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>nasty shit about kids like didn't like </v>

1883
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:48.951
<v Speaker 3>kids and started wrote on twitter that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>view women who don't like kids the same </v>

1884
01:21:48.951 --> 01:21:50.910
<v Speaker 3>way I view dogs that like to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing shit.</v>

1885
01:21:51.170 --> 01:21:52.080
<v Speaker 3>Like that's how I look at him.</v>

1886
01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:52.430
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1887
01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:53.970
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1888
01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:59.240
<v Speaker 3>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just being a fly on the wall </v>

1889
01:21:59.240 --> 01:21:59.240
<v Speaker 3>during a shitty conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1890
01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:01.080
<v Speaker 3>So I write that down on twitter and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get angry at me.</v>

1891
01:22:01.081 --> 01:22:02.820
<v Speaker 3>Like you're equating women too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

1892
01:22:02.821 --> 01:22:04.740
<v Speaker 3>eating dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And No,</v>

1893
01:22:04.741 --> 01:22:09.741
<v Speaker 3>not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean yes and not exactly what I'm </v>

1894
01:22:09.741 --> 01:22:12.621
<v Speaker 3>basically saying is it's kind of a gross</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing when someone doesn't like kids and</v>

1895
01:22:12.901 --> 01:22:14.880
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was feeling at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know.</v>

1896
01:22:14.881 --> 01:22:18.450
<v Speaker 3>I probably shouldn't have wrote women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably should've wrote men.</v>

1897
01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:23.480
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think about it because it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually a woman who was doing it and I </v>

1898
01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.440
<v Speaker 3>always like it when I see women that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like kids especially because I have kids</v>

1899
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:28.260
<v Speaker 3>and women that like kids are like cute </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the kids and it's kind of fun.</v>

1900
01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:32.090
<v Speaker 3>But I should've said people and not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1901
01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:36.030
<v Speaker 3>men or women and I should have probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>said hate instead of not like.</v>

1902
01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:36.990
<v Speaker 3>Because people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1903
01:22:36.991 --> 01:22:40.110
<v Speaker 3>like if women don't want to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>children and they're pieces of shit that</v>

1904
01:22:40.111 --> 01:22:41.400
<v Speaker 3>had nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I meant,</v>

1905
01:22:41.401 --> 01:22:43.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if a woman doesn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have kids,</v>

1906
01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:45.450
<v Speaker 3>you should absolutely be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to do.</v>

1907
01:22:45.451 --> 01:22:48.270
<v Speaker 3>And I could totally understand not </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting to take on the responsibility of</v>

1908
01:22:48.271 --> 01:22:49.140
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a woman.</v>

1909
01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:52.920
<v Speaker 3>That's not what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean doesn't want to have one.</v>

1910
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.260
<v Speaker 3>What I meant was doesn't like them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1911
01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Like people don't like to like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids away from me.</v>

1912
01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.980
<v Speaker 3>That's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It irks me.</v>

1913
01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.990
<v Speaker 3>It irks me with anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with men or women.</v>

1914
01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.340
<v Speaker 3>But I saw a woman it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I tweeted about that.</v>

1915
01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:11.580
<v Speaker 3>Then I started getting all these white </v>
<v Speaker 3>knight feminists dudes that were giving </v>

1916
01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:11.580
<v Speaker 3>me a hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1917
01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you weak bitches.</v>

1918
01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:16.710
<v Speaker 3>You better shut your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's silly.</v>

1919
01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:19.430
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was just like over and over again,</v>

1920
01:23:19.431 --> 01:23:21.400
<v Speaker 3>this nonsense about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1921
01:23:21.401 --> 01:23:26.401
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this contributes to violence against </v>

1922
01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:26.401
<v Speaker 3>women and your attitudes or misogynistic</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>

1923
01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:28.930
<v Speaker 3>well I'm talking about someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't like kids.</v>

1924
01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:30.580
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all I'm saying.</v>

1925
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:36.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm standing in 140 characters and </v>

1926
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:38.971
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a stupid way to say anything </v>

1927
01:23:38.971 --> 01:23:38.971
<v Speaker 3>controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1928
01:23:38.971 --> 01:23:40.690
<v Speaker 3>maybe twitter if you don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>misunderstood.</v>

1929
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:42.880
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't want to have to explain</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

1930
01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:45.120
<v Speaker 3>don't say anything controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1931
01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:50.130
<v Speaker 3>because anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because people look easy because it's </v>

1932
01:23:50.130 --> 01:23:52.270
<v Speaker 3>such a limited form of expression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can all of a sudden imply all sorts</v>

1933
01:23:52.271 --> 01:23:57.271
<v Speaker 3>of meaning to it and then write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold blogs about this implied meaning </v>

1934
01:23:57.271 --> 01:24:01.860
<v Speaker 3>they all of a sudden have like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole cause and all they're doing is </v>

1935
01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:05.041
<v Speaker 3>misinterpreting an original statement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because it's so narrow and its </v>

1936
01:24:05.041 --> 01:24:06.040
<v Speaker 3>definition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's only 140 characters,</v>

1937
01:24:06.190 --> 01:24:11.190
<v Speaker 3>there's so much room for them </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshitting and coming up with their </v>

1938
01:24:11.190 --> 01:24:11.190
<v Speaker 3>own meaning and now.</v>

1939
01:24:11.190 --> 01:24:15.900
<v Speaker 3>So it's good because like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a bunch of feminists write blogs </v>

1940
01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:15.900
<v Speaker 3>about me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was hilarious,</v>

1941
01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:19.651
<v Speaker 3>like reading all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my massage mystic attitudes and </v>

1942
01:24:19.651 --> 01:24:23.011
<v Speaker 3>this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's about as far from the truth </v>

1943

<v Speaker 4>My mother had just died.</v>

2348
01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:02.891
<v Speaker 4>That was traumatic enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was just over the fucking woman </v>

2349
01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:05.180
<v Speaker 4>still alive today.</v>

2350
01:43:05.181 --> 01:43:10.181
<v Speaker 4>I don't even look on facebook because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>might kill her because she fucked me up.</v>

2351
01:43:11.331 --> 01:43:14.450
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan fucked me up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told her to put her pants on.</v>

2352
01:43:14.451 --> 01:43:18.620
<v Speaker 4>I remember walking home the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to know how to control myself.</v>

2353
01:43:21.570 --> 01:43:25.580
<v Speaker 4>Till this day I think about that </v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker because she thought,</v>

01:43:25.610 --> 01:43:26.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the first time.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Haven't seen a woman with her period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the last I made a fucking point.</v>

2360
01:43:43.991 --> 01:43:43.991
<v Speaker 4>ends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no more talking.</v>

<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>

2460
01:47:58.030 --> 01:47:59.410
<v Speaker 5>Like almost like every single day.</v>

<v Speaker 2>prominence,</v>

2498
01:49:41.281 --> 01:49:44.980
<v Speaker 2>like a giant movie star like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you run around saying that you're not</v>

<v Speaker 2>constitutional legality of this and </v>

2503
01:49:57.181 --> 01:50:01.021
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reality is everybody's paying </v>

<v Speaker 2>Seventy six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>The reality of this situation is that </v>

2508
01:50:09.121 --> 01:50:09.160
<v Speaker 2>everybody's paying and these people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

2509
01:50:09.161 --> 01:50:14.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have found a clause here deep within </v>

2510
01:50:14.161 --> 01:50:16.891
<v Speaker 2>the constitution that clearly states </v>
<v Speaker 2>that what is going on is </v>

2511
01:50:16.891 --> 01:50:16.891
<v Speaker 2>unconstitutional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlawful,</v>

2512
01:50:16.891 --> 01:50:19.420
<v Speaker 2>and they would never have this brought </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in a court of law because if this was</v>

2513
01:50:19.421 --> 01:50:24.421
<v Speaker 2>exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would take down the very empire </v>

2514
01:50:24.421 --> 01:50:24.421
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

2515
01:50:24.421 --> 01:50:24.421
<v Speaker 2>And people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

2516
01:50:24.421 --> 01:50:25.570
<v Speaker 2>I ain't paying taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let him come get me.</v>

2517
01:50:25.690 --> 01:50:26.920
<v Speaker 2>I'll start talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

2518
01:50:27.070 --> 01:50:32.070
<v Speaker 2>I start telling them about how the tax </v>
<v Speaker 2>code is illegal and not even in the </v>

2519
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.860
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2520
01:50:32.861 --> 01:50:36.220
<v Speaker 2>and they're like telling Leslie Leslie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and next thing you know,</v>

2521
01:50:36.221 --> 01:50:37.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it went down that way.</v>

2522
01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:40.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm just guessing I'm making shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to be me,</v>

2523
01:50:40.770 --> 01:50:42.970
<v Speaker 2>me of the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then next thing you know,</v>

2524
01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:47.350
<v Speaker 2>he bought into some guy's idea and </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't pay taxes like willfully.</v>

2525
01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:50.310
<v Speaker 2>And so that was for like a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and when,</v>

2526
01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:52.690
<v Speaker 2>when they were going after him and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to,</v>

2527
01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2528
01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:54.960
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he won,</v>

2529
01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.340
<v Speaker 2>won but didn't win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't lose.</v>

2530
01:50:57.730 --> 01:51:00.940
<v Speaker 2>He lost like the second most important </v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

2531
01:51:00.941 --> 01:51:03.400
<v Speaker 2>but I think he was acquitted in the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>important one,</v>

2532
01:51:03.401 --> 01:51:06.430
<v Speaker 2>which was like a conspiracy or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>along those lines,</v>

2533
01:51:06.670 --> 01:51:11.670
<v Speaker 2>but he's still willfully avoided paying </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes and so they put them away for </v>

2534
01:51:11.670 --> 01:51:11.710
<v Speaker 2>three solid years.</v>

2535
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:13.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're 47 years old like he was,</v>

2536
01:51:14.290 --> 01:51:19.290
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a long chunk of the future of </v>

2537
01:51:19.290 --> 01:51:19.290
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2538
01:51:19.290 --> 01:51:19.510
<v Speaker 2>How much more time do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have?</v>

2539
01:51:20.290 --> 01:51:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Who's the oldest person ever?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like 1:20</v>

2540
01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:24.460
<v Speaker 2>and so we got eight years left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less,</v>

2541
01:51:24.610 --> 01:51:26.350
<v Speaker 2>less than 80 years and someone just </v>
<v Speaker 2>stole three.</v>

2542
01:51:26.650 --> 01:51:30.730
<v Speaker 2>They stole three and wanting to put you </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a cage because you didn't pay them.</v>

2543
01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:34.240
<v Speaker 2>That is like some of the most gangster </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2544
01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:37.360
<v Speaker 2>like any society can never pull on its </v>
<v Speaker 2>citizens.</v>

2545
01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:40.240
<v Speaker 2>If you don't give us a piece of what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>earn,</v>

2546
01:51:40.930 --> 01:51:43.690
<v Speaker 2>then we're going to put you in a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a debt.</v>

2547
01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:48.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not like there's some money on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ledger that has to be corrected and you </v>

2548
01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:50.200
<v Speaker 2>have to eventually re compensate us </v>
<v Speaker 2>until we're even.</v>

2549
01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:51.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2550
01:51:51.461 --> 01:51:53.350
<v Speaker 2>We're going to lock you in a cage.</v>

2551
01:51:53.590 --> 01:51:55.690
<v Speaker 2>That's our solution when you get up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2552
01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.310
<v Speaker 2>you're still going to have to pay us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2553
01:51:57.311 --> 01:52:02.311
<v Speaker 2>that's a fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a fairly victimless crime if </v>

2554
01:52:02.311 --> 01:52:04.771
<v Speaker 2>you really think about it and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greater spectrum of all the things that </v>

2555
01:52:04.771 --> 01:52:05.350
<v Speaker 2>goes wrong in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fairly victimless crime.</v>

2556
01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:07.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely it's a crime.</v>

2557
01:52:07.721 --> 01:52:12.721
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People should have to contribute to the </v>

2558
01:52:12.721 --> 01:52:13.120
<v Speaker 2>fixing of the highways and paying police</v>
<v Speaker 2>officers and all that jazz,</v>

2559
01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:18.780
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that someone should be just</v>
<v Speaker 2>locked in a cage for that is kind of </v>

2560
01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:19.990
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2561
01:52:19.991 --> 01:52:22.660
<v Speaker 2>there's people that don't get locked in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a cage for assault.</v>

2562
01:52:22.810 --> 01:52:27.810
<v Speaker 2>There's people that don't get locked in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a cage for much more horrible physical </v>

2563
01:52:27.810 --> 01:52:28.990
<v Speaker 2>things where there's actual real trauma </v>
<v Speaker 2>to an individual.</v>

2564
01:52:28.991 --> 01:52:32.170
<v Speaker 2>There's an actual victim and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get locked in a cage for three years.</v>

2565
01:52:32.171 --> 01:52:37.171
<v Speaker 2>You said the reasons why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they wanted to make an example </v>

2566
01:52:37.171 --> 01:52:38.010
<v Speaker 2>out of him as a person in his position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2567
01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:43.020
<v Speaker 2>you can't go to the government going and</v>
<v Speaker 2>paint that really can send tags down </v>

2568
01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:43.360
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

2569
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Dave Koresh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you haven't learned when they want</v>

2570
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:47.090
<v Speaker 3>their shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get there,</v>

2571
01:52:47.210 --> 01:52:50.990
<v Speaker 3>fuck it don't matter the government or </v>
<v Speaker 3>your fucking constitution,</v>

2572
01:52:51.170 --> 01:52:56.170
<v Speaker 3>throw that shit out the fucking window </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I pity you for even believing that </v>

2573
01:52:56.170 --> 01:52:56.650
<v Speaker 3>if you fuck up baton up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're coming to get you.</v>

2574
01:52:56.670 --> 01:53:01.670
<v Speaker 3>My friend at this point like retracting </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is going to be met with furious </v>

2575
01:53:02.481 --> 01:53:05.360
<v Speaker 3>resistance and the idea that it's not as</v>
<v Speaker 3>as really silly.</v>

2576
01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:10.700
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like at a point in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country where things are so weird that </v>

2577
01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:12.890
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like one of two things has </v>
<v Speaker 3>to happen.</v>

2578
01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:16.790
<v Speaker 3>Either there's some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>technological breakthrough that makes it</v>

2579
01:53:16.791 --> 01:53:19.160
<v Speaker 3>impossible align anymore and then from </v>
<v Speaker 3>now on,</v>

2580
01:53:19.190 --> 01:53:21.170
<v Speaker 3>everybody has to operate like 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

2581
01:53:21.590 --> 01:53:26.590
<v Speaker 3>No bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's either that when we get adapted to </v>

2582
01:53:26.590 --> 01:53:29.120
<v Speaker 3>that or some fucking walking dead Zombie</v>
<v Speaker 3>type situation where we have to reinvent</v>

2583
01:53:29.121 --> 01:53:32.660
<v Speaker 3>civilization because we just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way we're going right now.</v>

2584
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:37.870
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many opportunities for us to </v>

2585
01:53:37.870 --> 01:53:39.680
<v Speaker 3>trip over our own decks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just this North Korea thing alone.</v>

2586
01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:46.080
<v Speaker 3>See what's going on with this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers just pointing rockets at </v>

2587
01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:47.180
<v Speaker 3>everybody and Saber rattling and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they need?</v>

2588
01:53:47.210 --> 01:53:48.590
<v Speaker 3>They need food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they need.</v>

2589
01:53:48.650 --> 01:53:50.090
<v Speaker 3>They need power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>electricity.</v>

2590
01:53:50.091 --> 01:53:55.091
<v Speaker 3>They need something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously this guy's doing something to </v>

2591
01:53:55.091 --> 01:53:56.300
<v Speaker 3>get some sort of attention and get some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people to calm him down.</v>

2592
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:58.850
<v Speaker 3>How long can that guy be around for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long can you have?</v>

2593
01:53:58.851 --> 01:54:01.940
<v Speaker 3>India and Pakistan hate each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pointing nuclear arms at each other.</v>

2594
01:54:01.941 --> 01:54:02.420
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2595
01:54:02.421 --> 01:54:05.180
<v Speaker 3>They're just like staring at each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2596
01:54:05.181 --> 01:54:06.890
<v Speaker 3>How much longer can people do what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing?</v>

2597
01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:13.060
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of two things has to </v>

2598
01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:13.060
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either we,</v>

2599
01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:15.900
<v Speaker 3>they've got to figure out some new </v>
<v Speaker 3>invention that lets people all realize </v>

2600
01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:19.700
<v Speaker 3>that we all have like there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>repercussions to everyone's actions,</v>

2601
01:54:19.701 --> 01:54:24.701
<v Speaker 3>positive and negative and everybody has </v>
<v Speaker 3>a stake and everything that happens all </v>

2602
01:54:24.701 --> 01:54:28.571
<v Speaker 3>over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's in the Congo or the </v>

2603
01:54:28.571 --> 01:54:28.571
<v Speaker 3>fucking.</v>

2604
01:54:28.571 --> 01:54:29.210
<v Speaker 3>The people that are getting run out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Brazilian rainforest because loggers</v>

2605
01:54:29.211 --> 01:54:31.490
<v Speaker 3>have moved in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys are douchebags like,</v>

2606
01:54:31.530 --> 01:54:32.930
<v Speaker 3>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's be clear about that.</v>

2607
01:54:33.110 --> 01:54:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Like some people were living in tents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guys want to steal their trees like</v>

2608
01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:39.530
<v Speaker 3>everybody needs to settle the fuck down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to look at this globally and the</v>

2609
01:54:39.531 --> 01:54:44.531
<v Speaker 3>fact that like country shit can happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Amazon and the Congo and all </v>

2610
01:54:44.531 --> 01:54:47.891
<v Speaker 3>these different spots while that happens</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we know about it will never be at </v>

2611
01:54:47.891 --> 01:54:52.751
<v Speaker 3>balance and it seems to me it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>something has to happen that connects </v>

2612
01:54:52.751 --> 01:54:55.250
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's a stage of evolution,</v>

2613
01:54:55.251 --> 01:55:00.251
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a slow progress of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's we're going through right now that </v>

2614
01:55:00.251 --> 01:55:04.271
<v Speaker 3>we're where people are getting upset at </v>
<v Speaker 3>things right now that they never got </v>

2615
01:55:04.271 --> 01:55:04.271
<v Speaker 3>upset before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2616
01:55:04.271 --> 01:55:08.060
<v Speaker 3>where people are sort of realizing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there were much more connected than than</v>

2617
01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:09.380
<v Speaker 3>people have ever been before.</v>

2618
01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:14.800
<v Speaker 3>And if that doesn't like continue on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that trend when you've got things like </v>

2619
01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:16.700
<v Speaker 3>North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you got things like what's going on</v>

2620
01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:20.660

<v Speaker 7>American people that you've ever known.</v>

01:57:24.630 --> 01:57:29.630
<v Speaker 7>Nobody knew that the government wanted </v>
<v Speaker 7>it so bad they wanted him.</v>

2663

01:57:42.421 --> 01:57:44.970
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

2669
01:57:44.971 --> 01:57:45.750
<v Speaker 7>was brilliant.</v>

2670
01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:50.760
<v Speaker 7>The sense that he was the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was the first one to wrap what he </v>

2671
01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:51.960
<v Speaker 7>did to the government was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The government knew.</v>

2672
01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:57.140
<v Speaker 7>I told you that there's the stories that</v>
<v Speaker 7>the government was collecting his loan </v>

2673
01:57:57.140 --> 01:57:57.390
<v Speaker 7>shark payments.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When he went away,</v>

2674
01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:59.490
<v Speaker 7>he went into the system,</v>
<v Speaker 7>got out,</v>

2675
01:57:59.790 --> 01:58:04.790
<v Speaker 7>and then that's when it really blew up </v>
<v Speaker 7>in their face because all these people </v>

2676
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:05.490
<v Speaker 7>started going and testifying saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would never lie.</v>

2677
01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:06.460
<v Speaker 7>I sold drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>you didn't.</v>

2680
01:58:09.450 --> 01:58:14.450
<v Speaker 7>Sammy never sold a drug in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But after 50 people came in and said </v>

2681
01:58:14.450 --> 01:58:14.910
<v Speaker 7>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they did.</v>

2682
01:58:14.911 --> 01:58:16.340
<v Speaker 7>The government finally said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>

2683
01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:18.830
<v Speaker 7>fucking lie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then that fucking idiot went on,</v>

2684
01:58:18.831 --> 01:58:22.580
<v Speaker 7>things will be out on the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Man went on Hbo.</v>

2685
01:58:22.581 --> 01:58:27.120
<v Speaker 7>Now this third last interview,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said he killed the cop and then Sammy</v>

2686
01:58:27.121 --> 01:58:29.250
<v Speaker 7>the bull gravano gave him the yard.</v>

2687
01:58:30.330 --> 01:58:33.510
<v Speaker 7>They went to the files.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They said they seen that he never copped</v>

2688
01:58:33.511 --> 01:58:38.511
<v Speaker 7>to that cop and lost them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They had to move out with ecstasy ring </v>

2689
01:58:38.511 --> 01:58:41.641
<v Speaker 7>and they pulled him into jail and the </v>
<v Speaker 7>ice band mysteriously died to tell his </v>

2690
01:58:42.191 --> 01:58:47.191
<v Speaker 7>story to prosecute Sammy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They took the ball and they put them in </v>

2691
01:58:47.191 --> 01:58:49.150
<v Speaker 7>Colorado in Tomahawk,</v>
<v Speaker 7>under the fucking prison,</v>

2692
01:58:51.010 --> 01:58:53.590
<v Speaker 7>under the prison.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the government,</v>

2693
01:58:54.010 --> 01:58:56.170
<v Speaker 7>this is a king.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He never sees the light,</v>

2694
01:58:56.200 --> 01:59:01.200
<v Speaker 7>never sees light again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the government didn't give a fuck </v>

2695
01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.050
<v Speaker 7>when they cut the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's not just with him.</v>

2696
01:59:02.290 --> 01:59:04.780
<v Speaker 7>They do this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's a different government.</v>

2697
01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:09.930
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like the people that are in charge </v>

2698
01:59:09.930 --> 01:59:12.031
<v Speaker 7>today and not the people that put Sammy </v>
<v Speaker 7>the bull out on the street back during </v>

2699
01:59:12.031 --> 01:59:13.360
<v Speaker 7>the daytime,</v>
<v Speaker 7>most likely five fucking years.</v>

2700
01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:16.570
<v Speaker 7>He got for killing 20 people and they </v>
<v Speaker 7>got to take his money.</v>

<v Speaker 7>They didn't care.</v>

2703
01:59:20.951 --> 01:59:22.630

<v Speaker 7>Phoenix.</v>

2704
01:59:22.631 --> 01:59:27.631
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then he didn't even try to go under </v>

2705
01:59:27.631 --> 01:59:30.061
<v Speaker 7>a fake name or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He told him to go fuck himself or he </v>

2706

<v Speaker 2>and I don't think either you can,</v>

3076
02:15:49.861 --> 02:15:54.861
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that these people are living like </v>

3077
02:15:54.861 --> 02:15:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Stalinist Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're living like a real communist </v>

3078
02:15:58.040 --> 02:15:59.190
<v Speaker 2>dictatorial sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3079
02:15:59.730 --> 02:16:01.770
<v Speaker 2>you big view of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3080
02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:05.310
<v Speaker 2>their idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of life is they have dear leader.</v>

3081
02:16:05.530 --> 02:16:07.800
<v Speaker 2>You know when people didn't cry for dear</v>
<v Speaker 2>leader,</v>

3082
02:16:08.130 --> 02:16:09.240
<v Speaker 2>you don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy died.</v>

3083
02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:12.240
<v Speaker 2>People didn't cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got sentenced to six months in jail.</v>

3084
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:15.150
<v Speaker 2>They sent some people to jail because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't cry.</v>

3085
02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:18.390
<v Speaker 2>So people like if you ever see the video</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people crying,</v>

3086
02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:23.600
<v Speaker 2>it is the most ridiculous overproduced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overactive nuttiness that you've ever </v>

3087
02:16:23.731 --> 02:16:26.490
<v Speaker 2>seen in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's people just terrified.</v>

3088
02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 2>It's really sad to watch because these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are terrified and</v>

3089
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:33.210
<v Speaker 3>they're wandering around crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just wailing.</v>

3090
02:16:33.220 --> 02:16:36.490
<v Speaker 3>It's so fake looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks so fake,</v>

3091
02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:40.150
<v Speaker 3>but it's like they have to put on a show</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the government is so,</v>

3092
02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:40.730
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3093
02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:45.780
<v Speaker 3>they're so controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a horrible dictatorship that </v>

3094
02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:47.560
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not crying for the Guy Dying,</v>

3095
02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:52.210
<v Speaker 3>they just throw you in a fucking cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3096
02:16:52.390 --> 02:16:55.240
<v Speaker 3>The balance of power for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>

3097
02:16:55.241 --> 02:16:59.410
<v Speaker 3>people always want to get to that sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of total dictatorial position.</v>

3098
02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:00.880
<v Speaker 3>Like even the guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3099
02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:03.580
<v Speaker 3>who was the overthrowing of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government in Egypt,</v>

3100
02:17:04.330 --> 02:17:09.330
<v Speaker 3>the new people that came in were like </v>
<v Speaker 3>adults and I don't think the law should </v>

3101
02:17:09.330 --> 02:17:09.330
<v Speaker 3>apply to us and we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody was like,</v>

3102
02:17:09.330 --> 02:17:11.650
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was like riots in the street.</v>

3103
02:17:11.651 --> 02:17:12.040
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3104
02:17:12.041 --> 02:17:17.041
<v Speaker 3>this is what we just got rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're trying to do exactly what </v>

3105
02:17:17.041 --> 02:17:17.041
<v Speaker 3>the government before you like.</v>

3106
02:17:17.041 --> 02:17:18.670
<v Speaker 3>I see where you're going with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He crazy fucks.</v>

3107
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:23.260
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like a slave camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the purpose of a slave?</v>

3108
02:17:23.261 --> 02:17:24.580
<v Speaker 3>They're making them where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>working.</v>

3109
02:17:24.581 --> 02:17:25.990
<v Speaker 3>They're making things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

3110
02:17:26.220 --> 02:17:28.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korea has almost no money there.</v>

3111
02:17:28.171 --> 02:17:31.120
<v Speaker 3>They're unbelievably broke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you fly over North Korea at night,</v>

3112
02:17:31.121 --> 02:17:33.370
<v Speaker 3>the lights are out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They shut their lights off at night,</v>

3113
02:17:33.610 --> 02:17:35.980
<v Speaker 3>whereas you go to South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like any other part of the world.</v>

3114
02:17:35.981 --> 02:17:40.981
<v Speaker 3>We see people's lights on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korea doesn't even have enough </v>

3115
02:17:40.981 --> 02:17:40.981
<v Speaker 3>money to keep the lights on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

3116
02:17:40.981 --> 02:17:40.981
<v Speaker 3>it's an uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible.</v>

3117
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:43.390
<v Speaker 3>You can't run a country like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to profit.</v>

3118
02:17:43.391 --> 02:17:48.391
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to prosper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the only way to have a really </v>

3119
02:17:48.391 --> 02:17:50.611
<v Speaker 3>strong economy is you have a lot to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people that are trying to make </v>

3120
02:17:50.611 --> 02:17:53.731
<v Speaker 3>things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not just like the people that are in </v>

3121
02:17:53.731 --> 02:17:53.731
<v Speaker 3>charge and then their slaves.</v>

3122
02:17:53.731 --> 02:17:54.970
<v Speaker 3>You can't run it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3123
02:17:54.971 --> 02:17:59.971
<v Speaker 3>you can't run it where you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire civilization is under your </v>

3124
02:17:59.971 --> 02:18:00.250
<v Speaker 3>heel because a strong man is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prosper.</v>

3125
02:18:00.251 --> 02:18:05.251
<v Speaker 3>A strong woman is going to prosper and </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody that knows they're under the </v>

3126
02:18:05.251 --> 02:18:06.190
<v Speaker 3>heel of the government like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're never going to prosper.</v>

3127
02:18:06.310 --> 02:18:07.840
<v Speaker 3>So the economy is never going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>vital.</v>

3128
02:18:07.841 --> 02:18:12.841
<v Speaker 3>It's never going to be like no one's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be out there trying to make </v>

3129
02:18:12.841 --> 02:18:12.910
<v Speaker 3>shit happen and kick ass and take names </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3130
02:18:12.911 --> 02:18:13.360
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3131
02:18:13.361 --> 02:18:15.250
<v Speaker 3>and keep the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the economy energized.</v>

3132
02:18:15.670 --> 02:18:20.670
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're terrified of jackbooted thugs </v>

3133
02:18:20.670 --> 02:18:24.030
<v Speaker 3>coming into the house and locking them </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a cage because they weren't fake </v>

3134
02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:24.030
<v Speaker 3>crying enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3135
02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:26.260
<v Speaker 3>and it's 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the funniest part about it.</v>

3136
02:18:26.530 --> 02:18:31.530
<v Speaker 3>So this is happening right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like you and I are taking fucking </v>

3137
02:18:31.530 --> 02:18:35.101
<v Speaker 3>southwest to San Jose and having a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and fucking driving to Vegas and </v>

3138
02:18:35.101 --> 02:18:36.220
<v Speaker 3>waving at people at the gas station.</v>

3139
02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:41.520
<v Speaker 3>These fucking people in another part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world right now are living in a </v>

3140
02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:41.640
<v Speaker 3>horror movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking amazing.</v>

3141
02:18:41.810 --> 02:18:44.290
<v Speaker 3>You imagine men living in a horror </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

3142
02:18:44.530 --> 02:18:46.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you literally are living in Star Wars.</v>

3143
02:18:47.140 --> 02:18:49.750
<v Speaker 3>They might as well be stormtroopers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might as well be darth vader.</v>

3144
02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:52.900
<v Speaker 3>You really are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means they have nuclear power.</v>

3145
02:18:53.530 --> 02:18:55.090
<v Speaker 3>They have nuclear power and machine </v>
<v Speaker 3>guns,</v>

3146
02:18:55.150 --> 02:19:00.150
<v Speaker 3>tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're all willing to walk in a </v>

3147
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.150
<v Speaker 3>straight line without lifting the leg up</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time.</v>

3148
02:19:00.610 --> 02:19:04.510
<v Speaker 3>Which is scary for us when everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>moves mindlessly in a unit together.</v>

3149
02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:05.470
<v Speaker 3>Left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3150
02:19:05.530 --> 02:19:06.250
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3151
02:19:06.370 --> 02:19:08.980
<v Speaker 3>That scares the shit out of us because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that means you're willing to do whatever</v>

3152
02:19:08.981 --> 02:19:11.710
<v Speaker 3>the fuck they tell you once they got you</v>
<v Speaker 3>marching like that left,</v>

3153
02:19:11.711 --> 02:19:12.160
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

3154
02:19:12.161 --> 02:19:12.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3155
02:19:12.401 --> 02:19:15.250
<v Speaker 3>you can't just walk in carrying guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How impressive is that?</v>

3156
02:19:15.490 --> 02:19:20.490
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just walk in carrying those guns and it </v>

3157
02:19:20.490 --> 02:19:21.610
<v Speaker 3>was going to shit their pants anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're walking in with that.</v>

3158
02:19:24.030 --> 02:19:28.440
<v Speaker 3>The sergeant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sergeant Carlos.</v>

3159
02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:29.530
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3160
02:19:29.540 --> 02:19:34.540
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're letting people know that you've </v>

3161
02:19:34.540 --> 02:19:36.781
<v Speaker 2>got these motherfuckers under control </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely under control and you're </v>

3162
02:19:37.430 --> 02:19:42.430
<v Speaker 2>doing that while you're in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>nightmare of a dictatorial society.</v>

3163
02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:47.450
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be horrific to live over </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3164
02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:49.730
<v Speaker 2>She rolled the dice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3165
02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:52.760
<v Speaker 2>I was so pissed because I got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So lucky.</v>

3166
02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:58.300
<v Speaker 2>So lucky [inaudible] one on one at 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pisses me the fuck off.</v>

3167
02:19:58.570 --> 02:20:00.380
<v Speaker 2>So there's no traffic like New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic.</v>

3168
02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:01.410
<v Speaker 2>How bad is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>God?</v>

3169
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:02.510
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

3170
02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:03.950
<v Speaker 2>this dress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very bad.</v>

3171
02:20:03.951 --> 02:20:06.350
<v Speaker 2>I read this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it will go over.</v>

3172
02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:09.710
<v Speaker 2>That's why I said to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tunnels and bridges and getting into</v>

3173
02:20:09.711 --> 02:20:12.270
<v Speaker 2>the tunnels and bridges can be insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Insanity.</v>

3174
02:20:12.590 --> 02:20:13.460
<v Speaker 2>It can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3175
02:20:13.461 --> 02:20:15.350
<v Speaker 2>this was not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how long does this take?</v>

3176
02:20:15.910 --> 02:20:18.530
<v Speaker 2>It's craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of humans and by the way,</v>

3177
02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:20.010
<v Speaker 2>no one's driving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3178
02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's taking cabs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if most of the people in the city are</v>

3179
02:20:23.721 --> 02:20:28.721
<v Speaker 2>taking cabs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the rare few that are clogging it </v>

3180
02:20:28.721 --> 02:20:30.770
<v Speaker 2>up like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of traffic does not need even</v>

3181
02:20:30.771 --> 02:20:32.990
<v Speaker 2>closely represent the amount of actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

3182
02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Luckily because the amount of humans is </v>
<v Speaker 2>staggering,</v>

3183
02:20:35.690 --> 02:20:37.400
<v Speaker 2>but most of them are not taking cars.</v>

3184
02:20:37.620 --> 02:20:40.580
<v Speaker 7>I'm explaining something to you and 94,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was doing comedy and I went back.</v>

3185
02:20:40.581 --> 02:20:43.820
<v Speaker 7>That was an open mic or I lived in New </v>
<v Speaker 7>Jersey.</v>

3186
02:20:43.860 --> 02:20:48.110
<v Speaker 7>I dated a girl on 15th and Ninth Avenue </v>
<v Speaker 7>by Honda of Manhattan.</v>

3187
02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:53.800
<v Speaker 7>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm telling you I could get into my car </v>

3188
02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:53.800
<v Speaker 7>to coordinate and be in Manhattan at 10 </v>
<v Speaker 7>after eight.</v>

3189
02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:56.240
<v Speaker 7>You know me know how the fuck is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I pick her up.</v>

3190
02:20:56.241 --> 02:20:58.460
<v Speaker 7>My show would be at nine in the New York</v>
<v Speaker 7>comedy club.</v>

3191
02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:01.670
<v Speaker 7>About three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I went into New York City,</v>

3192
02:21:01.671 --> 02:21:03.530
<v Speaker 7>I had to pick my buddy up at the bus </v>
<v Speaker 7>station.</v>

3193
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:08.830
<v Speaker 7>I'd never seen anything like that while </v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought it was going to take me an </v>

3194
02:21:08.830 --> 02:21:10.670
<v Speaker 7>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 7>tops took me four fucking hours.</v>

3195
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:13.380
<v Speaker 7>I'm not shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know that.</v>

3196
02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:16.280
<v Speaker 7>Then there's nothing I want to do that </v>
<v Speaker 7>anymore.</v>

3197
02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:20.770
<v Speaker 7>I want to go get a hotdog.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I take the bus and the train over,</v>

3198
02:21:21.550 --> 02:21:24.470
<v Speaker 7>but I'm either taking them are over.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Those days are done.</v>

3199
02:21:24.850 --> 02:21:27.730
<v Speaker 2>I was hanging out with Shane Smith from </v>
<v Speaker 2>vice.com</v>

3200
02:21:27.780 --> 02:21:32.780
<v Speaker 2>or right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lives in New York and he has this </v>

3201
02:21:32.780 --> 02:21:35.350
<v Speaker 2>view window that it's like mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even seem real.</v>

3202
02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:36.670
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his view is like,</v>

3203
02:21:36.671 --> 02:21:39.400
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're looking at like </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains.</v>

3204
02:21:39.540 --> 02:21:42.040
<v Speaker 2>They're mechanical mountains that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>create.</v>

3205
02:21:42.041 --> 02:21:45.790
<v Speaker 2>It's more beautiful even than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains that the New York City skyline</v>

3206
02:21:45.791 --> 02:21:50.791
<v Speaker 2>is fucking staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so impressive that it's almost </v>

3207
02:21:50.791 --> 02:21:54.001
<v Speaker 2>worth being there just to see it on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular basis because it really is like </v>

3208
02:21:54.001 --> 02:21:56.380
<v Speaker 2>a work of art just like the mountains </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

3209
02:21:56.530 --> 02:21:58.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why people are willing to pay</v>

3210
02:21:58.751 --> 02:22:01.390
<v Speaker 2>for paintings and shit because it makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel good when you see something bad</v>

3211
02:22:01.391 --> 02:22:06.391
<v Speaker 2>ass when you look at something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something beautiful like this sculpture </v>

3212
02:22:06.391 --> 02:22:08.260
<v Speaker 2>that this gentleman sent me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Buddha for my tattoo that um,</v>

3213
02:22:08.340 --> 02:22:09.490
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love art.</v>

3214
02:22:09.550 --> 02:22:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I like looking at shit that someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>

3215
02:22:11.470 --> 02:22:12.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like,</v>

3216
02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:16.090
<v Speaker 2>I like things that are beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the New York City skyline,</v>

3217
02:22:16.091 --> 02:22:18.310
<v Speaker 2>it's like one of the most beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>things you could see.</v>

3218
02:22:18.610 --> 02:22:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Like when that thing is all lit up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cars are moving,</v>

3219
02:22:20.801 --> 02:22:22.270
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

3220
02:22:22.390 --> 02:22:24.100
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen a pain that makes me do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3221
02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:26.550
<v Speaker 2>I never see a painting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see a painting.</v>

3222
02:22:26.551 --> 02:22:27.090
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's bad ass.</v>

3225
02:22:29.700 --> 02:22:32.550
<v Speaker 2>But I never see a pain that makes me sit</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and open my jaw and go,</v>

3226
02:22:32.551 --> 02:22:37.551
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the New York City skyline will make </v>

3227

<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

3228
02:22:37.551 --> 02:22:41.791

<v Speaker 2>If you look at it from one of those </v>

<v Speaker 7>That's the main thing.</v>

02:23:16.530 --> 02:23:18.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Lennon is a perfect example though.</v>

3245
02:23:18.121 --> 02:23:19.190

<v Speaker 2>that's the weird thing is the dealing </v>

3265
02:24:21.111 --> 02:24:21.111
<v Speaker 2>with that constant stress that went away</v>
<v Speaker 2>after nine slash 11,</v>

3266
02:24:21.570 --> 02:24:26.570
<v Speaker 2>after nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were super friendly there for </v>

3267
02:24:26.570 --> 02:24:28.701
<v Speaker 2>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We filmed fear factor there and like </v>

3268
02:24:28.701 --> 02:24:28.990
<v Speaker 2>2002 I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3269
02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:30.780
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it might've been 2003,</v>

3270
02:24:30.990 --> 02:24:33.120
<v Speaker 2>but everybody was so friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

3271
02:24:33.140 --> 02:24:36.450
<v Speaker 2>it was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like when we went there,</v>

3272
02:24:36.540 --> 02:24:41.540
<v Speaker 2>people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could noticeably see that there was </v>

3273
02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:43.750
<v Speaker 2>like an extra effort that people made to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be nice to people that felt it.</v>

3274
02:24:43.751 --> 02:24:46.170
<v Speaker 2>It was like a fountain in the air and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember thinking,</v>

3275
02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:47.940
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long will this last?</v>

<v Speaker 2>like this is a new change of the way </v>

3277
02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:53.300
<v Speaker 2>people are behaving in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to.</v>

3278
02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:53.520

<v Speaker 2>It lasts a long time.</v>

3279
02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:59.240
<v Speaker 2>It lasted quite a few years before I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started feeling like it was back to </v>

3280
02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:00.600
<v Speaker 2>normal again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This last trip back to normal.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Barry Nelson was the first one in 1954.</v>

3308
02:26:08.951 --> 02:26:13.951
<v Speaker 2>Even before sean connery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Sean connery was 62 to 1971.</v>

3309
02:26:15.010 --> 02:26:20.010
<v Speaker 2>And again he came back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't call it a comeback and 83 took a </v>

3310
02:26:20.010 --> 02:26:23.080
<v Speaker 2>12 year hiatus and then came back with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>new wig.</v>

3311
02:26:23.650 --> 02:26:26.980
<v Speaker 2>And then there's David Nivon who fucks </v>
<v Speaker 2>David Nevon.</v>

3312
02:26:27.300 --> 02:26:30.010
<v Speaker 2>They tried David Nevon out in 67,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3313
02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:35.040
<v Speaker 2>That shit didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they tried George Lazenby and </v>

3314
02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:35.140
<v Speaker 2>tried that out in [inaudible] 69,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie.</v>

3315
02:26:35.141 --> 02:26:38.070
<v Speaker 2>And then there's another guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christopher Kazen,</v>

3319
02:26:51.871 --> 02:26:51.871

<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>

3320
02:26:51.871 --> 02:26:54.610
<v Speaker 2>But do you remember Timothy Dalton and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pierce Brosnan?</v>

3321
02:26:54.611 --> 02:26:59.611
<v Speaker 2>There was two duds in a row to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking total duds out here,</v>

3322
02:27:00.350 --> 02:27:01.850
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the same person.</v>

3323
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:04.690
<v Speaker 2>It's probably Timothy Dalton was talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3324
02:27:04.691 --> 02:27:06.910
<v Speaker 2>And I love to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got Pierce Brosnan on speed dial.</v>

3325
02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Bronson would probably be good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but get out.</v>

3326
02:27:11.570 --> 02:27:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Fuck out of here at both those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine those guys kicking </v>

3327
02:27:16.570 --> 02:27:19.681
<v Speaker 2>anybody's ass ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine them getting hit and just </v>

3328
02:27:19.681 --> 02:27:19.681
<v Speaker 2>start crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Daniel Craig,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I could see that guy kicking someone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass.</v>

3330
02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:26.040
<v Speaker 2>I totally 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he's the best one of all </v>

3331
02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:26.040
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a beast.</v>

3332
02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:28.120
<v Speaker 2>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he seems like a killer.</v>

3333
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Like when I'm watching them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like the type of guy who would </v>

3334
02:27:33.150 --> 02:27:34.690
<v Speaker 2>be like a problem drinking womanizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trained killer.</v>

3335
02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Like it all came together in the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>realistic version of it,</v>

3336
02:27:38.170 --> 02:27:39.850

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3529
02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:56.810
<v Speaker 7>You have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Gentlemen outside the door and I saw the</v>

3530
02:35:56.811 --> 02:36:01.811
<v Speaker 7>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They just drew wolves everywhere to get </v>

3531
02:36:01.811 --> 02:36:04.121
<v Speaker 7>the deer population down,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they kill them something else now </v>

3532
02:36:04.121 --> 02:36:04.550
<v Speaker 7>and every night and my inlaws got the </v>
<v Speaker 7>dog.</v>

3533
02:36:04.551 --> 02:36:05.870
<v Speaker 7>I tightened the fucking balcony.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

3534
02:36:05.871 --> 02:36:08.920
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And there's not one was yellow ones.</v>

3535
02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:11.180
<v Speaker 7>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think they did.</v>

3536
02:36:11.210 --> 02:36:13.690
<v Speaker 7>They brought them in to keep the deer </v>
<v Speaker 7>population populations not.</v>

3537
02:36:13.691 --> 02:36:16.880
<v Speaker 7>I mean that fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So monsters to eat the food.</v>

3538
02:36:16.940 --> 02:36:21.940
<v Speaker 7>This is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So now that you know they killed </v>

3539
02:36:21.940 --> 02:36:21.940
<v Speaker 7>something else,</v>
<v Speaker 7>now all they were killing the rabbits.</v>

3540
02:36:21.940 --> 02:36:22.730
<v Speaker 7>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did we kill him?</v>

3541
02:36:22.731 --> 02:36:25.880
<v Speaker 7>The fucking rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So one night you could hear my dad.</v>

3542
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:30.290
<v Speaker 7>I'm 50 yards them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's so crazy.</v>

3543
02:36:30.470 --> 02:36:32.270
<v Speaker 7>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fucking crazy.</v>

3544
02:36:32.271 --> 02:36:35.210
<v Speaker 7>So that was wild.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I liked that style of living.</v>

3545
02:36:35.211 --> 02:36:37.490
<v Speaker 7>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let me tell you something.</v>

3546
02:36:38.610 --> 02:36:40.990
<v Speaker 7>Listen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>tell you something.</v>

3547
02:36:41.090 --> 02:36:44.540
<v Speaker 7>My friends to know that like I wanted a </v>
<v Speaker 7>cup of coffee one night.</v>

3548
02:36:45.350 --> 02:36:50.350
<v Speaker 7>I didn't want to bother nobody because </v>
<v Speaker 7>this time I usually stay at a hotel but </v>

3549
02:36:50.350 --> 02:36:52.640
<v Speaker 7>it's too far.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's too fucking far from the house.</v>

3550
02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:56.240
<v Speaker 7>I mean they're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Joe Out there,</v>

3551
02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:58.790
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just beautiful land is paid for.</v>

3552
02:36:59.030 --> 02:37:01.970
<v Speaker 7>Gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But they're out there like that.</v>

3553
02:37:01.990 --> 02:37:02.780
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Terry,</v>

3554
02:37:03.260 --> 02:37:04.370
<v Speaker 7>I'm thinking this place.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She goes,</v>

3555
02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:06.200
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you get a cup of coffee,</v>

3556
02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:10.780
<v Speaker 7>it's 40 minutes each way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like 30 or something.</v>

3557
02:37:10.940 --> 02:37:12.770
<v Speaker 7>Thirty minutes and you but you don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>know where you're going.</v>

3558
02:37:13.370 --> 02:37:15.680
<v Speaker 7>So it's going to be 45.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here's question.</v>

3559
02:37:15.710 --> 02:37:15.980
<v Speaker 7>What's</v>

3560
02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:20.980
<v Speaker 3>more healthy that or New York because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know because sometimes sometimes I</v>

3561
02:37:22.551 --> 02:37:27.551
<v Speaker 3>think New York is more healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in being there just for over a </v>

3562
02:37:27.551 --> 02:37:31.930
<v Speaker 3>couple of days and comparing the pace of</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain places that I've been to like </v>

3563
02:37:31.930 --> 02:37:34.991
<v Speaker 3>boulder and then comparing it to New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York and dealing with the people and I </v>

3564
02:37:34.991 --> 02:37:35.150
<v Speaker 3>don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

3565
02:37:35.151 --> 02:37:37.730
<v Speaker 3>I can't say it's like New York people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are shitty people,</v>

3566
02:37:37.850 --> 02:37:38.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3567
02:37:38.161 --> 02:37:42.590
<v Speaker 3>it's not at the percentage of the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I ran into was very,</v>

3568
02:37:42.591 --> 02:37:44.720
<v Speaker 3>very small that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were not nice,</v>

3569
02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:47.660
<v Speaker 3>but those you might not ever run into in</v>
<v Speaker 3>boulder.</v>

3570
02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:52.720
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that the possibility of like </v>

3571
02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:55.280
<v Speaker 3>rudeness was there in a way that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>in other spots.</v>

3572
02:37:55.460 --> 02:37:56.270
<v Speaker 3>So I gotta think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3573
02:37:56.271 --> 02:37:57.770
<v Speaker 3>why are people like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is it?</v>

3574
02:37:57.771 --> 02:37:59.270
<v Speaker 3>What is it that causes people to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>rude?</v>

3575
02:37:59.271 --> 02:38:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Is it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's too many of us?</v>

3576
02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:02.240
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

3577
02:38:02.450 --> 02:38:04.370
<v Speaker 3>I think that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

3578
02:38:04.371 --> 02:38:09.371
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people when you get stuck in a certain </v>

3579
02:38:09.371 --> 02:38:10.490
<v Speaker 3>amount of traffic and a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of lines and certain mental waiting,</v>

3580
02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:12.410
<v Speaker 3>a certain amount of frustration is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>worth it.</v>

3581
02:38:12.580 --> 02:38:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody just</v>

3582
02:38:14.610 --> 02:38:19.610
<v Speaker 7>right now at one time or another,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the voices got loud with somebody at </v>

3583
02:38:19.991 --> 02:38:20.980
<v Speaker 7>some point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

3584
02:38:21.270 --> 02:38:26.270
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the answer to why people are </v>

3585
02:38:26.270 --> 02:38:27.670
<v Speaker 7>rude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The problem with us as we call it in New</v>

3586
02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:29.140
<v Speaker 7>York,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's just so much.</v>

3587
02:38:29.410 --> 02:38:32.390
<v Speaker 7>I still have it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I still have that time,</v>

3588
02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:35.740
<v Speaker 7>so I have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I grew up in that mentality in me.</v>

3589
02:38:35.741 --> 02:38:36.730
<v Speaker 7>It's Lubbock.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I am.</v>

3590
02:38:37.060 --> 02:38:39.970
<v Speaker 7>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I don't get it all the time.</v>

3591
02:38:39.971 --> 02:38:43.150
<v Speaker 7>I don't get somebody being mean to you </v>
<v Speaker 7>have the fucking belt.</v>

3592
02:38:43.930 --> 02:38:45.580
<v Speaker 7>There's a difference between route.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In fact,</v>

3593
02:38:45.940 --> 02:38:47.650
<v Speaker 7>there's some rootedness that you </v>
<v Speaker 7>appreciate.</v>

3594
02:38:48.100 --> 02:38:50.230
<v Speaker 7>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>thank fucking God.</v>

3595
02:38:50.231 --> 02:38:53.530
<v Speaker 7>We've got more people like that around </v>
<v Speaker 7>to make this lady push a little bit.</v>

3596
02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:58.920
<v Speaker 7>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But that there's another type that </v>

3597
02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:01.351
<v Speaker 7>rudeness I can't live with at this point</v>
<v Speaker 7>in my life and when I was younger I </v>

3598
02:39:01.351 --> 02:39:04.240
<v Speaker 7>confronted with confront it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now I don't confront them anymore,</v>

3599
02:39:04.310 --> 02:39:06.200
<v Speaker 3>but then on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got around New York.</v>

3600
02:39:06.201 --> 02:39:08.390
<v Speaker 3>People are more street smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just are.</v>

3601
02:39:08.690 --> 02:39:11.390
<v Speaker 3>There's people that are hipper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They they like,</v>

3602
02:39:11.720 --> 02:39:14.810
<v Speaker 3>like they just seem to be more on top of</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

3603
02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:17.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less obsessed with Hollywood.</v>

3604
02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:20.900
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a really bad thing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the area we live in.</v>

3605
02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:21.700
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's good.</v>

3606
02:39:21.701 --> 02:39:26.701
<v Speaker 7>Worse.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what I ripped the worst over and </v>

3607
02:39:26.701 --> 02:39:27.340
<v Speaker 7>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That in this area,</v>

3608
02:39:27.341 --> 02:39:28.420
<v Speaker 7>particularly with.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Listen,</v>

3609
02:39:28.750 --> 02:39:30.900
<v Speaker 7>this is very funny because I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>think about this.</v>

3610
02:39:30.940 --> 02:39:33.910
<v Speaker 7>I was onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I dare you Brian.</v>

3611
02:39:34.090 --> 02:39:39.040
<v Speaker 7>I dare you to get a fucking parking </v>
<v Speaker 7>ticket and be 45 minutes late to court.</v>

3612
02:39:40.110 --> 02:39:45.110
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Danny motherfuckers to be late to court </v>

3613
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.250
<v Speaker 7>and Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't get a bench warrant issued and</v>

3614
02:39:45.251 --> 02:39:47.350
<v Speaker 7>when you get there you have to Redo all </v>
<v Speaker 7>the paperwork.</v>

3615
02:39:47.620 --> 02:39:52.620
<v Speaker 7>Why this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Lindsay Lohan always an hour late for </v>

3616
02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:52.620
<v Speaker 7>court.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This cute.</v>

3617
02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:57.330
<v Speaker 7>You know Michael Jackson showed up in </v>
<v Speaker 7>pajamas an our late for court as well,</v>

3618
02:39:58.180 --> 02:40:00.670
<v Speaker 7>and they try to be strict like Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3619
02:40:00.671 --> 02:40:03.960
<v Speaker 7>you're 46 minutes late for court.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Come with this fucking fact,</v>

3620
02:40:04.020 --> 02:40:08.080
<v Speaker 7>Cuban to court late one time and see </v>
<v Speaker 7>what happens after a half hour there.</v>

3621
02:40:08.090 --> 02:40:11.560
<v Speaker 7>Strategies to it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's pretend you got a parking ticket,</v>

3622
02:40:11.590 --> 02:40:16.590
<v Speaker 7>a speeding ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you know the cop a lot of times is </v>

3623
02:40:16.590 --> 02:40:17.190
<v Speaker 7>the best strategy that my attorney in </v>
<v Speaker 7>Jersey would do.</v>

3624
02:40:17.490 --> 02:40:22.490
<v Speaker 7>He would always say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>tell the copy I show up and then he </v>

3625
02:40:22.490 --> 02:40:25.311
<v Speaker 7>would call and go Rogan's running late,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he would tell the court clerks or </v>

3626
02:40:25.311 --> 02:40:29.061
<v Speaker 7>we'll never get to the judge so the </v>
<v Speaker 7>judge would issue a bench warrant fleet </v>

3627
02:40:29.061 --> 02:40:29.400
<v Speaker 7>and we wait for the cop to leave the </v>
<v Speaker 7>building.</v>

3628
02:40:29.410 --> 02:40:31.710
<v Speaker 7>Then we sneak around the back and we </v>
<v Speaker 7>just say,</v>

3629
02:40:31.711 --> 02:40:34.110
<v Speaker 7>you got caught in traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They Redo your bench warrant.</v>

3630
02:40:34.111 --> 02:40:36.000
<v Speaker 7>There's no to testify in a speeding </v>
<v Speaker 7>ticket.</v>

3631
02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:37.650
<v Speaker 7>And they dropped the charges with the </v>
<v Speaker 7>ticket.</v>

3632
02:40:37.790 --> 02:40:39.540
<v Speaker 7>That's old school.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's uncle Joe.</v>

3633
02:40:39.541 --> 02:40:41.610
<v Speaker 7>He dropping knowledge on a motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 7>right there,</v>

3634
02:40:41.970 --> 02:40:45.420
<v Speaker 7>but there's other situations where you </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't want to be late for court,</v>

3635
02:40:45.630 --> 02:40:49.640
<v Speaker 7>especially if you go for Rehab or </v>
<v Speaker 7>Michael Jackson molest butting heads.</v>

3636
02:40:50.070 --> 02:40:52.250
<v Speaker 7>That's why right now that that tells you</v>
<v Speaker 7>right there.</v>

3637
02:40:52.251 --> 02:40:54.800
<v Speaker 7>I've been to court before.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I day even bolder,</v>

3638
02:40:54.830 --> 02:40:57.600
<v Speaker 7>the nicest people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Get the court 10 minutes late.</v>

3639
02:40:57.990 --> 02:40:59.280
<v Speaker 7>They'll even let you in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>door.</v>

3640
02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:01.920
<v Speaker 7>Once they close that door in boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sorry,</v>

3641
02:41:01.980 --> 02:41:06.980
<v Speaker 7>go to the third floor.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That means they handcuff you and go </v>

3642
02:41:06.980 --> 02:41:06.980
<v Speaker 7>through the whole fucking thing all over</v>
<v Speaker 7>again.</v>

3643
02:41:06.980 --> 02:41:11.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like the idea that you can come to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a place and this is the place to go.</v>

3644
02:41:12.340 --> 02:41:17.340
<v Speaker 3>If you want to get famous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the place and the whole like </v>

3645
02:41:17.340 --> 02:41:20.050
<v Speaker 3>entertainment industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is like the main hub of it.</v>

3646
02:41:20.500 --> 02:41:23.870
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get a lot of cool people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to look cool.</v>

3647
02:41:23.950 --> 02:41:28.950
<v Speaker 3>People that we know that all live here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at how many friends we have that </v>

3648
02:41:28.950 --> 02:41:29.350
<v Speaker 3>all live here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got a lot of God damn cool people</v>

3649
02:41:29.351 --> 02:41:34.351
<v Speaker 3>till you get people that have gotten </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the whole thing and sort of </v>

3650
02:41:34.351 --> 02:41:37.180
<v Speaker 3>figured it out and relaxed and settled </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and then you know,</v>

3651
02:41:37.350 --> 02:41:39.520
<v Speaker 3>became a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>understood how to,</v>

3652
02:41:39.550 --> 02:41:41.620
<v Speaker 3>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to work within the parameters of the</v>

3653
02:41:41.621 --> 02:41:46.621
<v Speaker 3>business without getting caught up in it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and becoming one of those weird last </v>

3654
02:41:46.621 --> 02:41:47.680
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood type people.</v>

3655
02:41:47.770 --> 02:41:50.520
<v Speaker 7>This is my beef and I think it's true of</v>
<v Speaker 7>before,</v>

3656
02:41:50.521 --> 02:41:55.521
<v Speaker 7>so two and a red band doesn't look at it</v>
<v Speaker 7>this way and this and I've always </v>

3657
02:41:55.521 --> 02:41:57.610
<v Speaker 7>thought about because I'm 50,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but uh,</v>

3658
02:41:57.611 --> 02:42:00.310
<v Speaker 7>I go for auditions,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which you don't,</v>

3659
02:42:00.470 --> 02:42:05.380
<v Speaker 7>and I see a little bit more of this </v>
<v Speaker 7>bullshit and I once saw girls,</v>

3660
02:42:05.860 --> 02:42:10.860
<v Speaker 7>maybe six years old that were adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I walked into a room this big that was </v>

3661
02:42:10.901 --> 02:42:15.901
<v Speaker 7>packed,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but these two little girls that was six </v>

3662
02:42:15.901 --> 02:42:18.850
<v Speaker 7>decide that they're going to take 20 of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the head shots and put them all over the</v>

3663
02:42:18.851 --> 02:42:21.490
<v Speaker 7>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

3664
02:42:21.970 --> 02:42:24.100
<v Speaker 7>And I heard the one girl say some </v>
<v Speaker 7>tailored girls.</v>

3665
02:42:24.101 --> 02:42:29.101
<v Speaker 7>You got to move this one little girl </v>
<v Speaker 7>said my daddy's a director or something </v>

3666
02:42:29.101 --> 02:42:29.101
<v Speaker 7>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

3667
02:42:29.101 --> 02:42:30.970
<v Speaker 7>So this is my problem guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Me,</v>

3668
02:42:30.971 --> 02:42:32.560
<v Speaker 7>I'm a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll live anywhere.</v>

3669
02:42:33.340 --> 02:42:35.470
<v Speaker 7>Really want to raise a child here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

3670
02:42:35.471 --> 02:42:36.580
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want.</v>

3671
02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:42.360
<v Speaker 7>This is probably the values of life here</v>
<v Speaker 7>are judged differently than what they </v>

3672
02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:43.120
<v Speaker 7>are in Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Boston.</v>

3673
02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:46.210
<v Speaker 7>And you might look down on that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Some people might look down on that,</v>

3674
02:42:46.211 --> 02:42:48.430
<v Speaker 7>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I never don't.</v>

3675
02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:51.820
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think for us there's like,</v>

3676
02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:53.050
<v Speaker 7>first of all,</v>

3677
02:42:54.210 --> 02:42:59.210
<v Speaker 3>this is the only place where there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like such a conglomeration of those </v>

3678
02:42:59.210 --> 02:43:00.990
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like if you live your whole life</v>

3679
02:43:00.991 --> 02:43:03.330
<v Speaker 3>and you never come in contact with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3680
02:43:03.331 --> 02:43:08.331
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be kind of shocking when you're </v>

3681
02:43:08.331 --> 02:43:08.331
<v Speaker 3>around like a bunch of actors are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of Hollywood types,</v>

3682
02:43:08.331 --> 02:43:12.201
<v Speaker 3>but the one of the real problem is </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not any other that's looked at </v>

3683
02:43:12.760 --> 02:43:15.700
<v Speaker 3>like that prominently here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so overwhelming.</v>

3684
02:43:15.701 --> 02:43:20.701
<v Speaker 3>There's so many people that are involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it that kids like automatically sort </v>

3685
02:43:20.701 --> 02:43:22.660
<v Speaker 3>of gravitate towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like everybody wants to be famous,</v>

3686
02:43:22.661 --> 02:43:24.550
<v Speaker 3>they'll gravitate towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas in Denver,</v>

3687
02:43:24.551 --> 02:43:26.350
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck is going to be famous?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you want to be famous.</v>

3688
02:43:26.550 --> 02:43:28.720
<v Speaker 3>That's a real God damn pipe dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you live in Boston,</v>

3689
02:43:28.840 --> 02:43:30.550
<v Speaker 3>you know it's a real God damn pipe </v>
<v Speaker 3>dream.</v>

3690
02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:33.250
<v Speaker 3>But if you live in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like it's attainable.</v>

3691
02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:38.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We saw this guy at the mall and then we </v>

3692
02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:40.771
<v Speaker 3>were there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We saw this and we went to an audition </v>

3693
02:43:40.771 --> 02:43:40.771
<v Speaker 3>and I saw Ben Affleck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3694
02:43:40.771 --> 02:43:40.771
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just becomes,</v>

3695
02:43:40.771 --> 02:43:43.960
<v Speaker 3>it comes more of a focal point and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough other shit here.</v>

3696
02:43:43.970 --> 02:43:45.140
<v Speaker 4>Let me ask you something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How come?</v>

3697
02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:49.610
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen any pictures of Joe </v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of folks that do things on</v>

3720
02:44:32.631 --> 02:44:35.810
<v Speaker 4>purpose for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just the other night that was.</v>

3721
02:44:36.350 --> 02:44:37.670
<v Speaker 5>I was talking to my friend the other day</v>
<v Speaker 5>who,</v>

3722
02:44:37.671 --> 02:44:39.200
<v Speaker 5>he's a popper I'd see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's like,</v>

02:44:41.410 --> 02:44:42.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why are you guys well here?</v>

3725
02:44:42.561 --> 02:44:46.850
<v Speaker 5>I got Lindsay Logan's boarding pass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's flying in at 5:30</v>

3726
02:44:46.850 --> 02:44:46.850
<v Speaker 5>AM.</v>

3727
02:44:47.070 --> 02:44:47.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

3728
02:44:47.670 --> 02:44:51.940
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've watched the other day or read it.</v>

3729
02:44:51.990 --> 02:44:56.990
<v Speaker 4>I read it online about Jamie Presley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you guys read that story about her </v>

3730
02:44:57.361 --> 02:45:00.630
<v Speaker 4>getting into a beef in Hollywood?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the chick stole.</v>

3731
02:45:00.960 --> 02:45:03.240
<v Speaker 4>This is hysterical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So her assistant,</v>

3732
02:45:03.630 --> 02:45:06.840
<v Speaker 4>somebody stole her assistance purse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3733
02:45:06.970 --> 02:45:08.290
<v Speaker 4>The jewelry you heard about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3734
02:45:08.910 --> 02:45:12.060
<v Speaker 4>she went to Hollywood to get the </v>
<v Speaker 4>assistance purse back.</v>

3735
02:45:12.300 --> 02:45:15.740
<v Speaker 4>But the girl that had something in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>purse that lets you know that the pro,</v>

3736
02:45:15.770 --> 02:45:20.770
<v Speaker 4>you like a gps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The GPS on the phone was in the purse </v>

3737
02:45:20.770 --> 02:45:24.050
<v Speaker 4>and they figured out it was pointed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this bar where they're having the </v>

3738
02:45:24.050 --> 02:45:25.110
<v Speaker 4>celebrity stuff out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Jamie Presley showed up and yelled at</v>

3739
02:45:25.111 --> 02:45:30.111
<v Speaker 4>the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then it turned out that in that </v>

3740
02:45:30.111 --> 02:45:30.111
<v Speaker 4>purse with drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3741
02:45:30.111 --> 02:45:31.890
<v Speaker 4>So the cops showed up and then nobody </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows who the person was.</v>

3742
02:45:31.891 --> 02:45:33.220
<v Speaker 4>Like once they got there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3743
02:45:33.370 --> 02:45:34.260
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that ain't my bro.</v>

3744
02:45:34.270 --> 02:45:39.270
<v Speaker 4>You guys were just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got into a fight over the fucking </v>

3745
02:45:39.270 --> 02:45:39.270
<v Speaker 4>purse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But once the cops got there,</v>

3746
02:45:39.270 --> 02:45:44.070
<v Speaker 4>they opened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The person was like blow and steroids </v>

3747
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.070
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is some shit like that.</v>

3748
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:45.970
<v Speaker 4>Ain't no motherfucking person no more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ain't no fuck.</v>

3749
02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:46.990
<v Speaker 4>We don't even know what.</v>

3750
02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:53.370
<v Speaker 4>It's always a pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend.</v>

3751
02:45:53.610 --> 02:45:54.390
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember this?</v>

3752
02:45:55.800 --> 02:45:58.080
<v Speaker 5>You're mad TV on the Sopranos.</v>

3753
