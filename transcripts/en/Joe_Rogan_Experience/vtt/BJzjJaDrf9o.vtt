44
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

45
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.530
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be full information disclosed from you to me and,</v>

46
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>and what it is is the convergence of all human beings.</v>

47
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking crazy and that's where it's going.</v>

48
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.690
<v Speaker 1>How come I can bank online?</v>

49
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>How come you can deal with the entire world's economy through computers and the</v>

50
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:30.871
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>

51
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>but you can't vote.</v>

52
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Really when it should be is it should be no Mexico.</v>

53
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.570
<v Speaker 1>There should be no United States.</v>

54
00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>There should be no Canada.</v>

55
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>They should be the planet earth.</v>

56
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>That's really what it should be.</v>

57
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>These ideas are fucking stupid,</v>

58
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.850
<v Speaker 1>but the DMT experiencing itself is unbelievably intense,</v>

59
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>but there is such a radical difference between eating a steak.</v>

60
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>He bought a store and eating the back strap of an axis deer that you had to</v>

61
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:56.940
<v Speaker 1>sneak up on.</v>

62
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>We all love to sleep,</v>

63
00:01:58.591 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>but everyone's afraid to die.</v>

64
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.830
<v Speaker 1>This is a guy named Fritz harbor.</v>

65
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

66
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Fritz Harbor.</v>

67
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 1>You know the horrible tragedy of Fritz Harbor.</v>

68
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Dan Carlin's hardcore history Dan Carlin podcast,</v>

69
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>where he talked about the Mongols and Dan Carlin thing on,</v>

70
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:13.614
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

71
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 1>on the history of the Mongols.</v>

72
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 1>This was when they had the operation Northwoods thing that had been passed.</v>

73
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>And if you haven't seen that document,</v>

74
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

75
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>That is a direct result of my obsession with quake.</v>

76
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>This is all from my quake playing days.</v>

77
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I got addicted to video games because of news radio because the writers,</v>

78
00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 1>the writers room where they had a land party.</v>

79
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>So that was the next quick too.</v>

80
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.860
<v Speaker 1>I was so obsessed with this that I,</v>

81
00:02:35.861 --> 00:02:40.240
<v Speaker 1>I put a t one line in my house so I had a t one line install a,</v>

82
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 1>you must have been rich.</v>

83
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.353
<v Speaker 1>I was rich,</v>

84
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.150
<v Speaker 1>the sensory deprivation chamber.</v>

85
00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>It's been the most important tool that I've ever used for,</v>

86
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:47.904
<v Speaker 1>for mine,</v>

87
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.950
<v Speaker 1>for in my mind.</v>

88
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>How much do you fuck with the isolation tag?</v>

89
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Colorado in the marriage,</v>

90
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>lived eight miles down a dirt road.</v>

91
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>My dog had eaten by a mountain lion.</v>

92
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

93
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>I lived in,</v>

94
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I talked about this yesterday.</v>

95
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>I lived in the mountains of Colorado for four months,</v>

97
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>That's where I wanted to live,</v>

98
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>and just last year till my dog had eaten by a mountain lion and my wife got</v>

107
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>A lot of outlines up there too.</v>

108

<v Speaker 1>dogs and cats.</v>

111
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Let's buy a house in the mountains.</v>

112
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>So it was a on the top of a mountain and my dog got eaten by mountain line.</v>
