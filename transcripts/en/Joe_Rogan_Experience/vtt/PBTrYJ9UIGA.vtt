<v Speaker 1>international man of adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's it going?</v>

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I purposely didn't ask you or talk to</v>

7
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>you about the grizzly bear attack</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted to save it.</v>

8
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>You want it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want,</v>

9
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:25.551
<v Speaker 1>what is it like to have survived but</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally being two feet away from an</v>

10
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>attack and grizzly bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have grabbed it.</v>

11
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

12
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easily.</v>

13
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

14
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just nuts.</v>

15
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.330
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about it a million times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

17
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>How long ago was this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was.</v>

18
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would've been early October.</v>

19
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Mid October.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've answered three months,</v>

20
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>three months to kind of wait around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

21
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

22
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>it's just one of those things that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about it so many times in my</v>

23
00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>head and I've always been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Steve was the same way.</v>

24
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.661
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

25
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>it'd be pretty cool to survive a bear</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack gets scratched up a little bit</v>

26
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>after that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought to myself,</v>

27
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>if that never happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

28
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve used to always say steve or no,</v>

29
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about from the mediator</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts and he has a two part series on</v>

30
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 1>this particular bear attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he always say he wanted to get</v>

31
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>clawed across the chest and have like</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a tattoo but like a big closet.</v>

32
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm like marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

33
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.680
<v Speaker 1>What are the odds that that happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.660
<v Speaker 1>I think that in order to get that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go through a really,</v>

35
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:38.661
<v Speaker 1>really horrible experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's guys that have had those attacks</v>

36
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>or there's guys that have had those</v>
<v Speaker 1>detects a lot,</v>

37
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've been around a lot of wild</v>

38
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:49.941
<v Speaker 1>animals and seen a lot of things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>been charged by bears and this was just</v>

39
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

40
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>It was that kind of attack where while</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's happening,</v>

41
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not gonna Pan out.</v>

42
00:01:57.781 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's going to die something</v>

43
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>either you're just looking at this bear</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's coming in hot and just</v>

44
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird experience.</v>

45
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your memory's a little foggy.</v>

46
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything happened so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it felt like it was so long.</v>

47
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.560
<v Speaker 1>So the adrenaline overwhelmed brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

48
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't even think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just remember it was,</v>

49
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>it was a weird situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe I'll just kind of recap the</v>

50
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:24.620
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>so we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're on a fog neck island and we're</v>

52
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:31.620
<v Speaker 1>hunting in a fog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neck island is off of Kodiak.</v>

53
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a fog neck island has some of the</v>

54
00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:36.760
<v Speaker 1>largest bears in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're brown bears are,</v>

55
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.190
<v Speaker 1>they are big brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>various,</v>

56
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>it can be over a thousand pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're hunting elk there.</v>

57
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.740
<v Speaker 1>My brother and myself have hunted elk on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that island before and it's just a</v>

58
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>miserable place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a fascinating hunt the way you</v>

59
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:54.490
<v Speaker 1>guys were describing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>

60
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the fact that you would choose out</v>

61
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>of all the places you can go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pretty much can go anywhere,</v>

62
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.080
<v Speaker 1>want you chose to go on this brutal</v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure hunt because it's so difficult</v>

63
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>and says he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like Rinella was talking about</v>

64
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>this once in the way he described it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's things that are fun while</v>

65
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>you're doing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not fun later,</v>

66
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>like rollercoasters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's things that are</v>

67
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>terrible and awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll think about them forever and</v>

68
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>look back at them fondly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

69
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that after the fact you think back</v>

70
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>and you go in the moment you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will never do this again.</v>

71
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>And then about a year later you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that again.</v>

72
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is it about the place?</v>

73
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>It's so miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

74
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.910
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to walk through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks,</v>

75
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.320
<v Speaker 1>it looks easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hiking.</v>

76
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.770
<v Speaker 1>And there's just this big mountain where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get to with a plane,</v>

77
00:03:45.771 --> 00:03:50.630
<v Speaker 1>you've kind of got to climb this big</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain and the vegetation is so thick</v>

78
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.870
<v Speaker 1>and it's so steep that it takes forever</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go somewhere.</v>

79
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.490
<v Speaker 1>So to put it in perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go say a mile might take five hours.</v>

80
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how much verdict.</v>

81
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Like a map mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way the crow would fly if you're</v>

82
00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 1>just going a mile and then another</v>
<v Speaker 1>distance could take you half that time</v>

83
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.200
<v Speaker 1>recorder that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a big mountain in between</v>

84
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.000
<v Speaker 1>where you need to go plus the vegetation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really steep.</v>

85
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.370
<v Speaker 1>So you've got all that kind of working</v>
<v Speaker 1>against you,</v>

86
00:04:19.371 --> 00:04:21.620
<v Speaker 1>plus you can't really walk and just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight line there.</v>

87
00:04:21.621 --> 00:04:24.370
<v Speaker 1>You've got to navigate around all kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of stuff.</v>

88
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.660
<v Speaker 1>You from place them in this journey that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was and is gay.</v>

89
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.140
<v Speaker 1>So that was after the bear attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to figure out because I poke</v>
<v Speaker 1>right after the bear attacked.</v>

91
00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I pulled out my phone and just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like recording everyone's reactions and</v>

92
00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:51.350
<v Speaker 1>then I put it on my instagram story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll try to find it tonight and I'll</v>

93
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.510
<v Speaker 1>post it onto some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll figure out a way to.</v>

94
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they let you save them now.</v>

95
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Now this was like three weeks before</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

96
00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this place is miserable.</v>

97
00:05:03.921 --> 00:05:05.870
<v Speaker 1>It's raining all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rain,</v>

98
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.070
<v Speaker 1>high winds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thick,</v>

99
00:05:07.071 --> 00:05:10.880
<v Speaker 1>thick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dense vegetation and literal monsters.</v>

100
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean giant bears and then big.</v>

101
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elk are probably with they way they</v>

102
00:05:18.741 --> 00:05:21.120
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can wait up to 1400 pounds either.</v>

103
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.610
<v Speaker 1>It was way bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

104
00:05:22.611 --> 00:05:26.720
<v Speaker 1>it was like the size of two normal elk</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight wise because like an average elk</v>

105
00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:30.260
<v Speaker 1>would probably be around 500 pounds in</v>
<v Speaker 1>most places.</v>

106
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Really big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we were talking about the</v>

107
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>California ones that the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it can get to a thousand.</v>

108
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 1>This is another 400 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but exactly.</v>

109
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of digging and there's bears</v>
<v Speaker 1>that eat those giant ant,</v>

110
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.010
<v Speaker 1>so those bears are giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The barriers can be over 1200,</v>

111
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>1500 pounds themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eleven feet or more?</v>

112
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 feet and feet.</v>

113
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not 11 foot bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

114
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>This one</v>

115
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 2>that attacked you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How big do you think it was if you had</v>

116
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 2>to guess?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

117
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's 11 and a half feet</v>

118
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 2>because I know because actually after we</v>
<v Speaker 2>went in there,</v>

119
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 2>my friend who's a pilot there in dropped</v>
<v Speaker 2>us off.</v>

120
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.870
<v Speaker 2>He called me about a week or two later</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was like,</v>

121
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 2>they shot that bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went after you guys.</v>

122
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Somebody went in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same place.</v>

123
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Bear attacked them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They killed it in self defense.</v>

124
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 2>It was 11 and a half feet and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 1200 pounds.</v>

125
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 2>So there's very good odds that that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same bear.</v>

126
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.770
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

127
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 2>because marry had just taken over that</v>
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

128
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Seemed about the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I,</v>

129
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 2>when it came in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that's a big bore.</v>

130
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't one of those ones you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

131
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:44.834
<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>

132
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.960
<v Speaker 2>It looked like a big mature animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the piecing together.</v>

133
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 2>What happened in my mind later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

134
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:57.881
<v Speaker 2>so we're hunting elk on this island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steven's up getting an ell.</v>

135
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 2>We hanging in a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do all the stuff you're supposed to</v>

136
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:03.710
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the meat away from the carcass.</v>

137
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 2>But we had yet to see a bear up until</v>
<v Speaker 2>this point and when my brother and I</v>

138
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:11.130
<v Speaker 2>went in there a few years earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just saw bears everyday.</v>

139
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.360
<v Speaker 2>We'd see six beers a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your mind's just bear,</v>

140
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 2>bear bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're seeing them all the time</v>

141
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:16.970
<v Speaker 2>when you weren't seeing them all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

142
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.360
<v Speaker 2>you get a little lax and that's where we</v>
<v Speaker 2>really screwed up because the attack</v>

143
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 2>went down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one was prepared,</v>

144
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 2>we were just sitting around having some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sandwiches and one of uh,</v>

145
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.310
<v Speaker 2>so we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

146
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.120
<v Speaker 2>we're filming and there was six of us</v>
<v Speaker 2>altogether and I think that large group,</v>

147
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 2>that six is what saved us because when</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bear ran in,</v>

148
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.890
<v Speaker 2>it was six of us sitting kind of in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>semi circle strange circle and when that</v>

149
00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:50.471
<v Speaker 2>bear came in we did that scatter effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that scatter was kind of</v>

150
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:55.850
<v Speaker 2>like if a lion is going after a zebra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use their numbers and stripes to</v>

151
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:59.900
<v Speaker 2>confuse the lion is that scattering of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things just going everywhere that,</v>

152
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.900
<v Speaker 2>that caused confusion for the bear.</v>

153
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.170
<v Speaker 2>So I think the bear went in thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever's under that tree,</v>

154
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it thought it was one thing and when</v>

155
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:13.310
<v Speaker 2>we blew up into six different pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just tried to kill everything at once</v>

156
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:16.210
<v Speaker 2>and couldn't actually get one person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

157
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.750
<v Speaker 2>But so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

158
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 2>it was crazy because we're sitting down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we decided,</v>

159
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.720
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have lunch before we hiked back</v>

160
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:26.210
<v Speaker 2>because the day before we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hiked along ways.</v>

161
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.440
<v Speaker 2>We got back to camp at three in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning or something.</v>

162
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:32.240
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two or three in the morning.</v>

163
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.410
<v Speaker 2>We'd barely eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everyone was just thinking let's have</v>

164
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 2>lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regroup,</v>

165
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:41.240
<v Speaker 2>hike out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're pat.</v>

166
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:45.800
<v Speaker 2>When the other guys that was with us</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought the jet boiled boil up some</v>

167
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 2>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was going around collecting water</v>

168
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 2>from everyone to get coffee going</v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

169
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.770
<v Speaker 2>And when I sat down I took my pack off</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the whole week I had been doing this</v>

170
00:08:54.771 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 2>thing where I take my pistol from</v>

171
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.100
<v Speaker 1>the PAC belt and put it on the holster</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my body when I dropped my pack and I.</v>

172
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.310
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird deal where I took the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack off and I'm thinking about</v>

173
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:06.370
<v Speaker 1>switching and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

174
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.670
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

175
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 1>and I thought I'll just sit because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's few times I'd set my pack down</v>

176
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:14.130
<v Speaker 1>and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just sit or lay on my pack like as</v>

177
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:17.560
<v Speaker 1>a chair backrest and then all flop the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>have the pistol right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's within arms reach and I'll be</v>

179
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 1>sitting there while I go around and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water.</v>

180
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.240
<v Speaker 1>And someone had moved kind of where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was sitting so now,</v>

181
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.600
<v Speaker 1>so I sit down across from the pack where</v>
<v Speaker 1>my pistol is and then thinking I was</v>

182
00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:34.890
<v Speaker 1>thinking about me that pistol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just was like,</v>

183
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:35.430
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

184
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be that guy.</v>

185
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:36.991
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

186
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:39.980
<v Speaker 1>the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

187
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 1>We not everybody had pistols,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just me.</v>

188
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:46.980
<v Speaker 1>And Jada said a pistol and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then pat pat's behind us.</v>

189
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear something and I look up and</v>

190
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:51.510
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bears like dead set.</v>

191
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:54.840
<v Speaker 1>So Steve would be where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bear behind Steve.</v>

192
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.110
<v Speaker 1>So Steve was between me and the bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his back was to it.</v>

193
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Like how far away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Far.</v>

194
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't 30 yards something the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time you see that?</v>

195
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Thirty yards and ends the marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

196
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:09.920
<v Speaker 1>it's dead run super fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just locked eyes with this thing.</v>

197
00:10:09.921 --> 00:10:14.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean I see it coming in the whole way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just beady eyes locked in on me and I</v>

198
00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 1>think this thing's gonna kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm thinking,</v>

199
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I say I'm thinking,</v>

200
00:10:20.491 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

201
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I just remembered what I was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through my head at the time.</v>

202
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.500
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>

203
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna die and my protections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

204
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:32.790
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die.</v>

205
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.380
<v Speaker 1>This is a situation where I'm dead and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they talk about it and he could have</v>

206
00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:40.020
<v Speaker 1>saved himself but his guns on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that was like,</v>

207
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.810
<v Speaker 1>go for the gun was my whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I start to go for the gun Yonis who</v>

208
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.990
<v Speaker 1>would have been here as I remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I start to go for the gun and</v>

209
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:49.561
<v Speaker 1>realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

210
00:10:49.561 --> 00:10:52.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time to get to my gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's three feet away.</v>

211
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 1>That bears like right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to me so fast.</v>

212
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.280
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of do like a football juke</v>
<v Speaker 1>move left,</v>

213
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll around,</v>

214
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do like a spin with my back and they</v>

215
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:08.040
<v Speaker 1>start running to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at that point Yonis it.</v>

216
00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know this at the time because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at some pictures afterwards,</v>

217
00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:13.020
<v Speaker 1>kind of piece everything together.</v>

218
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.110
<v Speaker 1>So Yannis was sitting right next to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he got up to turn.</v>

219
00:11:16.111 --> 00:11:17.970
<v Speaker 1>There was some trekking poles right</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

220
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.970
<v Speaker 1>He grabbed a trekking pole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so probably while I was joking,</v>

221
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 1>he reached around and grabbed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trekking.</v>

222
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Pole swings around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hits the bear in the face of Jesus.</v>

223
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.350
<v Speaker 1>So then the IC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bear running off.</v>

224
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Then I see someone going down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain with the bear.</v>

225
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking he's got someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I grabbed my pistol,</v>

226
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:35.850
<v Speaker 1>start going down the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yelling,</v>

227
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I count off.</v>

228
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:39.690
<v Speaker 1>And everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

229
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

230
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.860
<v Speaker 1>And then Garrett pops up out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bushes and his eyes.</v>

231
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 1>He's like wide eyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Garrett,</v>

232
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Aka dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirt myth.</v>

233
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:53.650
<v Speaker 1>He's the one who was on top of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow he's on the bears back.</v>

234
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>So I think when the bear wheeled around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like hit him and he ends up on the</v>

235
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:00.760
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I saw just legs and bear going down</v>

236
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 1>the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw his legs on the back of the bear.</v>

237
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 1>So the bear had them in his job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

238
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

239
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

240
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would think</v>

241
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 1>like if that was in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

242
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:13.850
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

243
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.590
<v Speaker 1>What was the anchorman where the guy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like writing the bear.</v>

244
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

245
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 1>And then we kind of circled up around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the treat and the real scary part was</v>

246
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.200
<v Speaker 1>that bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was so thick.</v>

247
00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:32.340
<v Speaker 1>You really couldn't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see maybe as far as the wall</v>

248
00:12:32.341 --> 00:12:34.090
<v Speaker 1>is from us with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that with the tree?</v>

249
00:12:34.091 --> 00:12:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Eight feet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

250
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.730
<v Speaker 1>And just real thick brush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd hear the bear charging again</v>

251
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:44.650
<v Speaker 1>and we only have the two pistols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yonis I and the wind was so strong.</v>

252
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:49.330
<v Speaker 1>There's no way we could use bear spray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we hear the bear charging in and me</v>

253
00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:53.440
<v Speaker 1>and Jada like pistols out ready waiting</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this thing to pop out at point blank</v>

254
00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:55.770
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he would in your yelling,</v>

255
00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 1>hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that thing stops and then it</v>

256
00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:04.750
<v Speaker 1>would just crash off and then would</v>
<v Speaker 1>charge in from the other direction.</v>

257
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Speaker 1>She ain't got to like circle around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree the other way and did that I think</v>

258
00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:10.780
<v Speaker 1>three times that was just under.</v>

259
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like a horror movie where it keeps</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in from different angles.</v>

260
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.230
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not a fun feeling.</v>

261
00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:20.830
<v Speaker 1>You just felt so small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you guys had come back to the carcass</v>

262
00:13:20.831 --> 00:13:24.220
<v Speaker 1>that was hanging in the tree and it had</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably claim that carcass.</v>

263
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.000
<v Speaker 1>We don't know who he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

264
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:33.100
<v Speaker 1>I assume now the weird thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it came in with the wind so the wind</v>

265
00:13:34.751 --> 00:13:39.751
<v Speaker 1>was blowing pretty stiff and say into</v>
<v Speaker 1>our face and the bear came in with the</v>

266
00:13:40.091 --> 00:13:44.200
<v Speaker 1>wind so he wasn't going into the scent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normally they go around,</v>

267
00:13:44.201 --> 00:13:48.430
<v Speaker 1>they catch the scent and they charge in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if you'd heard something</v>

268
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.280
<v Speaker 1>if he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw what slightly looked like.</v>

269
00:13:51.281 --> 00:13:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Bear sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both Steve and Steve and I kind of</v>

270
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.560
<v Speaker 1>pointed it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we weren't.</v>

271
00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.040
<v Speaker 1>We were thinking maybe it was something</v>
<v Speaker 1>older you wouldn't you say bear sign?</v>

272
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:00.940
<v Speaker 1>You mean bear shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

273
00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Bear Shit in the base of the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

274
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.820
<v Speaker 1>And so I think we did some things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are wrong,</v>

275
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:11.821
<v Speaker 1>but in in the instance what saved us all</v>
<v Speaker 1>now if we were to do it 100 times over,</v>

276
00:14:13.481 --> 00:14:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I would say I would do it differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it worked out how it worked out.</v>

277
00:14:17.141 --> 00:14:21.830
<v Speaker 1>So I obviously wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never opt to just have nothing</v>

278
00:14:21.831 --> 00:14:25.810
<v Speaker 1>and have this weird scatter effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think what saved everyone from</v>

279
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:28.780
<v Speaker 1>getting anyone from getting hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a miracle,</v>

280
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.970
<v Speaker 1>was the fact that when we scattered it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just confused that bear because he kind</v>

281
00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:37.540
<v Speaker 1>of had this look after you started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you started wheeling around kind of like</v>

282
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.600
<v Speaker 1>trying to pick a person trying to go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't target one individual and</v>

283
00:14:43.481 --> 00:14:46.890
<v Speaker 1>then things started hitting him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody is on his back and I think it</v>

284
00:14:46.891 --> 00:14:49.330
<v Speaker 1>just freaked him out and he went off to</v>
<v Speaker 1>regroup,</v>

285
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 1>keep charging back in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never made that full</v>

286
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.410
<v Speaker 2>charge all the way back in again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

287
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.220
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people have ever gone through a</v>

288
00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:02.650
<v Speaker 2>bear attack unscathed like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a group of six and the.</v>

289
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:06.800
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about it was it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a bear attack,</v>

290
00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:11.801
<v Speaker 2>but had looking at it later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had someone even been grabbed and mauled</v>

291
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 2>to death but injured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it would have been very</v>

292
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:20.840
<v Speaker 2>unlikely that that person was survived</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we.</v>

293
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.830
<v Speaker 2>The weather that came in was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was a hundred mile an</v>

294
00:15:24.831 --> 00:15:26.240
<v Speaker 2>hour winds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

295
00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 2>you aren't getting rescued in a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>mile an hour winds.</v>

296
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:30.980
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know those coast guard</v>

297
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.140
<v Speaker 2>helicopters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really sure what they're capable</v>

298
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:34.250
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe someone would say,</v>

299
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:34.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd,</v>

300
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Speaker 2>we'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that would be a very hard thing.</v>

301
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.720
<v Speaker 2>The gusts were so bad when we came back</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the ridge to our camp.</v>

302
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Now we're all on edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just want to get back to camp to put</v>

303
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:47.240
<v Speaker 2>it mildly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

304
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 2>Every now and then of course we see</v>
<v Speaker 2>bears on the way back and we're like,</v>

305
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.970
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this bear gun?</v>

306
00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Follow us this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many beds do you guys see on the way</v>

307
00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:56.920
<v Speaker 2>back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One one another.</v>

308
00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 2>So we saw a bear on the front one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

309
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:03.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still after that.</v>

310
00:16:03.351 --> 00:16:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking now before that happened</v>

311
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:06.951
<v Speaker 2>were thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

312
00:16:06.951 --> 00:16:09.470
<v Speaker 2>bears will attack us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After that happened were thinking every</v>

313
00:16:09.471 --> 00:16:14.060
<v Speaker 2>bear will attack us and we start to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the ridge back toward camp.</v>

314
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.910
<v Speaker 2>I think at that point I was in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>front,</v>

315
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Steve and someone else was behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we go over this little saddle,</v>

316
00:16:21.201 --> 00:16:23.870
<v Speaker 2>the wind hits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocks the first three people over.</v>

317
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.590
<v Speaker 2>One of the guys have like a pack cover</v>
<v Speaker 2>on his pack,</v>

318
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.540
<v Speaker 2>ripped that off and just sent it in.</v>

319
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.780
<v Speaker 2>The never evers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it went up and it was crazy.</v>

320
00:16:32.781 --> 00:16:34.490
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anything blow away like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

321
00:16:34.491 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 2>It just went flying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then we get down the winds or gusting</v>

322
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:42.680
<v Speaker 2>the rain's pouring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We look down the two main tensor</v>

323
00:16:42.681 --> 00:16:47.120
<v Speaker 2>destroyed steve and I's tensor flopped</v>
<v Speaker 2>down on the ground.</v>

324
00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:50.450
<v Speaker 2>I see somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sleeping pad blowing away,</v>

325
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.430
<v Speaker 2>sleeping bags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting soaked.</v>

326
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.550
<v Speaker 2>So now we have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real situation of hypothermia.</v>

327
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.690
<v Speaker 2>If the bear didn't get us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this hypothermia might and we now no</v>

328
00:16:59.691 --> 00:17:01.610
<v Speaker 2>longer have a camp that we can just go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

329
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.330
<v Speaker 2>So we've been attacked by a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our camps destroy.</v>

330
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.750
<v Speaker 2>We get down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the tents is jacked up.</v>

331
00:17:07.751 --> 00:17:10.820
<v Speaker 2>We take all the camp down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relocate behind the spruce,</v>

332
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.270
<v Speaker 2>gather up everybody stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the guys sleeping bags or wet.</v>

333
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we ended up like restringing the bear</v>

334
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:22.610
<v Speaker 2>fence around this new camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is after you've just had a full day</v>

335
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.240
<v Speaker 2>and been attacked by a bear and by bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>fence.</v>

336
00:17:26.241 --> 00:17:27.660
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>electric fencing?</v>

337
00:17:27.661 --> 00:17:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a little electric.</v>

338
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.300
<v Speaker 2>How do those things work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a battery operated deal.</v>

339
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.440
<v Speaker 2>You run electric fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a ribbon to electric fence,</v>

340
00:17:36.441 --> 00:17:41.441
<v Speaker 2>just like a cattle yard would have you</v>
<v Speaker 2>run that around and then it's just off</v>

341
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:45.470
<v Speaker 2>of I think six d batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

342
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.410
<v Speaker 2>Pulses and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tingles just a little bit.</v>

343
00:17:48.411 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you touch</v>

344
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.720
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really light you up.</v>

345
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.380
<v Speaker 1>So I think they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that feeling,</v>

346
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.000
<v Speaker 1>especially if it got like their wet</v>
<v Speaker 1>nose.</v>

347
00:17:57.001 --> 00:18:00.390
<v Speaker 1>They might feel it with their nose first</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shocks them and gets them to run off</v>

348
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.680
<v Speaker 1>hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

349
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'd like cuddle up with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead carcass inside that fence.</v>

350
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust it that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

351
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just a nuts a day.</v>

352
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.850
<v Speaker 1>So how did you guys eventually set camp</v>
<v Speaker 1>back up?</v>

353
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.510
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a spruce that we're using and</v>

354
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:22.230
<v Speaker 1>we got behind that spruce tree and input</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the GP tents up,</v>

355
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:26.730
<v Speaker 1>kind of tied it off to the spruce and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then Steve and I had too small a</v>

356
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.430
<v Speaker 1>backpacking tents that we put underneath</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few of the limbs,</v>

357
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.610
<v Speaker 1>cut out some limbs and got up under</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and it's still 100 mile an hour</v>

358
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:33.260
<v Speaker 1>winds.</v>

359
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 to a hundred,</v>

360
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.160
<v Speaker 1>a hundred and something gusts out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then uh,</v>

361
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.520
<v Speaker 1>some of the guys we actually cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't stashed it under the tree</v>

362
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.870
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was good.</v>

363
00:18:45.871 --> 00:18:50.210
<v Speaker 1>We had semi dry wood and we tried some</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the tent before and the carpet</v>

364
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.340
<v Speaker 1>kind of fallen over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had a little bit of dry wood were</v>

365
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.750
<v Speaker 1>after a couple of hours we're able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a fire going inside the inside the</v>

366
00:18:57.751 --> 00:19:01.140
<v Speaker 1>tent</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they could dry out some their</v>

367
00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:04.020
<v Speaker 1>sleeping bags and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

368
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.440
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long did it take before you guys got</v>

369
00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:09.000
<v Speaker 1>off the island?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

370
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:14.330
<v Speaker 1>so what was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it would have been the next day</v>

371
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.290
<v Speaker 1>in the evening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you get any sleep?</v>

372
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I slept pretty hard.</v>

373
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was ready for bed.</v>

374
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.220
<v Speaker 1>But how could you sleep knowing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking things out there.</v>

375
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like that for me.</v>

376
00:19:28.591 --> 00:19:31.910
<v Speaker 1>It was Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was Kinda.</v>

377
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking that was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We serve when it's over,</v>

378
00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.560
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fine with it.</v>

379
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 1>You didn't think like we're still on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same island.</v>

380
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.030
<v Speaker 1>The same bear still there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we only walked like,</v>

381
00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 1>how many miles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only three miles.</v>

382
00:19:44.191 --> 00:19:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Three miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing.</v>

383
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Firstly for a bear,</v>

384
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:48.660
<v Speaker 1>for a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't have been a problem for</v>

385
00:19:48.661 --> 00:19:49.860
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes five,</v>

386
00:19:49.861 --> 00:19:51.750
<v Speaker 1>six hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven hours or something like that.</v>

387
00:19:51.751 --> 00:19:54.510
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

388
00:19:54.511 --> 00:19:59.250
<v Speaker 1>And after it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once we cleared the area I was okay,</v>

389
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.090
<v Speaker 1>but in the moment I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it,</v>

390
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.150
<v Speaker 1>this is how I die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird feeling.</v>

391
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I've had that feeling a few times in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and I just don't like that,</v>

392
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:15.050
<v Speaker 1>that helpless feeling of like thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what scares me the most is that</v>

393
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:21.350
<v Speaker 1>thought of thinking while you're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking about that,</v>

394
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.550
<v Speaker 1>like while you're dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that this is that last thought.</v>

395
00:20:26.551 --> 00:20:30.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the idea that last thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I was hearing the plane and the</v>

396
00:20:30.871 --> 00:20:33.000
<v Speaker 1>plane's going down and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

397
00:20:33.001 --> 00:20:36.570
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing I can do in those</v>

398
00:20:36.571 --> 00:20:38.700
<v Speaker 1>thoughts that go through your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like those thoughts.</v>

399
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Just not see it coming because those</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts are the worst part.</v>

400
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I've thought of that before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how do you deal those thoughts?</v>

401
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 1>The feeling right before the plane hits</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground,</v>

402
00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:48.923
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

403
00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:53.060
<v Speaker 2>What are your parachute doesn't go and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same with the bear attack that bears</v>

404
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.280
<v Speaker 2>coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no.</v>

405
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:58.000
<v Speaker 2>If you have a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're focused on your task and then if</v>

406
00:20:58.001 --> 00:21:02.080
<v Speaker 2>the bear got you crushed your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you have that task to focus on,</v>

407
00:21:02.081 --> 00:21:05.080
<v Speaker 2>but you're focusing on the inevitable is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to happen.</v>

408
00:21:05.081 --> 00:21:07.780
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that thought.</v>

409
00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:11.280
<v Speaker 2>It's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are crazy animals.</v>

410
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:12.580
<v Speaker 2>They're nuts.</v>

411
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Been a Adam Green tree who were talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about before the podcast,</v>

412
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.800

<v Speaker 3>and Colorado and elk hunting in</v>

413
00:21:23.821 --> 00:21:28.821

<v Speaker 3>took a bunch of instagram pictures and</v>

414
00:21:29.491 --> 00:21:34.290
<v Speaker 3>putting them on instagram story of him</v>
<v Speaker 3>holding up a pistol with a sow.</v>

415
00:21:34.291 --> 00:21:38.970
<v Speaker 3>Grizzly standing on two legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at them in the distance while</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's snowing out and she got within 15</v>
<v Speaker 3>yards.</v>

<v Speaker 3>charged them within 15 yards.</v>

418
00:21:44.521 --> 00:21:46.140
<v Speaker 3>She's just trying to get them away from</v>
<v Speaker 3>her cubs.</v>

419
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:51.240
<v Speaker 3>Different situation than with with you</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys because the sow when they have the</v>

420
00:21:51.241 --> 00:21:54.150

<v Speaker 3>They just don't want their kids to get</v>

421

<v Speaker 3>fucked up by you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want you anywhere near them,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

426
00:22:01.811 --> 00:22:02.920

433
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really.</v>

434
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know what you get eaten</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese,</v>

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.010
<v Speaker 2>but you silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

436
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a fun feeling.</v>

437
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.580
<v Speaker 2>Those bluff charges are still extremely</v>
<v Speaker 2>scary because you never know if that's</v>

438
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:32.020
<v Speaker 2>going to be the one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

439
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:33.420
<v Speaker 2>They said</v>

440
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.320
<v Speaker 3>10 has had quite a few lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

441
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.990
<v Speaker 3>there was a really crazy video where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy had half his head hanging off,</v>

442
00:22:40.991 --> 00:22:44.170
<v Speaker 3>like a scalp was hanging off his head</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was explaining what happened and</v>

443
00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:49.060
<v Speaker 3>bit his arm and he apparently was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>was just scouting</v>

444
00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.700
<v Speaker 2>and that guy if I recollect right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was him.</v>

445
00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:58.150
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of one of those guys that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think even my taught classes on bear</v>

446
00:22:58.821 --> 00:23:01.220
<v Speaker 2>safety and other stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think afterwards he said,</v>

447
00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:02.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucked up deal.</v>

448
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.113
<v Speaker 2>Happens.</v>

449
00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was lucky he had a backpack on</v>

450
00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:10.050
<v Speaker 3>apparently because he was down and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing was just tearing them apart and.</v>

451
00:23:10.051 --> 00:23:10.884
<v Speaker 3>But he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

452
00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:15.670
<v Speaker 2>pedal in the backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a few years ago when I was in Alaska,</v>

453
00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:19.480
<v Speaker 2>I met this guy and he was an older guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I talked about this</v>

454
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:22.480
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was a older guy that was on that</v>

455
00:23:22.481 --> 00:23:27.481
<v Speaker 2>same island and he got attacked by a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like an 11 foot brown</v>

456
00:23:27.791 --> 00:23:31.210
<v Speaker 2>bear while you're skinning a deer and</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed the bear with a knife.</v>

457
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.580
<v Speaker 2>But he got destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

458
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Killed it with a buck knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

459
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.070
<v Speaker 2>he's probably 80 something now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

460
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.820
<v Speaker 2>there used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remembered reading stories about it</v>

461
00:23:39.821 --> 00:23:44.821
<v Speaker 2>and outdoor life magazine when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid and then somehow I got to kind of</v>

462
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 2>interview them and get</v>

463
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.130
<v Speaker 1>the whole story firsthand and recorded</v>
<v Speaker 1>it on a video and stuff.</v>

464
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Where's the video?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

465
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I've just got it on my hard drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

466
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do something with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

467
00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.340
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put it out this year is cool.</v>

468
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.900
<v Speaker 1>How big was the knife?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

469
00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.370
<v Speaker 1>it was a 500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says yes.</v>

470
00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Six inch buck knife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

471
00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:04.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the black handle kind of almost like a.</v>

472
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a solid straight blade knife.</v>

473
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bear like attacked him.</v>

474
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.950
<v Speaker 1>He kept stabbing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting it off.</v>

475
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this.</v>

476
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the video.</v>

477
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.960
<v Speaker 1>That's your video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

478
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:19.550
<v Speaker 1>that's not my video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

479
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:20.960
<v Speaker 1>that's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy.</v>

480
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.710
<v Speaker 1>That little tiny knife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little thing.</v>

481
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a big knife.</v>

482
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.390
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where did he kill it?</v>

483
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stabbed it.</v>

484
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:37.390
<v Speaker 1>It was like he kept getting it in neck</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the bear would go off and then</v>

485
00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:38.900
<v Speaker 1>charge him again.</v>

486
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.930
<v Speaker 1>And then finally the bear went off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it was pretty sick,</v>

487
00:24:41.931 --> 00:24:45.770
<v Speaker 1>like getting wobbly every time you</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack it'd be less and less.</v>

488
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.320
<v Speaker 1>And then I think he actually grabbed his</v>
<v Speaker 1>rifle and shot it last time we,</v>

489
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.280
<v Speaker 1>a bear was laying there because he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to get the bear away.</v>

490
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.870
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

491
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:57.470
<v Speaker 1>he was really fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a part of the story.</v>

492
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.860
<v Speaker 1>So there's a cabin there that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually been by.</v>

493
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:05.870
<v Speaker 1>They got him to that cabin and they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cabin.</v>

494
00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:10.871
<v Speaker 1>They have these things called Arctic</v>
<v Speaker 1>doors where it's a to keep the cold out</v>

495
00:25:12.291 --> 00:25:14.510
<v Speaker 1>when you open the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a two door system.</v>

496
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that the Arctic doors set up,</v>

497
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:23.530
<v Speaker 1>the emergency responders couldn't get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gurney in there,</v>

498
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:30.490
<v Speaker 1>so the owner of the cab and rips out a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chainsaw and cuts his wall open low to</v>

499
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:36.230
<v Speaker 1>get say I mean saved his life because</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they got the Gurney in the coast</v>

500
00:25:36.231 --> 00:25:37.064
<v Speaker 1>guard got him out.</v>

501
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.540
<v Speaker 1>He was in the hospital for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skin graft after skin graph and all</v>

502
00:25:41.541 --> 00:25:45.680
<v Speaker 1>kinds of surgeries and he survived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with those stories is that</v>

503
00:25:45.681 --> 00:25:47.920
<v Speaker 1>gives me hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always have these stupid fantasies,</v>

504
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.700
<v Speaker 1>like if a mountain lion ever comes after</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

505
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stab it in the net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to put my arm in its mouth and</v>

506
00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.240
<v Speaker 1>think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

507
00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.950
<v Speaker 1>You think about all that stuff until</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just right on top of you.</v>

508
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

509
00:26:02.031 --> 00:26:04.530
<v Speaker 1>None of this is going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking up at the thousand pounds,</v>

510
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.650
<v Speaker 1>so I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

511
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:08.840
<v Speaker 1>I think we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

512
00:26:08.841 --> 00:26:12.530
<v Speaker 1>I know we're really weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we were so weak,</v>

513
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong person is really,</v>

514
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:16.640
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

515
00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.010
<v Speaker 1>You feel really strong up until the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

516
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.250
<v Speaker 1>This breaths on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to happen.</v>

517
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.870
<v Speaker 1>When I was on news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did a scene once with a chimpanzee.</v>

518
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know everything you've ever made</v>
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>

519
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it got edited out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we had a baby chimp.</v>

520
00:26:31.701 --> 00:26:35.120
<v Speaker 1>It was a tiny champ like I think it</v>
<v Speaker 1>might've even had a diaper on,</v>

521
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:39.950
<v Speaker 1>but this little chimp I'm was like two</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old or something like that and it</v>

522
00:26:39.951 --> 00:26:42.560
<v Speaker 1>was on top of me playing around with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

523
00:26:42.561 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 1>like you want hold them accountable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold</v>

524
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:49.070
<v Speaker 3>it and I'm holding it and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>just hits me a couple times on the back.</v>

525
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking decides to smack me a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit like a puppy and I just</v>

526
00:26:53.401 --> 00:26:57.760
<v Speaker 3>couldn't believe how fucking strong this</v>
<v Speaker 3>little thing I had in my mind like,</v>

527
00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 3>like you think of a chimp that's like 30</v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds or 50 pounds.</v>

528
00:27:01.861 --> 00:27:02.131
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

529
00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:05.010
<v Speaker 3>that's like a person that's 30 pounds or</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 pounds.</v>

530
00:27:05.011 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 3>Like it is a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's body was hard,</v>

531
00:27:09.931 --> 00:27:13.020
<v Speaker 3>like would like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it felt like this table,</v>

532
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:16.200
<v Speaker 3>like everything was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have it in your mind like,</v>

533
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.890
<v Speaker 3>oh that skin and muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like my skin and muscle.</v>

534
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.850
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

535
00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so.</v>

536
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:25.200
<v Speaker 3>There's so much stronger and they ain't</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit compared to a bear</v>

537
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:31.140
<v Speaker 3>little baby chimpanzee in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy how weak we are.</v>

538
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:33.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing how our brains and the</v>

539
00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:37.620
<v Speaker 3>development of our intellect and our</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to use tools and houses have</v>

540
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.880
<v Speaker 3>protected us from all these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wonder what we used to be like.</v>

541
00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:47.030
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about that the other day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was kind of debating in my head</v>

542
00:27:47.031 --> 00:27:52.031
<v Speaker 2>whether our tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think our tools are the only thing we</v>

543
00:27:52.161 --> 00:27:53.510
<v Speaker 2>hide behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

544
00:27:53.511 --> 00:27:55.070
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the only thing that kept</v>

545
00:27:55.071 --> 00:27:56.180
<v Speaker 2>us alive for so long.</v>

546
00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what we used to be like though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if before the tools we were</v>

547
00:28:00.681 --> 00:28:03.380
<v Speaker 3>more like the chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe why we,</v>

548
00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:03.790
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

549
00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.460
<v Speaker 3>we were showing photos of Australia</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

550
00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:10.130
<v Speaker 3>which is like one of the oldest human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings and it looks kinda like a chimp</v>

551
00:28:10.131 --> 00:28:10.970
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

552
00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.000
<v Speaker 3>it's all covered in hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

553
00:28:13.001 --> 00:28:15.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't very big.</v>

554
00:28:15.231 --> 00:28:17.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about chimps size,</v>

555
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.680
<v Speaker 3>maybe a little bit of the underdog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The underdog is apparently we're only</v>

556
00:28:21.681 --> 00:28:24.380
<v Speaker 3>like five feet tall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they weighed 200 pounds.</v>

557
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:25.830
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

558
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:27.833
<v Speaker 3>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

559
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Speaker 3>maybe something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably guerrilla type drink.</v>

560
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Stupid Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Giant bones like probably waste stronger</v>

561
00:28:33.741 --> 00:28:35.060
<v Speaker 3>than us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

562
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:37.370
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

563
00:28:37.371 --> 00:28:42.371
<v Speaker 3>We just figured out a way to build stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I guess we just got soft.</v>

564
00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way it's amazing that we made it</v>

565
00:28:45.171 --> 00:28:48.190
<v Speaker 3>this far though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think bears like that and</v>

566
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.890
<v Speaker 3>all the various animals that we must</v>
<v Speaker 3>have encountered along the way.</v>

567
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.580
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why when the pioneers</v>
<v Speaker 2>came West,</v>

568
00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.470
<v Speaker 2>they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get rid of all the bears.</v>

569
00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I see why they got rid of the bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine those guys back then cruising</v>

570
00:29:04.511 --> 00:29:07.870
<v Speaker 2>crossed the plains and constantly being</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacked constantly.</v>

571
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.590
<v Speaker 2>They had a legit fear of bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

572
00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Because it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand it in our society of</v>

573
00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:21.100
<v Speaker 2>having these natural predators be actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>threats to you in your daily life.</v>

574
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:21.811
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

575
00:29:21.811 --> 00:29:23.970
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but back then they didn't even have like</v>

576
00:29:23.971 --> 00:29:26.820
<v Speaker 3>a real legit map of the territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

577
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.160
<v Speaker 3>they were just trying to figure it out</v>
<v Speaker 3>as they went along.</v>

578
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:32.700
<v Speaker 3>Cruising around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stumbling in the stomach thing and yeah.</v>

579
00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.870
<v Speaker 3>Well the last guy in California to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed by a bear.</v>

580
00:29:36.871 --> 00:29:40.140
<v Speaker 3>They named the town after him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a out near Bakersfield.</v>

581
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:43.090
<v Speaker 3>It was the last guy in California to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed by a grizzly bear,</v>

582
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.380
<v Speaker 3>which is interesting is that's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>California state flag as a grizzly bear</v>

583
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:48.610
<v Speaker 3>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we killed all of them.</v>

584
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.230
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>

585
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:52.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the California grizzly bears</v>

586
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:54.910
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just from my opinion,</v>

587
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.880
<v Speaker 3>it would have been semi coastal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they would've been very similar to</v>

588
00:29:57.881 --> 00:30:02.560
<v Speaker 3>the brown bears with a mild climate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They probably would not have needed to</v>

589
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:05.410
<v Speaker 3>hibernate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they would have been very large</v>

590
00:30:05.411 --> 00:30:06.244
<v Speaker 3>bears.</v>

591
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.320
<v Speaker 3>We should reintroduce him though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm all for that.</v>

592
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's probably some people</v>

593
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:13.930
<v Speaker 3>that would agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

594
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.770
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the people that want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>reintroduce wolves everywhere I say for</v>

595
00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:19.390
<v Speaker 3>everyone they reintroduced somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

596
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:21.580
<v Speaker 3>Let's reintroduce a bear somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

597
00:30:21.581 --> 00:30:26.050
<v Speaker 3>in the Monterrey San Francisco area</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they naturally were all those</v>

598
00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.600
<v Speaker 3>cmos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

599
00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:30.940
<v Speaker 3>Imagine I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't.</v>

600
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people really have no idea what</v>

601
00:30:34.121 --> 00:30:36.940
<v Speaker 3>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think of it as some sort of a thing</v>

602
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:38.970
<v Speaker 3>that they've seen on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

603
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.780
<v Speaker 3>the discovery channel or some cool</v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube video or you see them wandering</v>

604
00:30:43.781 --> 00:30:46.330
<v Speaker 3>to the fields,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but until you're there with it,</v>

605
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.190
<v Speaker 3>well it was going to say about with Adam</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

606
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.220
<v Speaker 3>like Adam said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like Mike.</v>

607
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:54.340
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets a fucking monster monster.</v>

608
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:55.420
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

609
00:30:55.421 --> 00:30:57.040
<v Speaker 3>people are out there looking for</v>
<v Speaker 3>monsters.</v>

610
00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.510
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fucking real.</v>

611
00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:00.700
<v Speaker 3>He goes most as a real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

612
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:02.680
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not their fault that the monsters</v>

613
00:31:02.681 --> 00:31:06.400
<v Speaker 3>put that fucking month is the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam Green spot on impression,</v>

614
00:31:06.401 --> 00:31:08.410
<v Speaker 3>that was exactly like him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's around me.</v>

615
00:31:08.411 --> 00:31:11.260
<v Speaker 3>I could do it better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might have that thing where they talk.</v>

616
00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:16.290
<v Speaker 3>Well at the end they've always goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was talking about out.</v>

617
00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:22.080
<v Speaker 3>It was charging him from 15 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could see the muscles and the hair</v>

618
00:31:22.271 --> 00:31:25.570
<v Speaker 3>was standing straight up and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at him and rippling and he was</v>

619
00:31:25.571 --> 00:31:28.750
<v Speaker 3>saying is this it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he found out later that the gun</v>

620
00:31:28.751 --> 00:31:31.030
<v Speaker 3>had the wrong bullets in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

621
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.930
<v Speaker 3>So the bullets were too big for the gun</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the only way it would have worked as</v>

622
00:31:34.931 --> 00:31:36.640
<v Speaker 3>if he got one in the chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had,</v>

623
00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:39.070
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't cock it to put one in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>chamber.</v>

624
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:42.640
<v Speaker 3>He would have had to individually put</v>
<v Speaker 3>one in the chamber and then who had had</v>

625
00:31:42.641 --> 00:31:43.480
<v Speaker 3>one shot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

626
00:31:43.481 --> 00:31:45.590
<v Speaker 3>that wouldn't work too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

627
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.490
<v Speaker 3>The weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember it almost seemed like slow</v>

628
00:31:48.491 --> 00:31:50.560
<v Speaker 3>motion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way that hair is just waving back</v>

629
00:31:50.561 --> 00:31:52.600
<v Speaker 3>and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This shouldn't be locking eyes with it.</v>

630
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:57.950
<v Speaker 3>I just saw one grizzly once ever in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild at close range in Alberta and it</v>

631
00:31:58.961 --> 00:32:01.600
<v Speaker 3>wasn't a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like maybe six,</v>

632
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.510
<v Speaker 3>six and a half feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they'll look.</v>

633
00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:07.030
<v Speaker 3>It gave me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was so different than,</v>

634
00:32:07.031 --> 00:32:08.690
<v Speaker 3>look black bears give you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

635
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:11.430
<v Speaker 3>This is the zero fucks look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just know.</v>

636
00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.650
<v Speaker 3>You just look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look through you through you.</v>

637
00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at you like your food to figure out</v>

638
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:19.480
<v Speaker 3>if it was going to eat me and how it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to eat me.</v>

639
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.640
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't looking at me like I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>scary.</v>

640
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.400
<v Speaker 3>Like black bears look at you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing man?</v>

641
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I come over here?</v>

642
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.800
<v Speaker 3>They bought smell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Outta here.</v>

643
00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:31.030
<v Speaker 3>And then they take off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

644
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.720
<v Speaker 3>the grizzly was just looking at me like</v>
<v Speaker 3>these marble eyes like black.</v>

645
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.500
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those eyes man dead.</v>

646
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.360
<v Speaker 3>They are dead eyes man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Shark</v>

647
00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.193
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

648
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nuts.</v>

649
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:43.663
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

650
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:46.280
<v Speaker 1>with all the ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the videos you see bears tear in.</v>

651
00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:49.790
<v Speaker 1>That cap might preserve where they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>just eating fish and they're chomping.</v>

652
00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the young ones because they have food.</v>

653
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine,</v>

654
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.790
<v Speaker 1>imagine if you just took all those fish</v>
<v Speaker 1>away and put one person there.</v>

655
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the look that those bears would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have just completely changed.</v>

656
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

657
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.320
<v Speaker 1>We showed a video of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull that video up.</v>

658
00:33:03.321 --> 00:33:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Jamie have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a crazy video of this guy who's</v>

659
00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.830
<v Speaker 1>a photographer who's taking pictures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it looks like.</v>

660
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:14.860
<v Speaker 1>15 plus brown bears and this one river</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of them walks up beside them and</v>

661
00:33:15.651 --> 00:33:18.500
<v Speaker 1>just sits down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like literally sit down about 10 feet</v>

662
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:22.640
<v Speaker 1>away and apparently this one particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>area is so rich with salmon.</v>

663
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:24.680
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever been killed there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

664
00:33:24.681 --> 00:33:25.510
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the.</v>

665
00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:27.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's kept my preserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's what they call it,</v>

666
00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.850
<v Speaker 1>but now you have to get permits because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just such a popular place.</v>

667
00:33:31.851 --> 00:33:35.180
<v Speaker 1>You go and you fly in there and you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>take pictures of the bears and they're</v>

668
00:33:35.181 --> 00:33:36.890
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have so much food and there are so</v>

669
00:33:36.891 --> 00:33:40.640
<v Speaker 1>habituated that they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you took the food source away,</v>

670
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:41.683
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

671
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that gun sitting there?</v>

672
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.050
<v Speaker 1>That's not what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've decided,</v>

673
00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like an issue.</v>

674
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:52.770
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

675
00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:54.060
<v Speaker 1>go over and grab that gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You'd be so crushed before he even got</v>

677
00:33:58.741 --> 00:34:00.660
<v Speaker 1>to that and it's given me some volumes</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could see it</v>

678
00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:04.520
<v Speaker 4>here at breathing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that attacked you guys?</v>

683
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:23.360

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>top I guess.</v>

688
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This video freaks me the fuck out</v>

689
00:34:38.151 --> 00:34:41.150
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this bear was just sitting right</v>

690
00:34:41.151 --> 00:34:43.010
<v Speaker 4>next to this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean you look at that and they</v>

691
00:34:43.011 --> 00:34:44.980
<v Speaker 4>just look so peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nice.</v>

692
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.020
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't ever think it's two</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely different worlds.</v>

693
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:53.021
<v Speaker 4>When you go to somewhere like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you see how close that thing is now</v>

694
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.990
<v Speaker 4>in that video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just looks like a docile,</v>

695
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:58.910
<v Speaker 4>fuzzy animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now Watch this,</v>

696
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:03.140
<v Speaker 4>look down there</v>
<v Speaker 4>bed so crazy.</v>

697
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.120
<v Speaker 4>That is literally like 15</v>

698
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:08.090
<v Speaker 1>huge fucking bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pulling salmon out of that river.</v>

699
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not.</v>

700
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think they're beautiful.</v>

701
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:14.240
<v Speaker 1>I think they're amazing and I'm glad</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>

702
00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:19.420
<v Speaker 1>but it disturbs me to no end that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really understand what they are</v>

703
00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:23.210
<v Speaker 1>and they treat them as if there's some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a mythical creature in some</v>

704
00:35:23.211 --> 00:35:28.211
<v Speaker 1>Disneyland movie and they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand conservation and</v>

705
00:35:28.401 --> 00:35:31.700
<v Speaker 1>controlling their populations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what they did understand when</v>

706
00:35:31.701 --> 00:35:33.650
<v Speaker 1>they killed them all out of California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

707
00:35:33.651 --> 00:35:35.660
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are getting fucking killed at a</v>

708
00:35:35.661 --> 00:35:38.280
<v Speaker 1>regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a is a real problem</v>

709
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.390
<v Speaker 3>and now British Columbia's in this weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

710
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:47.070
<v Speaker 3>my friend Michael Hockridge lives up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the woods in British Columbia.</v>

711
00:35:47.071 --> 00:35:50.640

<v Speaker 3>the real BC,</v>

712
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:54.090

<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

715
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:01.860
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to kill the bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you fly in to where my friend</v>

<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

718
00:36:05.731 --> 00:36:07.950
<v Speaker 3>they can hunt as many wolves as they</v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

719
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:10.410
<v Speaker 3>You could shoot 100 loaves a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

720
00:36:10.411 --> 00:36:11.990
<v Speaker 3>There's no lack of wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is.</v>

721
00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.160
<v Speaker 3>They're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We heard them,</v>

722
00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:15.121
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

723
00:36:15.121 --> 00:36:17.850
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see one when I was up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could hear him off in the</v>

724
00:36:17.851 --> 00:36:20.910
<v Speaker 3>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he said that he's got one in his</v>

725
00:36:20.911 --> 00:36:24.840
<v Speaker 3>house that jumped at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He shot in the air,</v>

726
00:36:24.841 --> 00:36:26.760
<v Speaker 3>jumping off of a ridge at him.</v>

727
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:27.840
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

728
00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:32.841
<v Speaker 3>He was making a Predator call and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolf closed in on him and literally</v>

729
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:38.160
<v Speaker 3>jumped at him and he shot it in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in his house he's got his house like</v>

730
00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:42.420
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got the wolf mounted like in the</v>

731
00:36:42.421 --> 00:36:44.610
<v Speaker 3>same position it was in when it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to eat him.</v>

732
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:46.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

733
00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.260
<v Speaker 3>People.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have to realize that like,</v>

734
00:36:49.261 --> 00:36:51.240
<v Speaker 3>I love wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong,</v>

735
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.960
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once I started hunting and then I</v>

736
00:36:54.961 --> 00:36:59.100
<v Speaker 3>started really looking into wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation and then the consequences</v>

737
00:36:59.101 --> 00:37:02.340
<v Speaker 3>of letting apex predators get out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

738
00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:03.510
<v Speaker 3>Like it's scary.</v>

739
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

740
00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:07.860
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wolves I've never really been afraid</v>

741
00:37:07.861 --> 00:37:10.260
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did one time I was in Idaho is</v>

742
00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:15.261
<v Speaker 2>springtime and I heard something in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>real thick brush again and here's</v>

743
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:22.930
<v Speaker 2>something and all of a sudden this wolf</v>
<v Speaker 2>pops out like five or six feet away,</v>

744
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:27.990
<v Speaker 2>just fold dead run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I like freak out.</v>

745
00:37:27.991 --> 00:37:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was about ready to kick it and it</v>

746
00:37:30.361 --> 00:37:34.950
<v Speaker 2>veered off the path and then I hear and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then another one comes running in and I</v>

747
00:37:34.951 --> 00:37:39.720
<v Speaker 2>grabbed my gun and shooting the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not when it like from me to you,</v>

748
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

749
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.320
<v Speaker 2>and it ran off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't know.</v>

750
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.610
<v Speaker 2>My initial thought was they were just</v>
<v Speaker 2>chasing each other playing and I just</v>

751
00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:50.610
<v Speaker 2>happened to be in their way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know,</v>

752
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:53.400
<v Speaker 2>you might've been lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

753
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.240
<v Speaker 2>And maybe I scared it because I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

754
00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hung them in Idaho,</v>

755
00:37:57.481 --> 00:37:59.400
<v Speaker 2>so they probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was before you can hunt them.</v>

756
00:37:59.460 --> 00:37:59.851
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

757
00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:01.410
<v Speaker 2>I was just an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

758
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like got my gun off after the first one</v>

759
00:38:03.971 --> 00:38:04.804
<v Speaker 2>was just thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

760
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:07.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just in case some trays,</v>

761
00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:08.850

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:11.360

763
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.500
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked to.</v>

764
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.040
<v Speaker 3>He told us on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Excuse me.</v>

768
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:24.640
<v Speaker 3>He shot an elk in a pc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

769
00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.740
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>shot an elk and um,</v>

771
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.680
<v Speaker 3>didn't realize that where the elk went</v>
<v Speaker 3>down was literally right in a wolf's</v>

772
00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:37.930
<v Speaker 3>den.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

773
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.650
<v Speaker 3>There was these bones around and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was literally like a scene from that</v>

774
00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:42.510
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gray,</v>

775
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.880
<v Speaker 3>like it's like broken jack bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was him and John only has a four</v>

776
00:38:50.021 --> 00:38:51.610
<v Speaker 3>Arrow quiver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

777
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:54.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He shot one arrow which used to take</v>

778
00:38:54.191 --> 00:38:57.340
<v Speaker 3>down the elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's got three hours left and he's</v>

779
00:38:57.341 --> 00:39:00.160
<v Speaker 3>got a guide with them and the guide has</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rifle,</v>

780
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.560
<v Speaker 3>but the guide only has a handful of</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullets.</v>

781
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.500
<v Speaker 3>He's got like three or four bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're standing there,</v>

782
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.900
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to take this elk out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

783
00:39:07.901 --> 00:39:10.720
<v Speaker 3>quartering it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we'll start circling them and</v>

784
00:39:10.721 --> 00:39:13.870
<v Speaker 3>howling and then they realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck,</v>

785
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:19.440
<v Speaker 3>like we're literally in the wolf's den</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one wolf makes a dead run out of</v>

786
00:39:19.481 --> 00:39:21.250
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He kills it with his bow.</v>

787
00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Another wolf makes a dead run at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They shoot it,</v>

788
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.110
<v Speaker 3>another wolf comes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he shoots it with the rifle.</v>

789
00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:33.880
<v Speaker 3>So John is shot to have his bow and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other guy shot one with a rifle.</v>

790
00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:38.050
<v Speaker 3>John's down to one Arrow and the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy has like maybe two bullets.</v>

791
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.150
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're freaking the fuck out.</v>

792
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.210
<v Speaker 3>They have their back to a tree and</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves are circling them and they're</v>

793
00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:45.700
<v Speaker 3>howling because they've already lost</v>
<v Speaker 3>three wolves.</v>

794
00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:49.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's literally getting charged by</v>

795
00:39:49.271 --> 00:39:53.000
<v Speaker 3>wolves with his back to a tree with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>giant elk carcass behind them that</v>

796
00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:53.890
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to claim.</v>

797
00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:55.630
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

798
00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:59.260
<v Speaker 3>He said the Alpha male was standing on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridge.</v>

799
00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:00.950
<v Speaker 3>He drew back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

800
00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:02.620
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the wolf.</v>

801
00:40:02.621 --> 00:40:04.690
<v Speaker 3>The Wolf looked at him and bolted and</v>
<v Speaker 3>took off in.</v>

802
00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.290
<v Speaker 3>The rest of them took off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

803
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.570
<v Speaker 3>but he said they were circling them</v>
<v Speaker 3>howling from like doing like a roll</v>

804
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:12.700
<v Speaker 3>call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to see who's still alive like</v>

805
00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:16.690
<v Speaker 3>what's going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even after a gunshot and two of them</v>

806
00:40:16.691 --> 00:40:18.880
<v Speaker 3>killed with arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were still chart.</v>

807
00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:21.680
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck Huh.</v>

808
00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:24.370
<v Speaker 3>Two great story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying.</v>

809
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.620
<v Speaker 3>But just to let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people think,</v>

810
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.690
<v Speaker 3>oh well was don't harm people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In World War II,</v>

811
00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:35.170
<v Speaker 3>the Russians and the Germans had to call</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ceasefire because so many people were</v>

812
00:40:35.171 --> 00:40:38.260
<v Speaker 3>getting killed by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They decided to call a ceasefire,</v>

813
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.080
<v Speaker 3>killed a wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then go back to killing each other.</v>

814
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:43.110
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy story.</v>

815
00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:48.170
<v Speaker 3>World War One or two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's one to the two like fed on</v>

816
00:40:48.831 --> 00:40:50.440
<v Speaker 3>the dead people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

817
00:40:50.441 --> 00:40:54.790
<v Speaker 3>I think there were so many wolves like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Siberia or Russia or wherever the fuck</v>

818
00:40:54.791 --> 00:40:56.350
<v Speaker 3>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of walls,</v>

819
00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they don't give a shit if you're a</v>

820
00:40:58.451 --> 00:41:01.780
<v Speaker 3>person or a chicken and they're here to</v>
<v Speaker 3>just go for it.</v>

821
00:41:01.781 --> 00:41:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's cold.</v>

822
00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:03.713
<v Speaker 3>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tough.</v>

823
00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:05.650
<v Speaker 3>Tough living is one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one.</v>

824
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.810
<v Speaker 3>So where we're one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

825
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.930
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a confirmed story.</v>

826
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:14.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean they were just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys would go out on scouts and they</v>

827
00:41:14.051 --> 00:41:16.990
<v Speaker 3>would just vanished and then they find a</v>
<v Speaker 3>boot with like half a foot still in it</v>

828
00:41:16.991 --> 00:41:20.500
<v Speaker 3>and like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people don't realize like a wolf can</v>

829
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.320
<v Speaker 3>cut through an elk bone with its teeth.</v>

830
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

831
00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:29.050
<v Speaker 2>when you see a wolf actually take down</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now it's pretty impressive if you've</v>

832
00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:29.801
<v Speaker 2>seen it live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

833
00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:32.220
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a single scene,</v>

834
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:36.470
<v Speaker 2>a single take down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a spike elk ones.</v>

835
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:42.200
<v Speaker 2>And what it did was just so fast to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ran in and ran it downhill.</v>

836
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:47.480
<v Speaker 2>They're so smart too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was the ELC was on a ridge.</v>

837
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.350
<v Speaker 2>The Wolf start chasing it down and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts chasing the elk through what we</v>

838
00:41:51.351 --> 00:41:53.630
<v Speaker 2>call dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where a bunch of trees have fallen over.</v>

839
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:57.590
<v Speaker 2>So the ELC has to exert itself and jump</v>
<v Speaker 2>over things and then the wolves would</v>

840
00:41:57.591 --> 00:42:01.250
<v Speaker 2>come in and bite its back legs and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>how old was so fast,</v>

841
00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.280
<v Speaker 2>it could run almost between its legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that elks running?</v>

842
00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it got it stomach open so it's</v>

843
00:42:08.421 --> 00:42:12.980
<v Speaker 2>dragging its guts and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the elk finally would get its guts</v>

844
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.670
<v Speaker 2>caught on the trees that it was going</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and then got it by the neck and</v>

845
00:42:16.671 --> 00:42:20.450
<v Speaker 2>just held it until it died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you saw this from,</v>

846
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.140
<v Speaker 2>how far away?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

847
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably 300 yards maybe.</v>

848
00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.493
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

849
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.530
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of it you couldn't see,</v>

850
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:29.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be because it was a hill across</v>

851
00:42:29.301 --> 00:42:30.230
<v Speaker 2>from me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could see it,</v>

852
00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:33.160
<v Speaker 2>you lose it in the timber and then it</v>
<v Speaker 2>come out in the patch and then it was</v>

853
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.840
<v Speaker 2>right below us and then we just kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>backed out and left it to them.</v>

854
00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Dudley saw a grizzly bear swat the moose</v>
<v Speaker 3>down with one shot.</v>

855
00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that the grizzly literally</v>

856
00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:43.371
<v Speaker 3>lifted up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

857
00:42:43.371 --> 00:42:47.420
<v Speaker 3>Paul was chasing the Moose and slammed</v>
<v Speaker 3>it on the Moose back and broke.</v>

858
00:42:47.421 --> 00:42:48.380
<v Speaker 3>It's back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going,</v>

859
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.390
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how strong a fucking grizzly</v>

860
00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.550
<v Speaker 3>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said you couldn't use it.</v>

861
00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like to to see it is like to see it</v>
<v Speaker 3>as one thing,</v>

862
00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.690
<v Speaker 3>but to try to describe it as like</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way I want to describe</v>

863
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:02.480
<v Speaker 3>because the amount of power that thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>had and it's Paul.</v>

864
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.000
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just gives you a totally different</v>

865
00:43:05.001 --> 00:43:06.740
<v Speaker 3>perception of what it's capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

866
00:43:06.741 --> 00:43:10.310
<v Speaker 3>you have an idea while the grizzlies big</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Moose is big kind of a bra.</v>

867
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.110
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swats it.</v>

868
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just snap down.</v>

869
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:17.090
<v Speaker 3>Most just went like he got shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

870
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you see the power of you think,</v>

871
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:20.583
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

872
00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:24.060
<v Speaker 3>The whole getting scratched things</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably that's not happening and</v>

873
00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:26.060
<v Speaker 3>getting scratched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're getting tore up.</v>

874
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:31.070
<v Speaker 3>So in BC they've recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they passed two laws.</v>

875
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:34.160
<v Speaker 3>The first law they pass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were going to outlaw trophy hunts.</v>

876
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:37.910
<v Speaker 3>So what they said is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because eating black bear is a</v>

877
00:43:37.911 --> 00:43:39.890
<v Speaker 3>traditional thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people eat black pair and a lot</v>

878
00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:43.160
<v Speaker 3>of people that are that don't hunt or</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have anything to do with hunting.</v>

879
00:43:43.161 --> 00:43:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Don't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but black bear is eaten by a lot of</v>

880
00:43:45.441 --> 00:43:46.274
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

881
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:49.940
<v Speaker 3>Grizzly bears not eating as much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some people eat it.</v>

882
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.920
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the indigenous people eat it or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they call first nations in</v>

883
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:55.850
<v Speaker 3>Canada day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll eat brown bear,</v>

884
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
<v Speaker 3>some of them will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they decided no more quote unquote</v>

885
00:44:01.221 --> 00:44:05.780
<v Speaker 3>trophy hunts so you can't keep the skin</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you couldn't keep the head,</v>

886
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:07.760
<v Speaker 3>but you could keep the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

887
00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.540
<v Speaker 3>So it was a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird law that got passed and people</v>

888
00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:12.230
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that doesn't make any sense because</v>

889
00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:16.670
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that they would want the</v>

890
00:44:16.671 --> 00:44:18.890
<v Speaker 3>people to only hunt for meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense,</v>

891
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.540
<v Speaker 3>but why not allow them to keep the skull</v>
<v Speaker 3>and keep the Cape and all that other</v>

892
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:24.610
<v Speaker 3>stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was useful.</v>

893
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:25.483
<v Speaker 3>It's wasteful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

894
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:29.750
<v Speaker 3>Then they changed it entirely and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>said no grizzly hunts at all and it was</v>

895
00:44:29.751 --> 00:44:32.080
<v Speaker 3>really quickly the one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one law changed and</v>

896
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.760
<v Speaker 5>changed and they based it on a really</v>
<v Speaker 5>small sampling like the,</v>

897
00:44:34.761 --> 00:44:36.840
<v Speaker 5>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had like a,</v>

898
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.840
<v Speaker 5>I think it was an email sample.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pretty Bowman has a thing on it.</v>

899
00:44:39.841 --> 00:44:43.640
<v Speaker 5>They did a podcast on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they explained how it went down that</v>

900
00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:46.230
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said 75 percent of the population</v>

901
00:44:46.231 --> 00:44:48.060
<v Speaker 5>degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not really 75 percent of the</v>

902
00:44:48.061 --> 00:44:50.370
<v Speaker 5>population.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seventy five percent of the 3000 people</v>

903
00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:55.371
<v Speaker 5>that got responded to the email and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or online petition or whatever the fuck</v>

904
00:44:56.011 --> 00:44:58.470
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they have a problem now.</v>

905
00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:00.630
<v Speaker 5>These people that actually live there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like my friend Mike,</v>

906
00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:02.130
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

907
00:45:02.131 --> 00:45:03.390
<v Speaker 5>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're not going to control the</v>

908
00:45:03.391 --> 00:45:05.880
<v Speaker 5>populations of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Mike had to shoot one that</v>

909
00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:09.720
<v Speaker 5>literally had its face in his cabin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He opened the door.</v>

910
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:12.540
<v Speaker 5>It was literally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he shot it like we're literally right</v>

911
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:15.750
<v Speaker 5>there where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was trying to come in his cabin and</v>

912
00:45:15.751 --> 00:45:16.584
<v Speaker 5>he shot it.</v>

913
00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the reason there's,</v>

914
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:24.470
<v Speaker 2>I've I've heard that there's more people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are attacked or affected by black bears</v>

915
00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:29.030
<v Speaker 2>and grizzly bears or brown bears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just not as many people live in</v>

916
00:45:29.031 --> 00:45:32.840
<v Speaker 2>proximity to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you put a major metropolitan area in</v>

917
00:45:32.841 --> 00:45:34.400
<v Speaker 2>the middle of fog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neck island,</v>

918
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:37.790
<v Speaker 2>people will be getting jacked all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

919
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's what's going on.</v>

920
00:45:39.991 --> 00:45:41.640
<v Speaker 5>Also in Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean when,</v>

921
00:45:41.641 --> 00:45:45.870
<v Speaker 5>when these most recent attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just because there's a large</v>

922
00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:50.280
<v Speaker 5>population of bears there and you can</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunt them and the good thing is that</v>

923
00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:53.700
<v Speaker 5>people hunted them almost to the brink</v>
<v Speaker 5>of extinction and now through</v>

924
00:45:53.701 --> 00:45:56.430
<v Speaker 5>conservation they brought them back to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the point where they're no longer</v>

925
00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.490
<v Speaker 5>endangered,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's the dispute between the</v>

926
00:45:59.491 --> 00:46:04.260
<v Speaker 5>animal rights people and the wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 5>biologist and the hunters and you know,</v>

927
00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:06.490
<v Speaker 5>trying to figure out what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

928
00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:08.700
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how big does the population you have to</v>

929
00:46:08.701 --> 00:46:12.060
<v Speaker 5>be before you realize that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>chop some of them down.</v>

930
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.790
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to eliminate grizzly bears,</v>

931
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.280
<v Speaker 5>but you don't want 100,000 grizzly bears</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the metropolitan thing</v>

932
00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:20.920
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

933
00:46:20.921 --> 00:46:22.000
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird.</v>

934
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:24.400
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a weird balance when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>check them out,</v>

935
00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:27.910
<v Speaker 2>hunting an animal populations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you throw in predators,</v>

936
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:33.270
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>even understand how humans have affected</v>

937
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:38.140
<v Speaker 2>the environment in such a negative way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that nothing will ever be as it was,</v>

938
00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People go,</v>

939
00:46:39.431 --> 00:46:42.760
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the predators will control the prey</v>

940
00:46:42.761 --> 00:46:45.940
<v Speaker 2>populations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so why would we need to control the</v>

941
00:46:45.941 --> 00:46:47.070
<v Speaker 2>predators?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

942
00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.930
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've upset the balance in such a way</v>

943
00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:53.710
<v Speaker 2>that if we don't insert ourself into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>equation,</v>

944
00:46:53.711 --> 00:46:58.711
<v Speaker 2>which is far as we know humans have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the equation,</v>

945
00:46:59.111 --> 00:47:03.610
<v Speaker 2>hunting since the animals that are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>currently in North America have been</v>

946
00:47:03.611 --> 00:47:05.710
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown birds have always been hunted by</v>

947
00:47:05.711 --> 00:47:07.120
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

948
00:47:07.121 --> 00:47:09.010
<v Speaker 2>when you're looking at the way things</v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

949
00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:11.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean indigenous people on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

950
00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.700
<v Speaker 2>people before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

951
00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.020
<v Speaker 2>settlers and whatever came in the bears</v>
<v Speaker 2>were being hunted.</v>

952
00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.000
<v Speaker 2>So humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're always a natural Predator of the</v>

953
00:47:19.001 --> 00:47:22.450
<v Speaker 2>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the way that humans have affected</v>

954
00:47:22.451 --> 00:47:27.130
<v Speaker 2>the landscape between obviously taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>up habitat and habitat and the number</v>

955
00:47:27.131 --> 00:47:31.750
<v Speaker 2>one thing is habitat is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Invasive plant species is crazy.</v>

956
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.600
<v Speaker 2>The type of plants that grow in places</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't be.</v>

957
00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:38.320
<v Speaker 2>Now we'll never get rid of those plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because those plants are there,</v>

958
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:42.730
<v Speaker 2>native plants that the animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>originally should be eating off of don't</v>

959
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:45.640
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They out competed by noxious weeds and</v>

960
00:47:45.641 --> 00:47:48.490
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the amount of food sources smaller.</v>

961
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:53.240
<v Speaker 2>So then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prey population cannot there.</v>

962
00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:56.440
<v Speaker 2>They've lost their winter range because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of developments and other things.</v>

963
00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.300
<v Speaker 2>And then if you just inserted it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

964
00:47:58.301 --> 00:48:00.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the predators will take care of</v>

965
00:48:00.161 --> 00:48:02.920
<v Speaker 2>those numbers still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not true because the numbers</v>

966
00:48:02.921 --> 00:48:07.240
<v Speaker 2>can't get to what they were because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's less availability starting at</v>

967
00:48:07.241 --> 00:48:11.650
<v Speaker 2>the bottom level of food source and</v>
<v Speaker 2>winter range and habitat.</v>

968
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:13.750
<v Speaker 3>So what do you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

969
00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:16.560
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it possible to kill all the invasive</v>

970
00:48:16.561 --> 00:48:17.394
<v Speaker 3>plants?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

971
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:19.110
<v Speaker 3>it's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not even close.</v>

972
00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:20.003
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

973
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:23.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way that like where I'm from</v>

974
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talked about invasive plants.</v>

975
00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:30.550
<v Speaker 2>There's species of grass cheat grass</v>
<v Speaker 2>fires,</v>

976
00:48:30.551 --> 00:48:32.740
<v Speaker 2>wiped through the native grasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't compete with that.</v>

977
00:48:32.741 --> 00:48:36.040
<v Speaker 2>So the cheat grass takes over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has less nutrients and doesn't have</v>

978
00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:39.280
<v Speaker 2>the same type of browse that the native</v>
<v Speaker 2>deer and whatever species,</v>

979
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:43.630
<v Speaker 2>deer and elk need mostly meal deer cheat</v>
<v Speaker 2>grass coming from.</v>

980
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Somebody brought it over because of was</v>
<v Speaker 2>ornamental and it's just gone rampant.</v>

981
00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Most of our plants aren't native plants</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it.</v>

982
00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:53.393
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at.</v>

983
00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the plants that take over or are</v>

984
00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.840
<v Speaker 2>invasive plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

985
00:48:58.841 --> 00:49:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Our countries primarily invasive</v>
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>

986
00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Maybe someone will call me out on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say That's not true,</v>

987
00:49:03.551 --> 00:49:06.220
<v Speaker 2>but there's more invasive plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The native plants.</v>

988
00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.300
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

989
00:49:07.301 --> 00:49:09.640
<v Speaker 2>The grasses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the grasses that we have around</v>

990
00:49:09.641 --> 00:49:13.720
<v Speaker 2>aren't from the regions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kentucky bluegrass in California.</v>

991
00:49:13.721 --> 00:49:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Does it make sense?</v>

992
00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:15.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always fascinating to me when an</v>

993
00:49:15.791 --> 00:49:19.270
<v Speaker 3>animal gets into an area where it</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have natural predators,</v>

994
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.330
<v Speaker 3>like a nutria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

995
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:24.130
<v Speaker 3>Like nutri is down south and they just</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to hunt those things.</v>

996
00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:26.500
<v Speaker 3>Like all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These giant rat thing.</v>

997
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

998
00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:28.110
<v Speaker 3>I was just.</v>

999
00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:31.730
<v Speaker 2>We're in Maui hunting access,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dear said,</v>

1000
00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:34.140
<v Speaker 2>the populations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just have exploded.</v>

1001
00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

1002
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.680
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have predators and all the</v>

1003
00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:43.040
<v Speaker 2>native species actually are being</v>
<v Speaker 2>negatively affected by the invasive</v>

1004
00:49:43.321 --> 00:49:44.010
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>

1005
00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:45.210
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were you there?</v>

1006
00:49:45.211 --> 00:49:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

1007
00:49:46.151 --> 00:49:48.600
<v Speaker 3>how recently?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was this yesterday?</v>

1008
00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:49.440
<v Speaker 3>Yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:50.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you just got back?</v>

1010
00:49:50.401 --> 00:49:51.061
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I got back.</v>

1011
00:49:51.061 --> 00:49:54.240
<v Speaker 3>What is it like in relationship to where</v>
<v Speaker 3>we hunted in Lanai?</v>

1012
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:56.680
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very similar.</v>

1013
00:49:56.681 --> 00:49:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different terrain,</v>

1014
00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.810
<v Speaker 2>little more mountainous terrain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1015
00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.350
<v Speaker 2>so probably kind of cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1016
00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:03.700
<v Speaker 2>lot of lava,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>

1017
00:50:03.701 --> 00:50:07.450
<v Speaker 2>A lot of rock and cliffs and some other</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that goes to the ocean.</v>

1018
00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's,</v>

1019
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:12.040
<v Speaker 2>there's kind of all different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more of a dry side of the</v>

1020
00:50:12.041 --> 00:50:14.740
<v Speaker 2>island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more of that law of a type terrain.</v>

1021
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.110
<v Speaker 2>And you've got bamboo forest on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other side.</v>

1022
00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Once the deer get into that thick bamboo</v>
<v Speaker 2>type forest,</v>

1023
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:23.680
<v Speaker 2>they'll never eradicate them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same with the pigs and everything.</v>

1024
00:50:23.681 --> 00:50:26.080
<v Speaker 2>They just can't get them out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:50:26.081 --> 00:50:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Well the good news is they've instituted</v>

1026
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.930
<v Speaker 1>a hunters for the hungry type program</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1027
00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:32.850
<v Speaker 1>in Maui,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1028
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.863
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1029
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:35.760
<v Speaker 1>So one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my buddies that don't with every</v>

1030
00:50:35.761 --> 00:50:36.281
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robin,</v>

1031
00:50:36.281 --> 00:50:38.180
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started getting some of that rolling</v>

1032
00:50:38.181 --> 00:50:43.181
<v Speaker 1>where they could go on the ranch's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot the deer off the excess deer and</v>

1033
00:50:43.851 --> 00:50:45.800
<v Speaker 1>then give them the people that need</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

1034
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:48.590
<v Speaker 1>God's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which they should be able to.</v>

1035
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Sure why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

1036
00:50:49.941 --> 00:50:52.010
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the some of the best tasting meat</v>

1037
00:50:52.011 --> 00:50:55.160
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're overrun with these animals.</v>

1038
00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an argument for hunting.</v>

1039
00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:01.910
<v Speaker 1>It's really difficult for animal rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to argue against because you</v>

1040
00:51:01.911 --> 00:51:05.540
<v Speaker 1>already have this invasive species</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's overpopulating this island and</v>

1041
00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.350
<v Speaker 1>you're going to bring in wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another invasive species,</v>

1042
00:51:09.351 --> 00:51:12.230
<v Speaker 1>which isn't that similar to what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to do in Australia?</v>

1043
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:13.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

1044
00:51:13.251 --> 00:51:14.780
<v Speaker 1>They started to try to bring in a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of stuff.</v>

1045
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.120
<v Speaker 1>I wish was here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought foxes and cats,</v>

1046
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:20.960
<v Speaker 1>but the foxes and cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you've got these marsupials that</v>

1047
00:51:20.961 --> 00:51:23.510
<v Speaker 1>are slow and lay eggs and don't run</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

1048
00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:28.960
<v Speaker 1>The rats rats hide and her fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>platypuses don't nesting bird ground</v>

1049
00:51:29.511 --> 00:51:30.620
<v Speaker 1>nesting birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

1050
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:35.710
<v Speaker 1>So they just hammer the native species</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the invasive rats and mice</v>

1051
00:51:35.771 --> 00:51:37.820
<v Speaker 1>still just take a toll on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1052
00:51:37.821 --> 00:51:40.460
<v Speaker 1>What is the solution to a place like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lanai,</v>

1053
00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:45.410
<v Speaker 1>other than hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you'd have to give the deer birth</v>

1054
00:51:45.411 --> 00:51:48.970
<v Speaker 1>control or bringing predators or poison</v>
<v Speaker 1>or poison.</v>

1055
00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.040
<v Speaker 1>So they use that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use fair talks in New Zealand.</v>

1056
00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine just,</v>

1057
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:54.801
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use,</v>

1058
00:51:54.801 --> 00:51:56.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a poison called tent and they will,</v>

1059
00:51:56.721 --> 00:52:00.570
<v Speaker 1>the fair tax is mostly for a possums</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they use a,</v>

1060
00:52:00.571 --> 00:52:03.680
<v Speaker 1>a poison called 10 80 and it's serial</v>
<v Speaker 1>poisoning.</v>

1061
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:07.730
<v Speaker 1>So they essentially cold cereal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be like grains and rice and</v>

1062
00:52:07.731 --> 00:52:11.780
<v Speaker 1>other things with this extremely deadly</v>
<v Speaker 1>poison.</v>

1063
00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:15.290
<v Speaker 1>And then they just dump it out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>helicopters into the forest.</v>

1064
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.290
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't discriminate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1065
00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Just whatever's local as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1066
00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:22.670
<v Speaker 1>And you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're putting.</v>

1067
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.823
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1068
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:26.240
<v Speaker 1>you're dumping poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1069
00:52:26.241 --> 00:52:27.740
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get into the ground water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1071
00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:30.890
<v Speaker 1>that's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of,</v>

1072
00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:34.400
<v Speaker 1>what kind of solution is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think hunting's bad,</v>

1073
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:38.690
<v Speaker 1>that poison is not an easy death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1074
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:39.560
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awful.</v>

1075
00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.900
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>

1076
00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:42.920
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

1077
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:47.950
<v Speaker 1>that the meat is delicious if you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they just had a program where they</v>

1078
00:52:48.411 --> 00:52:52.430
<v Speaker 1>went to Lanai and just shot animals just</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1079
00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:57.460
<v Speaker 1>for hungry people in la who are in Maui</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they could have a lot of amazing</v>

1080
00:52:57.741 --> 00:52:59.130
<v Speaker 1>meals for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1081
00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:02.600
<v Speaker 1>And not even just here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about sending that freezing it</v>

1082
00:53:02.601 --> 00:53:04.880
<v Speaker 1>somehow sending it other places in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

1083
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing that with other places in</v>

1084
00:53:07.341 --> 00:53:08.540
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

1085
00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:10.070
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>setting up programs like that.</v>

1086
00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like that fellow,</v>

1087
00:53:11.331 --> 00:53:15.590
<v Speaker 1>that was the con Hashtag animal rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Hashtag Vegan.</v>

1088
00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:19.940
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where they run into a wall,</v>

1089
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:23.030
<v Speaker 1>like an ideological wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you think should happen to</v>

1090
00:53:23.031 --> 00:53:25.010
<v Speaker 1>wild pigs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you think should happen?</v>

1091
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 1>You think they should just go</v>

1092
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.590
<v Speaker 3>run rampant and destroy all the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife.</v>

1093
00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:33.890
<v Speaker 3>They're not just an invasive species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a ruthlessly reproducing invasive.</v>

1094
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they can outcompete other things.</v>

1095
00:53:36.511 --> 00:53:38.660
<v Speaker 2>So by leaving one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1096
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:40.800
<v Speaker 2>you're killing something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always,</v>

1097
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:45.000
<v Speaker 2>there's always this weird trade off</v>
<v Speaker 2>where for some one thing to exist,</v>

1098
00:53:45.001 --> 00:53:46.580
<v Speaker 2>something else has to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1099
00:53:46.581 --> 00:53:48.690
<v Speaker 2>that's unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just how the world is.</v>

1100
00:53:48.691 --> 00:53:51.600
<v Speaker 2>If you don't like the way the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>works socks,</v>

1101
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:54.120
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also kind of.</v>

1102
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the way it is.</v>

1103
00:53:55.591 --> 00:53:56.424
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't.</v>

1104
00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:59.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that elk to get killed by</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wolf,</v>

1105
00:53:59.261 --> 00:54:01.840
<v Speaker 3>but I would have loved to see it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to happen.</v>

1106
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1107
00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:04.060
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to see in my,</v>

1108
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:06.580
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to see something really fucking</v>

1109
00:54:06.581 --> 00:54:07.490
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1110
00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:09.460
<v Speaker 3>What are the odds that you're there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1111
00:54:09.461 --> 00:54:11.320
<v Speaker 3>When a wolf takes out an elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1112
00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:13.600
<v Speaker 3>Not Very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not very likely.</v>

1113
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:16.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cam hands posted a few things.</v>

1114
00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:20.950
<v Speaker 3>We did that Una el con concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh good.</v>

1115
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.761
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1116
00:54:21.761 --> 00:54:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was great.</v>

1117
00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:26.740
<v Speaker 3>But Cam posted a bunch of videos because</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of people were,</v>

1118
00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:28.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always gonna bunch of people</v>

1119
00:54:28.961 --> 00:54:30.270
<v Speaker 3>complaining about hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1120
00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.830
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He posted a bunch of videos about bears</v>

1121
00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:38.250
<v Speaker 3>and one of them was a bear eating a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>grizzly eating this elk calf while it</v>

1122
00:54:38.921 --> 00:54:43.921
<v Speaker 3>was alive while the mother was off just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just a 30 yards away,</v>

1123
00:54:45.041 --> 00:54:45.970
<v Speaker 3>freaking the fuck out.</v>

1124
00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:50.970
<v Speaker 3>And she's watching this big old grizzly</v>
<v Speaker 3>just tear her and it's going making</v>

1125
00:54:51.101 --> 00:54:54.700
<v Speaker 3>weird noises where it just gets mauled</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1126
00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:59.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to happen and it's not.</v>

1127
00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:02.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm not happy that it's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's fascinating to watch.</v>

1128
00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.140
<v Speaker 3>Like if I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would definitely watch that.</v>

1129
00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just like it's live.</v>

1130
00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:14.280
<v Speaker 3>But I think that is the real ideological</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument and this is where like the</v>

1131
00:55:14.831 --> 00:55:17.950
<v Speaker 3>Vegan people fall short.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I understand that you don't</v>

1132
00:55:17.951 --> 00:55:19.630
<v Speaker 3>want to kill animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to.</v>

1133
00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:22.120
<v Speaker 3>I understand that you don't want factory</v>
<v Speaker 3>farming.</v>

1134
00:55:22.121 --> 00:55:24.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want any of that stuff.</v>

1135
00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:27.250
<v Speaker 3>But this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with a different thing</v>

1136
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:29.320
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a smaller thing,</v>

1137
00:55:29.321 --> 00:55:32.650
<v Speaker 3>like the amount of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting for food and managing wildlife</v>

1138
00:55:32.651 --> 00:55:36.610
<v Speaker 3>and controlling populations too small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a smaller thing than the amount of</v>

1139
00:55:36.611 --> 00:55:39.160
<v Speaker 3>people that actually eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to target that.</v>

1140
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:41.110
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're literally targeting the one thing</v>

1141
00:55:41.111 --> 00:55:43.540
<v Speaker 3>that's been thought out the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1142
00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:44.430
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1143
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've created,</v>

1144
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:50.700
<v Speaker 2>we've created these systems that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay with yet if you really look at it,</v>

1145
00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:52.980
<v Speaker 2>they're just fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1146
00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:55.880
<v Speaker 2>No farming of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've done.</v>

1147
00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:59.280
<v Speaker 2>We've done that for a very long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way that we do it now is just</v>

1148
00:55:59.281 --> 00:56:01.120
<v Speaker 2>some kind of different strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:02.100
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>

1150
00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:04.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're putting things in your body that</v>

1151
00:56:04.201 --> 00:56:07.620
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be there when you can go out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go and shoot a Caribou that's</v>

1152
00:56:07.621 --> 00:56:11.340
<v Speaker 2>never had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only been eating native grasses on</v>

1153
00:56:11.341 --> 00:56:15.580
<v Speaker 2>the Tundra and it's completely wild and</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy in my body.</v>

1154
00:56:15.581 --> 00:56:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Even feels different when I eat</v>

1155
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:18.100
<v Speaker 3>that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1156
00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:18.970
<v Speaker 3>Same with elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1157
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1158
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.690
<v Speaker 3>I get their argument that not everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>could do that.</v>

1159
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:24.500
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not everybody would do it again,</v>

1160
00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:27.910
<v Speaker 3>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Everybody is going to do a lot of</v>

1161
00:56:27.911 --> 00:56:29.200
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to do.</v>

1162
00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.790
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not an easy thing to do.</v>

1163
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy to get a bow and Arrow and</v>
<v Speaker 3>go into the mountains and find an elk</v>

1164
00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.290
<v Speaker 3>and shoot it and then pack it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most people are just,</v>

1165
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:40.090
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to do that.</v>

1166
00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.033
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you,</v>

1167
00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:45.210
<v Speaker 2>if you really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think it was kind of cool this,</v>

1168
00:56:45.211 --> 00:56:47.640
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last week I took my fiance hunting.</v>

1169
00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:49.490
<v Speaker 2>It was their first time hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1170
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like where she was hunting.</v>

1171
00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:52.880
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1172
00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.660
<v Speaker 3>So she's been with you before when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were hunting?</v>

1173
00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:56.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like when are you doing?</v>

1174
00:56:56.311 --> 00:56:57.120
<v Speaker 3>Are you done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1175
00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:57.953
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1176
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.780
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the years she's seen me go,</v>

1177
00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:02.040
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She gets it,</v>

1178
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:05.070
<v Speaker 2>she enjoys eating the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has always,</v>

1179
00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:07.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we first started dating or ever</v>

1180
00:57:07.201 --> 00:57:07.651
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1181
00:57:07.651 --> 00:57:11.340
<v Speaker 2>I could never kill anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I understood that not everyone can,</v>

1182
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:14.760
<v Speaker 2>but through the process of watching what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

1183
00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:16.710
<v Speaker 2>the respect that I have for the animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going,</v>

1184
00:57:16.711 --> 00:57:18.810
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't as bad as I had always</v>

1185
00:57:18.811 --> 00:57:20.430
<v Speaker 2>thought it was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was bad.</v>

1186
00:57:20.431 --> 00:57:23.940
<v Speaker 2>But she gave it a try and just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1187
00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:25.380
<v Speaker 2>And then when we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1188
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:28.350
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time she killed something she</v>

1189
00:57:28.351 --> 00:57:30.570
<v Speaker 2>cried a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But immediately after she was like,</v>

1190
00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:34.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually really excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really happy that I got this,</v>

1191
00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.500
<v Speaker 2>this deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then last night we cooked it up for</v>

1192
00:57:37.501 --> 00:57:38.610
<v Speaker 2>dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we got home.</v>

1193
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:40.950
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does taste better.</v>

1194
00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:41.780
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1195
00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:45.240
<v Speaker 2>because this is your dear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is you provided this meal for us.</v>

1196
00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:47.220
<v Speaker 2>This is your and well now you're a part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

1197
00:57:47.221 --> 00:57:49.590
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't go by that you killed it</v>

1198
00:57:49.591 --> 00:57:51.990
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You knew what that deer was and you just</v>

1199
00:57:51.991 --> 00:57:55.470
<v Speaker 2>respect it a lot more now because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were a part of that process.</v>

1200
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:58.140
<v Speaker 2>You had to struggle a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We almost didn't get one.</v>

1201
00:57:58.141 --> 00:58:00.390
<v Speaker 2>You went through the whole thing of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1202
00:58:00.391 --> 00:58:02.790
<v Speaker 2>you know the whole process of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's completely different.</v>

1203
00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:06.010
<v Speaker 3>It's just a different thing that when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're eating the food.</v>

1204
00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you buy a steak from a supermarket,</v>

1205
00:58:08.471 --> 00:58:11.590
<v Speaker 3>you have zero connection with that other</v>
<v Speaker 3>than the fact that he had to work to pay</v>

1206
00:58:11.591 --> 00:58:12.550
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1207
00:58:12.551 --> 00:58:14.380
<v Speaker 3>you go to a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have even less because you're not</v>

1208
00:58:14.381 --> 00:58:16.390
<v Speaker 3>even cooking it and they just sit down</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1209
00:58:16.391 --> 00:58:17.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have the t bone.</v>

1210
00:58:17.321 --> 00:58:18.970
<v Speaker 3>Medium rare please,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it comes back.</v>

1211
00:58:18.971 --> 00:58:19.960
<v Speaker 3>We'll looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shopped up,</v>

1212
00:58:19.961 --> 00:58:20.261
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

1213
00:58:20.261 --> 00:58:20.711
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

1214
00:58:20.711 --> 00:58:21.041
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

1215
00:58:21.041 --> 00:58:21.770
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

1216
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:23.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you do it yourself,</v>

1217
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:26.560
<v Speaker 3>you know when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you described it once,</v>

1218
00:58:26.561 --> 00:58:29.910
<v Speaker 3>I think a great way like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you pull out an elk stack from an</v>

1219
00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:31.690
<v Speaker 3>you shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like a sacred.</v>

1220
00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're holding it like a baby.</v>

1221
00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:34.810
<v Speaker 3>You will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've just,</v>

1222
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:37.060
<v Speaker 3>you've worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you just appreciate everything.</v>

1223
00:58:37.061 --> 00:58:40.300
<v Speaker 3>You work hard for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also that you were there,</v>

1224
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:43.390
<v Speaker 3>like you understand this when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating that meal,</v>

1225
00:58:43.391 --> 00:58:47.770
<v Speaker 3>that meal has a memory attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas effort attached to it,</v>

1226
00:58:47.771 --> 00:58:52.480
<v Speaker 3>it has a comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You understand the process,</v>

1227
00:58:52.481 --> 00:58:56.590
<v Speaker 3>you understand where the Arrow went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You understand the blood trail,</v>

1228
00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:59.080
<v Speaker 3>you under your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were there when you quartered it.</v>

1229
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.080
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all coming back to you as you're</v>

1230
00:59:02.081 --> 00:59:03.880
<v Speaker 3>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way you could reproduce that</v>

1231
00:59:03.881 --> 00:59:04.870
<v Speaker 3>without actually doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

1232
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:06.440
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>

1233
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:10.740
<v Speaker 2>there's that value when you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We even just having a set of antlers</v>

1234
00:59:10.741 --> 00:59:12.750
<v Speaker 2>around people might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't hunt think,</v>

1235
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just trophy.</v>

1236
00:59:14.731 --> 00:59:17.400
<v Speaker 2>It's glorifying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but after the meats gone,</v>

1237
00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:19.380
<v Speaker 2>you're still in remembrance of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

1238
00:59:19.381 --> 00:59:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a very deep process</v>

1239
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:25.940
<v Speaker 1>that you take with you for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1240
00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:29.200
<v Speaker 5>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have my first elk that I shot on my</v>

1241
00:59:29.201 --> 00:59:31.540
<v Speaker 5>wall at my house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only one that my wife lets me put up</v>

1242
00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:36.060
<v Speaker 5>with the first shot over the bow and I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I walked by that thing all the time and</v>

1243
00:59:36.061 --> 00:59:38.320
<v Speaker 5>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember the whole experience.</v>

1244
00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:42.070
<v Speaker 5>I remember bugling coming up the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember hiding behind the tree.</v>

1245
00:59:42.071 --> 00:59:44.910
<v Speaker 5>I remember drawing back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember waiting till I could see it's</v>

1246
00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:46.690
<v Speaker 5>vitals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember the Arrow hitting it.</v>

1247
00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.220
<v Speaker 5>I remember going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit,</v>

1248
00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:53.440
<v Speaker 5>we're watching it stumble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember going down a vivid,</v>

1249
00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:58.470
<v Speaker 5>like super vivid and vivid in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 5>not a lot of memories are because it's</v>

1250
00:59:59.351 --> 01:00:02.490
<v Speaker 5>so primal because it's a life and death</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

1251
01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:03.750
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1252
01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a neuroscientist obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's some shit that's turning on</v>

1253
01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:12.271
<v Speaker 5>in your head that's like from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>caveman days when you shoot an elk with</v>

1254
01:00:12.461 --> 01:00:16.690
<v Speaker 5>a bow and Arrow and you see it go down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you realize you like you're going to eat</v>

1255
01:00:16.691 --> 01:00:17.170
<v Speaker 5>this thing.</v>

1256
01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:19.660
<v Speaker 5>Like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very,</v>

1257
01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:22.230
<v Speaker 5>it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like the way I am.</v>

1258
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:26.330
<v Speaker 5>There's certain experiences in life</v>
<v Speaker 5>where once those experiences happen,</v>

1259
01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:26.831
<v Speaker 5>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

1260
01:00:26.831 --> 01:00:29.560
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even know that that was a part</v>
<v Speaker 5>of my brain.</v>

1261
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:31.810
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Being a father is that way in a more</v>

1262
01:00:31.811 --> 01:00:34.390
<v Speaker 5>intense way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like once you have kids and then you</v>

1263
01:00:34.391 --> 01:00:35.950
<v Speaker 5>realize like how much you love your kids</v>
<v Speaker 5>are like,</v>

1264
01:00:35.951 --> 01:00:36.850
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

1265
01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.960
<v Speaker 5>this is a part of my brain that I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>even know was there.</v>

1266
01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.520
<v Speaker 5>And that was like fully lit up and</v>
<v Speaker 5>overcoming all of my senses and</v>

1267
01:00:45.521 --> 01:00:46.660
<v Speaker 5>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1268
01:00:46.661 --> 01:00:49.840
<v Speaker 5>there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of strange deep connection</v>

1269
01:00:49.841 --> 01:00:52.540
<v Speaker 5>that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I always tell people like a good way</v>

1270
01:00:52.541 --> 01:00:57.280
<v Speaker 5>to let's that you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you sort of feel that in a mild way</v>

1271
01:00:57.610 --> 01:01:00.720
<v Speaker 5>without too much craziness is fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1272
01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.180
<v Speaker 5>When you catch a fish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1273
01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.540
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got decided,</v>

1274
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:04.743
<v Speaker 5>oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's.</v>

1275
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.150
<v Speaker 5>There's this weird sort of excitement to</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1276
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:09.640
<v Speaker 5>But people don't have a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 5>dead fish.</v>

1277
01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.570
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1278
01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:14.950
<v Speaker 1>it's weird because fish don't have faces</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like title,</v>

1279
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:19.840
<v Speaker 1>like your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that you maybe just because</v>

1280
01:01:19.841 --> 01:01:21.910
<v Speaker 1>nothing you don't cuddle fish or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1281
01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the water fish.</v>

1282
01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:25.600
<v Speaker 1>So the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1283
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:26.150
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

1284
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:28.100
<v Speaker 5>in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's in a different world.</v>

1285
01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something that we have about and</v>

1286
01:01:31.191 --> 01:01:32.480
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then there's other animals.</v>

1287
01:01:32.481 --> 01:01:33.920
<v Speaker 5>So we're super racist when</v>

1288
01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.070
<v Speaker 1>it comes to animals over share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like rats.</v>

1289
01:01:36.071 --> 01:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rats kills things gusting because they</v>

1290
01:01:40.311 --> 01:01:44.710
<v Speaker 1>have hair everywhere but their tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just slimy ass fucking rep type</v>

1291
01:01:44.711 --> 01:01:46.010
<v Speaker 1>retail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1292
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:49.760
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something cute like a chip on click on a</v>

1293
01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>little fella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was funny because today on my</v>

1294
01:01:52.941 --> 01:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>instagram page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1295
01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:56.450
<v Speaker 1>because I was doing some spear fishing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff,</v>

1296
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I caught an octopus and when to kill an</v>
<v Speaker 1>octopus,</v>

1297
01:01:59.031 --> 01:02:02.330
<v Speaker 1>you swim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bite their skull to kill him.</v>

1298
01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:03.493
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1299
01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.311
<v Speaker 1>Skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1300
01:02:04.311 --> 01:02:06.170
<v Speaker 1>It's right between their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's where their,</v>

1301
01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I guess their brain is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You bite them between the eyes because</v>

1302
01:02:09.561 --> 01:02:13.820
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it moves around too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's hard to cause an octopus.</v>

1303
01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:15.920
<v Speaker 1>They just latch on to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to bite it.</v>

1304
01:02:15.921 --> 01:02:18.680
<v Speaker 1>You can't stab it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be really hard to undo.</v>

1305
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to move and it's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1306
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>it can is you stick the knife and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would move around.</v>

1307
01:02:24.511 --> 01:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>So everybody does it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always bite?</v>

1308
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the most part.</v>

1309
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>So you just write eyes and you feel the</v>
<v Speaker 1>school and you bite down and crush it.</v>

1310
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had has a problem with you biting</v>
<v Speaker 1>an octopus in the head at least not yet.</v>

1311
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Probably fucking smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1312
01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:44.290
<v Speaker 1>This guy's got one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1313
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:45.480

1314
01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy's an animal.</v>

1315
01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.840
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you're that poor octopus is</v>

1316
01:02:53.841 --> 01:02:58.841
<v Speaker 3>fucking savage with a beard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian is my is running around before</v>

1317
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.000
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1318
01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.070
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1319
01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.050
<v Speaker 1>nobody gives a shit about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is octopus are smart as</v>

1320
01:03:10.051 --> 01:03:11.700
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're weird.</v>

1321
01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>

1322
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about that before.</v>

1323
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Just the way that they hide the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do stuff.</v>

1324
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:20.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your show that you.</v>

1325
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.750
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1326
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:24.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Creditor Apex Predator was a great show</v>

1327
01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:26.250
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things that were for</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't know what it was.</v>

1328
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:31.260
<v Speaker 3>You traveled all over the place and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to learn from the way different</v>

1329
01:03:31.261 --> 01:03:32.710
<v Speaker 3>animals would hunt things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1330
01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:35.640
<v Speaker 3>I remember when you came in here and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were talking about octopus.</v>

1331
01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:36.690
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>

1332
01:03:36.691 --> 01:03:39.810
<v Speaker 3>You can say octopuses and you could say</v>
<v Speaker 3>Octopi.</v>

1333
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1334
01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Whatever you want it both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I had no idea like when you came in</v>

1335
01:03:45.541 --> 01:03:46.021
<v Speaker 3>here like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1336
01:03:46.021 --> 01:03:47.760
<v Speaker 3>they're not even from this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like aliens.</v>

1337
01:03:47.810 --> 01:03:48.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're weird.</v>

1338
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.970
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1339
01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:54.440
<v Speaker 1>they are smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the ocean they're definitely at</v>

1340
01:03:54.441 --> 01:03:56.110
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the food chain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they really?</v>

1341
01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.940
<v Speaker 1>But they kill sharks will the big ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little ones,</v>

1342
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.350
<v Speaker 1>everything eats them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1343
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>If you're an octopus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

1344
01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:06.020
<v Speaker 1>You are a savory dish for every fish I</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess are quite delicious.</v>

1345
01:04:06.021 --> 01:04:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're fishing,</v>

1346
01:04:07.431 --> 01:04:10.550
<v Speaker 1>that kind of octopus for bait works</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than anything.</v>

1347
01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.361
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1348
01:04:11.361 --> 01:04:13.490
<v Speaker 1>These fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually how he saw the one that</v>

1349
01:04:13.491 --> 01:04:15.320
<v Speaker 1>I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swam down to go shoot a fishing,</v>

1350
01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:19.850
<v Speaker 1>usually pecking at it because they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the reef and just keep going for it</v>

1351
01:04:19.851 --> 01:04:23.270
<v Speaker 1>until it gets out of their spear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phishing is supposed to be really fun.</v>

1352
01:04:23.271 --> 01:04:24.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like hunting underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

1353
01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really fun.</v>

1354
01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.840
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd enjoy it.</v>

1355
01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:30.440
<v Speaker 1>I think you dig the hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to go that one of the best</v>

1356
01:04:30.441 --> 01:04:34.780
<v Speaker 1>things I've ever done in my life was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that free diving essentially like as</v>

1357
01:04:34.781 --> 01:04:38.810
<v Speaker 1>free diving class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's one of the coolest things</v>

1358
01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.430
<v Speaker 1>when I guarantee you'd be able to hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>your breath for four minutes or so and</v>

1359
01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.240
<v Speaker 1>after you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think like,</v>

1360
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:45.320
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do anything.</v>

1361
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:47.060
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird feeling.</v>

1362
01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:50.060
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the coolest things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did and I did it on that apex</v>

1363
01:04:50.061 --> 01:04:51.380
<v Speaker 1>predators show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he did it for.</v>

1364
01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.900
<v Speaker 1>But then since then I've been doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit of,</v>

1365
01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:57.270
<v Speaker 1>as much as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to go diving and spear fishing.</v>

1366
01:04:57.430 --> 01:05:00.220
<v Speaker 3>And the first time you held your breath</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't hold it that long.</v>

1367
01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:02.680
<v Speaker 3>And then they told you how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a minute,</v>

1368
01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:04.220
<v Speaker 1>a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute and a half,</v>

1369
01:05:04.221 --> 01:05:05.660
<v Speaker 1>something like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was the difference?</v>

1370
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:07.680
<v Speaker 1>It's all mental really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1371
01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:08.930
<v Speaker 1>So what did they tell you to concentrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>

1372
01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Just the fact that you aren't going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>die [inaudible] key and relaxing when</v>

1373
01:05:15.471 --> 01:05:18.310
<v Speaker 1>your heart rate starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's more about just controlling</v>

1374
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:20.590
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>controlling your heart rate and other</v>

1375
01:05:20.591 --> 01:05:22.300
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm no expert,</v>

1376
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:26.080
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people there really have been</v>

1377
01:05:26.081 --> 01:05:28.210
<v Speaker 2>spear fishing and diving as much as I go</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>

1378
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.210
<v Speaker 2>But I try to learn as much as I can when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out with people that know what</v>

1379
01:05:31.211 --> 01:05:32.870
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1380
01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:37.420
<v Speaker 2>it's just a cool experience of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>underwater and you get that little bit</v>

1381
01:05:37.421 --> 01:05:40.930
<v Speaker 2>of a panic and you start to use your</v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen and then you just try to relax,</v>

1382
01:05:40.931 --> 01:05:41.591
<v Speaker 2>relax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relax,</v>

1383
01:05:41.591 --> 01:05:43.870
<v Speaker 2>relax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can stay longer.</v>

1384
01:05:45.010 --> 01:05:47.890
<v Speaker 2>And sort of this guy does he given you</v>
<v Speaker 2>like techniques,</v>

1385
01:05:47.891 --> 01:05:52.891
<v Speaker 2>tech techniques to breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow your heart rate and then just</v>

1386
01:05:53.081 --> 01:05:56.200
<v Speaker 2>knowing the fact of how to hold your</v>
<v Speaker 2>breath,</v>

1387
01:05:56.201 --> 01:06:00.280
<v Speaker 2>don't let it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that what your body goes</v>

1388
01:06:00.281 --> 01:06:03.400
<v Speaker 2>through the stages that your body goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>through when you are out of oxygen.</v>

1389
01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:08.680
<v Speaker 2>So when you get to that end period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually almost feel like you don't</v>

1390
01:06:08.681 --> 01:06:10.870
<v Speaker 2>need to breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird.</v>

1391
01:06:10.871 --> 01:06:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's when he got to breathe.</v>

1392
01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:14.250
<v Speaker 2>That's when you got to breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when I,</v>

1393
01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:16.600
<v Speaker 2>when I was done doing the four minute</v>
<v Speaker 2>breath,</v>

1394
01:06:16.601 --> 01:06:18.430
<v Speaker 2>all that came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first thing he says,</v>

1395
01:06:18.431 --> 01:06:21.790
<v Speaker 2>breathe like x.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tell you like exhale and breathe.</v>

1396
01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Because I got up and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>

1397
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.400
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1398
01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:24.821
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1399
01:06:24.821 --> 01:06:26.950
<v Speaker 2>I need to breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

1400
01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.780
<v Speaker 3>So is it sort of like hypothermia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as you get really,</v>

1401
01:06:29.781 --> 01:06:31.130
<v Speaker 3>really cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start heating up?</v>

1402
01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:33.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>

1403
01:06:33.591 --> 01:06:36.110
<v Speaker 3>Like you feel the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when people are dying of</v>

1404
01:06:36.111 --> 01:06:38.120
<v Speaker 3>hypothermia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things when they find them,</v>

1405
01:06:38.121 --> 01:06:39.550
<v Speaker 3>they took all their clothes off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1406
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:42.620
<v Speaker 3>It could be something similar to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1407
01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1408
01:06:44.031 --> 01:06:44.864
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1409
01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.610
<v Speaker 3>when you hold your breath and you'd take</v>
<v Speaker 3>arts,</v>

1410
01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:53.270
<v Speaker 3>why is it better to hold your breath and</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have no breath in and just not</v>

1411
01:06:53.271 --> 01:06:55.970
<v Speaker 3>breathe because your body needs the</v>
<v Speaker 3>oxygen.</v>

1412
01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:59.960
<v Speaker 3>So the big breath like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1413
01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.210
<v Speaker 3>that's better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just hold that.</v>

1414
01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I was wondering like how,</v>

1415
01:07:04.310 --> 01:07:09.200
<v Speaker 3>what is the record for exhaling is all</v>
<v Speaker 3>your air and then holding your breath</v>

1416
01:07:09.201 --> 01:07:11.100
<v Speaker 3>before you take another deep breath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

1417
01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.150
<v Speaker 3>exhaling all your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1418
01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:16.550
<v Speaker 3>You're taking a big deep breath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exhaling everything and then holding it</v>

1419
01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.680
<v Speaker 3>while you have no air in your lungs.</v>

1420
01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.630
<v Speaker 3>Like how long can you go on for too</v>
<v Speaker 3>long?</v>

1421
01:07:20.631 --> 01:07:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Really know you're saying you breathe in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and breathe all the air out and then</v>

1422
01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:25.820
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1423
01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:26.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few seconds.</v>

1424
01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:27.651
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1425
01:07:27.651 --> 01:07:28.910
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1426
01:07:28.911 --> 01:07:29.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1427
01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:32.270
<v Speaker 3>not a few seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a minute it with.</v>

1428
01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:32.990
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1429
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:34.070
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no worry.</v>

1430
01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:35.030
<v Speaker 3>Blackout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1431
01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:36.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1432
01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:41.090
<v Speaker 3>You gotta breathe everything out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then do 10 jumping jacks.</v>

1433
01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>

1434
01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:44.810
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's no way he'd burn it out.</v>

1435
01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:45.900
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1436
01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:48.770
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably be the fastest way to pass</v>

1437
01:07:48.771 --> 01:07:50.060
<v Speaker 3>out of Eagan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

1438
01:07:50.061 --> 01:07:54.170
<v Speaker 3>a guy who fought in the UFC and he was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>free dive champion and I believe,</v>

1439
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:58.880
<v Speaker 3>I want to say he went longer than seven</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

1440
01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the ocean.</v>

1441
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:03.500
<v Speaker 3>Underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holding his breath.</v>

1442
01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people are incredible.</v>

1443
01:08:05.161 --> 01:08:09.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean they can go five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven that some of that too is building</v>

1444
01:08:09.241 --> 01:08:12.660
<v Speaker 2>up your endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it is building up your</v>

1445
01:08:12.661 --> 01:08:15.320
<v Speaker 2>endurance and just really slowing your</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart rate</v>

1446
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:20.930
<v Speaker 1>and not using up the oxygen that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have and not freaking out is a freakout.</v>

1447
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:22.740
<v Speaker 1>You get scared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're heart rate goes up and you use</v>

1448
01:08:22.741 --> 01:08:25.790
<v Speaker 1>them more oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things if you're</v>

1449
01:08:25.791 --> 01:08:30.791
<v Speaker 1>running out of gas and you want to speed</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to the gas station and burn more gas</v>

1450
01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:35.750
<v Speaker 1>was instead of slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop it down to 35 and cruise,</v>

1451
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:41.500
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go 70 if he can do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating life when it comes to</v>

1452
01:08:42.561 --> 01:08:45.680
<v Speaker 1>like your experiences in the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how old are you?</v>

1453
01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Thirty five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>33,</v>

1454
01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:51.290
<v Speaker 1>33,</v>
<v Speaker 1>33 year old guys have not been to as</v>

1455
01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:52.640
<v Speaker 1>many places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Experiences.</v>

<v Speaker 1>very unusual life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh definitely.</v>

1461
01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:06.170
<v Speaker 1>I've spent the majority of my life out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the wild.</v>

1462
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.110
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things because people</v>

<v Speaker 1>but it was like a dance champion of the</v>

1480
01:09:47.641 --> 01:09:48.530
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's true.</v>

1481
01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:51.380

1486
01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:06.620
<v Speaker 1>It's the only those things you whip out</v>
<v Speaker 1>at like a wedding.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's one of those things that everyone</v>

1489
01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:17.960
<v Speaker 1>was one Christmas party with Zpz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was just hammered and I</v>

1490
01:10:17.961 --> 01:10:18.794
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1491
01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:21.950
<v Speaker 1>someone was trying to do like the white</v>
<v Speaker 1>break dance thing,</v>

1492
01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:25.040
<v Speaker 1>which as my version is extremely white</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bad,</v>

1493
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:30.310
<v Speaker 1>but I could do like a few no head spins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe some wind mills and some cool</v>

1494
01:10:30.501 --> 01:10:31.151
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1495
01:10:31.151 --> 01:10:34.700
<v Speaker 1>that might have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it just goes from there.</v>

1496
01:10:34.701 --> 01:10:38.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened because the rumor</v>
<v Speaker 1>has spread like wildfire.</v>

1497
01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.411
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1498
01:10:39.411 --> 01:10:41.060
<v Speaker 1>warren was a break desi champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1499
01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.210
<v Speaker 1>does he have time for these things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty three years old.</v>

1500
01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Have all the places that you've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you.</v>

1501
01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:50.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the first time I saw you was on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that show solo hunter,</v>

1502
01:10:50.091 --> 01:10:50.924
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1503
01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:52.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the first time I saw you was on</v>

1504
01:10:52.761 --> 01:10:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Steve Show and that I saw you on soul</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter as well.</v>

1505
01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was actually supposed to go on</v>

1506
01:10:56.781 --> 01:10:59.570
<v Speaker 1>that first hunt with you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had to guide that week when</v>

1507
01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Callahan and I wish I would have made</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1508
01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:03.980
<v Speaker 1>but I was fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have been cool.</v>

1509
01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I love that area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

1510
01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:07.650
<v Speaker 1>You have to go into the woods with Brian</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cowen.</v>

1511
01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1512
01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:11.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will not stop laughing because.</v>

1513
01:11:11.151 --> 01:11:11.984
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1514
01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.150
<v Speaker 1>he's way than me like</v>

1515
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.950
<v Speaker 3>with a captive audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's like,</v>

1516
01:11:16.951 --> 01:11:21.040
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like he's wasted on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a Bra.</v>

1517
01:11:21.090 --> 01:11:21.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1518
01:11:21.481 --> 01:11:24.150
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where he's at his best is a bunch of</v>

1519
01:11:24.151 --> 01:11:26.870
<v Speaker 3>friends just hanging around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Small group,</v>

1520
01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.020
<v Speaker 3>just small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he would just,</v>

1521
01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.300
<v Speaker 3>he would just be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so funny.</v>

1522
01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:33.270
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like there's no art forum</v>

1523
01:11:33.271 --> 01:11:34.630
<v Speaker 3>for what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1524
01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:39.240
<v Speaker 3>it's like he can take it to a stage in</v>
<v Speaker 3>front of a bunch of strangers and 300</v>

1525
01:11:39.241 --> 01:11:41.820
<v Speaker 3>people and whatever on a credit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be really funny.</v>

1526
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's standups really,</v>

1527
01:11:43.441 --> 01:11:45.090
<v Speaker 3>really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the best standups in the</v>

1528
01:11:45.091 --> 01:11:47.940
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not as funny as when you're</v>

1529
01:11:47.941 --> 01:11:51.600
<v Speaker 3>alone with him in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did this thing about he had a</v>

1530
01:11:51.601 --> 01:11:55.230
<v Speaker 3>character that he created called the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ravine calmer where he would jerk off</v>

1531
01:11:55.231 --> 01:11:58.560
<v Speaker 3>intervenes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid,</v>

1532
01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:02.430
<v Speaker 3>but when you're there and you're in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Montana and his fucking nine degrees out</v>

1533
01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:06.450
<v Speaker 3>and you've been sleeping on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 3>for five days and hiking around miles</v>

1534
01:12:06.451 --> 01:12:10.140
<v Speaker 3>every day and you're kind of half half</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of it and laughing and you're,</v>

1535
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.960
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in the middle of a quartering,</v>

1536
01:12:11.970 --> 01:12:13.980
<v Speaker 3>a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he just starts,</v>

1537
01:12:13.981 --> 01:12:14.731
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

1538
01:12:14.731 --> 01:12:16.320
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a dealer,</v>

1539
01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:20.970
<v Speaker 3>and he just starts like pretending pulls</v>
<v Speaker 3>his pants halfway down his jacket off</v>

1540
01:12:20.971 --> 01:12:22.560
<v Speaker 3>into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a canyon.</v>

1541
01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.320
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing it any justice.</v>

1542
01:12:25.321 --> 01:12:26.910
<v Speaker 3>Purely that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So juvenile.</v>

1543
01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:29.690
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely Juvie is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's what cried.</v>

1544
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.980
<v Speaker 3>When you're hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have that,</v>

1545
01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:35.690
<v Speaker 3>that sense of humor to keep you going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's guys like that.</v>

1546
01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:40.230
<v Speaker 3>Just when you're out there sharing</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are just extra money,</v>

1547
01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:45.231
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>just but see him when he's at his best.</v>

1548
01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.100
<v Speaker 3>When you're in a captive audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm just,</v>

1549
01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:49.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not me.</v>

1550
01:12:49.171 --> 01:12:50.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have that sense of humor.</v>

1551
01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:52.260
<v Speaker 3>I have a different kind of sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>humor,</v>

1552
01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:54.900
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the guy where there's like five of</v>

1553
01:12:54.901 --> 01:12:55.501
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like he'll just</v>

1556
01:12:58.850 --> 01:13:00.990
<v Speaker 3>making you uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The next thing you know,</v>

1558
01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:05.100

<v Speaker 3>it's so silly.</v>

1559
01:13:05.101 --> 01:13:09.060
<v Speaker 3>So that trip and that's when I knew too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on the first hunting trip and I</v>

1560
01:13:09.061 --> 01:13:10.590
<v Speaker 3>knew he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of all my friends,</v>

1561
01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.740
<v Speaker 3>he's one of the ones that I knew would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to tough it out.</v>

1562
01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Like all the other guys that are urban</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys stand up Comedians,</v>

1563
01:13:17.461 --> 01:13:21.000

<v Speaker 3>one of those guys to go to Montana for</v>

1564
01:13:21.001 --> 01:13:24.320
<v Speaker 3>seven days?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they'd be like,</v>

1565
01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:29.250

1578
01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:53.130
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was originally pronounced one way,</v>

1579
01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:57.420
<v Speaker 3>like the state of Nevada is not Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nevada.</v>

1580
01:13:57.570 --> 01:13:59.410
<v Speaker 3>Everyone who lives there calls it</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nevada,</v>

1581
01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:00.820
<v Speaker 3>Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In Nevada,</v>

1582
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.863
<v Speaker 3>Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1583
01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:04.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Las Vegas,</v>

1584
01:14:04.351 --> 01:14:06.180
<v Speaker 3>Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what I say.</v>

1585
01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:08.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to be alone without you</v>

1586
01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 3>influencing me to remember when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think next time they'll call</v>

1587
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.830
<v Speaker 1>it in Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be like a big ad</v>

1588
01:14:14.831 --> 01:14:16.780
<v Speaker 1>campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's just certain things that</v>

1589
01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.400
<v Speaker 1>when you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it set a certain way.</v>

1590
01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we went and borrowed your truck</v>

1591
01:14:22.211 --> 01:14:25.660
<v Speaker 1>when we went bowhunting outside of Reno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1592
01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:29.650
<v Speaker 1>That's when I got to see the Nevada that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys know.</v>

1593
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thinks everybody thinks of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevada as Vegas.</v>

1594
01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Vegas and Barstow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1595
01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:40.000
<v Speaker 1>this like mule deer and elk and mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains.</v>

1596
01:14:40.001 --> 01:14:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's more independent mountain</v>

1597
01:14:41.681 --> 01:14:45.610
<v Speaker 1>ranges in Nevada than anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And more public land outside of Alaska</v>

1598
01:14:45.611 --> 01:14:48.370
<v Speaker 1>and there's more public land percentage</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise.</v>

1599
01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

1600
01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:51.790
<v Speaker 1>It's almost all public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1601
01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:55.960
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the reasons why I'm so</v>
<v Speaker 1>gung Ho for public lands.</v>

1602
01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a place where you never saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>a no trespassing sign.</v>

1603
01:14:59.051 --> 01:15:00.430
<v Speaker 1>You weren't told you you couldn't go</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>

1604
01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:02.800
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Anti Texas.</v>

1605
01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.900
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the Anti Texas.</v>

1606
01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all,</v>

1607
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:08.970
<v Speaker 1>it's all private.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So weird.</v>

1608
01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:13.030
<v Speaker 1>There's probably some public land where</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys hunting Texas,</v>

1609
01:15:13.031 --> 01:15:13.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was public,</v>

1610
01:15:13.901 --> 01:15:15.830
<v Speaker 1>but they sold it all off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they sell it all off?</v>

1611
01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:18.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the states got the land and they sold it</v>

1612
01:15:18.191 --> 01:15:20.020
<v Speaker 1>off to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>State hardly has any land.</v>

1613
01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:23.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the worry for places like Utah</v>
<v Speaker 1>and where they're shrinking their</v>

1614
01:15:23.951 --> 01:15:28.420
<v Speaker 1>monuments and they're starting to sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>off rights for drilling and mining and</v>

1615
01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:31.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are really concerned about this</v>

1616
01:15:31.091 --> 01:15:33.550
<v Speaker 1>administration and their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing with the</v>

1617
01:15:33.551 --> 01:15:35.680
<v Speaker 1>environmental protections because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1618
01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:37.840
<v Speaker 1>today trump signed some new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1619
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:41.080
<v Speaker 1>allowing for offshore drilling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pretty much fucking everywhere.</v>

1620
01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.690
<v Speaker 1>He just went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find that.</v>

1621
01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1622
01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:50.680
<v Speaker 1>it's rolling back all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental protections from the Obama</v>

1623
01:15:50.681 --> 01:15:53.080
<v Speaker 1>administration and his ideas like</v>
<v Speaker 1>economics.</v>

1624
01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Trumps trumps wrong word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Trump's environmental and then will we</v>
<v Speaker 1>really need is to just maximize our</v>

1626
01:15:59.591 --> 01:16:00.940
<v Speaker 1>ability to earn money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1627
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Trump moves to open nearly all offshore</v>
<v Speaker 1>waters to drilling nearly all offshore</v>

1628
01:16:08.051 --> 01:16:10.810
<v Speaker 1>waters to drilling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds so fucking crazy.</v>

1629
01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.090
<v Speaker 1>FTC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the BP oil spill,</v>

1630
01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:15.340
<v Speaker 1>like how many of those can we endure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1631
01:16:15.341 --> 01:16:16.174
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1632
01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:20.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of scary stuff when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to the environment because we only</v>

1633
01:16:20.561 --> 01:16:21.970
<v Speaker 1>get one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only one earth.</v>

1634
01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so interested in Mars,</v>

1635
01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:28.390
<v Speaker 1>like just figure out how to manage the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit we got.</v>

1636
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:29.703
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1637
01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:34.360
<v Speaker 1>he's all about business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird to see a super pro</v>

1638
01:16:34.361 --> 01:16:38.470
<v Speaker 1>business guy that's in the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite strange.</v>

1639
01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:39.660
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is quite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1640
01:16:39.730 --> 01:16:42.940
<v Speaker 1>it seems surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every couple of days I'll look at</v>

1641
01:16:42.941 --> 01:16:44.980
<v Speaker 1>the paper and it says president trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll go,</v>

1642
01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:48.350
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy is the president and that's why</v>

1643
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:51.730
<v Speaker 1>for what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just get to unplug for very long</v>

1644
01:16:51.731 --> 01:16:55.390
<v Speaker 1>periods of time just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not even the right way to go</v>

1645
01:16:55.391 --> 01:16:58.780
<v Speaker 1>about it sometimes because then there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that affect me and what I love</v>

1646
01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:01.360
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I get hit blindsided by it</v>

1647
01:17:01.361 --> 01:17:05.170
<v Speaker 1>because they don't know that I'm gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and out in the woods and enjoying what I</v>

1648
01:17:05.171 --> 01:17:07.050
<v Speaker 1>like and then I come home and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1649
01:17:07.051 --> 01:17:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Everything's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you have a hard time relating to</v>

1650
01:17:09.681 --> 01:17:13.290
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people your age that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience the things you experienced</v>

1651
01:17:13.291 --> 01:17:17.480
<v Speaker 1>because your life is so vastly different</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the average 33 year old guy?</v>

1652
01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:19.610
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think people.</v>

1653
01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:22.520
<v Speaker 2>I think people respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

1654
01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:24.260
<v Speaker 2>if you're really passionate about</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1655
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:27.590
<v Speaker 2>whether if you are passionate about</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that isn't even non hunting</v>

1656
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.730
<v Speaker 2>lease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1657
01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:30.230
<v Speaker 2>well I give you respect your passion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1658
01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.160
<v Speaker 1>You're doing your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of people get that</v>

1659
01:17:34.161 --> 01:17:35.810
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether they hunter don't hunt,</v>

1660
01:17:36.130 --> 01:17:38.540
<v Speaker 1>I can relate to anybody because</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's kind of passionate about</v>

1661
01:17:38.541 --> 01:17:41.300
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We use that group of people that have no</v>

1662
01:17:41.301 --> 01:17:42.810
<v Speaker 1>passion and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1663
01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:44.810
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't relate with them,</v>

1664
01:17:44.811 --> 01:17:47.690
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like they were raised wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody didn't come along,</v>

1665
01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.030
<v Speaker 1>introduce them to something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly something.</v>

1666
01:17:50.031 --> 01:17:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got their thing,</v>

1667
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:52.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1668
01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:54.920
<v Speaker 1>if your thing is whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>video game or whatever,</v>

1669
01:17:54.921 --> 01:17:56.540
<v Speaker 1>that's not my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're cool,</v>

1670
01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.760
<v Speaker 1>if you like it and you're passionate</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and I can tell that,</v>

1671
01:17:58.790 --> 01:18:01.730
<v Speaker 1>then we can have a conversation about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think that's cool when people</v>

1672
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:03.380
<v Speaker 1>are passionate about something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1673
01:18:03.381 --> 01:18:06.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's very infectious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watch people make furniture.</v>

1674
01:18:06.771 --> 01:18:09.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make furniture that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched people that are really into</v>

1675
01:18:09.201 --> 01:18:10.130
<v Speaker 1>furniture like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1676
01:18:10.131 --> 01:18:10.970
<v Speaker 1>that looks awesome.</v>

1677
01:18:11.010 --> 01:18:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Does something exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My instagram feed is like woodworking</v>

1678
01:18:15.531 --> 01:18:16.364
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1679
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:17.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1680
01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:20.240
<v Speaker 1>It's just like the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really passionate about where we're</v>

1681
01:18:20.241 --> 01:18:22.820
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool to see them build stuff.</v>

1682
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.430
<v Speaker 1>I into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked makers.</v>

1683
01:18:25.730 --> 01:18:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1684
01:18:26.571 --> 01:18:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Watching gorging orange blades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer them down.</v>

1685
01:18:29.721 --> 01:18:32.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just there's something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>tactile,</v>

1686
01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:36.790
<v Speaker 1>just actual physical things that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>making and changing it.</v>

1687
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:38.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1688
01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:41.180
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do it or whatever.</v>

1689
01:18:41.181 --> 01:18:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody can relate on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>level to to things that they're into or</v>

1690
01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:47.750
<v Speaker 1>their passions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure,</v>

1691
01:18:47.751 --> 01:18:51.710
<v Speaker 1>but what you've done is pretty unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said that about that show solo</v>

1692
01:18:51.711 --> 01:18:52.970
<v Speaker 1>hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking,</v>

1693
01:18:52.971 --> 01:18:53.930
<v Speaker 1>watching that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1694
01:18:53.931 --> 01:18:56.120
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy goes out there.</v>

1695
01:18:56.540 --> 01:19:00.830
<v Speaker 1>You're out there by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really have a lot to save.</v>

1696
01:19:00.831 --> 01:19:03.100
<v Speaker 1>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my thing is I.</v>

1697
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:08.660
<v Speaker 2>me and Steve are actually talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this on that a fog neck.</v>

1698
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:12.740
<v Speaker 2>It was before the bear attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just real shitty weather,</v>

1699
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:17.770
<v Speaker 2>hard hiking and I'm just loving it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you'll ever get sick of this.</v>

1700
01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:22.310
<v Speaker 2>You just want to go on on a ranch</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and drive around and not kill</v>

1701
01:19:22.311 --> 01:19:24.440
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a different.</v>

1702
01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:28.160
<v Speaker 2>That's my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I have two options,</v>

1703
01:19:28.161 --> 01:19:32.810
<v Speaker 2>option a is just this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go hunting in a place that there's very</v>

1704
01:19:32.811 --> 01:19:36.800
<v Speaker 2>few animals and you probably won't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>any success and it's just really shitty</v>

1705
01:19:36.801 --> 01:19:40.520
<v Speaker 2>weather and it's tough and big mountains</v>
<v Speaker 2>or there's this one where I'm guaranteed</v>

1706
01:19:40.521 --> 01:19:44.180
<v Speaker 2>that I'll get some big animal and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of encounters and I can just</v>

1707
01:19:44.181 --> 01:19:46.670
<v Speaker 2>drive around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to choose the really hard one</v>

1708
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:49.280
<v Speaker 2>and that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just how I am.</v>

1709
01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:51.470
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the,</v>

1710
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:55.580
<v Speaker 2>it's like a masochistic thing of I like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to struggle.</v>

1711
01:19:55.581 --> 01:19:58.100
<v Speaker 2>I like to hurt for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I'm going to kill an animal,</v>

1712
01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:02.480
<v Speaker 2>I want to have had some kind of struggle</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I feel like I've earned some</v>

1713
01:20:02.481 --> 01:20:04.400
<v Speaker 2>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I dunno,</v>

1714
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:06.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like my payment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to work for it.</v>

1715
01:20:06.591 --> 01:20:09.660
<v Speaker 2>It's my payment to the animal's life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird.</v>

1716
01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:11.760
<v Speaker 2>So it's just my thing.</v>

1717
01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.670
<v Speaker 5>Don't you feel like also it's because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've had so much success.</v>

1718
01:20:14.671 --> 01:20:18.600
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you're hurting for meat</v>
<v Speaker 5>desperado meat hunt.</v>

1719
01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that's part of it</v>

1720
01:20:20.530 --> 01:20:23.080
<v Speaker 2>because sometimes I might go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if something's too easy,</v>

1721
01:20:23.081 --> 01:20:24.820
<v Speaker 2>if I go somewhere and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

1722
01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:28.330
<v Speaker 2>this is too easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'll look for an animal that might</v>

1723
01:20:28.331 --> 01:20:33.331
<v Speaker 2>be bigger or harder to find or a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>one just to give myself some kind of</v>

1724
01:20:33.521 --> 01:20:37.540
<v Speaker 2>challenge and that was part of the thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>of filming myself while hunting and</v>

1725
01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:40.450
<v Speaker 2>going out there is that added challenge</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being alone.</v>

1726
01:20:40.451 --> 01:20:44.590
<v Speaker 2>The added challenge of filming myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those challenges just to,</v>

1727
01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:48.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create that experience of the struggle</v>

1728
01:20:48.791 --> 01:20:49.720
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1729
01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:52.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like I crave that struggle a lot as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1730
01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:54.500
<v Speaker 2>So weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So weird thing.</v>

1731
01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:56.750
<v Speaker 2>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think a lot of people do that and</v>

1732
01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:57.450
<v Speaker 2>different stuff.</v>

1733
01:20:57.450 --> 01:20:59.190
<v Speaker 5>It's like exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I,</v>

1734
01:20:59.191 --> 01:21:03.990
<v Speaker 5>I firmly believe that a person who</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't struggle with anything is going</v>

1735
01:21:03.991 --> 01:21:07.110
<v Speaker 5>to be a miserable person because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>think you're really going to truly</v>

1736
01:21:07.111 --> 01:21:10.590
<v Speaker 5>appreciate relaxation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't appreciate relaxation unless I</v>

1737
01:21:10.591 --> 01:21:13.140
<v Speaker 5>work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I worked like if I come home from the</v>

1738
01:21:13.141 --> 01:21:14.760
<v Speaker 5>gym,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I worked out hard.</v>

1739
01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:17.220
<v Speaker 5>I worked all day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>worked out hard,</v>

1740
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:20.790
<v Speaker 5>come home from the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking exhausted and I can put my</v>

1741
01:21:20.791 --> 01:21:23.430
<v Speaker 5>feet up on the couch and I can enjoy TV</v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

1742
01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:26.220
<v Speaker 5>I can really enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the only times I can because</v>

1743
01:21:26.221 --> 01:21:28.830
<v Speaker 5>if I wake up in the morning and I eat</v>
<v Speaker 5>breakfast and I turned on the TV,</v>

1744
01:21:28.831 --> 01:21:30.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why the fuck you watching TV?</v>

1745
01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:33.270
<v Speaker 5>Shut that shit off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll get something done if I've</v>

1746
01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:36.510
<v Speaker 5>already done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this is the reason why people</v>

1747
01:21:36.511 --> 01:21:41.460
<v Speaker 5>like working out hard is because your</v>
<v Speaker 5>body desires struggle and I think that's</v>

1748
01:21:41.461 --> 01:21:45.090
<v Speaker 5>the way human beings evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we evolved to have a certain</v>

1749
01:21:45.091 --> 01:21:49.410
<v Speaker 5>amount of our reward system geared</v>
<v Speaker 5>towards us accomplishing difficult</v>

1750
01:21:49.411 --> 01:21:51.330
<v Speaker 5>things because that's how people</v>
<v Speaker 5>survived.</v>

1751
01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot to that.</v>

1752
01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:56.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an accomplishment feeling that you</v>

1753
01:21:56.441 --> 01:21:58.810
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of releases those endorphins.</v>

1754
01:21:58.811 --> 01:21:59.980
<v Speaker 2>You okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel good about.</v>

1755
01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:05.080
<v Speaker 2>And you really see the real hard times</v>
<v Speaker 2>really make you appreciate the easy</v>

1756
01:22:05.081 --> 01:22:06.610
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just all easy.</v>

1757
01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:09.760
<v Speaker 2>You just get stagnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a rich kid,</v>

1758
01:22:09.761 --> 01:22:14.530
<v Speaker 2>not be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Born with silver spoons and you go,</v>

1759
01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:16.860
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

1760
01:22:17.050 --> 01:22:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't just keep buying.</v>

1761
01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:19.361
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1762
01:22:19.361 --> 01:22:20.050
<v Speaker 2>you need.</v>

1763
01:22:20.050 --> 01:22:23.020
<v Speaker 5>You need some sort of struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I just,</v>

1764
01:22:23.021 --> 01:22:25.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's been mapped out.</v>

1765
01:22:25.901 --> 01:22:28.990
<v Speaker 5>If people understand like you need x</v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of struggle to have this amount</v>

1766
01:22:28.991 --> 01:22:29.990
<v Speaker 5>of happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a really,</v>

1767
01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:31.600
<v Speaker 5>most people just think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1768
01:22:31.601 --> 01:22:33.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just get a job and do your thing and</v>

1769
01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.920
<v Speaker 5>you'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll be happy and if you're not,</v>

1770
01:22:35.921 --> 01:22:36.820
<v Speaker 5>you take paxil.</v>

1771
01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people's goal plans</v>

1772
01:22:40.041 --> 01:22:42.080
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They try to find the way around that</v>

1773
01:22:42.081 --> 01:22:44.050
<v Speaker 2>struggle part and I kind of seek out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

1774
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:47.670
<v Speaker 5>or just a different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your experiences have taught you that</v>

1775
01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:50.910
<v Speaker 5>that struggle is where the happiness</v>
<v Speaker 5>comes from and most people are.</v>

1776
01:22:51.330 --> 01:22:53.500
<v Speaker 5>They think that the happiness is</v>
<v Speaker 5>avoiding the struggle.</v>

1777
01:22:53.530 --> 01:22:55.690
<v Speaker 5>It's a real cat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a trick.</v>

1778
01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:59.140
<v Speaker 5>It's like that feeling that your body</v>
<v Speaker 5>gives you.</v>

1779
01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:00.340
<v Speaker 5>Like when you don't want to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>gym,</v>

1780
01:23:00.341 --> 01:23:01.000
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1781
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:01.870
<v Speaker 5>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't go.</v>

1782
01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:04.780
<v Speaker 5>But if you push through that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then afterwards,</v>

1783
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:07.090
<v Speaker 5>like I fucking did this time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1784
01:23:07.091 --> 01:23:09.790
<v Speaker 5>I've now I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then also you see the results in</v>

1785
01:23:09.791 --> 01:23:12.340
<v Speaker 5>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if you just give in to that I'm</v>

1786
01:23:12.341 --> 01:23:15.260
<v Speaker 5>lazy thing all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you just have this dumpy doughy</v>

1787
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:16.143
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>

1788
01:23:16.190 --> 01:23:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Then you feel like shit when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>naked.</v>

1789
01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:20.780
<v Speaker 2>A lot of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1790
01:23:20.781 --> 01:23:23.300
<v Speaker 2>You're your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still doing yoga.</v>

1791
01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:26.570
<v Speaker 2>I had not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not like I should because my back's all</v>

1792
01:23:26.571 --> 01:23:28.940
<v Speaker 2>jacked up now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think probably from not doing it,</v>

1793
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:31.960
<v Speaker 2>I need to get back into doing it for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>

1794
01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:32.451
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

1795
01:23:32.451 --> 01:23:33.284
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I actually,</v>

1796
01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:37.130
<v Speaker 2>I actually never felt better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the,</v>

1797
01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean since I was probably 18 years old</v>

1798
01:23:40.821 --> 01:23:44.620
<v Speaker 2>for most my most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my year was in,</v>

1799
01:23:44.710 --> 01:23:48.650
<v Speaker 2>was guiding hunters and that involved</v>
<v Speaker 2>packing out animals.</v>

1800
01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:50.300
<v Speaker 2>So if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1801
01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:53.390
<v Speaker 2>I probably should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm one day I'll sit down and try to</v>

1802
01:23:53.391 --> 01:23:55.760
<v Speaker 2>figure out how many animals I've carried</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1803
01:23:55.761 --> 01:23:59.090
<v Speaker 2>like heavy packs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred pound pack probably in.</v>

1804
01:23:59.630 --> 01:24:01.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even want to guess.</v>

1805
01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:06.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot more than probably most</v>
<v Speaker 2>people a strong back from that,</v>

1806
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:08.570
<v Speaker 2>but it's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1807
01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:09.680
<v Speaker 2>it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1808
01:24:09.681 --> 01:24:13.250
<v Speaker 2>it's just very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now it's only been</v>

1809
01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:19.400
<v Speaker 2>17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 years of really doing all the time.</v>

1810
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:21.680
<v Speaker 2>You just start feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1811
01:24:21.681 --> 01:24:25.280
<v Speaker 2>the back end here and oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think when I was doing the yoga</v>

1812
01:24:25.281 --> 01:24:27.890
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get those pains a little bit</v>

1813
01:24:27.891 --> 01:24:28.790
<v Speaker 2>more flexible.</v>

1814
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:30.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The decompression,</v>

1815
01:24:30.270 --> 01:24:34.110
<v Speaker 5>that's a big part of what yoga is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yoga makes you move your body in a way</v>

1816
01:24:34.111 --> 01:24:36.130
<v Speaker 5>that's almost the opposite of carrying</v>
<v Speaker 5>weight</v>

1817
01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:37.230
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1818
01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:38.950
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1819
01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.970
<v Speaker 2>you just got so much weighted down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much compression.</v>

1820
01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the toddler Jujitsu people have turned</v>

1821
01:24:44.281 --> 01:24:45.100
<v Speaker 2>to yoga now.</v>

1822
01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:47.150
<v Speaker 5>The to realize that they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1823
01:24:47.151 --> 01:24:49.670
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of guys that for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>longest time me included,</v>

1824
01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:53.060
<v Speaker 5>what we did was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like working out with weights,</v>

1825
01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:55.460
<v Speaker 5>maybe kettle bells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like heavy,</v>

1826
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:57.770
<v Speaker 5>heavy explosive stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>box jumps,</v>

1827
01:24:57.771 --> 01:24:59.360
<v Speaker 5>things on those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then Jujitsu.</v>

1828
01:24:59.630 --> 01:25:02.990
<v Speaker 5>So the idea was that the working out</v>
<v Speaker 5>with weights would prepare you for the</v>

1829
01:25:02.991 --> 01:25:05.180
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then everybody gets injured.</v>

1830
01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:10.100
<v Speaker 5>But a lot of guys have turned now</v>
<v Speaker 5>towards yoga in Jujitsu because there's</v>

1831
01:25:10.101 --> 01:25:15.101
<v Speaker 5>something about the rugged smashing and</v>
<v Speaker 5>crushing and pulling and Yanking of g of</v>

1832
01:25:15.321 --> 01:25:20.321
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu that it's complemented by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>stretching and elongating and holding</v>

1833
01:25:21.201 --> 01:25:25.580
<v Speaker 5>static positions and completely</v>
<v Speaker 5>non-explosive actions of Yoga.</v>

1834
01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:28.640
<v Speaker 2>I think there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actually talking with one of my</v>

1835
01:25:28.641 --> 01:25:30.170
<v Speaker 2>good buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David Wise,</v>

1836
01:25:30.171 --> 01:25:34.480
<v Speaker 2>he's actually a Olympic gold medalist</v>
<v Speaker 2>for halfpipe freeskiing.</v>

1837
01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's just like the top of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>game for what is happening.</v>

1838
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.520
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he does the halfpipe like said it'd</v>

1839
01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:43.700
<v Speaker 2>be like half a water bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cut Pipe.</v>

1840
01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Does it tricks in it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Skis.</v>

1841
01:25:46.770 --> 01:25:49.850
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda like what Shaun white does on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a snowboard or skis,</v>

1842
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:55.390
<v Speaker 2>but we were talking about exercise that</v>
<v Speaker 2>controls those little muscles for</v>

1843
01:25:56.361 --> 01:25:58.870
<v Speaker 2>balance because he's big into hunting</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1844
01:25:59.370 --> 01:26:02.030
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's when you're moving through the</v>

1845
01:26:02.031 --> 01:26:03.740
<v Speaker 2>mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got that heavy on.</v>

1846
01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when you see an animal it</v>
<v Speaker 2>means the difference between you getting</v>

1847
01:26:07.101 --> 01:26:09.140
<v Speaker 2>it not is it the speed that you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1848
01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:12.530
<v Speaker 2>So you just have to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ability,</v>

1849
01:26:12.531 --> 01:26:15.260
<v Speaker 2>that agility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you set your foot on something,</v>

1850
01:26:15.261 --> 01:26:16.660
<v Speaker 2>know that that's that word.</v>

1851
01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:18.310
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's going to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1852
01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:21.980
<v Speaker 2>And you don't get off balance because a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the stuff I hunts mountain type</v>

1853
01:26:21.981 --> 01:26:26.981
<v Speaker 2>stuff cliffs and especially in Alaska</v>
<v Speaker 2>and New Zealand.</v>

1854
01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Other stuff is dangerous country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People die in that.</v>

1855
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:32.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cams friend died in an area that I was</v>

1856
01:26:32.991 --> 01:26:35.270
<v Speaker 2>hunting that same year for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for dall sheep,</v>

1857
01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:37.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's just like,</v>

1858
01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:38.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a guy that does it all the</v>

1859
01:26:38.841 --> 01:26:42.680
<v Speaker 2>time like you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very important to have that</v>

1860
01:26:42.681 --> 01:26:44.150
<v Speaker 2>balance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that balance,</v>

1861
01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:49.200
<v Speaker 2>those muscles that you can't lift for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the weird being able to stand on</v>

1862
01:26:49.221 --> 01:26:53.980
<v Speaker 2>one leg and move around in every</v>
<v Speaker 2>direction because especially when you've</v>

1863
01:26:53.981 --> 01:26:56.060
<v Speaker 2>got weight on your back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>packing something out,</v>

1864
01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:59.960
<v Speaker 2>that kind of weird agility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strength training and those guys that do</v>

1865
01:26:59.961 --> 01:27:03.020
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of sports like skiing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>snowboarding and all that,</v>

1866
01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:06.260
<v Speaker 2>and they're like cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can not tip them over.</v>

1867
01:27:06.650 --> 01:27:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be like that.</v>

1868
01:27:07.971 --> 01:27:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Like even Shane Dorian and I guy when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>walks in the mountains,</v>

1869
01:27:11.541 --> 01:27:12.500
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>

1870
01:27:12.501 --> 01:27:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Like his balance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so centered.</v>

1871
01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:17.540
<v Speaker 2>It makes him quiet and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cool.</v>

1872
01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:19.310
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from all the surfing.</v>

1873
01:27:19.311 --> 01:27:20.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1874
01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:22.300
<v Speaker 3>do you ever do a Kettlebell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Windmills?</v>

1875
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:24.110
<v Speaker 3>That's a great one for that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1876
01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.890
<v Speaker 3>I've done that a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something about holding that overhead</v>

1877
01:27:27.891 --> 01:27:30.560
<v Speaker 3>and then bending all your body down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>touching the floor,</v>

1878
01:27:30.561 --> 01:27:35.420
<v Speaker 3>and then extending backup it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It put strength into the core or weird</v>

1879
01:27:35.421 --> 01:27:37.190
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you can do it with heavy</v>

1880
01:27:37.191 --> 01:27:40.720
<v Speaker 3>weights like you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a church Turkish get up.</v>

1881
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:43.540
<v Speaker 3>That's what I've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Turkish get up there,</v>

1882
01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:45.590
<v Speaker 3>so there's so non-glamorous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

1883
01:27:45.591 --> 01:27:48.380
<v Speaker 3>Everybody else do curls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>press and stuff and get jacked,</v>

1884
01:27:48.381 --> 01:27:52.520
<v Speaker 3>but for functional strength is very few</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are as good as a Turkish</v>

1885
01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:54.530
<v Speaker 3>getup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about pressing that</v>

1886
01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:58.130
<v Speaker 3>weight on your back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting up to your knees,</v>

1887
01:27:58.610 --> 01:28:00.920
<v Speaker 3>anchoring your body up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing all the way up,</v>

1888
01:28:00.921 --> 01:28:02.750
<v Speaker 3>and then lowering yourself all the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>back down again.</v>

1889
01:28:02.751 --> 01:28:05.720
<v Speaker 3>It's just phenomenal for all these weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscles.</v>

1890
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:09.550
<v Speaker 3>Your back and your neck and shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 3>stability and all these gifts that</v>

1891
01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:10.810
<v Speaker 3>people ignore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1892
01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:11.750
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1893
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:13.970
<v Speaker 2>In the off season I'll try to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See I'm.</v>

1894
01:28:14.010 --> 01:28:17.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm out there a lot with the pack on all</v>
<v Speaker 2>day long,</v>

1895
01:28:17.331 --> 01:28:22.331
<v Speaker 2>so for me I'd have to find something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not that right to get more</v>

1896
01:28:23.031 --> 01:28:25.220
<v Speaker 2>benefit and I think that that's why the</v>
<v Speaker 2>yoga thing,</v>

1897
01:28:25.221 --> 01:28:28.970
<v Speaker 2>because if I go for to work out and put</v>
<v Speaker 2>a heavy pack on and go for a hike,</v>

1898
01:28:28.971 --> 01:28:32.030
<v Speaker 2>well for work I do that for 12 hours a</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

1899
01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:35.240
<v Speaker 2>So like the one hour I go do it when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>not working.</v>

1900
01:28:35.241 --> 01:28:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Isn't gonna do much for me.</v>

1901
01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:40.540
<v Speaker 3>Your back must be like really fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>strong for you think about 17,</v>

1902
01:28:40.541 --> 01:28:42.170
<v Speaker 3>18 years of doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1903
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:45.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean your back must be ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1904
01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:46.020
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1905
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:47.590
<v Speaker 3>you aren't carrying a heavy pack every</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

1906
01:28:47.591 --> 01:28:49.870
<v Speaker 3>but there's been a substantial number</v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

1907
01:28:49.930 --> 01:28:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're doing it once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1908
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:52.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely.</v>

1909
01:28:52.421 --> 01:28:54.670
<v Speaker 3>It would probably help you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you get strong.</v>

1910
01:28:54.730 --> 01:28:56.380
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing it everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably break you down.</v>

1911
01:28:56.381 --> 01:28:58.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But doing it once a week,</v>

1912
01:28:58.331 --> 01:29:01.090
<v Speaker 3>that gives your body a chance to break</v>
<v Speaker 3>down and then slowly recover.</v>

1913
01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:03.840
<v Speaker 3>Most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm that guy that's like 55 years old</v>

1914
01:29:03.841 --> 01:29:07.170
<v Speaker 3>and can't walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that outdoorsmen</v>

1915
01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:10.710
<v Speaker 3>trainer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thing's amazing.</v>

1916
01:29:10.711 --> 01:29:11.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>

1917
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:14.610
<v Speaker 3>I love hiking with that thing on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it keeps the.</v>

1918
01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.790
<v Speaker 2>It keeps the weight real centered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't actually used that.</v>

1919
01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:21.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because the time it takes to take</v>

1920
01:29:21.331 --> 01:29:22.520
<v Speaker 2>my bag off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only got it</v>

1921
01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:24.580
<v Speaker 3>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I haven't actually used it,</v>

1922
01:29:24.581 --> 01:29:25.660
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make sense.</v>

1923
01:29:25.661 --> 01:29:26.800
<v Speaker 3>It looks pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1924
01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:29.650
<v Speaker 3>it's very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of athletes are using that</v>

1925
01:29:29.651 --> 01:29:30.700
<v Speaker 3>now to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1926
01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:34.690
<v Speaker 3>they like it better than weight vests</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just sits on your body better,</v>

1927
01:29:34.990 --> 01:29:36.130
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>

1928
01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's uh,</v>

1929
01:29:37.870 --> 01:29:40.660
<v Speaker 3>for a person who lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if you live in the Midwest,</v>

1930
01:29:40.661 --> 01:29:43.840
<v Speaker 3>like say if you live in Kansas where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all flat and you want to prepare</v>

1931
01:29:43.841 --> 01:29:46.120
<v Speaker 3>for an elk hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do?</v>

1932
01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:46.541
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1933
01:29:46.541 --> 01:29:50.350
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess box steps with like a weighted</v>

1934
01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:51.940
<v Speaker 3>pack over and over and over again.</v>

1935
01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:56.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get asked that question a lot and I</v>

1936
01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:59.530
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I start,</v>

1937
01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:03.070
<v Speaker 2>when I say late teens or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>

1938
01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:07.330
<v Speaker 2>I'd see elk and then just trying to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to get that endurance where I never</v>

1939
01:30:07.331 --> 01:30:12.331
<v Speaker 2>had to stop and what I would do is I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would go out and I would do something</v>

1940
01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:16.810
<v Speaker 2>that was prolonged to where the point</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I had to stop,</v>

1941
01:30:16.930 --> 01:30:19.290
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would switch the way that I did.</v>

1942
01:30:19.450 --> 01:30:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So say I pick them out or stairs or</v>

1943
01:30:21.911 --> 01:30:24.700
<v Speaker 2>whatever and you can run and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>point that you'd have to,</v>

1944
01:30:24.850 --> 01:30:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I turn around and start walking</v>

1945
01:30:27.071 --> 01:30:31.060
<v Speaker 2>backwards and then I would turn to start</v>
<v Speaker 2>sidestepping and I would refuse to stop.</v>

1946
01:30:31.061 --> 01:30:35.410
<v Speaker 2>So I'd pick a point that I knew I</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't or almost couldn't get to if I</v>

1947
01:30:35.411 --> 01:30:38.260
<v Speaker 2>walked up a mountain one day and thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to stop now.</v>

1948
01:30:38.261 --> 01:30:41.130
<v Speaker 2>At that point where I had to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just switch the type of muscle</v>

1949
01:30:41.131 --> 01:30:43.480
<v Speaker 2>and movement that I would do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>

1950
01:30:43.481 --> 01:30:46.240
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're some kind of workout,</v>

1951
01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:51.720
<v Speaker 2>whatever that workout is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some kind of say stairs or</v>

1952
01:30:52.241 --> 01:30:55.030
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're running stairs and you go</v>

1953
01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:59.260
<v Speaker 2>until your body's like absolutely I</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot go anymore.</v>

1954
01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:02.470
<v Speaker 2>But keep moving in just a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle group</v>

1955
01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:05.110
<v Speaker 3>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I do,</v>

1956
01:31:05.111 --> 01:31:06.700
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I'm,</v>

1957
01:31:06.770 --> 01:31:09.790
<v Speaker 3>if I'm doing like kickboxing on a heavy</v>
<v Speaker 3>bag and I'm exhausted,</v>

1958
01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:12.190
<v Speaker 3>like say if I'm throwing punches and</v>
<v Speaker 3>roundhouse kicks,</v>

1959
01:31:12.191 --> 01:31:15.610
<v Speaker 3>I get so exhausted I'm almost done and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>know there's still a minute left to the</v>

1960
01:31:15.611 --> 01:31:17.860
<v Speaker 3>Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'll switch to front kicks and</v>

1961
01:31:17.861 --> 01:31:20.010
<v Speaker 3>weirdly enough I have energy to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1962
01:31:20.170 --> 01:31:22.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like I almost can't kick the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been kicking butt.</v>

1963
01:31:22.961 --> 01:31:24.220
<v Speaker 3>I can kick otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1964
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:27.820
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird way that I started just</v>
<v Speaker 3>building endurance to the point where</v>

1965
01:31:27.821 --> 01:31:30.850
<v Speaker 3>then I never had to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're a guy lives in a flat</v>

1966
01:31:30.851 --> 01:31:32.320
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd.</v>

1967
01:31:32.321 --> 01:31:33.090
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1968
01:31:33.090 --> 01:31:34.300
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1969
01:31:34.330 --> 01:31:38.080
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to get like I've seen guys on</v>
<v Speaker 3>those stair machines where it's a</v>

1970
01:31:38.081 --> 01:31:41.110
<v Speaker 3>rotating stairs and they have a backpack</v>
<v Speaker 3>on like a heavy backpack.</v>

1971
01:31:41.111 --> 01:31:42.700
<v Speaker 3>I think that'd be the way to do it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then not.</v>

1972
01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:45.040
<v Speaker 3>And then try to go for like five or six</v>
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>

1973
01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.390
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody's going to do that.</v>

1974
01:31:49.391 --> 01:31:50.740
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>

1975
01:31:50.741 --> 01:31:52.330
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you no one's ever prepared.</v>

1976
01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:53.343
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the thing is,</v>

1977
01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:54.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to say it,</v>

1978
01:31:54.561 --> 01:31:57.050
<v Speaker 2>but how do you prepare it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you just have to do it?</v>

1979
01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:02.080
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't actually go into a go into a</v>

1980
01:32:02.381 --> 01:32:05.890
<v Speaker 2>gym and think that you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to carry a heavy pack for days at a</v>

1981
01:32:05.891 --> 01:32:06.780
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1982
01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:11.200
<v Speaker 2>there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for what I do at a hiking speed,</v>

1983
01:32:11.201 --> 01:32:13.000
<v Speaker 2>carrying a pack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really good at that.</v>

1984
01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:16.900
<v Speaker 2>But this year we went in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wanted to go in to the spa was a</v>

1985
01:32:16.901 --> 01:32:21.901
<v Speaker 2>little bit further and I got on a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got smoked my 65 years old.</v>

1986
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:25.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean he rides a bike all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't write them.</v>

1987
01:32:25.061 --> 01:32:27.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if I knew how to ride</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bike when I got on it,</v>

1988
01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:31.570
<v Speaker 2>but it kicked my ass so it was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1989
01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:32.973
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1990
01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:35.170
<v Speaker 2>all the hiking every day with the pack.</v>

1991
01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:36.310
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

1992
01:32:36.311 --> 01:32:39.190
<v Speaker 2>this will be no problem and I get on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bike and get my ass kicked.</v>

1993
01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:41.050
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot,</v>

1994
01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:45.570
<v Speaker 2>you have to do to do in a certain level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's certain things I could.</v>

1995
01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:47.440
<v Speaker 2>You could probably do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>

1996
01:32:47.670 --> 01:32:49.500
<v Speaker 2>I could pedal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1997
01:32:49.501 --> 01:32:52.600
<v Speaker 2>and a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'd be like on a stationary</v>

1998
01:32:52.601 --> 01:32:56.540
<v Speaker 2>bike everyday and then you'd have more</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle memory for that type of action.</v>

1999
01:32:56.541 --> 01:32:59.560
<v Speaker 2>So if you did the stare thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably the closest you</v>

2000
01:32:59.561 --> 01:33:01.480
<v Speaker 2>could get to get that muscle memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2001
01:33:01.481 --> 01:33:02.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be a stair thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2002
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Or finding actual stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actual stairs,</v>

2003
01:33:05.891 --> 01:33:07.390
<v Speaker 2>running up flights of stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2004
01:33:07.391 --> 01:33:09.550
<v Speaker 2>There's a good place out here in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Calabasas</v>

2005
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:13.860
<v Speaker 3>that has several.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a up the side of this hill,</v>

2006
01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:14.821
<v Speaker 3>like many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

2007
01:33:14.821 --> 01:33:16.770
<v Speaker 3>many stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably like a quarter mile all</v>

2008
01:33:16.771 --> 01:33:19.850
<v Speaker 3>the way to the top and I'll run it up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go down and run it up and go down.</v>

2009
01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>

2010
01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:25.820
<v Speaker 2>People in the midwest where it's flat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd open up gyms like rent stairwells,</v>

2011
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.730
<v Speaker 2>you just have packs at the bottom and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get a membership and you can just</v>

2012
01:33:28.731 --> 01:33:31.910
<v Speaker 2>go up the stairs as many times as they</v>
<v Speaker 2>want up and downstairs.</v>

2013
01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:34.350
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how just carrying your body</v>

2014
01:33:34.410 --> 01:33:38.520
<v Speaker 3>uphills is so difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't to a person who never</v>

2015
01:33:38.521 --> 01:33:39.150
<v Speaker 3>does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2016
01:33:39.150 --> 01:33:39.983
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're hiking,</v>

2017
01:33:40.290 --> 01:33:41.071
<v Speaker 3>walking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2018
01:33:41.071 --> 01:33:41.904
<v Speaker 3>You're walking outside.</v>

2019
01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:44.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way harder.</v>

2020
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.400
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't seem like it should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2021
01:33:47.730 --> 01:33:49.710
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every ounce of weight on your body or</v>

2022
01:33:49.711 --> 01:33:51.330
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she even your shoes.</v>

2023
01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:54.120
<v Speaker 2>People buy these real heavy</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountaineering boots because like those</v>

2024
01:33:54.121 --> 01:33:55.560
<v Speaker 2>are the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they never wear them in a</v>

2025
01:33:55.561 --> 01:33:57.540
<v Speaker 2>mountain and then they try to go up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain.</v>

2026
01:33:57.541 --> 01:33:59.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did they say?</v>

2027
01:33:59.371 --> 01:34:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Every pound on your foot's like eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds on your back and get a pair of</v>

2028
01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.310
<v Speaker 2>five pound boots and it's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>

2029
01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:07.710
<v Speaker 2>but you do need some sort of stability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2030
01:34:07.711 --> 01:34:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean the reason why those boots</v>
<v Speaker 2>exists,</v>

2031
01:34:09.121 --> 01:34:10.560
<v Speaker 2>like if you were going to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alps,</v>

2032
01:34:10.730 --> 01:34:12.210
<v Speaker 2>you need that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

2033
01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to actually walk different</v>

2034
01:34:13.951 --> 01:34:15.390
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people don't realize that.</v>

2035
01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:17.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more of a rocking step.</v>

2036
01:34:17.371 --> 01:34:18.510
<v Speaker 2>And then a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2037
01:34:19.530 --> 01:34:22.320
<v Speaker 2>almost like ski boots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ski cubits and you've got to walk on</v>

2038
01:34:22.321 --> 01:34:24.780
<v Speaker 2>your lot of people don't walk on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>toes.</v>

2039
01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2040
01:34:27.471 --> 01:34:31.460
<v Speaker 3>it's modern shoes will have started</v>
<v Speaker 3>going heel to toe,</v>

2041
01:34:31.461 --> 01:34:34.670
<v Speaker 3>heel to toe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humans are supposed to go ball the foot</v>

2042
01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:37.160
<v Speaker 3>down to the heel ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's how we're supposed to run.</v>

2043
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:40.400
<v Speaker 3>So we're supposed to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But modern shoes that particularly ones</v>

2044
01:34:40.401 --> 01:34:43.010
<v Speaker 3>with heels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just accentuate that heel to toe</v>

2045
01:34:43.190 --> 01:34:44.390
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is real weird.</v>

2046
01:34:44.391 --> 01:34:44.670
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>

2047
01:34:44.670 --> 01:34:45.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

2048
01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:50.660
<v Speaker 2>Well if you'd like people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid I learned to walk with</v>

2049
01:34:51.650 --> 01:34:54.360
<v Speaker 2>the pads of my fingers just quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right around.</v>

2050
01:34:54.630 --> 01:34:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2051
01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:57.540
<v Speaker 2>do you stalk animals with socks on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do still do that?</v>

2052
01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 2>Socks</v>

2053
01:34:58.130 --> 01:34:59.330
<v Speaker 1>or barefoot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly,</v>

2054
01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:01.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just depends.</v>

2055
01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever tried those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like five finger shoes?</v>

2056
01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Those Viv says before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2057
01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I've got pretty tough feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's nothing to just take my socks</v>

2058
01:35:10.521 --> 01:35:13.370
<v Speaker 1>off shoes and just walk my socks and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>real quiet.</v>

2059
01:35:13.450 --> 01:35:15.230
<v Speaker 1>It would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in like a rocky area,</v>

2060
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:16.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll still do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2061
01:35:16.551 --> 01:35:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like were you were hunting in Nevada?</v>

2062
01:35:18.741 --> 01:35:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the idea that barefoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>with socks.</v>

2063
01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go a couple miles and that stuff.</v>

2064
01:35:25.130 --> 01:35:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just.</v>

2065
01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:27.410
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get used to it.</v>

2066
01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:30.350
<v Speaker 1>You never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a weird because I always</v>

2067
01:35:30.351 --> 01:35:30.831
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2068
01:35:30.831 --> 01:35:34.460
<v Speaker 1>your feet get tough that your feet</v>
<v Speaker 1>really don't get any tougher.</v>

2069
01:35:34.461 --> 01:35:37.870
<v Speaker 1>You just get used to the sensation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your feet hurting you.</v>

2070
01:35:37.871 --> 01:35:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2071
01:35:38.961 --> 01:35:40.520
<v Speaker 1>they do get tough if you go as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2072
01:35:40.521 --> 01:35:43.400
<v Speaker 1>You ever see that dual survivor guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the guys name?</v>

2073
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Corey something or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the most disgusting feet ever.</v>

2074
01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just walked everywhere barefoot.</v>

2075
01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would go to the forest.</v>

2076
01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:54.110
<v Speaker 1>They would do these survivor shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like there was a series of shows</v>

2077
01:35:54.111 --> 01:35:57.920
<v Speaker 1>after survivor man came out that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>ripping off survivor man in a way,</v>

2078
01:35:58.670 --> 01:36:01.760
<v Speaker 1>and this was one of the weird ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>called dual survivor.</v>

2079
01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:03.360
<v Speaker 1>It was hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody something.</v>

2080
01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.520
<v Speaker 1>It was like so staged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2081
01:36:04.521 --> 01:36:07.550
<v Speaker 1>what do you think we should do that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to make a bone marrow?</v>

2082
01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:10.760
<v Speaker 1>And they'd be wandering through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forest and you see this guy's fucking</v>

2083
01:36:10.761 --> 01:36:12.390
<v Speaker 1>disgusting feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

2084
01:36:13.650 --> 01:36:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's barely a human foot.</v>

2085
01:36:15.650 --> 01:36:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that in that case,</v>

2086
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:19.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I take that back.</v>

2087
01:36:19.191 --> 01:36:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Your feet do get tough for you build</v>
<v Speaker 1>calluses,</v>

2088
01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:24.110
<v Speaker 1>but you can get a rock right in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>arch area.</v>

2089
01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:27.250
<v Speaker 1>I'll still hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom of the hill,</v>

2090
01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:28.620
<v Speaker 1>we're just there.</v>

2091
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:32.420
<v Speaker 1>They're dark like a soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It literally looks like he's got</v>

2092
01:36:32.421 --> 01:36:36.320
<v Speaker 1>something on his feet because I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take pride in my foot calluses.</v>

2093
01:36:36.321 --> 01:36:37.850
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I ever lost them,</v>

2094
01:36:37.851 --> 01:36:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'd start getting blisters</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fewer deal.</v>

2095
01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's next level.</v>

2096
01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some people that go to the</v>

2097
01:36:45.681 --> 01:36:48.560
<v Speaker 1>woods and they go hiking and they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2098
01:36:48.570 --> 01:36:52.970
<v Speaker 1>they're not prepared for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they give these horrible like areas</v>

2099
01:36:52.971 --> 01:36:55.310
<v Speaker 1>of their foot where their skin gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubbed off,</v>

2100
01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.990
<v Speaker 1>rubbed raw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the back,</v>

2101
01:36:56.991 --> 01:36:59.570
<v Speaker 1>like the heel area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I first started guiding,</v>

2102
01:36:59.571 --> 01:37:04.040
<v Speaker 1>this guy was from Pennsylvania and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2103
01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:06.140
<v Speaker 1>he just kept pushing himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just cool.</v>

2104
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:09.180
<v Speaker 1>He kept hiking and I always tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2105
01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:11.540
<v Speaker 1>if something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're aren't going to keep up</v>

2106
01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:15.590
<v Speaker 1>you just because you aren't used to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just stop and I'll stop this,</v>

2107
01:37:15.591 --> 01:37:16.424
<v Speaker 1>that and the other thing.</v>

2108
01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:17.930
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anything is wrong,</v>

2109
01:37:17.931 --> 01:37:19.760
<v Speaker 1>let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started to get a blister,</v>

2110
01:37:19.761 --> 01:37:23.120
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't say anything and his foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>started getting rubbed down.</v>

2111
01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Why would he just had him duck tape it</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2112
01:37:25.650 --> 01:37:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Ended up getting gang green.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2113
01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just from his foot getting rubbed inside</v>

2114
01:37:31.041 --> 01:37:32.750
<v Speaker 1>of his shoe and then just keep pushing</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

2115
01:37:32.751 --> 01:37:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Pushing himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or how many days did it take to get gang</v>

2116
01:37:35.001 --> 01:37:36.380
<v Speaker 1>green?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that long.</v>

2117
01:37:36.381 --> 01:37:40.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it was for five days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fifth day he had gangrene.</v>

2118
01:37:41.210 --> 01:37:42.660
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get him to the hospital.</v>

2119
01:37:42.670 --> 01:37:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2120
01:37:43.410 --> 01:37:47.150
<v Speaker 1>You get blood poisoning of some kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

2121
01:37:47.151 --> 01:37:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2122
01:37:48.741 --> 01:37:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get gang green from hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2123
01:37:52.050 --> 01:37:55.710
<v Speaker 1>you just didn't just toughing it out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to it out and didn't do</v>

2124
01:37:55.711 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 1>anything</v>

2125
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:57.960
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't and I probably didn't hear it</v>

2126
01:37:57.961 --> 01:38:00.300
<v Speaker 2>because it hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take the sock on it so he's probably</v>

2127
01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:03.000
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know what his situation</v>

2128
01:38:03.001 --> 01:38:04.140
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't good.</v>

2129
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:05.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting the.</v>

2130
01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:08.520
<v Speaker 2>So you probably had it in a boot</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweating all day,</v>

2131
01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:12.840
<v Speaker 2>rubbing on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting sweat and bacteria.</v>

2132
01:38:13.170 --> 01:38:15.390
<v Speaker 2>Who knows that it just had gotten</v>
<v Speaker 2>infected.</v>

2133
01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:17.670
<v Speaker 2>It was nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>

2134
01:38:17.970 --> 01:38:20.220
<v Speaker 2>you could smell it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was rotting flesh.</v>

2135
01:38:20.221 --> 01:38:23.430
<v Speaker 2>It's disgusting word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise folks put some duct tape on</v>

2136
01:38:23.431 --> 01:38:24.510
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just some duct tape on it.</v>

2137
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:27.210
<v Speaker 2>You take a lot of guys out that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>never hunted before.</v>

2138
01:38:27.630 --> 01:38:29.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a few often.</v>

2139
01:38:29.150 --> 01:38:33.240
<v Speaker 2>You do that every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple times a year I would say.</v>

2140
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:37.170
<v Speaker 2>What does that do you enjoy that is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had experienced.</v>

2141
01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:38.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun for me.</v>

2142
01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:42.570
<v Speaker 2>It's mostly guys that have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They may have tried and may have been</v>

2143
01:38:42.571 --> 01:38:47.571
<v Speaker 2>successful or it might be their first</v>
<v Speaker 2>real big game type hunt or whatever.</v>

2144
01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:53.720
<v Speaker 2>I like it because a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to be a part of the experience and</v>

2145
01:38:54.570 --> 01:38:58.490
<v Speaker 2>kind of helped shape that first</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience because you could go out with</v>

2146
01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:01.360
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I kind of say some hunt.</v>

2147
01:39:01.410 --> 01:39:05.730
<v Speaker 2>There are hunters out there that fit the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stereotype and it's a shame I think</v>

2148
01:39:05.731 --> 01:39:08.970
<v Speaker 2>somebody that's getting into hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they go with somebody that fits that</v>

2149
01:39:08.971 --> 01:39:11.760
<v Speaker 2>stereotype and they're probably going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a bad experience and that's not</v>

2150
01:39:11.761 --> 01:39:16.160
<v Speaker 2>what hunting is to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that by me being able to kind</v>

2151
01:39:16.161 --> 01:39:21.000
<v Speaker 2>of help form that first experience and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it about the experience because for</v>

2152
01:39:21.001 --> 01:39:21.900
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I go hunting,</v>

2153
01:39:21.901 --> 01:39:26.610
<v Speaker 2>it's not just about killing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the entire experience around.</v>

2154
01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:28.320
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what hunting is.</v>

2155
01:39:28.650 --> 01:39:30.210
<v Speaker 2>You go out into the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2156
01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:34.310
<v Speaker 2>there's just certain things that I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that other people might not do,</v>

2157
01:39:34.530 --> 01:39:36.030
<v Speaker 2>but there are a lot of people that do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2158
01:39:36.031 --> 01:39:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Say I pay attention to the plants that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there.</v>

2159
01:39:38.881 --> 01:39:41.670
<v Speaker 2>I pay attention to really everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2160
01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:44.490
<v Speaker 2>the things that I noticed someone else</v>
<v Speaker 2>might notice that I point those out to</v>

2161
01:39:44.491 --> 01:39:47.520
<v Speaker 2>them and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just like give them an overall good</v>

2162
01:39:47.521 --> 01:39:51.000
<v Speaker 2>experience of why we're out there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing.</v>

2163
01:39:51.001 --> 01:39:52.230
<v Speaker 2>And that's fun.</v>

2164
01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.990
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of people have an idea of</v>

2165
01:39:54.991 --> 01:39:59.130
<v Speaker 5>what a hunter is from television or from</v>
<v Speaker 5>the movies or from duck dynasty or</v>

2166
01:39:59.131 --> 01:40:03.010
<v Speaker 5>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of that is maybe even Trieste</v>

2167
01:40:03.011 --> 01:40:06.220
<v Speaker 5>and hunters who are maybe overweight not</v>
<v Speaker 5>fit and yeah,</v>

2168
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:11.310
<v Speaker 5>they don't understand that western big</v>
<v Speaker 5>game style hunting like you do is really</v>

2169
01:40:11.610 --> 01:40:16.610
<v Speaker 5>an athletic endeavor as well as a skill</v>
<v Speaker 5>as well as a like a really comprehensive</v>

2170
01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:24.510
<v Speaker 5>knowledge based approach to problem</v>
<v Speaker 5>solving.</v>

2171
01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:27.690
<v Speaker 5>Like you have to know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so many factors</v>

2172
01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:29.480
<v Speaker 2>so much that goes into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>

2173
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:30.780
<v Speaker 2>you're backpacking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2174
01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:33.430
<v Speaker 2>you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also have to have a certain amount</v>

2175
01:40:33.431 --> 01:40:38.080
<v Speaker 2>of Bush skills and I call it like</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that do it,</v>

2176
01:40:38.081 --> 01:40:42.010
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those little nuance skills that you pick</v>

2177
01:40:42.011 --> 01:40:45.460
<v Speaker 2>up over over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things that I do that</v>

2178
01:40:45.461 --> 01:40:47.800
<v Speaker 2>maybe people that have hunted their</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole life's won't even notice.</v>

2179
01:40:47.801 --> 01:40:51.100
<v Speaker 2>Just the more you do things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more the better you get at it.</v>

2180
01:40:51.101 --> 01:40:52.840
<v Speaker 2>The more you notice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you've had times,</v>

2181
01:40:52.841 --> 01:40:56.860
<v Speaker 2>two more times you fucked up and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out why that got messed up and</v>

2182
01:40:56.861 --> 01:41:00.910
<v Speaker 2>then you try to remedy it in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do it this way and you just start</v>

2183
01:41:00.911 --> 01:41:04.480
<v Speaker 2>paying attention to really small things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that other people might not pay</v>

2184
01:41:04.481 --> 01:41:07.000
<v Speaker 2>attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like the way that I.</v>

2185
01:41:07.630 --> 01:41:10.000
<v Speaker 2>it's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've noticed even went from when I first</v>

2186
01:41:10.001 --> 01:41:13.620
<v Speaker 2>started hunting until now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that I do things is just</v>

2187
01:41:13.630 --> 01:41:16.450
<v Speaker 2>completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like I have a method and a</v>

2188
01:41:16.451 --> 01:41:19.210
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all based on the millions of</v>

2189
01:41:19.211 --> 01:41:24.211
<v Speaker 2>times that things haven't gone right and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to to progress into be a better</v>

2190
01:41:24.461 --> 01:41:25.211
<v Speaker 2>hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2191
01:41:25.211 --> 01:41:26.740
<v Speaker 2>Like you see this situation like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2192
01:41:26.741 --> 01:41:28.780
<v Speaker 2>I fucked this up before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2193
01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:30.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what's going on here.</v>

2194
01:41:30.341 --> 01:41:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Why is the wind at the back of my neck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get out of here now.</v>

2195
01:41:32.621 --> 01:41:34.300
<v Speaker 2>I got to back down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go around,</v>

2196
01:41:34.570 --> 01:41:38.800
<v Speaker 2>go around trying to push it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you pick areas as people that I</v>

2197
01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:42.730
<v Speaker 2>hung with all go into a new area and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be fairly successful for not going</v>

2198
01:41:42.731 --> 01:41:45.760
<v Speaker 2>into that area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've done it enough times to where,</v>

2199
01:41:45.761 --> 01:41:48.860
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do things a certain way and it's</v>

2200
01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:51.190
<v Speaker 2>constantly changing too as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment changes,</v>

2201
01:41:51.191 --> 01:41:53.500
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going into an area instead of</v>

2202
01:41:53.501 --> 01:41:56.770
<v Speaker 2>going down that hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go around the other way and look at</v>

2203
01:41:56.771 --> 01:41:59.680
<v Speaker 2>the hill facing me or things that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>

2204
01:41:59.710 --> 01:42:02.440
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to explain to like when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out there I can explain it a lot</v>

2205
01:42:02.441 --> 01:42:03.820
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can explain,</v>

2206
01:42:03.821 --> 01:42:04.990
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm doing and this is why</v>

2207
01:42:04.991 --> 01:42:06.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's other stuff that you</v>

2208
01:42:06.461 --> 01:42:09.520
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The easiest is just more of an instinct</v>

2209
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:12.850
<v Speaker 2>than anything and I think a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have those hunter instincts.</v>

2210
01:42:12.851 --> 01:42:17.230
<v Speaker 2>Those are the whole point of that Apex</v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator show was to talk about just the</v>

2211
01:42:17.231 --> 01:42:20.080
<v Speaker 2>instincts that humans have that we may</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even tap into.</v>

2212
01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:22.360
<v Speaker 2>When you say as a father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you just.</v>

2213
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:25.120
<v Speaker 2>You have that instinct to protect your</v>
<v Speaker 2>children at all costs.</v>

2214
01:42:25.121 --> 01:42:26.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that,</v>

2215
01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:29.140
<v Speaker 2>that instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure it's in there somewhere.</v>

2216
01:42:29.410 --> 01:42:32.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has to teach you that you just</v>

2217
01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:35.010
<v Speaker 2>kind of all of a sudden go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2218
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:38.340
<v Speaker 2>that's a switch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something goes off if I,</v>

2219
01:42:38.341 --> 01:42:41.090
<v Speaker 2>I think that most people would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they were carrying their child in</v>

2220
01:42:41.091 --> 01:42:44.410
<v Speaker 2>some kind of danger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would do some kind of natural</v>

2221
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:48.520
<v Speaker 2>instinctive movement to get that child</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from the danger for sure.</v>

2222
01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:50.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's literally walk human being</v>

2223
01:42:50.370 --> 01:42:55.370
<v Speaker 2>survived as long as we did in hunting is</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those primal things that tap into</v>

2224
01:42:55.931 --> 01:42:59.650
<v Speaker 2>and there's some things that are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>instinctual and there's not a lot of,</v>

2225
01:42:59.651 --> 01:43:02.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of lessons that people</v>

2226
01:43:02.861 --> 01:43:06.280
<v Speaker 2>can talk about as far as like what</v>
<v Speaker 2>instincts are.</v>

2227
01:43:06.370 --> 01:43:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that you just have to do</v>

2228
01:43:08.411 --> 01:43:10.110
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's an instinct is not.</v>

2229
01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:12.280
<v Speaker 2>You can't put it into a category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't go to a class.</v>

2230
01:43:12.281 --> 01:43:14.380
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't read a book on instincts.</v>

2231
01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:18.700
<v Speaker 2>You can know what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that whole instinctual,</v>

2232
01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:23.650
<v Speaker 2>it just has to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The grizzly bear charges something else</v>

2233
01:43:23.651 --> 01:43:25.360
<v Speaker 2>takes over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

2234
01:43:25.630 --> 01:43:28.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not a Stevie said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like.</v>

2235
01:43:28.181 --> 01:43:31.030
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even a primal level who is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight or flight.</v>

2236
01:43:31.031 --> 01:43:32.740
<v Speaker 2>It was just this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this weird.</v>

2237
01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:35.230
<v Speaker 2>You just did what you had to do in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>very second.</v>

2238
01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:36.860
<v Speaker 2>There was no thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2239
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:37.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2240
01:43:37.871 --> 01:43:40.840
<v Speaker 2>it's you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're almost like your DNA.</v>

2241
01:43:41.370 --> 01:43:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Your DNA is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2242
01:43:42.730 --> 01:43:47.730
<v Speaker 2>we've seen this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This happened to a fatty maximus 1500</v>

2243
01:43:48.191 --> 01:43:50.110
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your great grandfather was eaten by a</v>

2244
01:43:50.111 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 2>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those genes</v>

2245
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:52.873
<v Speaker 3>passed on.</v>

2246
01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:53.821
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that time too,</v>

2247
01:43:53.821 --> 01:43:56.650
<v Speaker 2>if you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're hunting and you go like this</v>

2248
01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:57.990
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2249
01:43:57.991 --> 01:44:00.810
<v Speaker 2>and you just have that feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should sit here and then it works out</v>

2250
01:44:00.811 --> 01:44:02.070
<v Speaker 2>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2251
01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:05.250
<v Speaker 2>I got to go over this region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just some kind of instinct that</v>

2252
01:44:05.251 --> 01:44:09.000
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to survive you need to do this.</v>

2253
01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:11.260
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tap into it and you're out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there enough.</v>

2254
01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:14.490
<v Speaker 2>You start to pay attention to the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that work and things that don't.</v>

2255
01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:16.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guidelines that has so much experience</v>

2256
01:44:16.981 --> 01:44:18.930
<v Speaker 3>in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that you're kind of</v>

2257
01:44:18.931 --> 01:44:21.120
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like your data chunking.</v>

2258
01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:23.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like you've seen so many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're like,</v>

2259
01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:24.690
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what this is.</v>

2260
01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way I.</v>

2261
01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:28.340
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of like think of instincts is</v>

2262
01:44:28.341 --> 01:44:30.860
<v Speaker 2>like a bunch of ones and Zeros and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>

2263
01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:34.280
<v Speaker 2>so you don't really think about all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones in zero patterns that are in your</v>

2264
01:44:34.281 --> 01:44:36.830
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just enter a situation and then</v>

2265
01:44:37.370 --> 01:44:39.080
<v Speaker 2>something you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2266
01:44:39.081 --> 01:44:42.680
<v Speaker 2>your instinct is that data processing</v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

2267
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:43.723
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow down.</v>

2268
01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:45.620
<v Speaker 3>It might be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2269
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:47.380
<v Speaker 3>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2270
01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:50.800
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely parts of us that we,</v>

2271
01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:55.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we were ever going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>really experience it unless you're doing</v>

2272
01:44:55.511 --> 01:44:56.890
<v Speaker 3>something physically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2273
01:44:56.891 --> 01:44:58.030
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't even probably know.</v>

2274
01:44:58.031 --> 01:45:01.690
<v Speaker 3>You have the instinct to get the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>away from a bear as it's charging or to</v>

2275
01:45:01.691 --> 01:45:06.691
<v Speaker 3>Juka bear until it actually happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go who that was more like the fuck</v>

2276
01:45:06.761 --> 01:45:10.120
<v Speaker 3>out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that your brain was capable</v>

2277
01:45:10.121 --> 01:45:15.121
<v Speaker 3>of coming up with that move in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment while it's 11 and a half foot</v>

2278
01:45:15.610 --> 01:45:17.710
<v Speaker 3>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking bear was coming down on you.</v>

2279
01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:20.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the whole Yannis man hitting</v>

2280
01:45:20.071 --> 01:45:21.600
<v Speaker 2>that thing in the face with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tracking,</v>

2281
01:45:21.650 --> 01:45:24.840
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he probably also,</v>

2282
01:45:24.841 --> 01:45:26.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to ask him,</v>

2283
01:45:26.071 --> 01:45:29.030
<v Speaker 2>but it probably didn't even process what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying</v>

2284
01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:31.570
<v Speaker 3>dealing and as big as this table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2285
01:45:33.210 --> 01:45:34.240
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

2286
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Just huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just and that turned into,</v>

2287
01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I had no clue that he did that because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't get was on the back.</v>

2288
01:45:43.481 --> 01:45:44.800
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on his back and I was like,</v>

2289
01:45:44.801 --> 01:45:47.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he juked it in the bear ran away and</v>

2290
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:48.161
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

2291
01:45:48.161 --> 01:45:50.640
<v Speaker 2>no dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit it in the face of the trekking.</v>

2292
01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:51.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I ran away.</v>

2293
01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:52.700
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2294
01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:55.520
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing that Aspen unbelievable</v>

2295
01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:58.730
<v Speaker 3>is that that's the most intense</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience you've ever had in the woods.</v>

2296
01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intense in that in a different way.</v>

2297
01:46:03.570 --> 01:46:06.890
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a lot of just momentary.</v>

2298
01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:10.150
<v Speaker 2>They're just intense in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2299
01:46:10.930 --> 01:46:12.070
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one was,</v>

2300
01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:14.890
<v Speaker 2>that one was pretty intense in the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I thought,</v>

2301
01:46:15.630 --> 01:46:17.260
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this bear's going to fucking kill me.</v>

2302
01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:22.480
<v Speaker 3>A big part of what hunting is to is</v>
<v Speaker 3>being able to stay calm in that moment.</v>

2303
01:46:22.690 --> 01:46:24.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and because you're,</v>

2304
01:46:24.231 --> 01:46:26.710
<v Speaker 3>you're looking for an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hiking,</v>

2305
01:46:26.711 --> 01:46:29.260
<v Speaker 3>you're exhausted day in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>day out.</v>

2306
01:46:29.261 --> 01:46:31.750
<v Speaker 3>You're out there for long time and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden it comes down to one</v>

2307
01:46:31.751 --> 01:46:34.420
<v Speaker 3>moment and that wall moment literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be five seconds.</v>

2308
01:46:34.421 --> 01:46:37.750
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit is coming out from behind that</v>
<v Speaker 3>tree draw and it's right there.</v>

2309
01:46:38.050 --> 01:46:40.960
<v Speaker 3>And you have to just be able to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2310
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:43.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be thinking about something</v>

2311
01:46:43.551 --> 01:46:44.460
<v Speaker 2>else because you just fucked</v>

2312
01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:46.120
<v Speaker 3>and you can't be freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't go,</v>

2313
01:46:46.190 --> 01:46:46.881
<v Speaker 3>you to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2314
01:46:46.881 --> 01:46:49.800
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe this is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't think that either anybody does</v>

2315
01:46:49.801 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

2316
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:52.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do freak out on or even I've done it</v>

2317
01:46:52.951 --> 01:46:56.580
<v Speaker 2>a thousand times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get that rush of,</v>

2318
01:46:56.610 --> 01:46:59.960
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's that rush of adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have,</v>

2319
01:46:59.961 --> 01:47:01.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that,</v>

2320
01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:05.010
<v Speaker 2>that you say in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you draw back your bow or</v>

2321
01:47:05.011 --> 01:47:07.530
<v Speaker 2>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have like a series of things like</v>

2322
01:47:07.531 --> 01:47:09.900
<v Speaker 2>a checklist that you go off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few things.</v>

2323
01:47:09.901 --> 01:47:11.790
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess with my bow,</v>

2324
01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:16.560
<v Speaker 2>the one thing I think because I have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>trigger release so I just try to feel</v>

2325
01:47:17.250 --> 01:47:20.000
<v Speaker 2>the trigger in my finger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the corner,</v>

2326
01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:22.620
<v Speaker 2>my finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean I know that I'm not going to</v>

2327
01:47:22.621 --> 01:47:26.370
<v Speaker 2>like slap or punch later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if I'm thinking about that,</v>

2328
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:28.780
<v Speaker 2>but mostly I'm focusing on where I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2329
01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.440
<v Speaker 2>I guess I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my checklists would be like,</v>

2330
01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:31.860
<v Speaker 2>drawback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick a spot,</v>

2331
01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:34.560
<v Speaker 2>feel the trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let it go.</v>

2332
01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:36.750
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever have any classic archery</v>
<v Speaker 2>training?</v>

2333
01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:38.170
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2334
01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:41.100
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably would.</v>

2335
01:47:41.190 --> 01:47:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Should you at this point in time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I was talking to Debbie about that</v>

2336
01:47:44.431 --> 01:47:45.510
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2337
01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:48.990
<v Speaker 2>you could pick up a rubber band and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pencil and kill something with it.</v>

2338
01:47:48.991 --> 01:47:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Like you just have the instinct to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2339
01:47:51.211 --> 01:47:55.740
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've noticed when I started hunting with</v>

2340
01:47:55.741 --> 01:47:59.100
<v Speaker 2>a bow I just kind of tried to pick it up</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself and I did everything wrong,</v>

2341
01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:03.840
<v Speaker 2>but I would go to these three d shoots</v>
<v Speaker 2>and winham not like,</v>

2342
01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:09.080
<v Speaker 2>not like real tournament's but just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>local things and I know I'm the best</v>

2343
01:48:09.091 --> 01:48:10.740
<v Speaker 2>shop around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

2344
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:11.790
<v Speaker 2>And then you guys would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2345
01:48:11.791 --> 01:48:13.050
<v Speaker 2>you're shooting wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing.</v>

2346
01:48:13.110 --> 01:48:16.980
<v Speaker 2>And I just would slap the trigger and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>never thought about holding still.</v>

2347
01:48:16.981 --> 01:48:21.000
<v Speaker 2>I had always just shoot with movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I started shooting a,</v>

2348
01:48:21.001 --> 01:48:26.001
<v Speaker 2>a like a long bow and I would watch time</v>
<v Speaker 2>tnn outdoors.</v>

2349
01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:30.090
<v Speaker 2>There's guy named Byron Ferguson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen his stuff?</v>

2350
01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:33.940
<v Speaker 2>This dude would throw up and aspirin and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot it out of the air over and over.</v>

2351
01:48:33.941 --> 01:48:36.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his whole thing was be the arrow.</v>

2352
01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:38.730
<v Speaker 2>That was my only archery advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be The arrow.</v>

2353
01:48:38.731 --> 01:48:41.880
<v Speaker 2>That's all I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just be the arrow.</v>

2354
01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:43.650
<v Speaker 2>It made no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'd be out there.</v>

2355
01:48:43.770 --> 01:48:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I had a ball on a string in the backyard</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would like a softball and swing</v>

2356
01:48:48.391 --> 01:48:50.960
<v Speaker 2>the soft ball back and forth and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell myself beat the Arrow,</v>

2357
01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:56.070
<v Speaker 2>shoot it made no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I got a compound bow I</v>

2358
01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:57.870
<v Speaker 2>just be the arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just move.</v>

2359
01:48:57.871 --> 01:49:00.180
<v Speaker 2>And when it felt right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I let her let her rip.</v>

2360
01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:02.850
<v Speaker 2>But you've obviously made adjustments</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't move.</v>

2361
01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I in the shot right now.</v>

2362
01:49:04.711 --> 01:49:09.711
<v Speaker 2>So in the process of switching the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I shoot at developed a few bad</v>

2363
01:49:11.311 --> 01:49:14.910
<v Speaker 2>habits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which now I think if I would have just</v>

2364
01:49:14.911 --> 01:49:16.530
<v Speaker 2>stuck with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had been fine,</v>

2365
01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:20.820
<v Speaker 2>but now that I've tried to switch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I kind of try to all those bad</v>

2366
01:49:20.821 --> 01:49:25.230
<v Speaker 2>habits that I had originally tried to</v>
<v Speaker 2>creep back in and it doesn't really,</v>

2367
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:29.040
<v Speaker 2>in the end I do really well so it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't really matter,</v>

2368
01:49:29.041 --> 01:49:33.960
<v Speaker 2>but I like the idea of trying new things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's always room for improvement.</v>

2369
01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:35.640
<v Speaker 2>You should talk to Dudley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2370
01:49:36.130 --> 01:49:38.010
<v Speaker 2>we should go over some coaching with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2371
01:49:38.730 --> 01:49:40.700
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting to me is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2372
01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a bunch of guys who are like</v>
<v Speaker 2>very accomplished hunters,</v>

2373
01:49:45.781 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 2>very accomplished archers and</v>

2374
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:51.100
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get real weird around him really</v>

2375
01:49:51.130 --> 01:49:55.660
<v Speaker 5>because they know he's a master.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a master of form and technique and</v>

2376
01:49:55.661 --> 01:49:59.710
<v Speaker 5>he does it absolutely the right way and</v>
<v Speaker 5>people do not like to get in shootouts</v>

2377
01:49:59.711 --> 01:50:02.380
<v Speaker 5>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you have little competitions,</v>

2378
01:50:02.530 --> 01:50:04.170
<v Speaker 5>he's too fucking accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

2379
01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:06.010
<v Speaker 5>he's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He shot,</v>

2380
01:50:06.170 --> 01:50:11.050
<v Speaker 5>we did a video for on it where he shot a</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kettlebell handle at 120 yards.</v>

2381
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:13.500
<v Speaker 5>He shot in the handling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2382
01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:16.510
<v Speaker 5>at night and the sparks because he did</v>
<v Speaker 5>it at night,</v>

2383
01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:19.180
<v Speaker 5>like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lighted nock in there and aim for the</v>

2384
01:50:19.181 --> 01:50:23.620
<v Speaker 5>lighted nock and shot it through and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can see the sparks as the broad head</v>

2385
01:50:23.621 --> 01:50:27.060
<v Speaker 5>hits the bottom of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a handle the,</v>

2386
01:50:27.110 --> 01:50:28.720
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the top edge of the Kettlebell.</v>

2387
01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:33.660
<v Speaker 5>He's ridiculous shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But everything he does is text book and</v>

2388
01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:35.740
<v Speaker 5>he's like a technical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's.</v>

2389
01:50:35.741 --> 01:50:36.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he.</v>

2390
01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:37.900
<v Speaker 5>And he does that when he's hunting too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2391
01:50:37.901 --> 01:50:40.160
<v Speaker 5>but he does that with everything but so</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's real weird.</v>

2392
01:50:40.161 --> 01:50:43.300
<v Speaker 5>Like guys almost have this thing in</v>
<v Speaker 5>their head like I don't want to fuck</v>

2393
01:50:43.301 --> 01:50:45.940
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's already are already very successful</v>

2394
01:50:45.941 --> 01:50:47.410
<v Speaker 5>doing this way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to change anything.</v>

2395
01:50:47.850 --> 01:50:49.780
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm not listening to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah blah blah blah blah.</v>

2396
01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:53.770
<v Speaker 5>Like some guys will try to revamp their</v>
<v Speaker 5>whole system but a lot of really</v>

2397
01:50:53.771 --> 01:50:56.530
<v Speaker 5>successful guys won't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they get real weird around him.</v>

2398
01:50:56.531 --> 01:50:57.270
<v Speaker 5>It's very interesting</v>

2399
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:59.690
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see that whole if it's not broken,</v>

2400
01:50:59.691 --> 01:51:01.250
<v Speaker 2>don't fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not that type.</v>

2401
01:51:01.251 --> 01:51:03.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody is really good at something,</v>

2402
01:51:03.201 --> 01:51:04.940
<v Speaker 2>I want to learn from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2403
01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:06.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he came to me and was like,</v>

2404
01:51:06.861 --> 01:51:10.160
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to know my thing isn't technical</v>

2405
01:51:10.161 --> 01:51:13.910
<v Speaker 2>archery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My thing is being out outdoor skills,</v>

2406
01:51:14.150 --> 01:51:15.980
<v Speaker 2>survival skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>

2407
01:51:16.010 --> 01:51:17.350
<v Speaker 2>being in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2408
01:51:17.370 --> 01:51:18.111
<v Speaker 2>if he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2409
01:51:18.111 --> 01:51:23.111
<v Speaker 2>I want to know some more stuff about</v>
<v Speaker 2>stocking mountain goats in wherever</v>

2410
01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:25.251
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2411
01:51:25.251 --> 01:51:26.630
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you what I know.</v>

2412
01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:30.140
<v Speaker 2>And I asked him the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like tell me about some archery stuff</v>

2413
01:51:30.141 --> 01:51:34.880
<v Speaker 2>because there's always areas where I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>improve and I'm not so stuck in my ways</v>

2414
01:51:34.881 --> 01:51:37.880
<v Speaker 2>that I need to do it the way I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

2415
01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:40.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely better ways to do</v>

2416
01:51:40.671 --> 01:51:42.320
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can definitely get by the way,</v>

2417
01:51:42.321 --> 01:51:43.870
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it really well here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>

2418
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:47.030
<v Speaker 2>here's John.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he put a light on it.</v>

2419
01:51:47.031 --> 01:51:48.170
<v Speaker 2>That's what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2420
01:51:52.050 --> 01:51:56.160
<v Speaker 5>check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you want to talk about a guy who</v>

2421
01:51:56.190 --> 01:51:57.610
<v Speaker 5>loves archery?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2422
01:51:57.611 --> 01:52:00.160
<v Speaker 5>He loves coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He loves doing it,</v>

2423
01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:05.460
<v Speaker 5>like that's a perfect thing for him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He loves it and he loves teaching people</v>

2424
01:52:06.941 --> 01:52:08.650
<v Speaker 5>how to do it too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you watch his form,</v>

2425
01:52:08.651 --> 01:52:09.484
<v Speaker 5>it's just</v>

2426
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:11.070
<v Speaker 2>absolutely perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2427
01:52:11.071 --> 01:52:12.420
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2428
01:52:12.421 --> 01:52:14.430
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love bow hunting.</v>

2429
01:52:14.431 --> 01:52:17.640
<v Speaker 2>That's my passion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll still go rifle hunting</v>

2430
01:52:17.641 --> 01:52:20.580
<v Speaker 2>depending on the hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How often your rifle and every year.</v>

2431
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:23.820
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2432
01:52:23.821 --> 01:52:26.460
<v Speaker 2>am I doing one or two on senior?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>

2433
01:52:26.461 --> 01:52:29.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one hunt generally because I guide</v>

2434
01:52:29.551 --> 01:52:34.551
<v Speaker 2>during the elk season in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my thing is El Camino is my number</v>

2435
01:52:34.861 --> 01:52:39.861
<v Speaker 2>one thing that I want in the freezer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I generally save a few days at the</v>

2436
01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:42.090
<v Speaker 2>end of the season to go out and try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill an elk with a rifle.</v>

2437
01:52:42.330 --> 01:52:45.740
<v Speaker 2>It's mostly just because I want that</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat in the freezer</v>

2438
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:48.860
<v Speaker 1>and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing wrong with rifling</v>

2439
01:52:49.030 --> 01:52:50.990
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about that I,</v>

2440
01:52:51.110 --> 01:52:53.720
<v Speaker 1>if I take a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also that challenge thing.</v>

2441
01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:58.940
<v Speaker 1>So I might go into an area where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>odds of me getting something with a</v>

2442
01:52:58.941 --> 01:53:03.941
<v Speaker 1>rifle even would be 100 or say multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple times less than the odds of me</v>

2443
01:53:06.291 --> 01:53:10.790
<v Speaker 1>going into an area with a bone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting something right because it's low</v>

2444
01:53:10.791 --> 01:53:12.770
<v Speaker 1>density of animals so he didn't see any</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals or even.</v>

2445
01:53:13.110 --> 01:53:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Well with Elc I think it's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier to get an elk and maybe people</v>

2446
01:53:17.591 --> 01:53:18.141
<v Speaker 1>will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2447
01:53:18.141 --> 01:53:20.330
<v Speaker 1>that's bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's easier to get an elk with a bow</v>

2448
01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:23.000
<v Speaker 1>than a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2449
01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:26.120
<v Speaker 1>During Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most archery seasons or during</v>

2450
01:53:26.121 --> 01:53:27.710
<v Speaker 1>the Rut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the easiest time to.</v>

2451
01:53:28.130 --> 01:53:31.780
<v Speaker 1>It would be like a no brainer with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rifle and during the rut because the</v>

2452
01:53:31.781 --> 01:53:34.430
<v Speaker 1>animals were all distracted and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to hump and it mostly</v>

2453
01:53:34.431 --> 01:53:35.510
<v Speaker 1>across the West.</v>

2454
01:53:35.690 --> 01:53:38.600
<v Speaker 1>The elk season with a rifle and general</v>
<v Speaker 1>elk season,</v>

2455
01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:40.880
<v Speaker 1>is it the absolute worst time to finding</v>
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>

2456
01:53:40.881 --> 01:53:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Just seeing an elk is the struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might go five days and not seeing</v>

2457
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:47.120
<v Speaker 1>elk in some areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably really cold.</v>

2458
01:53:47.121 --> 01:53:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Really cold hartree equipment might not</v>
<v Speaker 1>even work and some of those temperatures</v>

2459
01:53:51.641 --> 01:53:56.360
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you draw it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well icicles on you're frozen and it</v>

2460
01:53:56.570 --> 01:53:59.510
<v Speaker 1>gets wet and then it's frozen and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to shoot.</v>

2461
01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:04.720
<v Speaker 1>And how did you start going to Montana?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My grandpa actually lived there.</v>

2462
01:54:04.821 --> 01:54:09.821
<v Speaker 1>I just went there summers and I grew up</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of in hunting that area and stuff.</v>

2463
01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:14.240
<v Speaker 1>The bitterroot valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Southwest Montana.</v>

2464
01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:16.100
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Near Missoula.</v>

2465
01:54:16.190 --> 01:54:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Missoula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2466
01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:20.000
<v Speaker 1>South of Missoula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just grew up hunting there.</v>

2467
01:54:20.190 --> 01:54:21.100
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

2468
01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:23.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no grizzlies there.</v>

2469
01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Some areas of Montana have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some don't.</v>

2470
01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:26.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

2471
01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:29.060
<v Speaker 1>What's that about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2472
01:54:29.090 --> 01:54:33.440
<v Speaker 1>well they have them in the park and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main population and then they did</v>

2473
01:54:33.441 --> 01:54:37.100
<v Speaker 1>the reintroductions and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so glacier has them,</v>

2474
01:54:37.610 --> 01:54:39.170
<v Speaker 1>a yellowstone has them.</v>

2475
01:54:39.230 --> 01:54:41.630
<v Speaker 1>They reintroduced grizzlies to certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

2476
01:54:41.690 --> 01:54:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real upside of glacier in some other</v>

2477
01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:47.240
<v Speaker 1>areas you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do the problem grizzlies and trap</v>

2478
01:54:47.241 --> 01:54:49.150
<v Speaker 1>them or something or as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2479
01:54:49.190 --> 01:54:53.160
<v Speaker 1>they did do some transplants or</v>
<v Speaker 1>reintroductions.</v>

2480
01:54:53.590 --> 01:54:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those parks have had them.</v>

2481
01:54:55.640 --> 01:55:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And then the ones in that greater</v>
<v Speaker 1>yellowstone area of spread out and in</v>

2482
01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:04.040
<v Speaker 1>that glacier if spread out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana is a very unusual place.</v>

2483
01:55:04.041 --> 01:55:07.480
<v Speaker 1>It's such a small population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people are like,</v>

2484
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:12.790
<v Speaker 1>I've only been to Bozeman and billings</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we went and hunted the Missouri</v>

2485
01:55:13.041 --> 01:55:13.850
<v Speaker 1>breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2486
01:55:13.850 --> 01:55:16.640
<v Speaker 1>people are very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool area.</v>

2487
01:55:16.670 --> 01:55:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're not,</v>

2488
01:55:18.081 --> 01:55:19.310
<v Speaker 1>they're not Hicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2489
01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:20.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're tuned in.</v>

2490
01:55:20.890 --> 01:55:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Well Weird Montana is a small</v>
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>

2491
01:55:23.001 --> 01:55:26.390
<v Speaker 1>but that population explodes in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>summer with all the,</v>

2492
01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:28.070
<v Speaker 1>with the parks there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2493
01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:32.330
<v Speaker 1>So it's tourists type people coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>

2494
01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:36.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually have the stats,</v>

2495
01:55:36.081 --> 01:55:40.940
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like the law almost every</v>
<v Speaker 1>year somebody dies from a grizzly now or</v>

2496
01:55:40.941 --> 01:55:42.550
<v Speaker 1>multiple people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been.</v>

2497
01:55:42.590 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have been getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked and</v>

2498
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:49.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just the amount of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are there and just think that</v>

2499
01:55:49.021 --> 01:55:52.380
<v Speaker 2>they're cuddly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cute animals and they don't really have</v>

2500
01:55:52.381 --> 01:55:55.050
<v Speaker 2>precautions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think if you go on a hunt in</v>

2501
01:55:55.051 --> 01:55:59.310
<v Speaker 2>Alaska where we went in a fog neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably a lot safer than the</v>

2502
01:55:59.311 --> 01:56:02.940
<v Speaker 2>tourists going into a yellowstone just</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you,</v>

2503
01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.440
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be prepared.</v>

2504
01:56:04.441 --> 01:56:07.370
<v Speaker 2>You've got the idea that these bears are</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous and they're probably going to</v>

2505
01:56:07.410 --> 01:56:11.730
<v Speaker 2>come at you in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to be ready at all times.</v>

2506
01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Then you go into yellowstone or glacier</v>
<v Speaker 2>park.</v>

2507
01:56:14.630 --> 01:56:17.220
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of attacks around</v>
<v Speaker 2>delisted bears there,</v>

2508
01:56:17.221 --> 01:56:18.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2509
01:56:18.691 --> 01:56:19.710
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're delisted.</v>

2510
01:56:19.711 --> 01:56:20.200
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2511
01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:22.390
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a season open for hunting.</v>

2512
01:56:22.391 --> 01:56:23.780
<v Speaker 3>But that's under debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

2513
01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:28.810
<v Speaker 3>So the ideas there are populations of</v>
<v Speaker 3>reached a steady or maybe even over the</v>

2514
01:56:29.860 --> 01:56:30.600
<v Speaker 3>that level.</v>

2515
01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2516
01:56:32.161 --> 01:56:35.790
<v Speaker 2>They're no longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're no longer threaten or</v>

2517
01:56:35.970 --> 01:56:37.720
<v Speaker 2>potentially in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>

2518
01:56:38.430 --> 01:56:40.440
<v Speaker 2>They aren't going to go extinct right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2519
01:56:41.130 --> 01:56:42.300
<v Speaker 3>And did you ever see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2520
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:47.040
<v Speaker 3>a short face bear?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever see images of the bear that</v>

2521
01:56:47.041 --> 01:56:51.780
<v Speaker 3>used to live somewhere in the bearing</v>
<v Speaker 3>landmass between the US and Asia?</v>

2522
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:54.600
<v Speaker 3>It's a way bigger than even a grizzly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very large.</v>

2523
01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:56.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think that's what made of might</v>

2524
01:56:56.941 --> 01:57:01.170
<v Speaker 3>have kept people from migrating to North</v>
<v Speaker 3>America quicker.</v>

2525
01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:02.273
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2526
01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:06.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say they say that a polar bear's</v>

2527
01:57:06.321 --> 01:57:09.650
<v Speaker 2>still actively hunt people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a.</v>

2528
01:57:10.370 --> 01:57:12.530
<v Speaker 2>those bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do have a different temperament</v>

2529
01:57:12.770 --> 01:57:16.010
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the bears in Montana,</v>

2530
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:18.680
<v Speaker 2>we just keep going back to barriers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the barriers in Montana,</v>

2531
01:57:19.250 --> 01:57:24.250
<v Speaker 2>landlocked grizzly bears just seemed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be slightly more aggressive than the</v>

2532
01:57:25.731 --> 01:57:28.970
<v Speaker 2>larger coastal brown bears just because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have as much food.</v>

2533
01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:32.870
<v Speaker 2>There's always slightly pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always see everything as a,</v>

2534
01:57:32.910 --> 01:57:33.950
<v Speaker 2>as a potential meal</v>

2535
01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:36.790
<v Speaker 3>and everything is like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look at mammals moving around on</v>

2536
01:57:36.791 --> 01:57:39.280
<v Speaker 3>the ground as a meal as opposed to like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bears and the coastal.</v>

2537
01:57:39.281 --> 01:57:41.530
<v Speaker 3>They'll connect salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Salmon most of the year.</v>

2538
01:57:41.550 --> 01:57:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not thinking of things walking</v>

2539
01:57:43.541 --> 01:57:44.590
<v Speaker 3>around as being food.</v>

2540
01:57:44.710 --> 01:57:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the salmon are a very large food</v>

2541
01:57:47.771 --> 01:57:48.910
<v Speaker 2>source,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only in the fall.</v>

2542
01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:52.660
<v Speaker 2>So for a quarter of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see that</v>

2543
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:57.600
<v Speaker 3>BC special or the guy they put him in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>giant plexiglass box.</v>

2544
01:57:57.630 --> 01:58:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they dropped him off somewhere where</v>

2545
01:58:01.081 --> 01:58:03.750
<v Speaker 3>there's a large polar bear population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

2546
01:58:03.751 --> 01:58:07.050
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw one where they did with the brown</v>

2547
01:58:07.051 --> 01:58:10.170
<v Speaker 3>bear and the got to attack the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2548
01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:11.580
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was a polar bear.</v>

2549
01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:12.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

2550
01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:14.940
<v Speaker 3>They put the polar bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they put this box there and the guys</v>

2551
01:58:14.941 --> 01:58:18.030
<v Speaker 3>inside the box and the polar bear comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to the box.</v>

2552
01:58:18.031 --> 01:58:18.751
<v Speaker 3>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2553
01:58:18.751 --> 01:58:23.751
<v Speaker 3>so is this like super thick glass thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with steel and bolts and rivets?</v>

2554
01:58:25.321 --> 01:58:28.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean it literally looks like some sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a like something you would drop out</v>

2555
01:58:28.891 --> 01:58:33.891
<v Speaker 3>of a fucking spaceship and this bear</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes up and sees him and start smelling</v>

2556
01:58:36.211 --> 01:58:38.850
<v Speaker 3>them to tries to bite through the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

2557
01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck this bad.</v>

2558
01:58:41.530 --> 01:58:43.960
<v Speaker 3>He's tightening everything down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freaking out.</v>

2559
01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:48.010
<v Speaker 3>It's licking everything and</v>
<v Speaker 3>systematically trying.</v>

2560
01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:54.220
<v Speaker 3>That's a big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's times where it opens its</v>

2561
01:58:54.221 --> 01:58:55.570
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2562
01:58:55.650 --> 01:58:59.920
<v Speaker 3>And the guys inside of it and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can smell him through these little</v>

2563
01:58:59.921 --> 01:59:02.190
<v Speaker 3>holes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see where it's going through that hole</v>

2564
01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:04.570
<v Speaker 3>and is trying to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2565
01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:07.090
<v Speaker 3>That thing is trying to snack on the ice</v>
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>

2566
01:59:08.670 --> 01:59:10.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not curious is trying to</v>

2567
01:59:10.451 --> 01:59:12.550
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man,</v>

2568
01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:15.230
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2569
01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:17.010
<v Speaker 2>there are so ruthless that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2570
01:59:17.370 --> 01:59:19.470
<v Speaker 2>all of them are cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's really crazy.</v>

2571
01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:22.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of food up there now.</v>

2572
01:59:23.090 --> 01:59:27.270
<v Speaker 2>The sources that they do have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seals and things are just high fat</v>

2573
01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:30.650
<v Speaker 2>content so they don't have to eat as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much in Wales.</v>

2574
01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Like the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2575
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:36.290
<v Speaker 3>picture crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got its mouth open trying to bite</v>

2576
01:59:36.291 --> 01:59:38.510
<v Speaker 3>through the class and its head is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking big.</v>

2577
01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:42.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a heartbreaking video.</v>

2578
01:59:42.141 --> 01:59:45.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was going around a couple of weeks</v>

2579
01:59:45.660 --> 01:59:47.920
<v Speaker 3>ago of a polar bear is starving to death</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2580
01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:49.370
<v Speaker 3>they're attributing it to climate</v>
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>

2581
01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:54.400
<v Speaker 3>I did see that little nat geo thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird that you do not want that to</v>

2582
01:59:54.591 --> 01:59:55.221
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2583
01:59:55.221 --> 01:59:57.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean the last thing you want to see as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a polar bear starving to death,</v>

2584
01:59:58.850 --> 02:00:01.670
<v Speaker 3>but I also don't want to get eaten by</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fucking thing.</v>

2585
02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:04.730
<v Speaker 3>We'll just go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>

2586
02:00:05.930 --> 02:00:07.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the balance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2587
02:00:07.630 --> 02:00:11.150
<v Speaker 3>We want them to thrive and survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just don't want him anywhere near me.</v>

2588
02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:12.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2589
02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:13.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2590
02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:15.710
<v Speaker 3>I've never been anywhere that there are</v>
<v Speaker 3>a polar bears.</v>

2591
02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:17.560
<v Speaker 3>So would you be interested in going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2592
02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:19.850
<v Speaker 3>I'd go check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be cool to see.</v>

2593
02:00:20.150 --> 02:00:21.650
<v Speaker 3>Do they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are those big,</v>

2594
02:00:21.651 --> 02:00:23.720
<v Speaker 3>furry things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muskox.</v>

2595
02:00:23.721 --> 02:00:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Are they anywhere near a polar bears?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2596
02:00:25.521 --> 02:00:26.140
<v Speaker 3>they are.</v>

2597
02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got them in the Arctic.</v>

2598
02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:31.190
<v Speaker 2>The polar bears hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those muskox says,</v>

2599
02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:33.173
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2600
02:00:33.250 --> 02:00:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Not that I know of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're mostly go for seals and</v>

2601
02:00:37.001 --> 02:00:37.834
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>

2602
02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's next for you?</v>

2603
02:00:40.031 --> 02:00:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You going to do any more TV shows?</v>

2604
02:00:41.550 --> 02:00:43.330
<v Speaker 3>Because I really enjoyed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apex predators.</v>

2605
02:00:44.110 --> 02:00:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still doing the solo hunter stuff</v>

2606
02:00:45.970 --> 02:00:47.590
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did.</v>

2607
02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:52.640
<v Speaker 2>I did some cool stuff in Australia this</v>
<v Speaker 2>year and did a buff Huntington,</v>

2608
02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:55.720
<v Speaker 2>like a solo little mission there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with some people,</v>

2609
02:00:55.721 --> 02:00:58.090
<v Speaker 2>but then I did all the hunting alone</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to get out there.</v>

2610
02:00:58.091 --> 02:01:03.010
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty far out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still doing the solo stuff and then</v>

2611
02:01:03.330 --> 02:01:04.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got some stuff in the works,</v>

2612
02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:08.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the coming future that be,</v>

2613
02:01:08.430 --> 02:01:11.710
<v Speaker 2>it's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't really divulge a lot of it</v>

2614
02:01:11.711 --> 02:01:13.450
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I hope you do something that</v>

2615
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:18.990
<v Speaker 5>allows people that are more mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 5>that aren't on outdoor TV to get a look</v>

2616
02:01:19.961 --> 02:01:23.830
<v Speaker 5>at your approach and your philosophy and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way you look at things because I</v>

2617
02:01:23.831 --> 02:01:28.831
<v Speaker 5>think that guys like you and Rinella and</v>
<v Speaker 5>campaigns and Dudley very valuable</v>

2618
02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:33.400
<v Speaker 5>because people have this sense that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

2619
02:01:33.401 --> 02:01:34.240
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about like the</v>

2620
02:01:34.241 --> 02:01:38.880
<v Speaker 5>stereotypical idea of what a hunter is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have this idea of what it is and</v>

2621
02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:40.340
<v Speaker 5>they see a guy like you and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2622
02:01:40.341 --> 02:01:42.140
<v Speaker 5>well this guy is like more like an</v>
<v Speaker 5>athlete.</v>

2623
02:01:42.170 --> 02:01:46.790
<v Speaker 5>Like this is more like a pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is more like an endurance skill</v>

2624
02:01:46.791 --> 02:01:50.000
<v Speaker 5>thing on top of being a hunting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of,</v>

2625
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:54.320
<v Speaker 5>a lot of variables here that most people</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't take into consideration.</v>

2626
02:01:54.321 --> 02:01:57.500
<v Speaker 5>It's why I think it's so important to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I really enjoyed having you</v>

2627
02:01:57.501 --> 02:02:01.490
<v Speaker 5>on a podcast and having guys like you on</v>
<v Speaker 5>to talk about this stuff so people get</v>

2628
02:02:01.491 --> 02:02:03.320
<v Speaker 5>an understanding of it in a different</v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

2629
02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:03.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

2630
02:02:03.981 --> 02:02:05.180
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2631
02:02:05.181 --> 02:02:09.230
<v Speaker 2>it's nice to be able to kind of share</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do with a population that might</v>

2632
02:02:09.231 --> 02:02:12.860
<v Speaker 2>not really understand it because I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really look at it hunting in</v>

2633
02:02:12.861 --> 02:02:17.600
<v Speaker 2>general and the way that myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not the exception,</v>

2634
02:02:17.601 --> 02:02:20.000
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that hunt the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that I do,</v>

2635
02:02:20.300 --> 02:02:23.420
<v Speaker 2>especially out west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that if you really understand</v>

2636
02:02:23.421 --> 02:02:26.200
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you kind of start to get a grasp of</v>

2637
02:02:26.210 --> 02:02:29.360
<v Speaker 2>it's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a better system and some</v>

2638
02:02:29.361 --> 02:02:32.210
<v Speaker 2>of the systems that we have around now</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think some of the stuff that I'm</v>

2639
02:02:32.211 --> 02:02:33.590
<v Speaker 2>going to be doing in the future will</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

2640
02:02:33.930 --> 02:02:35.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just give people more access to that.</v>

2641
02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:38.780
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now you can go get their solo</v>

2642
02:02:38.781 --> 02:02:39.800
<v Speaker 2>hunter episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a,</v>

2643
02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:42.110
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we decided to put them all on our</v>

2644
02:02:42.111 --> 02:02:45.230
<v Speaker 2>website and do like a solo hunter all</v>
<v Speaker 2>access kind of thing.</v>

2645
02:02:45.670 --> 02:02:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Just like a subscription and you can go</v>
<v Speaker 2>on there and just watch anything that</v>

2646
02:02:48.831 --> 02:02:49.820
<v Speaker 2>we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

2647
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:52.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

2648
02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:56.190
<v Speaker 5>I think that a lot of times what's</v>
<v Speaker 5>happening with the</v>

2649
02:02:58.190 --> 02:02:59.960
<v Speaker 5>stories that are being told about</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting,</v>

2650
02:02:59.961 --> 02:03:01.850
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all everyone's preaching to the</v>

2651
02:03:01.851 --> 02:03:02.930
<v Speaker 5>converted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2652
02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:08.260
<v Speaker 5>and occasionally something comes along</v>
<v Speaker 5>like this podcast where people maybe</v>

2653
02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:12.380
<v Speaker 5>would have a prejudiced idea what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then they get introduced to a guy like</v>

2654
02:03:12.381 --> 02:03:13.700
<v Speaker 5>you or Rainelle and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2655
02:03:13.701 --> 02:03:16.290
<v Speaker 5>these aren't meatheads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These aren't dumb people.</v>

2656
02:03:16.291 --> 02:03:18.980
<v Speaker 5>Like this is a different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they realize that this is</v>

2657
02:03:18.981 --> 02:03:23.981
<v Speaker 5>actually a very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 5>honorable pursuit and very respectful</v>

2658
02:03:24.291 --> 02:03:28.040
<v Speaker 5>pursuit and really hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you were talking about like what</v>

2659
02:03:28.041 --> 02:03:30.590
<v Speaker 5>the kind of physical fitness levels that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are required of you,</v>

2660
02:03:30.591 --> 02:03:35.300
<v Speaker 5>the the knowledge and understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not some easy thing where you go</v>

2661
02:03:35.301 --> 02:03:39.890
<v Speaker 5>into the mountains and just go find an</v>
<v Speaker 5>animal that's trying to survive and kill</v>

2662
02:03:39.891 --> 02:03:41.360
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It especially with a bow and Arrow,</v>

2663
02:03:41.361 --> 02:03:42.194
<v Speaker 5>it's not easy.</v>

2664
02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Not Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if anyone.</v>

2665
02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:46.490
<v Speaker 2>I used to hear those comments that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that don't hunt,</v>

2666
02:03:46.540 --> 02:03:49.930
<v Speaker 2>oh you big hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go out there and kill an animal with a</v>

2667
02:03:49.931 --> 02:03:51.520
<v Speaker 2>gun or boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2668
02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Go give it a try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give it a try,</v>

2669
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:56.800
<v Speaker 2>see if you can do it because it's not as</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy as you might think.</v>

2670
02:03:57.190 --> 02:03:59.440
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievably difficult is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult.</v>

2671
02:03:59.610 --> 02:04:01.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean they smell you hundreds of yards</v>
<v Speaker 5>away and I'm like,</v>

2672
02:04:01.591 --> 02:04:02.570
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy gone,</v>

2673
02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:04.680
<v Speaker 2>gone and you're never going to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>close to him.</v>

2674
02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:07.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of people's interactions with</v>

2675
02:04:07.111 --> 02:04:10.140
<v Speaker 2>wildlife or an urban zones are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>national parks.</v>

2676
02:04:10.141 --> 02:04:12.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's like Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like going to the zoo.</v>

2677
02:04:12.841 --> 02:04:17.841
<v Speaker 2>It's not like where I go into remote</v>
<v Speaker 2>wilderness areas where the animals are</v>

2678
02:04:18.091 --> 02:04:21.870
<v Speaker 2>completely wild and you have no support</v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

2679
02:04:21.871 --> 02:04:26.850
<v Speaker 2>new net of safety and you just have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>rely on your skills and your ability and</v>

2680
02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:30.660
<v Speaker 2>you're just another like you're just</v>
<v Speaker 2>another Predator out there on the</v>

2681
02:04:30.661 --> 02:04:34.110
<v Speaker 2>mountain and there are things in some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those places that want each you and you</v>

2682
02:04:34.111 --> 02:04:36.300
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to adapt and deal with it and</v>

2683
02:04:36.301 --> 02:04:38.820
<v Speaker 2>be prepared and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go off the skills.</v>

2684
02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Are those solo backpacking trips your</v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite ones?</v>

2685
02:04:41.330 --> 02:04:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by far,</v>

2686
02:04:42.270 --> 02:04:43.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

2687
02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:46.170
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in those mouse there's some,</v>

2688
02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:48.780
<v Speaker 2>there's some hints that I used to do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of that.</v>

2689
02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:53.240
<v Speaker 2>I try to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually looking back on man as</v>

2690
02:04:53.250 --> 02:04:55.650
<v Speaker 2>way dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably shouldn't do that alone.</v>

2691
02:04:55.710 --> 02:04:58.830
<v Speaker 2>And then I still go do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's going to be some point I'll</v>

2692
02:04:58.831 --> 02:05:00.680
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we're,</v>

2693
02:05:00.750 --> 02:05:02.960
<v Speaker 2>we're rinella night hunted and got</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacked by the.</v>

2694
02:05:03.050 --> 02:05:04.290
<v Speaker 2>I've been in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very,</v>

2695
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:05.580
<v Speaker 2>quite a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably</v>

2696
02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:10.140
<v Speaker 2>three or four times alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Solo Watts?</v>

2697
02:05:10.230 --> 02:05:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunting deer and other things in there.</v>

2698
02:05:12.510 --> 02:05:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2699
02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:17.420
<v Speaker 2>and I think about it and go God that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>

2700
02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:18.560
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>

2701
02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:19.380
<v Speaker 2>terribly steep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2702
02:05:19.380 --> 02:05:21.840
<v Speaker 2>and to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's times that I've been in there by</v>

2703
02:05:21.841 --> 02:05:26.520
<v Speaker 2>myself and taking precaution and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember one specific time I was</v>

2704
02:05:26.521 --> 02:05:30.210
<v Speaker 2>stocking a black tail and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had my pistol in my backpack,</v>

2705
02:05:30.270 --> 02:05:32.160
<v Speaker 2>which now obviously I would never do</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2706
02:05:32.161 --> 02:05:35.250
<v Speaker 2>but I had my bear spray on my hip and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>pistol.</v>

2707
02:05:35.251 --> 02:05:37.590
<v Speaker 2>I pull it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have no bullets in the thing,</v>

2708
02:05:38.010 --> 02:05:42.540
<v Speaker 2>and I'm on a fog neck island thinking I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be dead.</v>

2709
02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:46.350
<v Speaker 2>I would have been dead if that would've</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and I wasn't by myself and I've</v>

2710
02:05:46.351 --> 02:05:48.250
<v Speaker 2>been in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shitty thing is I've been.</v>

2711
02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:52.050
<v Speaker 2>The thing that really kind of pissed me</v>
<v Speaker 2>off later was thinking the amount of</v>

2712
02:05:52.051 --> 02:05:56.520
<v Speaker 2>times I've been in those situations</v>
<v Speaker 2>alone an and just thinking,</v>

2713
02:05:56.521 --> 02:05:57.900
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to lax on that.</v>

2714
02:05:58.950 --> 02:06:01.650
<v Speaker 2>Why did you not bullets in the gun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that just one of those things?</v>

2715
02:06:01.690 --> 02:06:06.390
<v Speaker 2>You just been there too many times and</v>
<v Speaker 2>think so and I did.</v>

2716
02:06:06.490 --> 02:06:08.400
<v Speaker 2>I did have bear spray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2717
02:06:08.430 --> 02:06:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bear spray is good enough,</v>

2718
02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:13.500
<v Speaker 2>but now knowing the way that that bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>charged in bear spray would have been</v>

2719
02:06:13.501 --> 02:06:15.720
<v Speaker 2>completely useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll just run right through it.</v>

2720
02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wind was blowing so,</v>

2721
02:06:17.221 --> 02:06:20.010
<v Speaker 2>so fast in our faces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would have blinded ourselves.</v>

2722
02:06:20.850 --> 02:06:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Now whether you're coated with bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>spray in it,</v>

2723
02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:24.930
<v Speaker 2>words the bear off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2724
02:06:25.130 --> 02:06:25.963
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't.</v>

2725
02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:30.270
<v Speaker 2>You want to whip out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to whip out bear spray and 70</v>

2726
02:06:30.271 --> 02:06:32.220
<v Speaker 2>mile an hour winds that blown in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

2727
02:06:32.250 --> 02:06:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that time you'd probably 40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 miles an hour,</v>

2728
02:06:34.501 --> 02:06:37.350
<v Speaker 2>but that bear spray is not gonna work in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2729
02:06:38.130 --> 02:06:39.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>

2730
02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:43.440
<v Speaker 2>Bear sprays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I bet it works some of the time.</v>

2731
02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in in some instances is probably</v>

2732
02:06:46.111 --> 02:06:49.110
<v Speaker 2>a lot more effective friend Johnny</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rivets that he sprayed it right and the</v>

2733
02:06:49.111 --> 02:06:51.270
<v Speaker 2>grizzlies face and the grooves of walk</v>
<v Speaker 2>right through it.</v>

2734
02:06:51.290 --> 02:06:55.440
<v Speaker 2>It just closes his eyes and then shook</v>
<v Speaker 2>his head and then walk right through it.</v>

2735
02:06:55.620 --> 02:06:58.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's now I think I just</v>

2736
02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:02.340
<v Speaker 2>carried both because there's certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>instances where that is probably better</v>

2737
02:07:02.341 --> 02:07:03.174
<v Speaker 2>than option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2738
02:07:03.570 --> 02:07:06.810
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm shooting something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>charging you with a pistol is very</v>

2739
02:07:06.811 --> 02:07:11.280
<v Speaker 2>difficult in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was a 44 magnum.</v>

2740
02:07:11.550 --> 02:07:13.110
<v Speaker 2>I think in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that situation,</v>

2741
02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:15.700
<v Speaker 2>you're really relying on it when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bears on top of you.</v>

2742
02:07:16.810 --> 02:07:19.080
<v Speaker 2>It's just a last ditch effort.</v>

2743
02:07:21.450 --> 02:07:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Any of those and even those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of deterrent you have.</v>

2744
02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:27.330
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2745
02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:31.920
<v Speaker 2>hard to really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when it comes down it's either</v>

2746
02:07:31.921 --> 02:07:34.560
<v Speaker 2>going to go down and you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>away and they are,</v>

2747
02:07:34.561 --> 02:07:35.600
<v Speaker 2>you not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

2748
02:07:35.790 --> 02:07:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Do you think anything you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but horrific experience made that place</v>

2749
02:07:41.021 --> 02:07:43.300
<v Speaker 2>more attractive to you in about a year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2750
02:07:43.301 --> 02:07:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't answer before I asked it.</v>

2751
02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:51.070
<v Speaker 2>I was hoping you'd be surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The weather sucks.</v>

2752
02:07:51.071 --> 02:07:55.580
<v Speaker 2>It's hard walking around now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that the bear attacks are leads</v>

2753
02:07:55.581 --> 02:07:56.440
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2754
02:07:56.441 --> 02:07:57.900
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go.</v>

2755
02:07:58.150 --> 02:08:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I'll go back there next year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And hunt deer for sure.</v>

2756
02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I echoed in for tags in different</v>

2757
02:08:02.441 --> 02:08:04.810
<v Speaker 2>area in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll go back.</v>

2758
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:07.390
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't one of those type of</v>

2759
02:08:07.391 --> 02:08:10.780
<v Speaker 2>experiences where you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think even if I had got tore up a</v>

2760
02:08:10.781 --> 02:08:12.850
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would still go back as.</v>

2761
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not tore up a little bit defined</v>

2762
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:17.990
<v Speaker 2>like lived through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2763
02:08:18.730 --> 02:08:21.880
<v Speaker 2>What if you like lost half your nose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably go.</v>

2764
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:26.910
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably start bear hunting</v>
<v Speaker 2>grizzly.</v>

2765
02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:29.201
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2766
02:08:29.201 --> 02:08:30.940
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once it was,</v>

2767
02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:33.160
<v Speaker 2>it was one of those things I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2768
02:08:33.170 --> 02:08:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>

2769
02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:38.110
<v Speaker 2>I had an opportunity and I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2770
02:08:38.170 --> 02:08:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not big into bear hunting.</v>

2771
02:08:42.430 --> 02:08:44.470
<v Speaker 2>The meat to me is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is good.</v>

2772
02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:46.270
<v Speaker 2>It's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>

2773
02:08:46.330 --> 02:08:47.350
<v Speaker 2>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

2774
02:08:47.410 --> 02:08:48.340
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not my thing.</v>

2775
02:08:48.610 --> 02:08:50.350
<v Speaker 2>And you can't eat it medium rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2776
02:08:50.351 --> 02:08:52.270
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it where you want to eat</v>

2777
02:08:52.271 --> 02:08:53.770
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2778
02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:59.040
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing is there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some of it might just be like you</v>

2779
02:08:59.861 --> 02:09:02.110
<v Speaker 2>have emotional connections to certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2780
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:04.660
<v Speaker 2>Like I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any desire to go hunt and</v>

2781
02:09:04.661 --> 02:09:05.620
<v Speaker 2>African lion.</v>

2782
02:09:05.650 --> 02:09:10.030
<v Speaker 2>It's just not like you just whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2783
02:09:10.350 --> 02:09:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Not that I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean now if it's a thing where it's</v>

2784
02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:16.960
<v Speaker 2>like you just to save the species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go hunting and African lion,</v>

2785
02:09:16.961 --> 02:09:19.480
<v Speaker 2>then I'd probably do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not something that appeals to</v>

2786
02:09:19.481 --> 02:09:20.230
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2787
02:09:20.230 --> 02:09:22.870
<v Speaker 2>But that's like to say to save mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2788
02:09:22.871 --> 02:09:23.710
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go,</v>

2789
02:09:23.711 --> 02:09:28.540
<v Speaker 2>fuck Jennifer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jennifer flashdance with the lady.</v>

2790
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Where was she in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jennifer</v>

2791
02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:34.270
<v Speaker 2>is that flash dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2792
02:09:34.330 --> 02:09:36.250
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hunt bears.</v>

2793
02:09:36.270 --> 02:09:38.200
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with my memory?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

2794
02:09:38.201 --> 02:09:39.910
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't come up with a current hot</v>
<v Speaker 2>chick</v>

2795
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:42.743
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>

2796
02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:44.860
<v Speaker 2>You did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

2797
02:09:44.890 --> 02:09:45.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2798
02:09:45.790 --> 02:09:49.090
<v Speaker 2>it was like a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the area that I went into,</v>

2799
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:51.360
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2800
02:09:51.570 --> 02:09:55.960
<v Speaker 2>a Predator control area and it's an area</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the state of Alaska,</v>

2801
02:09:56.230 --> 02:09:58.840
<v Speaker 2>so the state of Alaska works different</v>
<v Speaker 2>than other places,</v>

2802
02:09:58.990 --> 02:10:01.690
<v Speaker 2>so I actually went and met with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>biologist and kind of like,</v>

2803
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:03.700
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the deal with this?</v>

2804
02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:08.710
<v Speaker 2>And so the deal was that there's change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The state of Alaska has to manage their</v>

2805
02:10:08.711 --> 02:10:12.040
<v Speaker 2>wildlife populations for subsistence</v>
<v Speaker 2>subsistence</v>

2806
02:10:13.630 --> 02:10:16.360
<v Speaker 2>food sources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mandated by the state.</v>

2807
02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:21.780
<v Speaker 2>So in that particular area that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator population is got so high that</v>

2808
02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:27.660
<v Speaker 2>the moose populations and populations</v>
<v Speaker 2>were in severe decline and in danger of</v>

2809
02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:35.090
<v Speaker 2>not being able to provide food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inadequate food source for the people</v>

2810
02:10:35.091 --> 02:10:37.040
<v Speaker 2>that lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I'm talking to people that</v>

2811
02:10:37.041 --> 02:10:39.230
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people live in these remote areas.</v>

2812
02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Yes they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And seeing the shows,</v>

2813
02:10:41.421 --> 02:10:44.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot more real than the shows,</v>

2814
02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:45.860
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they live in these areas where there is</v>

2815
02:10:45.861 --> 02:10:48.890
<v Speaker 2>no access to other food sources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the guys that I met,</v>

2816
02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:52.580
<v Speaker 2>the only thing he eats for an entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>year is bear meat.</v>

2817
02:10:53.330 --> 02:10:56.450
<v Speaker 2>He has no other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't know if he gets some kind</v>

2818
02:10:56.451 --> 02:10:59.780
<v Speaker 2>of grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of garden forages as well,</v>

2819
02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:02.690
<v Speaker 2>but his main food source through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>winter is bear meat.</v>

2820
02:11:03.050 --> 02:11:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Which gun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black lives right there in that area or</v>

2821
02:11:05.991 --> 02:11:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't matter.</v>

2822
02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you could get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>

2823
02:11:08.621 --> 02:11:12.470
<v Speaker 2>there's people that live in certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>places that the only way that they live</v>

2824
02:11:12.471 --> 02:11:14.870
<v Speaker 2>is from the animals that live there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the only way they could</v>

2825
02:11:14.871 --> 02:11:16.820
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to get the scientists to study</v>

2826
02:11:16.821 --> 02:11:17.654
<v Speaker 2>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2827
02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:19.310
<v Speaker 2>that'd be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an interesting guy.</v>

2828
02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:22.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean the guy who just eats bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does he like?</v>

2829
02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:26.360
<v Speaker 3>If he's like ridiculously strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will they get them to the left?</v>

2830
02:11:26.710 --> 02:11:30.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he seemed like his normal as somebody</v>

2831
02:11:30.221 --> 02:11:32.380
<v Speaker 2>that lives off grade is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

2832
02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Very odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2833
02:11:34.150 --> 02:11:36.370
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2834
02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:38.320
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this particular area,</v>

2835
02:11:38.650 --> 02:11:43.650
<v Speaker 2>the bear population was so high that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was severely hurting the undulate</v>

2836
02:11:46.181 --> 02:11:47.800
<v Speaker 2>population to the point where there</v>
<v Speaker 2>might,</v>

2837
02:11:48.130 --> 02:11:52.030
<v Speaker 2>it'd be very hard to repair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then they open up these special</v>

2838
02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:56.590
<v Speaker 2>seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for people to go in to hunt bears</v>

2839
02:11:56.650 --> 02:12:01.180
<v Speaker 2>in this particular area with a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>objective and since they opened it,</v>

2840
02:12:01.181 --> 02:12:04.150
<v Speaker 2>now that area has been starting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>recuperate and then they stop the</v>

2841
02:12:04.151 --> 02:12:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Predator management thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2842
02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.750
<v Speaker 2>they still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can hunt certain,</v>

2843
02:12:07.780 --> 02:12:09.390
<v Speaker 2>but they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've got a,</v>

2844
02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:11.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an interesting balance and they put a</v>

2845
02:12:11.711 --> 02:12:15.160
<v Speaker 2>lot of time in research and into this</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole deal.</v>

2846
02:12:15.190 --> 02:12:16.023
<v Speaker 2>The soul.</v>

2847
02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:18.740
<v Speaker 3>There's something very bizarre about</v>
<v Speaker 3>those television shows because they're,</v>

2848
02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.010
<v Speaker 3>they're captivating those people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>live off the grid.</v>

2849
02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:26.300
<v Speaker 3>But there's something really ironic</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a person who doesn't even have a</v>

2850
02:12:26.301 --> 02:12:29.240
<v Speaker 3>television in their house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're on television.</v>

2851
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:31.580
<v Speaker 3>That is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>

2852
02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy is living as close to the land</v>

2853
02:12:34.881 --> 02:12:37.610
<v Speaker 3>as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet there's some millennial behind a</v>

2854
02:12:37.611 --> 02:12:38.830
<v Speaker 3>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell him,</v>

2855
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:40.521
<v Speaker 3>tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

2856
02:12:40.521 --> 02:12:42.560
<v Speaker 3>can you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you pretend that you just found that</v>

2857
02:12:42.561 --> 02:12:43.850
<v Speaker 3>again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just put it down.</v>

2858
02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Pick it up again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2859
02:12:44.901 --> 02:12:46.640
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe this is here.</v>

2860
02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:47.720
<v Speaker 3>Just give me one of those.</v>

2861
02:12:47.740 --> 02:12:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2862
02:12:48.941 --> 02:12:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I think some of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2863
02:12:50.670 --> 02:12:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I've met quite a few people that live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in that aren't on television that</v>

2864
02:12:55.091 --> 02:12:59.080
<v Speaker 2>live in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in they're fairly strangely normal</v>

2865
02:12:59.081 --> 02:13:01.180
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of,</v>

2866
02:13:01.420 --> 02:13:04.250
<v Speaker 2>you would think that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them have the,</v>

2867
02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:07.480
<v Speaker 2>might live in a shack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've got some kind of Internet</v>

2868
02:13:07.481 --> 02:13:10.300
<v Speaker 2>service off their generator that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>run every once in a while.</v>

2869
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:11.143
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

2870
02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:14.510
<v Speaker 3>I see that vice piece on that guy that</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives in,</v>

2871
02:13:14.590 --> 02:13:17.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eastern Alaska.</v>

2876
02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:31.900
<v Speaker 3>he came out there I think as a guide or</v>
<v Speaker 3>a forestry or something like that and</v>

2877
02:13:32.851 --> 02:13:36.420
<v Speaker 3>built a cabin and he's the last guy out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there that has the,</v>

02:13:39.991 --> 02:13:42.990
<v Speaker 3>alloW that has permits to keep this</v>
<v Speaker 3>cabinet out there.</v>

2880
02:13:43.180 --> 02:13:45.150
<v Speaker 3>Heimos arctic refuge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

2881
02:13:45.151 --> 02:13:46.140
<v Speaker 3>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mo course.</v>

2882
02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:49.920
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a hunter and he lives off of</v>

2883
02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:53.210
<v Speaker 3>caribou and he takes these caribou and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2884
02:13:53.250 --> 02:13:55.230
<v Speaker 3>they're all frozen because it's all</v>
<v Speaker 3>cold.</v>

2885
02:13:55.231 --> 02:14:00.231
<v Speaker 3>They're hanging froM hanging from trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He saws it and throws it on the grill,</v>

2886
02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:04.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like saws a frozen steak and throws it</v>

2887
02:14:04.111 --> 02:14:06.750
<v Speaker 3>on the grill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's remarkably intelligent and</v>

2888
02:14:06.751 --> 02:14:07.410
<v Speaker 3>articulate.</v>

2889
02:14:07.410 --> 02:14:08.940
<v Speaker 3>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not crazy.</v>

2890
02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:11.740
<v Speaker 3>He lives up there with his wife and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2891
02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:15.570
<v Speaker 3>she's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>nun I guess.</v>

2892
02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:17.550
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what you would say?</v>

2893
02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2894
02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:22.020
<v Speaker 3>WheRe is it okay to say eskimo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because some of them prefer eskimo.</v>

2895
02:14:22.350 --> 02:14:26.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure where the line is there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people think that eskimo is a slur,</v>

2896
02:14:26.851 --> 02:14:29.280
<v Speaker 3>like you're not supposed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but other ones say no,</v>

2897
02:14:29.281 --> 02:14:32.070
<v Speaker 3>you should say eskimo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like rinella was trying to</v>

2898
02:14:32.071 --> 02:14:35.770
<v Speaker 3>explain it to me and it went in one ear</v>
<v Speaker 3>and out the other probably just where</v>

2899
02:14:35.771 --> 02:14:38.010
<v Speaker 3>they live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>YeaH.</v>

2900
02:14:38.010 --> 02:14:41.100
<v Speaker 3>But this guy lives in this shack that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller than this room,</v>

2901
02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:44.040
<v Speaker 3>smAller than the studio and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>log thing.</v>

2902
02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:46.140
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the show,</v>

2903
02:14:46.210 --> 02:14:49.890
<v Speaker 3>a bear tried to eat his dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he ran out in the middle of the</v>

2904
02:14:49.890 --> 02:14:50.611
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's dark out,</v>

2905
02:14:50.611 --> 02:14:52.860
<v Speaker 3>he's blowing his shotgun off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

2906
02:14:52.861 --> 02:14:53.611
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

2907
02:14:53.611 --> 02:14:55.680
<v Speaker 3>chasing this bear through the forest and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting it.</v>

2908
02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:58.530
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then had to skin it and send the</v>

2909
02:14:58.531 --> 02:15:00.950
<v Speaker 3>skull in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to uh,</v>

2910
02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:03.000
<v Speaker 3>tell the wildlife people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2911
02:15:03.140 --> 02:15:06.000
<v Speaker 3>It's been tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to kill my dog so I had to shoot</v>

2912
02:15:06.001 --> 02:15:06.751
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2913
02:15:06.751 --> 02:15:10.410
<v Speaker 3>Defensive life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shoot when we're defensive life or</v>

2914
02:15:10.411 --> 02:15:11.850
<v Speaker 3>property technically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2915
02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:14.790
<v Speaker 3>But this guy again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're saying,</v>

2916
02:15:14.820 --> 02:15:15.870
<v Speaker 3>remarkably normal.</v>

2917
02:15:15.930 --> 02:15:17.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of strange,</v>

2918
02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:17.970
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>

2919
02:15:17.970 --> 02:15:22.250
<v Speaker 2>in that area I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went on that hunt and then um,</v>

2920
02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:26.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eight because people have always said,</v>

2921
02:15:26.130 --> 02:15:29.220
<v Speaker 2>oh bear whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ate it.</v>

2922
02:15:29.250 --> 02:15:31.030
<v Speaker 2>And it was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was better than blackberry meet.</v>

2923
02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:32.070
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it really?</v>

2924
02:15:32.090 --> 02:15:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the whole like,</v>

2925
02:15:34.261 --> 02:15:36.380
<v Speaker 2>you caN't eat him as a weird deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my own,</v>

2926
02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:39.270
<v Speaker 2>my one thing was if I do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to eat it.</v>

2927
02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:40.853
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2928
02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:42.150
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see anything</v>

2929
02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:43.890
<v Speaker 3>wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it wasn't coastal.</v>

2930
02:15:44.190 --> 02:15:45.480
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was coastal.</v>

2931
02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:49.830
<v Speaker 3>So it was eating fish is eating seals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Navy seals tastes better.</v>

2932
02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:50.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2933
02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:52.010
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was summertime too.</v>

2934
02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:54.770
<v Speaker 2>So it would've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would've been eating fish and seals</v>

2935
02:15:54.771 --> 02:15:57.380
<v Speaker 2>and whatever can find dead dead seals</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly</v>

2936
02:15:57.550 --> 02:16:00.110
<v Speaker 3>because I remember rinella telling me</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he shot a black bear one,</v>

2937
02:16:00.111 --> 02:16:03.750
<v Speaker 3>so it'd be nothing but fish and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they smoked it and that terrible</v>

2938
02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:06.010
<v Speaker 3>borrowed a friend's smoker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't say it was terrible,</v>

2939
02:16:06.011 --> 02:16:08.020
<v Speaker 3>but he said he borrowed a friend smoker</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>

2940
02:16:08.021 --> 02:16:09.910
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to clean that smoker out.</v>

2941
02:16:10.210 --> 02:16:10.781
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

2942
02:16:10.781 --> 02:16:11.171
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2943
02:16:11.171 --> 02:16:12.670
<v Speaker 3>it smells like fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

2944
02:16:12.671 --> 02:16:14.560
<v Speaker 3>I've never smoked fish in that thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

2945
02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:16.120
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2946
02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:17.620
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they realize like,</v>

2947
02:16:17.650 --> 02:16:19.570
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's coming off of the actual meat,</v>

2948
02:16:19.900 --> 02:16:24.460
<v Speaker 3>like the bear ate so much fish that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>tasted like fish in the fat.</v>

2949
02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:26.370
<v Speaker 3>And tHen when they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2950
02:16:26.550 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they smoke this bear ham and</v>

2951
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.680
<v Speaker 2>then slice it thin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It literally tastes like salmon</v>

2952
02:16:32.681 --> 02:16:35.170
<v Speaker 2>carpaccio it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2953
02:16:35.171 --> 02:16:36.580
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't appeal to me.</v>

2954
02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:41.230
<v Speaker 2>I think if you get your head past it</v>
<v Speaker 2>like salmon.</v>

2955
02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:43.390
<v Speaker 2>So why wouldn't I like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2956
02:16:43.410 --> 02:16:45.160
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a weird bear.</v>

2957
02:16:45.161 --> 02:16:46.570
<v Speaker 2>Salmon combination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2958
02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Was somebody asked me the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well me and ronelle on mediators eight</v>

2959
02:16:50.441 --> 02:16:52.750
<v Speaker 2>that coyote in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was weird.</v>

2960
02:16:52.940 --> 02:16:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't at the time it just tasted</v>

2961
02:16:57.341 --> 02:16:58.930
<v Speaker 2>like meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was weird meat.</v>

2962
02:16:58.990 --> 02:17:02.440
<v Speaker 2>It tastes like goose or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thinking back on it,</v>

2963
02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:05.680
<v Speaker 2>it's like I have no desire to go out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat coyote again.</v>

2964
02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:06.753
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2965
02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:09.820
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just the things that are close to</v>

2966
02:17:09.821 --> 02:17:10.770
<v Speaker 2>a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2967
02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:13.540
<v Speaker 2>that's too weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of like coyotes.</v>

2968
02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:14.920
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked to seen them around.</v>

2969
02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:19.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean I feel like our weird neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is this year I got man.</v>

2970
02:17:19.350 --> 02:17:21.070
<v Speaker 2>I got charged by a lot of stuff this</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

2971
02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:23.130
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a hunting.</v>

2972
02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Where you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent you in rinella.</v>

2973
02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:27.730
<v Speaker 2>I went back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got charged with something up there?</v>

2974
02:17:27.790 --> 02:17:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is just,</v>

2975
02:17:29.570 --> 02:17:32.290
<v Speaker 2>this is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sitting there in this.</v>

2976
02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Just see like that white sandy area up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>

2977
02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:37.150
<v Speaker 2>It was like this weird white dirt up</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2978
02:17:37.540 --> 02:17:41.170
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sitting in this weird white dirt</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of the day,</v>

2979
02:17:41.350 --> 02:17:45.400
<v Speaker 2>100 degrees out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm trying to get in the shade and</v>

2980
02:17:45.401 --> 02:17:48.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually had a trip coming up that</v>

2981
02:17:48.521 --> 02:17:52.450
<v Speaker 2>we did a caribou hunt that we filmed</v>
<v Speaker 2>with under armour for one of their rigs</v>

2982
02:17:52.451 --> 02:17:55.540
<v Speaker 2>reaper series,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I've done a few of those that um,</v>

2983
02:17:55.700 --> 02:17:56.350
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brother,</v>

2984
02:17:56.350 --> 02:17:59.350
<v Speaker 2>you did one and then me and my brother</v>
<v Speaker 2>did a moose hunt.</v>

2985
02:17:59.351 --> 02:18:02.050
<v Speaker 2>That was just before that green trees.</v>

2986
02:18:02.050 --> 02:18:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Australia on cam has a couple of the on</v>
<v Speaker 2>cam's got the,</v>

2987
02:18:07.170 --> 02:18:11.950
<v Speaker 2>he had the elk this year and then the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that Australia has got the time.</v>

2988
02:18:12.060 --> 02:18:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Will chose him working in the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah that was good one.</v>

2989
02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:17.870
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2990
02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm leaving for that shortly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sitting out there makIng a list</v>

2991
02:18:23.051 --> 02:18:28.051
<v Speaker 2>on my phone and I'm full camoed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had no gloves on and I've got my</v>

2992
02:18:28.511 --> 02:18:33.511
<v Speaker 2>phone there and I hear this slight noise</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind me and I turned around in,</v>

2993
02:18:34.601 --> 02:18:39.601
<v Speaker 2>this coyote is running full speed at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like full tilt and I cocked my fist</v>

2994
02:18:40.481 --> 02:18:43.690
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that punch in the face and it like hits</v>

2995
02:18:43.691 --> 02:18:47.410
<v Speaker 2>the brakes and start skidding because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's running down hill.</v>

2996
02:18:47.710 --> 02:18:52.210
<v Speaker 2>So I think my estimation of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened was I'm sitting there with my</v>

2997
02:18:52.211 --> 02:18:57.211
<v Speaker 2>hands and cammo and saw maybe the flash</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my hands working on the phone or</v>

2998
02:18:57.311 --> 02:19:00.310
<v Speaker 2>maybe something in the flash in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone and thought it was a small animal.</v>

2999
02:19:00.550 --> 02:19:02.230
<v Speaker 2>Probably thought it was a rabbit or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3000
02:19:02.290 --> 02:19:06.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just what I'm assuming it ran in</v>

3001
02:19:06.461 --> 02:19:10.000
<v Speaker 2>so fast and so quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I heard,</v>

3002
02:19:10.001 --> 02:19:14.090
<v Speaker 2>but I happened to turn around at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right time and when I turned around at</v>

3003
02:19:14.110 --> 02:19:18.560
<v Speaker 2>things eyes I swear just doubled in size</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he hit the brakes and his ass</v>

3004
02:19:18.570 --> 02:19:20.110
<v Speaker 2>started skidding toward me because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

3005
02:19:20.410 --> 02:19:24.640
<v Speaker 2>I was going to punch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had no clue what else to do and it it</v>

3006
02:19:24.641 --> 02:19:29.641
<v Speaker 2>started like skidded and this started</v>
<v Speaker 2>rolling and then got up within could</v>

3007
02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:34.160
<v Speaker 2>have grabbed it and just reeled off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other direction 100 miles away,</v>

3008
02:19:34.370 --> 02:19:38.900
<v Speaker 2>but it was in full on attack mode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he realized what it was</v>

3009
02:19:38.901 --> 02:19:40.640
<v Speaker 2>attacking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it knew that I was a</v>

3010
02:19:40.641 --> 02:19:43.460
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it just thought movement,</v>

3011
02:19:43.610 --> 02:19:45.200
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small thing,</v>

3012
02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:48.750
<v Speaker 2>attack and when I scared the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3013
02:19:48.751 --> 02:19:49.480
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

3014
02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:51.260
<v Speaker 2>Your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little little squirrel.</v>

3015
02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Squirrel or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just coming full tilt.</v>

3016
02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:57.740
<v Speaker 2>So quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so quiet.</v>

3017
02:19:57.741 --> 02:20:00.980
<v Speaker 2>I see how they can grab stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had a mountain lion sneak</v>

3018
02:20:00.981 --> 02:20:05.210
<v Speaker 2>up on you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sneak up on me,</v>

3019
02:20:05.211 --> 02:20:09.650
<v Speaker 2>but I've been in very close proximity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Arizona,</v>

3020
02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:13.100
<v Speaker 2>hemanchu's deer with my bow probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

3021
02:20:13.101 --> 02:20:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Maybe even 10 years ago now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was going through this wash and I</v>

3022
02:20:17.691 --> 02:20:20.510
<v Speaker 2>see it drag mark and tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3023
02:20:20.570 --> 02:20:25.100
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lion killed a cow and drug it through</v>

3024
02:20:25.101 --> 02:20:28.010
<v Speaker 2>this wash and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweet.</v>

3025
02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:33.280
<v Speaker 2>I was filming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had my video camera in my backpack so</v>

3026
02:20:33.651 --> 02:20:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm bent over getting my video camera</v>
<v Speaker 2>out because I'm going to like film the</v>

3027
02:20:38.151 --> 02:20:40.790
<v Speaker 2>tracks and the drag mark and then maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>finding the cow.</v>

3028
02:20:41.350 --> 02:20:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Well in the wash it's like sand and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>each tree and some real tall grass and</v>

3029
02:20:47.301 --> 02:20:52.301
<v Speaker 2>I'm bent over going through my backpack</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I look up and maybe three,</v>

3030
02:20:52.521 --> 02:20:53.290
<v Speaker 2>four feet away.</v>

3031
02:20:53.290 --> 02:20:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Is that cat crouched down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just looking at me through the grass.</v>

3032
02:20:56.901 --> 02:20:58.360
<v Speaker 2>three or four feet away?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3033
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:59.970
<v Speaker 2>within.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3034
02:21:00.260 --> 02:21:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Two arms length.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 40 feet away.</v>

3035
02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:03.020
<v Speaker 2>So like right where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3036
02:21:03.021 --> 02:21:06.570
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I look up and I lock eyes with it</v>

3037
02:21:06.890 --> 02:21:11.890
<v Speaker 2>just and it and it like slinks back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes underneath the log and pops up at</v>

3038
02:21:12.501 --> 02:21:16.610
<v Speaker 2>maybe 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 feet and turns of stairs like oh</v>

3039
02:21:16.611 --> 02:21:19.370
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I get the camera out and then</v>

3040
02:21:19.371 --> 02:21:22.310
<v Speaker 2>it just sauntered off like digit on</v>
<v Speaker 2>film.</v>

3041
02:21:22.630 --> 02:21:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I got it walking away but I</v>

3042
02:21:24.981 --> 02:21:26.950
<v Speaker 2>didn't get it when it was close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause now I'm like,</v>

3043
02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:31.280
<v Speaker 2>now I'm digging for my pistol brushes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And where was my pistol?</v>

3044
02:21:31.281 --> 02:21:34.790
<v Speaker 2>It was in the bag too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what my deal is to keep my</v>

3045
02:21:34.791 --> 02:21:39.380
<v Speaker 2>pistol in my bag or steven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so.</v>

3046
02:21:39.381 --> 02:21:44.381
<v Speaker 2>Then it went off well what it had done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had drugged the calf into that,</v>

3047
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:49.640
<v Speaker 2>into that patch of grass and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of bury it and it just been gorging</v>

3048
02:21:49.641 --> 02:21:52.940
<v Speaker 2>on it and it was laying on top of it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even see any of that because</v>

3049
02:21:52.941 --> 02:21:55.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm so focused on the tracks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

3050
02:21:55.580 --> 02:21:59.270
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even notice it and it was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way it was the lane that the cow is</v>

3051
02:21:59.271 --> 02:22:01.550
<v Speaker 2>tucked up under the tree and covered in</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

3052
02:22:01.551 --> 02:22:05.180
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't see it until I went through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thick grass and that cat must have</v>

3053
02:22:05.181 --> 02:22:10.181
<v Speaker 2>just heard me in slunk down waiting for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me to go by and then it was probably</v>

3054
02:22:11.301 --> 02:22:12.980
<v Speaker 2>just so full.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had no end.</v>

3055
02:22:12.981 --> 02:22:15.350
<v Speaker 2>They're faring fairly shy animals as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3056
02:22:15.650 --> 02:22:19.040
<v Speaker 2>but I was very vulnerable position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could have easily jumped on me,</v>

3057
02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:24.200
<v Speaker 2>easily know the only thing I saw was its</v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes and there because it blended in so</v>

3058
02:22:24.201 --> 02:22:25.110
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

3059
02:22:25.111 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 2>One thing that I was shocked</v>

3060
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:29.580
<v Speaker 3>by when we were in Nevada is Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nevada.</v>

3061
02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:33.870
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now I know I say Nevada that we were</v>

3062
02:22:33.871 --> 02:22:38.280
<v Speaker 3>in Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many domestic cows wander through</v>

3063
02:22:38.281 --> 02:22:40.960
<v Speaker 3>those areas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grazing and that they,</v>

3064
02:22:41.500 --> 02:22:44.220
<v Speaker 3>they spend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how that works.</v>

3065
02:22:44.310 --> 02:22:47.070
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pay money for permits to allow</v>

3066
02:22:47.071 --> 02:22:48.210
<v Speaker 3>these cows to graze.</v>

3067
02:22:48.310 --> 02:22:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lease a lease it and then you pay x</v>

3068
02:22:51.071 --> 02:22:53.590
<v Speaker 2>amount to the forest service for</v>
<v Speaker 2>grazing,</v>

3069
02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:55.660
<v Speaker 2>atonement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain areas and then generally you</v>

3070
02:22:55.661 --> 02:22:57.910
<v Speaker 2>have to have him off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but October 1st.</v>

3071
02:22:58.390 --> 02:23:03.370
<v Speaker 3>So like me and dan dody were on a stock</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're moving through this area and</v>

3072
02:23:03.371 --> 02:23:07.330
<v Speaker 3>then we hear some noise and this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>cows standing in front of us.</v>

3073
02:23:07.670 --> 02:23:10.120
<v Speaker 3>Like tHis is just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you feel like you shouldn't be</v>

3074
02:23:10.121 --> 02:23:11.680
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like at my end,</v>

3075
02:23:11.980 --> 02:23:14.950
<v Speaker 3>some farm somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're not there just just running</v>

3076
02:23:14.951 --> 02:23:16.510
<v Speaker 3>their cows grAzing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3077
02:23:16.511 --> 02:23:18.640
<v Speaker 3>And then they'll go up in horses and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just round them up.</v>

3078
02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Push them down into the field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3079
02:23:20.501 --> 02:23:21.510
<v Speaker 3>So odd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3080
02:23:21.511 --> 02:23:25.030
<v Speaker 3>I didn't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always thought that cows were in pens</v>

3081
02:23:25.031 --> 02:23:26.490
<v Speaker 3>and that's just the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

3082
02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:29.860
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of cows that are just</v>
<v Speaker 3>wandering around on grazing land.</v>

3083
02:23:30.050 --> 02:23:31.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all open range.</v>

3084
02:23:31.820 --> 02:23:34.700
<v Speaker 2>That was with all that bundy stuff up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oregon was about right.</v>

3085
02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:37.640
<v Speaker 2>It was about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an expert on it,</v>

3086
02:23:37.850 --> 02:23:39.320
<v Speaker 2>but I remember them talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>IT was.</v>

3087
02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't pay his,</v>

3088
02:23:41.250 --> 02:23:45.860
<v Speaker 2>his fees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said have to erica.</v>

3089
02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:48.440
<v Speaker 2>She was on blm land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which.</v>

3090
02:23:49.100 --> 02:23:49.933
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3091
02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:52.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean with bureau of land management.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3092
02:23:52.850 --> 02:23:54.830
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fees aren't,</v>

3093
02:23:54.860 --> 02:23:57.730
<v Speaker 2>weren't even that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot cheaper than having an on</v>

3094
02:23:57.731 --> 02:23:59.210
<v Speaker 2>private land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3095
02:23:59.660 --> 02:24:02.030
<v Speaker 2>well there's something that happens to</v>
<v Speaker 2>white people when you leave him alone</v>

3096
02:24:02.031 --> 02:24:02.864
<v Speaker 2>with guns.</v>

3098
02:24:07.371 --> 02:24:09.560
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They almost always get a little</v>

3099
02:24:09.561 --> 02:24:10.590
<v Speaker 2>squirrely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3100
02:24:10.940 --> 02:24:13.850
<v Speaker 2>the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a weird stand up though.</v>

3101
02:24:13.940 --> 02:24:17.720
<v Speaker 2>It was very strange because there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>shootouts with the federal rallies and</v>

3102
02:24:17.721 --> 02:24:20.600
<v Speaker 2>everything and they take over soMe kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>

3103
02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:24.040
<v Speaker 2>like forest reserve area.</v>

3104
02:24:24.290 --> 02:24:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something happened.</v>

3105
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Refuge won some kind of federal little</v>
<v Speaker 2>building out there.</v>

3106
02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:30.663
<v Speaker 2>And there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>

3107
02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:32.750
<v Speaker 2>one of them was shot and killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3108
02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:35.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like a big uproar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3109
02:24:35.791 --> 02:24:40.760
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of other fucking yahoo's white</v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes with guns flew there to sort of</v>

3110
02:24:40.761 --> 02:24:42.900
<v Speaker 2>help out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when It got real weird memory of</v>

3111
02:24:42.901 --> 02:24:44.540
<v Speaker 2>those big standoff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3112
02:24:44.541 --> 02:24:47.720
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See my mile thought on it is,</v>

3113
02:24:47.770 --> 02:24:49.040
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's public land.</v>

3114
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:51.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not your land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's our land.</v>

3115
02:24:51.950 --> 02:24:54.860
<v Speaker 2>So you can't go do commercial shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like,</v>

3116
02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:55.491
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

3117
02:24:55.491 --> 02:24:58.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to go open up a hotel on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the forest service land over here</v>

3118
02:24:58.791 --> 02:25:01.430
<v Speaker 2>because it's my land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's government it,</v>

3119
02:25:01.580 --> 02:25:02.450
<v Speaker 2>I own it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3120
02:25:02.451 --> 02:25:04.000
<v Speaker 2>it's everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's shit.</v>

3121
02:25:04.260 --> 02:25:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3122
02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:07.010
<v Speaker 2>But people have weird ways justifying</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

3123
02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:11.330
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if he's giving out as beef for</v>
<v Speaker 2>free to everyone who owns the land,</v>

3124
02:25:11.690 --> 02:25:13.850
<v Speaker 2>that's the one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he wasn't doing that.</v>

3125
02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:14.690
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Different place.</v>

3137
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:37.660
<v Speaker 2>YeaH.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was amazing where they</v>

3138
02:25:37.690 --> 02:25:41.680
<v Speaker 2>showed how they preserve buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they would cut it really thin and</v>

3139
02:25:41.681 --> 02:25:44.690
<v Speaker 2>hanging on clotheslines to dry it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make machaca as</v>

3140
02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:48.940
<v Speaker 2>a I went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been to that place a couple times.</v>

3141
02:25:48.941 --> 02:25:51.040
<v Speaker 2>That place is pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where they've got those buffalo down</v>

3142
02:25:51.041 --> 02:25:52.150
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you did?</v>

3143
02:25:52.151 --> 02:25:54.490
<v Speaker 2>That episode of solo hunter where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the wolf skin?</v>

3144
02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:56.270
<v Speaker 2>A apex predator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apex predator,</v>

3145
02:25:56.310 --> 02:25:56.650
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3146
02:25:56.650 --> 02:25:58.330
<v Speaker 2>and we still those apex predator</v>
<v Speaker 2>episodes,</v>

3147
02:25:58.331 --> 02:26:03.331
<v Speaker 2>you can still go apex predator.tv and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just want to get them,</v>

3148
02:26:03.521 --> 02:26:04.900
<v Speaker 2>you can get the downloads still.</v>

3149
02:26:05.020 --> 02:26:06.640
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the only place that</v>
<v Speaker 2>exists now.</v>

3150
02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.290
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3151
02:26:08.291 --> 02:26:09.280
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was cool.</v>

3152
02:26:09.281 --> 02:26:14.050
<v Speaker 2>They show up sometime on dvr because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you as a season pass,</v>

3153
02:26:14.051 --> 02:26:15.670
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes they'll just throw one</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

3154
02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

3155
02:26:17.020 --> 02:26:19.010
<v Speaker 2>On the channel and it'll just pop up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3156
02:26:19.210 --> 02:26:20.260
<v Speaker 2>that's what my buddy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3157
02:26:20.370 --> 02:26:22.890
<v Speaker 2>they're doing an apex predator marathon</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3158
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Can they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you want to do more of those?</v>

3159
02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoyed doing it,</v>

3160
02:26:29.890 --> 02:26:34.110
<v Speaker 2>but the other thing is I also liked</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else I was doing and there</v>

3161
02:26:34.111 --> 02:26:38.110
<v Speaker 2>was a lot of tv networks are dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

3162
02:26:38.480 --> 02:26:43.480
<v Speaker 2>it seems like they don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want shows it or it was a,</v>

3163
02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:46.900
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an extremely high quality show</v>

3164
02:26:46.901 --> 02:26:50.740
<v Speaker 2>for that network and those high quality</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows Costs too much for that network to</v>

3165
02:26:50.741 --> 02:26:53.240
<v Speaker 2>make is whether it ended up being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3166
02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:55.480
<v Speaker 2>now is there a way to do something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that for the internet?</v>

3167
02:26:55.870 --> 02:26:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Because I know that netflix is starting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do rinella.</v>

3168
02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flicks and he's still on regular tv too,</v>

3169
02:27:01.631 --> 02:27:02.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3170
02:27:02.350 --> 02:27:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're just reruns.</v>

3171
02:27:04.481 --> 02:27:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure new stuff is just going to</v>

3172
02:27:06.881 --> 02:27:08.170
<v Speaker 2>be on netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3173
02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:10.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really sure how interesting.</v>

3174
02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to ask him,</v>

3175
02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:14.650
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3176
02:27:14.651 --> 02:27:15.251

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3177
02:27:15.251 --> 02:27:18.340
<v Speaker 2>I think there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be a plaCe for that kind of</v>

3178
02:27:18.341 --> 02:27:21.610
<v Speaker 2>stuff in the future when I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3179
02:27:21.670 --> 02:27:24.100
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed doing it but I also didn't</v>

3180
02:27:24.101 --> 02:27:28.840
<v Speaker 2>want to do 15 episodes of it a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there was other things that I</v>

3181
02:27:28.841 --> 02:27:32.050
<v Speaker 2>enjoy doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy doing those under armor pieces.</v>

3182
02:27:32.051 --> 02:27:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy giving solo hunters enjoy doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of stuff.</v>

3183
02:27:36.610 --> 02:27:40.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't like just doing one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you do a lot of New Zealand as</v>

3184
02:27:40.361 --> 02:27:42.730
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll be going over to New Zealand</v>

02:27:42.731 --> 02:27:43.564
<v Speaker 2>this year.</v>

3186
02:27:45.060 --> 02:27:47.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's a place where again,</v>

3187
02:27:47.740 --> 02:27:50.230
<v Speaker 2>it's all invasive species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>invasive species in New Zealand and</v>

3188
02:27:50.231 --> 02:27:52.780
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked Australia when I went</v>

3189
02:27:52.781 --> 02:27:57.781
<v Speaker 2>there actually that a video with green</v>
<v Speaker 2>tree and cam actually swung by kind of</v>

3190
02:27:58.571 --> 02:28:02.320
<v Speaker 2>crash their party for a couple of days</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're taking is cool as fun.</v>

3191
02:28:03.350 --> 02:28:06.910
<v Speaker 2>I had a good time over there and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>went and did my own thing after they,</v>

3192
02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:10.030
<v Speaker 2>after they left for their buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of went off and did my own thing</v>

3193
02:28:10.031 --> 02:28:11.470
<v Speaker 2>somewhere completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3194
02:28:11.471 --> 02:28:12.520
<v Speaker 2>you went by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3195
02:28:12.850 --> 02:28:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3196
02:28:14.231 --> 02:28:16.900
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend over there and so we</v>

3197
02:28:16.901 --> 02:28:21.200
<v Speaker 2>drove out into arnhem land which is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>aboriginal land.</v>

3198
02:28:21.201 --> 02:28:22.310
<v Speaker 2>We got special permission</v>

3199
02:28:22.310 --> 02:28:25.700
<v Speaker 1>and got all these permits and everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we drove out there and went hunting</v>

3200
02:28:25.790 --> 02:28:28.340
<v Speaker 1>for a week and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks,</v>

3201
02:28:28.341 --> 02:28:30.380
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3202
02:28:30.540 --> 02:28:32.510
<v Speaker 1>and then we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we only had one vehicle between</v>

3203
02:28:32.511 --> 02:28:35.450
<v Speaker 1>the two of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I dropped him off somewhere and then</v>

3204
02:28:35.451 --> 02:28:39.050
<v Speaker 1>I'd drive out and then go hunt and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next day he would take the vehicle</v>

3205
02:28:39.051 --> 02:28:42.140
<v Speaker 1>and I would go out and hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was hunting by myself for most,</v>

3206
02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:43.790
<v Speaker 1>most of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

3207
02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:48.530
<v Speaker 1>I liked that experience because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinda dangerous and buffalo,</v>

3208
02:28:49.010 --> 02:28:51.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's when you only have a bow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're completely by yourself.</v>

3209
02:28:52.220 --> 02:28:54.410
<v Speaker 1>There is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you aren't gonna get medivaced out of</v>

3210
02:28:54.411 --> 02:28:59.360
<v Speaker 1>there in a helicopter because you're 13</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours by vehicle from the nearest town.</v>

3211
02:29:00.340 --> 02:29:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you even get out.</v>

3212
02:29:02.660 --> 02:29:07.040
<v Speaker 1>He'd be in a world of hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear that adult greentree fuck that</v>

3213
02:29:07.041 --> 02:29:07.874
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

3214
02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:11.010
<v Speaker 1>He's keeps trying to get me to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop it at him.</v>

3215
02:29:11.550 --> 02:29:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool place.</v>

3216
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:15.770
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a certain type of person will</v>

3217
02:29:15.771 --> 02:29:17.570
<v Speaker 1>really like it and other people will</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate it.</v>

3218
02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:18.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like you.</v>

3219
02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:20.650
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need to have a television</v>
<v Speaker 1>show or not,</v>

3220
02:29:21.250 --> 02:29:26.250
<v Speaker 1>if not a television show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some real in depth show that that they</v>

3221
02:29:26.991 --> 02:29:29.990
<v Speaker 1>do on the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shows like the preparation that's</v>

3222
02:29:29.991 --> 02:29:32.420
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's something that most</v>

3223
02:29:32.421 --> 02:29:35.810
<v Speaker 1>people are ignorant to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm kind of obsessed with that.</v>

3224
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:38.810
<v Speaker 1>The idea of explaining it to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3225
02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that hunt.</v>

3226
02:29:40.700 --> 02:29:43.040
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I filmed it for solo so you can watch</v>

3227
02:29:43.041 --> 02:29:44.450
<v Speaker 1>that and I thought that turned out</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good.</v>

3228
02:29:44.451 --> 02:29:45.450
<v Speaker 1>That was really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it,</v>

3229
02:29:45.980 --> 02:29:49.460
<v Speaker 1>but there's just something to you about</v>
<v Speaker 1>north american hunting and we have so</v>

3230
02:29:49.461 --> 02:29:50.240
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

3231
02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot of awesome places here,</v>

3232
02:29:54.460 --> 02:29:57.000
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people live close to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably don't even take advantage of</v>

3233
02:29:57.001 --> 02:29:58.280
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of cool places and a</v>

3234
02:29:58.281 --> 02:30:03.281
<v Speaker 1>lot of cool things you can do in the us</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the western us and it was just a</v>

3235
02:30:04.431 --> 02:30:05.840
<v Speaker 1>lot of cool places around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3236
02:30:05.841 --> 02:30:08.360
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I said when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were in Nevada,</v>

3237
02:30:08.510 --> 02:30:09.051
<v Speaker 1>set it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3238
02:30:09.051 --> 02:30:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got it.</v>

3239
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:11.240
<v Speaker 1>When we were up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3240
02:30:11.300 --> 02:30:13.720
<v Speaker 1>outside of reno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like three hours outside of reno,</v>

3241
02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:16.860
<v Speaker 1>somewhere like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was saying,</v>

3242
02:30:16.980 --> 02:30:20.960
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this might as well be some alien world.</v>

3243
02:30:21.250 --> 02:30:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Like there's nothing up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3244
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:26.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of public land and not much in</v>

3245
02:30:26.031 --> 02:30:29.960
<v Speaker 1>between.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these big giant hills and valleys</v>

3246
02:30:29.961 --> 02:30:31.890
<v Speaker 1>where there's nothing in them but</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

3247
02:30:31.891 --> 02:30:33.320
<v Speaker 1>And it's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3248
02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:35.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No mountains or</v>

3249
02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:39.040
<v Speaker 1>13,000 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3250
02:30:39.170 --> 02:30:41.570
<v Speaker 1>it's on one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty incredible.</v>

3251
02:30:41.630 --> 02:30:45.530
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also incredible that so few</v>

3252
02:30:45.531 --> 02:30:48.620
<v Speaker 1>people understand that this is all</v>
<v Speaker 1>public land.</v>

3253
02:30:48.621 --> 02:30:51.650
<v Speaker 1>You can go out there anytime you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go travel this stuff.</v>

3254
02:30:51.651 --> 02:30:55.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons why people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like back country hunters and anglers</v>

3255
02:30:55.950 --> 02:30:58.660
<v Speaker 1>and conservation groups are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

3256
02:30:58.900 --> 02:31:03.800
<v Speaker 1>They preserve your access to these</v>
<v Speaker 1>places because there are so many places</v>

3257
02:31:03.801 --> 02:31:08.450
<v Speaker 1>like that that are just fantastic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there for you and most people</v>

3258
02:31:08.451 --> 02:31:10.970
<v Speaker 1>don't even know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you have zero desire to go</v>

3259
02:31:10.971 --> 02:31:12.590
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go and visit.</v>

3260
02:31:12.650 --> 02:31:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Just go and wander through those woods</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Idaho.</v>

3261
02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3262
02:31:17.480 --> 02:31:22.350
<v Speaker 1>there's some cool places that there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just cool to walk into a spot.</v>

3263
02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Especially Idaho has got huge wilderness</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

3264
02:31:25.621 --> 02:31:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Walk in there and look around and think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what everything looks like when</v>

3265
02:31:30.421 --> 02:31:31.140
<v Speaker 1>there's no roads.</v>

3266
02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:33.390
<v Speaker 1>When there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing you might be the only</v>

3267
02:31:33.391 --> 02:31:36.300
<v Speaker 1>person for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool feeling to be know that</v>

3268
02:31:36.301 --> 02:31:39.750
<v Speaker 1>there's no one else around and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>much different than it was 5,000 years</v>

3269
02:31:39.751 --> 02:31:40.584
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

3270
02:31:40.720 --> 02:31:43.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not much has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

3271
02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:44.310
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get out of here for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stop.</v>
