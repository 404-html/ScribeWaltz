00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what I'm doing at a</v>

2
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 1>level that you can start in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.960

<v Speaker 1>And that's so tam important and it</v>

5
00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 1>gives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can feel sorry for themselves.</v>

6
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>They can say they can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the energy there to beat</v>

7
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:19.650

<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit.</v>

8
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>There's always something you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always something if you,</v>

9
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>but if you give yourself that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse,</v>

10
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I love about that video is if</v>

<v Speaker 1>and if he writes me back,</v>

30
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I think I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it a try.</v>

31
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>You go crazy.</v>

34
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>But he said four words or he wrote four</v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

35
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.130
<v Speaker 1>I can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

36
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 1>give me your number right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I called them on the fucker up.</v>

37
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>If you say you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say you can't,</v>

38
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that you say you can or you say</v>

<v Speaker 1>you camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

40
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know said that originally who</v>

41
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Henry Ford is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always say,</v>

43
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.280
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did he ever do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did he ever do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for when he said,</v>

45
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

46
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>give me your number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I called them and I said,</v>

47
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked for about an hour.</v>

48
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Two weeks later he calls me back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main thing I talked to him in in,</v>

49
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.980
<v Speaker 1>in that conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is again what positively going to</v>

50
00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>stop the war is all about as important</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the workout is as important as the</v>

51
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:12.981
<v Speaker 1>eating plan is 10% of the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 90% is right between your ears right</v>

52
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:15.390
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that six inch piece of real estate,</v>

53
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 1>the story you tell yourself and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can really just get past that</v>

54
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>story and start re telling yourself a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different story.</v>

55
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>An example would be when I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I went from my whole theme</v>

56
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>induction speech in front of 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in millions of people on USA and</v>

57
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:35.950
<v Speaker 1>on the wwe network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is only nine 99 about a wife.</v>

58
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like a ribbed bottom line is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I wasn't in the back going,</v>

59
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I don't fuck this up.</v>

60
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if I forget what was going to say?</v>

61
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sucks.</v>

62
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if like what if I fuck up?</v>

63
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm saying it's going to be best</v>

64
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>thing I've ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to blow people away and make</v>

65
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>them laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them cry.</v>

66
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to inspire them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was my inner voice.</v>

67
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I went out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did the best thing I've ever done,</v>

68
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.110
<v Speaker 1>like it's the best thing I've ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's about that story that you tell</v>

69
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>yourself when you get all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why people listen to you</v>

70
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 1>because they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to be reminded over and over</v>

71
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

72
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>the way you think about things is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

73
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>It's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost more important than the</v>

74
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:19.370
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

75
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>The Way and the way this guy decided</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was going to change his life,</v>

76
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>that that video is so important to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

77
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's ever,</v>

78
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>that's the best testimonial video you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever going to say?</v>

79
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm running boldly with an l by my name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

80
00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:34.440
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to change the Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a decent brand.</v>

81
00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:36.510
<v Speaker 2>It's what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you putting the button on my stuff?</v>

82
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm always libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to,</v>

83
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.190
<v Speaker 2>to build the brand out to be a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>brand.</v>

84
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.820
<v Speaker 2>So if I win the brands better people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll do that.</v>

85
00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:46.770
<v Speaker 2>We'll raise my money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be a real third party.</v>

86
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a third party in the United</v>

87
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.360
<v Speaker 2>States which will make better democrats</v>
<v Speaker 2>and better republicans will literally be</v>

108
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.510
<v Speaker 2>if I don't get out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't even debate stage and I don't</v>

109
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 2>come in second or third,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then no one's going to hear me because</v>

<v Speaker 2>but guess what?</v>

114
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Someone will figure out the right one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It won't be just keep giving it money.</v>

115
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.250
<v Speaker 2>It won't be that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be something that'll actually</v>

116
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:07.830
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be something brand new and exciting</v>

117
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.420
<v Speaker 2>and get people to come back to our</v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

118
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.750
<v Speaker 2>What I don't want is what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>now is kids get educated,</v>

119
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 2>they leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't come back with the edge,</v>

120
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.890
<v Speaker 2>get someplace else and never come back.</v>

121
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 1>It's the wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really into crafts from shit man.</v>

122
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.660
<v Speaker 1>I always have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love handmade pool cues and this desk,</v>

123
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:28.780
<v Speaker 1>which is a handmade desk and I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that I really</v>

124
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:33.781
<v Speaker 1>appreciate in this modern digital world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also feel like unfortunately it</v>

125
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:36.460
<v Speaker 1>may be one of the things that slipping</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

126
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.130
<v Speaker 3>It definitely is slipping away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think with,</v>

127
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

128
00:05:41.421 --> 00:05:44.030
<v Speaker 3>with technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>technology has been great for us and a</v>

129
00:05:44.031 --> 00:05:46.990
<v Speaker 3>lot of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we couldn't be fucking talking into</v>

130
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.870
<v Speaker 3>a piece of metal and it's recorded on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the computer going through a wire flying</v>

131
00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:52.700
<v Speaker 3>through the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it does a lot of great things.</v>

132
00:05:52.701 --> 00:05:57.701
<v Speaker 3>But in doing all those great things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually has taken us away from</v>

133
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 3>really creating and working with our</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>

134
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 3>And so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

135
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 3>even this whole like a farm to table</v>
<v Speaker 3>movement where people even growing their</v>

136
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 3>own vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got your own chickens,</v>

137
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're laying eggs for you.</v>

138
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 3>Like knowing where this stuff is coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

139
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 3>having like firsthand contact with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

140
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 3>just having that relationship in general</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it brings so much more value to the</v>

141
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 3>overall experience of eating those eggs</v>
<v Speaker 3>are using that knife or sitting at this</v>

142
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 3>fucking table right here</v>

143
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.050
<v Speaker 1>and it seems like a fairly recent</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement in that direction.</v>

144
00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it feels like things got so digital</v>

145
00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:35.710
<v Speaker 1>that people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

146
00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

147
00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:40.050
<v Speaker 1>What the facebook and the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram I want to I I,</v>

148
00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:41.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a wood table.</v>

149
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to saw this bitch myself.</v>

150
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your hands on it.</v>

151
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it to be fantastic.</v>

152
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want real stuff.</v>

153
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.060
<v Speaker 1>And there's something about handmade</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

154
00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:56.640
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a handmade pair of boots</v>
<v Speaker 1>are handmade bag like this.</v>

155
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something about things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are made by hand that people get at like</v>

156
00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:01.380
<v Speaker 1>a deep appreciation of,</v>

157
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.470
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

158
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it,</v>

159
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.850
<v Speaker 3>I think it also kind of goes back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was saying,</v>

160
00:07:06.851 --> 00:07:11.350
<v Speaker 3>like as technology has advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've kind of grown away from these kind</v>

161
00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:14.920
<v Speaker 3>of what's considered like blue collar</v>
<v Speaker 3>work and craftsmanship kind of work.</v>

162
00:07:14.921 --> 00:07:19.921
<v Speaker 3>But I think people really are driven by</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sense of achievement and when you're</v>

163
00:07:20.771 --> 00:07:25.270
<v Speaker 3>doing data entry that literally millions</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people fucking monkeys can be trained</v>

164
00:07:25.271 --> 00:07:27.220
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not to like diminish anything that</v>

165
00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:29.020
<v Speaker 3>anybody's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but literally like</v>

166
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.970
<v Speaker 3>to be able to go into a craft and to and</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a hands on experience is very,</v>

167
00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:37.061
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

168
00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:38.680
<v Speaker 3>very different in that sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>achievement.</v>

169
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.430
<v Speaker 3>Even when somebody comes out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>something and maybe I taught a class on</v>

170
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:44.320
<v Speaker 3>how to make a knife and it looks like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Turd,</v>

171
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.140
<v Speaker 3>they're going to think it looks like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most beautiful fucking knife they've</v>

172
00:07:47.141 --> 00:07:51.550
<v Speaker 3>ever seen in their life because their</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands and their creativity touched their</v>

173
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.990
<v Speaker 3>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

174
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.740
<v Speaker 3>their sweat and pop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably some of their blood is put into</v>

175
00:07:56.741 --> 00:07:59.500
<v Speaker 3>creating that thing and that brings that</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more value to it.</v>

176
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I was,</v>

177
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 4>like I was saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could get kids to believe in</v>

178
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:03.860
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get brain.</v>

179
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.060
<v Speaker 4>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could get my son into Satan easily.</v>

180
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.380
<v Speaker 4>He'd be all in all about Lucifer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

181
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.100
<v Speaker 4>I got them into the Brown kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

182
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>

183
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.700
<v Speaker 4>He's so into the dodgers because his</v>
<v Speaker 4>grandpa isn't at the dodgers,</v>

184
00:08:18.701 --> 00:08:22.070
<v Speaker 4>so he's all about the dodgers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I got them into the browns.</v>

185
00:08:22.071 --> 00:08:25.210
<v Speaker 4>He's all in the browns now too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I could get them into anything.</v>

186
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.080
<v Speaker 4>So I sat them down and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are,</v>

187
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to sit you down and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to show you the master of the nunchucks.</v>

188
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 4>And it's Bruce Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's number one dude.</v>

189
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 4>He's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the greatest martial artist of all</v>

190
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I broke them and I sat him down and put</v>

191
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:47.420
<v Speaker 4>them in front of the TV to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should have filmed this.</v>

192
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.150
<v Speaker 4>I did you fill the whole thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You filmed you saying it to him?</v>

193
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't film that,</v>

194
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 4>but I filmed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I filmed him watching Bruce Lee.</v>

195
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

196
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.050
<v Speaker 4>first I showed him the greatest nunchuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>scenes of all time with Bruce Lee that</v>

197
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:02.540
<v Speaker 4>you can go to youtube and you can get</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

198
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.550
<v Speaker 4>There's compilations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put together the one from the stuff</v>

199
00:09:06.551 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 4>in end of the drag and the stuff in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chinese connection,</v>

200
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.983
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

201
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 4>a way of the dragon or return of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dragon.</v>

202
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.671
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

203
00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 4>so I sat him down and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to blitz them with this shit.</v>

204
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to make sure that whenever he</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks about fucking nun chucks,</v>

205
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 4>he knows that Bruce Lee's the master.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

206
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.670
<v Speaker 4>So he's just completely blown away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then after I showed him all the</v>

207
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 4>nunchucks scenes with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sat him down and I want to show him</v>

208
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 4>the greatest fights of all time.</v>

209
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.580
<v Speaker 4>Bruce Lee versus Chuck fucking norris</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on that.</v>

210
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.090
<v Speaker 4>So I just wanted to leave that just in</v>
<v Speaker 4>his DNA and I fell on that.</v>

211
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:42.180
<v Speaker 4>I filmed him watching a chuck Norris and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bruce Lee,</v>

212
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 4>and he always wants to know he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he loves,</v>

213
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.960
<v Speaker 4>he loves Bruce Lee instantly and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

214
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.800
<v Speaker 4>he needs to know who wins the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I,</v>

215
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:52.980
<v Speaker 4>daddy does Bruce Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I go,</v>

216
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.980
<v Speaker 4>he always wins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sunny always wins.</v>

217
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.690
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my natural reaction,</v>

218
00:09:57.691 --> 00:09:59.970
<v Speaker 4>cause he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's constantly asking questions.</v>

219
00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:01.090
<v Speaker 4>He's constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does he win?</v>

220
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Speaker 4>My natural reaction would be just watch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch you gotta watch this because it's</v>

221
00:10:04.651 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 4>going to be sweeter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you watch it and you go through the</v>

222
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:08.160
<v Speaker 4>ups and downs and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

223
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:09.480
<v Speaker 4>Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to tell me now.</v>

224
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.441
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

225
00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:12.540
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna like it more if you just</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch it,</v>

226
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.550
<v Speaker 4>you got no daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This Bruce Lee,</v>

227
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 4>when he wants to fucking know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he don't want to be disappointed.</v>

228
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he got years old.</v>

229
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got completely blown away.</v>

230
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 4>So a week later,</v>
