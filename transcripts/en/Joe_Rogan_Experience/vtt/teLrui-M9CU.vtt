1
00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>The general experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really what I'm doing at a</v>

2
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:08.050
<v Speaker 1>level that you can start in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.980
<v Speaker 1>So there's no more fucking excuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking excuses,</v>

4
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 1>and that's so important because people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can feel sorry for themselves.</v>

5
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>They can say they can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the energy there to beat</v>

6
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit.</v>

7
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>There's always something you can do as</v>
<v Speaker 1>always if you.</v>

8
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>But if you give yourself that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse,</v>

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.080
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

10
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>What I love about that video is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody had an excuse,</v>

11
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:31.190
<v Speaker 1>it's that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

12
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean two canes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant belly blown out,</v>

13
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:38.460
<v Speaker 1>knees blown out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back veteran paratrooper,</v>

<v Speaker 1>jumping out of fucking airplanes over</v>

15
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blows his body apart and you fixed it</v>

16
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>and he fixed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fixed.</v>

17
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I just literally like credit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So would I send them the food plant</v>

18
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 1>right from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

19
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>from Fred [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dream,</v>

20
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>the food plan because it just regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

21
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.460
<v Speaker 1>But like what do you have the meeting</v>
<v Speaker 1>like chicken,</v>

22
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.291
<v Speaker 1>steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

23
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:01.070
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's finish her.</v>

24
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>So people's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll hear me say in my program over</v>

25
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>and over and over and over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

26
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Make the DDP why your own bike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I explained to Arthur when I called</v>

27
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well here's what happened.</v>

28
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sent him the food plan.</v>

30
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>Let me say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if he writes me back I think I can</v>

31
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it a try.</v>

32
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.283
<v Speaker 1>You go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

33
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

34
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep me posted.</v>

35
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>But he said four words or he wrote for</v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

36
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>I can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

37
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 1>give me your number right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I call the motherfucker up.</v>

38
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>If you say you can use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say you can't,</v>

39
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that say you can't or you say</v>

40
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:37.510
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

41
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>You said that originally who Henry Ford</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

42
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:41.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always say,</v>

44
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did he ever do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck did he ever do?</v>

45
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>But for when he said I can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

46
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>give me your number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I called them and I said,</v>

47
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked for about an hour.</v>

48
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Two weeks later he calls me back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main thing I talked to him in in in</v>

49
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>that conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is again what positively on stop</v>

50
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 1>was all about as important as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>workout is,</v>

51
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>as important as the eating plan is 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the equation.</v>

52
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 1>The 90 percent is right between your</v>
<v Speaker 1>ears right here,</v>

53
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>that six inch piece of real estate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story you tell yourself,</v>

54
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can really just get past that</v>

55
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>story and start</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling yourself a different story,</v>

56
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>and example would be when I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I went from my hall of fame</v>

57
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Induction Speech in front of 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in millions of people on USA and</v>

58
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>on the wwe network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is only nine 99.</v>

59
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.500
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a rib bottom line is,</v>

60
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>is that I wasn't in the back going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

61
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>I hope I don't fuck this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

62
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>what if I forget what was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

63
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 1>this sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I.</v>

64
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>What if I fuck up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say.</v>

65
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm saying this can be the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing ever done.</v>

66
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to blow people away and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>them laugh.</v>

67
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Make them cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to inspire them and that was</v>

68
00:02:56.311 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>my inner voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went out there,</v>

69
00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>did the best thing I've ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best thing I've ever done,</v>

70
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's about that story that you tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself when you get all this shit and</v>

71
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.450
<v Speaker 1>that's why people listen to you because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>

72
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>They need to be reminded it over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over again.</v>

73
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you think about things is so</v>

74
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so important.</v>

75
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:18.910
<v Speaker 1>It's almost more important than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>

76
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Way and the way this guy decided</v>

77
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:26.240
<v Speaker 1>that he was going to change his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that video is so important to</v>

78
00:03:26.241 --> 00:03:26.681
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

79
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>if there's ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best testimonial video you're</v>

80
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:30.094
<v Speaker 1>ever going to say.</v>

81
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm running boldly with an l by my name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

82
00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:35.040
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to change the brand so</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a decent brand is what I'm doing.</v>

83
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Or you put libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my stuff.</v>

84
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost libertarian so I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>build the brand out to be a better</v>

85
00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:43.980
<v Speaker 2>brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I win the brands better,</v>

86
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.630
<v Speaker 2>people will do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will raise my money,</v>

87
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.070
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a real third party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

88
00:03:47.071 --> 00:03:49.800
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a third party in the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States which will make better Democrats</v>

89
00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:52.230
<v Speaker 2>and Republicans will literally be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>better nation,</v>

90
00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:57.030
<v Speaker 2>a better a politic will be better in</v>
<v Speaker 2>America if I actually win this damn</v>

91
00:03:57.031 --> 00:03:59.280
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's say I lose Sam wrong.</v>

92
00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 2>My things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mind isn't wrong.</v>

93
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Whatever people don't agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lose.</v>

94
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.730
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bold ideas are still out there.</v>

95
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.790
<v Speaker 2>What you heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what your audience hurt is still there.</v>

96
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to pick this up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of us,</v>

97
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.380
<v Speaker 2>or talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're fine with that 100</v>

98
00:04:13.381 --> 00:04:15.030
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

99
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

100
00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:20.430
<v Speaker 2>I want to fix things I'm not concerned</v>
<v Speaker 2>with who gets the credit for it.</v>

101
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.640
<v Speaker 2>Let's fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to a better place to live this</v>

102
00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:24.860
<v Speaker 2>cutters in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nielsen.</v>

103
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Here's the perfect example of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

104
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.380
<v Speaker 2>of where we're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that to be the rest of this</v>

105
00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:29.850
<v Speaker 2>nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can fix,</v>

106
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.550
<v Speaker 2>steal all my stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please steal it all.</v>

107
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope you steal it.</v>

108
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:36.900
<v Speaker 2>I hope California copies me and does</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I said it'd be amazing.</v>

109
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Please do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be awesome,</v>

110
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.160
<v Speaker 2>but if people don't hear me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't get out there,</v>

111
00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:43.530
<v Speaker 2>if I don't have to debate stage and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't come in second or third,</v>

112
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.780
<v Speaker 2>then no one's going to hear me because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be forgotten,</v>

113
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.950
<v Speaker 2>but if I come in second or tight third,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a microphone in my face for</v>

114
00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:53.670
<v Speaker 2>the next two years and every time it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there I'll be saying stuff just like</v>

115
00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:58.410
<v Speaker 2>this again and again and again and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>manage a system isn't perfect,</v>

116
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.450
<v Speaker 2>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone will figure out the right one.</v>

117
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.370
<v Speaker 2>It won't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just keep giving it money.</v>

118
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.250
<v Speaker 2>It won't be that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be something that'll actually</v>

119
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:07.830
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be something brand new and exciting</v>

120
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.390
<v Speaker 2>and get people to come back to our</v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

121
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.720
<v Speaker 2>What I don't want is what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>now is kids get educated,</v>

122
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.180
<v Speaker 2>they leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't come back with the educators</v>

123
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.890
<v Speaker 2>someplace else and never come back.</v>

124
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.360
<v Speaker 1>It's the wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really into craftsmanship,</v>

125
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always have been.</v>

126
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.710
<v Speaker 1>I love handmade pool cues and this desk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is handmade desk and I feel like</v>

127
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that I really</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate in this modern digital world.</v>

128
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>And I also feel like unfortunately it</v>
<v Speaker 1>may be one of the things that slipping</v>

129
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:36.844
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

130
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.490
<v Speaker 3>It definitely is slipping away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think with um,</v>

131
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with technology,</v>

132
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 3>technology has been great for us and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of different ways.</v>

133
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 3>Like we couldn't be fucking talking into</v>
<v Speaker 3>a piece of metal and it's recorded on</v>

134
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:51.360
<v Speaker 3>the computer going through a wire flying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the air.</v>

135
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Like it does a lot of great things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in doing all those great things,</v>

136
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.640
<v Speaker 3>it actually has taken us away from</v>
<v Speaker 3>really creating and working with our</v>

137
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so like,</v>

138
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even this whole like a farm to table</v>

139
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 3>movement where people even growing their</v>
<v Speaker 3>own vegetables,</v>

140
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 3>you got your own chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

141
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 3>they're laying eggs for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like knowing where this stuff is coming</v>

142
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having firsthand contact with that.</v>

143
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm just having that relationship in</v>
<v Speaker 3>general with.</v>

144
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 3>It brings so much more value to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>overall experience of eating those eggs</v>

145
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 3>are using that knife or sitting at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking table right here</v>

146
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.050
<v Speaker 1>and it seems like a fairly recent</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement in that direction.</v>

147
00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it feels like things got so digital</v>

148
00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>that people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

149
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:36.551
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

150
00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 1>What the facebook and the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram I want to.</v>

151
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.890
<v Speaker 1>I want a wood table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to solve this myself.</v>

152
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your hands on it.</v>

153
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it to be plastic.</v>

154
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want real stuff.</v>

155
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.060
<v Speaker 1>And there's something about handmade</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

156
00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:56.020
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a handmade pair of boots or</v>
<v Speaker 1>handmade bag.</v>

157
00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like there's something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are made by hand that people</v>

158
00:06:59.861 --> 00:07:01.380
<v Speaker 1>get like a deep appreciation of.</v>

159
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.470
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

160
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it,</v>

161
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.850
<v Speaker 3>I think it also kind of goes back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was saying,</v>

162
00:07:06.851 --> 00:07:11.140
<v Speaker 3>like as technology has advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've kind of grown away from these</v>

163
00:07:11.141 --> 00:07:14.650
<v Speaker 3>kinds of what's considered like blue</v>
<v Speaker 3>collar work and craftsmanship kind of</v>

164
00:07:14.651 --> 00:07:18.370
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think people really are driven by</v>

165
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.200
<v Speaker 3>a sense of achievement and when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing data entry that literally millions</v>

166
00:07:23.201 --> 00:07:25.600
<v Speaker 3>of people fucking monkeys can be trained</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

167
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.020
<v Speaker 3>Not to like diminish anything that</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody's doing but literally like</v>

168
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.740
<v Speaker 3>to be able to go into a craft and to and</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a hands on experience is very,</v>

169
00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:37.061
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

170
00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:38.680
<v Speaker 3>very different in that sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>achievement.</v>

171
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.430
<v Speaker 3>Even when somebody comes out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>something and maybe I taught a class on</v>

172
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:44.320
<v Speaker 3>how to make a knife and it looks like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Turd,</v>

173
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.140
<v Speaker 3>they're going to think it looks like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most beautiful fucking knife they've</v>

174
00:07:47.141 --> 00:07:50.610
<v Speaker 3>ever seen in their life because their</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands and their creative,</v>

175
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.890
<v Speaker 3>they touch their energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

176
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.740
<v Speaker 3>their sweat and pop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably some of their blood is put into</v>

177
00:07:56.741 --> 00:07:59.500
<v Speaker 3>creating that thing and that brings that</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more value to it.</v>

178
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I was,</v>

179
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.320
<v Speaker 4>like I was saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get kids to believe in anything</v>

180
00:08:03.321 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 4>he could bring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could,</v>

181
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.070
<v Speaker 4>I could get my son into Satan</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially.</v>

182
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.350
<v Speaker 4>He'd be all in all about Lucifer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

183
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 4>I got them into the brown kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Little Kids,</v>

184
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.070
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

185
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.800
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

186
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 4>he's so into the dodgers because his</v>
<v Speaker 4>grandpa is under the daughter,</v>

187
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:22.890
<v Speaker 4>so he's all about the dodgers and I got</v>
<v Speaker 4>him into the browns is all in the browns</v>

188
00:08:22.891 --> 00:08:25.220
<v Speaker 4>now too because I could get them into</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

189
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.940
<v Speaker 4>So I sat him down and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are going to sit you down and I'm</v>

190
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 4>going to show you the master of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>nunchucks and it's Bruce Lee.</v>

191
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.160
<v Speaker 4>He's number one.</v>

192
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the greatest martial artist of all</v>

193
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I broke them and I sat him down and put</v>

194
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 4>them in front of the TV to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should have filmed this.</v>

195
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.310
<v Speaker 4>Did you fill the whole thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You filmed,</v>

196
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 4>you saying it to him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

197
00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:52.070
<v Speaker 4>I didn't film that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I filmed it.</v>

198
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:57.280
<v Speaker 4>I filmed him watching Bruce Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a first.</v>

199
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:01.020
<v Speaker 4>I showed him the greatest nunchucks</v>
<v Speaker 4>scenes of all time with Bruce Lee that</v>

200
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:02.560
<v Speaker 4>you can go to youtube and you can see</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

201
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.540
<v Speaker 4>there's compilations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put together the one from the stuff</v>

202
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:07.610
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enter the dragon,</v>

203
00:09:07.611 --> 00:09:12.611
<v Speaker 4>this stuff in a Chinese connection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a way of the dragon or or return of the</v>

204
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:16.080
<v Speaker 4>dragon and a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I sat them down and go,</v>

205
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to blitz them with this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to make sure that whenever he</v>

206
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 4>thinks about fucking nunchucks he knows</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Bruce Lee's the master.</v>

207
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's just completely blown away.</v>

208
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:27.800
<v Speaker 4>Then after I showed them other nunchucks</v>
<v Speaker 4>scenes with,</v>

209
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 4>I sat them down and I want them to show</v>
<v Speaker 4>them the greatest fights of all time.</v>

210
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.590
<v Speaker 4>Bruce Lee versus Chuck fucking Norris.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on man.</v>

211
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:39.090
<v Speaker 4>So I just want her to leave that just in</v>
<v Speaker 4>his DNA and I fill in that.</v>

212
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:42.180
<v Speaker 4>I filmed him watching a chuck Norris and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bruce Lee.</v>

213
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 4>Any old always wants to know he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He loves.</v>

214
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.630
<v Speaker 4>He loves Bruce Lee instantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>

215
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he needs to know who wins the fight.</v>

216
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.610
<v Speaker 4>So like daddy does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bruce Lee.</v>

217
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.600
<v Speaker 4>When I go always when sunny always wins</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

218
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.490
<v Speaker 4>but my natural reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's constantly asking</v>

219
00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 4>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's constantly does he,</v>

220
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.120
<v Speaker 4>when my natural reaction would be just</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch,</v>

221
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:04.920
<v Speaker 4>watch you gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch this because it's going to be</v>

222
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 4>sweeter if you watch it and you go</v>
<v Speaker 4>through the ups and downs and he goes,</v>

223
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:08.460
<v Speaker 4>no data.</v>

224
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.290
<v Speaker 4>You need to tell me now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>

225
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:11.910
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna like it more if you just</v>

226
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.070
<v Speaker 4>watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got no daddy does.</v>

227
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:19.071
<v Speaker 4>Bruce Lee when he wants to fucking know</v>
<v Speaker 4>he don't want to be disappointed.</v>

228
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he got two years old.</v>

229
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got completely blown away.</v>

230
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 4>So a week later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a week later I got today you're going to</v>

231
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:29.430
<v Speaker 4>watch the greatest martial arts movie of</v>
