<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

8
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a fun fucking car show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is,</v>

9
00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:17.720
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

10
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.370
<v Speaker 1>I tell people I might be the smartest</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy in the world.</v>

11
00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>I figured out how to drink beer and play</v>
<v Speaker 1>with cars.</v>

12
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Paid for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

13
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fun show.</v>

14
00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:27.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're not taking yourself too</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

15
00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>You having a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're buying and selling</v>

16
00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:31.960
<v Speaker 1>awesome cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

17
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.880
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's was a dream of mine to get it done.</v>

18
00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Speaker 1>It took eight years to get it sold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here we are now.</v>

19
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Did it really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

20
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:42.850
<v Speaker 1>it started to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started pitching the show in 2004.</v>

21
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.130
<v Speaker 1>We didn't start till 2008 or 2012.</v>

22
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.220
<v Speaker 1>What were you doing before that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

23
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>before television or before gas monkey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.510
<v Speaker 1>I kind of had two stages in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a firefighter police officer medic</v>

25
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>before I was old enough to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

26
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking 19 years old carrying a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably want the smartest thing for</v>

27
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:03.680
<v Speaker 1>them to let me do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm to let you know when you</v>

28
00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:06.110
<v Speaker 1>were 19 I had a badge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a cop.</v>

29
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally I was a police officer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

30
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.330
<v Speaker 1>so by the time I was $20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also a firefighter and a.</v>

31
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.560
<v Speaker 1>So I did that for awhile and then moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>into printing and advertising and then</v>

32
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>sold that and got into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was it just like something you just</v>

33
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:25.550
<v Speaker 1>always into cars and that's what led you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the show,</v>

34
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would I tell the story</v>

35
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>diplomatically?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.770
<v Speaker 1>realistically I was watching the shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were on TV at the time.</v>

37
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm always been a car nut and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>motorcycle guy and what have you.</v>

38
00:01:37.011 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>And I realized one night that my kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>are never in the room watching it and my</v>

39
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>wife's not in the room watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.380
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shows that we're on,</v>

41
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>we're a little bit too much bravado and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a tough guy and you know,</v>

42
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>so I dug it and all my buddies dug it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the wives and stuff and I was like,</v>

43
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.260
<v Speaker 1>golly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're missing a big chunk of the</v>

44
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:56.870
<v Speaker 1>market here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could tone down that part of it a</v>

45
00:01:56.871 --> 00:01:59.870
<v Speaker 1>little bit and still have a cool brand</v>
<v Speaker 1>and still be a cool guy,</v>

46
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get the moms and the kids in the</v>

47
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:05.450
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully it's a lot more successful.</v>

48
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:09.110
<v Speaker 1>And so that's kind of where the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>came from and I just went out and</v>

49
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>started it.</v>

50
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the marketing side,</v>

51
00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:15.200
<v Speaker 1>have you kicked in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the marketing side of you went,</v>

52
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's another way to do this.</v>

53
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still a tattooed guy with some</v>

54
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>jewelry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

55
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I got a pit bull or poodle on a leash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a pit bull on a chain.</v>

56
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.340
<v Speaker 1>The show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem compromised.</v>

57
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what's interesting about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems like a kind of a guy</v>

58
00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:32.660
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about it that way.</v>

59
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I approached it was just like</v>

60
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:37.910
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid and my dad had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>garage,</v>

61
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.130
<v Speaker 1>a not a not open for public garage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you have plays that we kept his</v>

62
00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:46.700
<v Speaker 1>car and the neighbors would come over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they tinker and they drink beer and</v>

63
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:49.130
<v Speaker 1>that's what our guys do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we kind of took that approach of</v>

64
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.940
<v Speaker 1>that's what gas monkey does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just drink some beer and play some</v>

65
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.430
<v Speaker 1>cars and goof around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like Saturday afternoon,</v>

66
00:02:55.431 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>but all week long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you have any background in,</v>

67
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>in automobile</v>

68
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.490
<v Speaker 2>knowledge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you know,</v>

69
00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 2>like how to fix things or did you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

70
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 2>I've never really been the full</v>
<v Speaker 2>fabricator.</v>

71
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.291
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 2>I understand everything and networks</v>
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>

73
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 2>but I'm probably more of a business guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was able to go out and hire good</v>

74
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 2>guys to do the fabricating stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got a great team.</v>

75
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 2>But I did have the car knowledge and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had had the eyeball for what was</v>

76
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 2>good and keeping up with what was going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be happening and things like that.</v>

77
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of my strong suit is</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying okay,</v>

78
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Porsche's are fixed to be popular so</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get into 3:56 is or</v>

79
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.840
<v Speaker 2>broncos like the he drove it is you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

80
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.090
<v Speaker 2>or what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I keep my eye on the market.</v>

81
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.120
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you still do keep your eye on the</v>

82
00:03:39.121 --> 00:03:41.210
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that 68 that you have outside of</v>

83
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.170
<v Speaker 2>the 68 Chevelle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty eight,</v>

84
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.060
<v Speaker 2>68 convertible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn,</v>

85
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:46.530
<v Speaker 2>that's a nice car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good.</v>

86
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.000
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the best one I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>

87
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean from an original standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

88
00:03:50.431 --> 00:03:52.650
<v Speaker 2>It's meant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's got a little scuffs out.</v>

89
00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:53.730
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's driven,</v>

90
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

91
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.240
<v Speaker 2>it's in perfect condition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have any dents or anything</v>

92
00:03:57.241 --> 00:03:59.730
<v Speaker 2>wrong with it is literally a little old</v>
<v Speaker 2>lady from Pasadena.</v>

93
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean the lady bought it brand new and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she passed away a couple of years ago</v>

94
00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:05.340
<v Speaker 2>and I bought it from her grandson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

95
00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:06.174
<v Speaker 2>what a cliche.</v>

96
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Fifty 2000 original miles and never been</v>
<v Speaker 2>read old lady from Pasadena is a cliche.</v>

97
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.940
<v Speaker 2>It was technically Pomona,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

98
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.860
<v Speaker 2>same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

99
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That car,</v>

100
00:04:17.761 --> 00:04:20.280
<v Speaker 2>those uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've said this on the show a</v>

101
00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:23.460
<v Speaker 2>million times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a giant fan of like the time period</v>

102
00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:28.020
<v Speaker 2>of 1965 to somewhere around like 71.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fell apart.</v>

103
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know like you still get a 71 challenger</v>

104
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.940
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 71.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barracuda is still pretty sweet for</v>

105
00:04:32.941 --> 00:04:35.490
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you get into like 72,</v>

106
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.470
<v Speaker 2>73.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to start putting.</v>

107
00:04:37.471 --> 00:04:42.471
<v Speaker 2>The big bumpers are there with</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything just fell apart and he got</v>

108
00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:46.680
<v Speaker 2>the gas crunch and then everything got</v>
<v Speaker 2>four cylinders and it was,</v>

109
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.080
<v Speaker 2>it was a bad time in the late seventies</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

110
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.930
<v Speaker 2>It was a bad time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a good time now.</v>

111
00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:54.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting time now for muscle</v>

112
00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:56.820
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the racist,</v>

113
00:04:56.821 --> 00:05:01.500
<v Speaker 2>so crazy that they're putting out street</v>
<v Speaker 2>legal cars you could buy from a dealer</v>

114
00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:05.250
<v Speaker 2>with 700 plus horsepower and almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>every dealer has one now.</v>

115
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

116
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a demon myself.</v>

117
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Eight horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy.</v>

118
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new GT,</v>

119
00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:13.470
<v Speaker 2>$500 out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to have over 700</v>

120
00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:18.471
<v Speaker 2>horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you have the Camaro l a m,</v>

121
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.680
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One Ellie know.</v>

122
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:22.733
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

123
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 2>was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] one.</v>

124
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Ellie know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is the name of the one?</v>

125
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.390
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>

126
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.470
<v Speaker 2>One one ellie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is 650 horsepower and then the new</v>

127
00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:37.770
<v Speaker 2>M,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Z are one at 750 horsepower.</v>

128
00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:39.060
<v Speaker 2>This is preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

129
00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:40.580
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's A.</v>

130
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.370
<v Speaker 2>I think it could be a little dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what everybody out there</v>

131
00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:44.761
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

132
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:49.150
<v Speaker 2>I can drive a 700 horsepower car because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's completely different than a normal</v>

133
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:49.981
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

134
00:05:49.981 --> 00:05:53.640
<v Speaker 2>did you see the video of the guy from</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the head guys at gm who took it</v>

135
00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:55.710
<v Speaker 2>on track?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the first days of the</v>

136
00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>release in the car and he spun out on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first</v>

137
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 1>turn and slammed into the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say much.</v>

138
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 1>I wrecked a brand new hell cat the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

139
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Race in Woodward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you really?</v>

140
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Woodward Dream cruise and they</v>

141
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>had a little celebrity match up and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was racing and just lost it and hit the</v>

142
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took the whole side of the car.</v>

143
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Were you on a track or where you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>strip?</v>

144
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 1>It was a street track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

145
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 1>that they had right there on Woodward</v>
<v Speaker 1>Avenue.</v>

146
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>So they put up the blocks and you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>off</v>

147
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>those hell cats are beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not,</v>

149
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>they're not that great at corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's still a giant car.</v>

150
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Big Car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

151
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Mustang and the Camaro going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>better in the corners for sure.</v>

152
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell kind of so much front.</v>

153
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 1>There's so much out in front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

154
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 1>it really does remind you more than any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those other cars though,</v>

155
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:45.020
<v Speaker 1>of those 1970 cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.840
<v Speaker 1>really has that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shape is more I can like,</v>

157
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:51.500
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1969 Camaro and then you look at a 2019</v>

158
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Camaro you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

159
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it.</v>

160
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the challenger really does look like</v>

161
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>that old car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

162
00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Kim and Tim can discuss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed it.</v>

163
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was his whole passion</v>
<v Speaker 1>project the whole time he was running</v>

164
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:06.010
<v Speaker 1>dodge and he just absolutely nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

165
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 1>no they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made a great looking modern muscle</v>

166
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other ones are just great looking</v>

167
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

168
00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:14.780
<v Speaker 1>they are still muscle cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't really think.</v>

169
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.960
<v Speaker 1>You don't really think about the old</v>
<v Speaker 1>days when you see him now.</v>

170
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.450
<v Speaker 1>They've tried but they didn't get it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>good as dodge.</v>

171
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Now you guys make some fucking great</v>
<v Speaker 1>built to,</v>

172
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys have done some really sweet</v>

173
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 1>custom builds like you were telling me</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside that the longest you do a build</v>

174
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:35.411
<v Speaker 1>for us 25 days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It down to about 25 from 32 ish when</v>

175
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:36.400
<v Speaker 1>we started.</v>

176
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you see a car on the show,</v>

177
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a single episode that we built</v>

178
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 1>that car in 25,</v>
<v Speaker 1>26 days,</v>

179
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start to finish paint interior</v>

180
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do it so quick?</v>

181
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 1>A lot of planning and we've learned over</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years now and 130 of them that um,</v>

182
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've just got a process in and the crew</v>

183
00:07:56.661 --> 00:08:00.350
<v Speaker 1>that I have at the shop now is</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably phenomenal and there's only</v>

184
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:02.480
<v Speaker 1>six guys doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's six guys that do it,</v>

185
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.330
<v Speaker 1>25 days we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

186
00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:08.990
<v Speaker 1>But what about like if you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do custom suspension or you know,</v>

187
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.480
<v Speaker 1>art more Morrison Chassy or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

188
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 1>It just takes some planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So literally what we do is we build the</v>

189
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:17.270
<v Speaker 1>car three times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I tell everybody will say,</v>

190
00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:19.310
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to build this 68 Chevelle</v>

191
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 1>and so we decide how we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>build it and what kind of parts we're</v>

192
00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:23.720
<v Speaker 1>going to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of suspension wheels,</v>

193
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:24.130
<v Speaker 1>motor.</v>

194
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.690
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we put all that down on paper and then</v>

195
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.600
<v Speaker 1>if it works mathematically for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>project we want to do,</v>

196
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.070
<v Speaker 1>then I go find the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when I find the car,</v>

197
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.660
<v Speaker 1>we order every single part and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>start that car until every single thing</v>

198
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.680
<v Speaker 1>that was on that list is in house has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been checked and we're ready to go.</v>

199
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.090
<v Speaker 1>So now we've got his actual fabrication</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and human error and we're ready to</v>

200
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:48.500
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still.</v>

201
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Seems like such a short amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the bills that I've seen take</v>

202
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:52.880
<v Speaker 1>seven months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine months,</v>

203
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the shops are set up</v>

204
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.390
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be one or two guys or maybe</v>

205
00:08:57.391 --> 00:08:59.010
<v Speaker 1>they've got kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 1>assembly programs going on or what have</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

207
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:03.450
<v Speaker 1>but we get in there like you'll love the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way we're building right now.</v>

208
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.930
<v Speaker 1>We're building a 77 international scout</v>
<v Speaker 1>and started with a really nice one.</v>

209
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white stripes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And what?</v>

<v Speaker 2>CR one and started cranking it up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>flight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When's your flight?</v>

254
00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I said say I got a couple on hold</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think I make enough</v>

255
00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:08.830
<v Speaker 2>money for a plane yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to talk to disco and that was like</v>

256
00:11:08.831 --> 00:11:10.120
<v Speaker 2>a private plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what you're saying?</v>

257
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

258
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're all scrambling for</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

259
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the ultimate scramble.</v>

260
00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:17.110
<v Speaker 2>The private jet money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

261
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.260
<v Speaker 2>that is just so much fucking money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems ridiculous.</v>

262
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd like to have a tricked out one</v>

263
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.560
<v Speaker 2>gas monkey on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Old monkey on the tail gas with a</v>

264
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.290
<v Speaker 2>keg in it somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

265
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:33.520
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you do these shows and you</v>

266
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:37.180
<v Speaker 2>bargain people down and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>watched the show to people ever get</v>

267
00:11:37.181 --> 00:11:38.980
<v Speaker 2>pest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a few.</v>

268
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.020
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first,</v>

269
00:11:42.021 --> 00:11:44.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first few years they were just excited,</v>

270
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we were going to be doing something</v>

271
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:49.840
<v Speaker 1>with the car and it was always an</v>
<v Speaker 1>element of a,</v>

272
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.690
<v Speaker 1>of a sentiment to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

273
00:11:51.691 --> 00:11:55.390
<v Speaker 1>it was their dads or their moms or</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmas or whatever and they want to</v>

274
00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 1>see it go to a good home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got several different kinds of</v>

275
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:01.750
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want you to not do anything or if</v>

276
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fix it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to see it,</v>

277
00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of things like that.</v>

278
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:09.490
<v Speaker 1>But nowadays it's a little more harder</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to get a decent deal because,</v>

279
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.970
<v Speaker 1>because we will know the success of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>show and I show up and they're like,</v>

280
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're that guy on TV.</v>

281
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say $10,000.</v>

282
00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I said 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

283
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

284
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Well I would imagine when people see</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you sell them for after you fix</v>

285
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 1>them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they get a little upset.</v>

286
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can.</v>

287
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.350
<v Speaker 1>But I mean they don't understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of work and time and money that</v>

288
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 1>we've put into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the cars that we're building on</v>

289
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 1>the show now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're putting elite 100 grand in and</v>

290
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:35.590
<v Speaker 1>sometimes as much as $300.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

291
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're building everything we're</v>

292
00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:41.800
<v Speaker 1>building now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the new season comes out in June,</v>

293
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.890
<v Speaker 1>people are going to be amazed because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're building this kind of stuff.</v>

294
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wicked cool when you're doing that</v>

295
00:12:47.651 --> 00:12:48.880
<v Speaker 1>in 25 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

296
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just put together a good plan and</v>

297
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 1>execute it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

298
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:56.560
<v Speaker 1>it must be like a thing now because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>show that people want to get a gas</v>

299
00:12:56.561 --> 00:12:58.960
<v Speaker 1>monkey bill car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

300
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:03.220
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would I say this diplomatically?</v>

301
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.770
<v Speaker 1>If it weren't for employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vendors and customers,</v>

302
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:08.650
<v Speaker 1>business would be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

303
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.370
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

304
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.710
<v Speaker 1>we don't do a lot for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the customer,</v>

305
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until we built it for ourselves and then</v>

306
00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:17.380
<v Speaker 1>we sell it to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as coming in off the street,</v>

307
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.200
<v Speaker 1>we just liked building what we want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>build,</v>

308
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.160
<v Speaker 1>honing our skills.</v>

309
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.300
<v Speaker 1>And then we find a buyer every once in</v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile I'll have god come in and go,</v>

310
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:26.134
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

311
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:27.790
<v Speaker 1>this is what I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can,</v>

312
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I won't call you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't come in there with a new</v>

313
00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:31.230
<v Speaker 1>steering wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

314
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.010
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets.</v>

315
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.990
<v Speaker 1>That's why a lot of times cars do take</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven months or a year or cause the guy</v>

316
00:13:37.991 --> 00:13:40.090
<v Speaker 1>that's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's built is in there every other</v>

317
00:13:40.091 --> 00:13:41.230
<v Speaker 1>weekend going up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

318
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:43.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe we move this over here and paint</v>
<v Speaker 1>it purple.</v>

319
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

320
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

321
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:48.940
<v Speaker 1>it does seem like it would be way better</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just build it.</v>

322
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.550
<v Speaker 1>How you like it and then sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

323
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:53.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's still a business decision.</v>

324
00:13:53.171 --> 00:13:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to build it to where I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna do the most,</v>

325
00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most money at the end of the day and</v>

326
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:03.250
<v Speaker 1>stay true with what's going on as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>that particular car and what's going on</v>

327
00:14:03.251 --> 00:14:05.740
<v Speaker 1>in the marketplace and technology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have you.</v>

328
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we do get a lot of calls where</v>

329
00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:09.130
<v Speaker 1>people come in and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

330
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:12.700
<v Speaker 1>I want that exact same thing and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll build another one.</v>

331
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Well sometimes you do buy cars and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sell them without doing anything to</v>

332
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:18.244
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

333
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we call our bs stories.</v>

334
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Will buy something and bring it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just put some wheels on it or</v>

335
00:14:23.801 --> 00:14:25.570
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But usually it's just clean it up,</v>

336
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.390
<v Speaker 1>get it running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell somebody else's dream because not</v>

337
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:31.990
<v Speaker 1>everybody can afford a fully built car</v>
<v Speaker 1>and slash or they want to do it</v>

338
00:14:31.991 --> 00:14:34.210
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we get them a good project.</v>

339
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people realize how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>money is involved in a fully built car.</v>

340
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Like if you ever seen those revegy</v>
<v Speaker 1>mustangs.</v>

341
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at those last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty intensive build.</v>

342
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting stuff.</v>

343
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.420
<v Speaker 1>Has got to take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

344
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially not really a mustang.</v>

345
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's kind of licensed by Ford.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks exactly like a Mustang and also</v>

346
00:14:55.921 --> 00:14:59.280
<v Speaker 2>a mustang parts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's got everything new is just</v>

347
00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 2>brand new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a brand new suv.</v>

348
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:05.960
<v Speaker 2>You take the kids to soccer except</v>
<v Speaker 2>really fast and fun to drive.</v>

349
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.610
<v Speaker 2>And 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>66,</v>

350
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.440
<v Speaker 2>65,</v>
<v Speaker 2>66.</v>

351
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.090
<v Speaker 2>He's got a GT 3:50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

352
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.150
<v Speaker 2>it's not really a 66,</v>
<v Speaker 2>GT,</v>

353
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 2>3:50 every part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the fenders,</v>

354
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.260
<v Speaker 2>everything's all newly fabricated steel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do that this season to</v>

355
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.350
<v Speaker 2>where I'm going to build a car back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the original,</v>

356
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.490
<v Speaker 2>like a 60.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sad.</v>

357
00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do Mustang or if we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do a Camaro,</v>

358
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.760
<v Speaker 2>but there's this guy's cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

359
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:31.670
<v Speaker 2>come the fuck on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is beautiful.</v>

360
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to build one that never</v>

361
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:35.930
<v Speaker 2>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look how pretty that God damn thing is.</v>

362
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.300
<v Speaker 2>He's killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to see what one of those things</v>

363
00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:39.200
<v Speaker 2>is like in real life.</v>

364
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.180
<v Speaker 2>He's even got pushed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buttons start,</v>

365
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

366
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.860
<v Speaker 2>it senses when you're near the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

367
00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:46.670
<v Speaker 2>the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it will unlock for you,</v>

368
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's the just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like super high quality built</v>

369
00:15:51.741 --> 00:15:56.300
<v Speaker 2>to mean look how fucking pretty that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trick is,</v>

370
00:15:56.301 --> 00:16:01.230
<v Speaker 2>is how much work goes into it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes they do make these parts aftermarket</v>

371
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.070
<v Speaker 2>and what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of times that's not the best</v>

372
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 2>stuff in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you ended up fabricating that and</v>

373
00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:08.840
<v Speaker 2>massage and it in and making all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gaps right.</v>

374
00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:13.340
<v Speaker 2>And so you can't just expect that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to buy a set,</v>

375
00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:15.770
<v Speaker 2>a new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new front end it vendors and hood and</v>

376
00:16:15.771 --> 00:16:18.710
<v Speaker 2>everything going to work out perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to always have to massage</v>

377
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:20.420
<v Speaker 2>it and get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I've been paying attention to this</v>

378
00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:24.890
<v Speaker 2>guy for awhile and essentially what he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>been doing is honing the process over</v>

379
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:29.620
<v Speaker 2>the last few years and he's got a</v>
<v Speaker 2>company now that makes a thing,</v>

380
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.030
<v Speaker 2>it's called dynacore that makes all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>parts.</v>

381
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.440
<v Speaker 2>They make everything in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body's body stamps.</v>

382
00:16:35.441 --> 00:16:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

383
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.330
<v Speaker 2>he's got his whole process down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

384
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.100
<v Speaker 2>when you watch them drive the cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like he's.</v>

385
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:45.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds perfect,</v>

386
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.980
<v Speaker 2>like everything inside of it seems like</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely locked down.</v>

387
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:53.330
<v Speaker 2>No squeaks and rattles is really like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern car for sure.</v>

388
00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.170
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of shops that do an</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing job at doing that stuff.</v>

389
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.810
<v Speaker 2>That's what I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I don't like.</v>

390
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean I liked the way they look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I look at like an old,</v>

391
00:17:03.051 --> 00:17:05.420
<v Speaker 2>like a 67,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gt 500.</v>

392
00:17:05.421 --> 00:17:08.330
<v Speaker 2>I liked the way they look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you try to hit the brakes on one</v>

393
00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:11.270
<v Speaker 2>of those things or if you try to make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn with those old tires,</v>

394
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.710
<v Speaker 2>everything's fucking that skinny and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

395
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.760
<v Speaker 2>the balance is all wonky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 67 car balance.</v>

396
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.460
<v Speaker 2>We get a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've built a few cars for,</v>

397
00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.540
<v Speaker 2>for a contest and somebody when they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

398
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:27.410
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want this car,</v>

399
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.800
<v Speaker 2>and then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

400
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.680
<v Speaker 2>this is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

401
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:35.210
<v Speaker 2>that's because it's a stock 65 bus thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what have you.</v>

402
00:17:35.211 --> 00:17:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Because if you don't realize what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>buying and then yeah,</v>

403
00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:40.370
<v Speaker 2>it can be a disappointing process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

404
00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:42.740
<v Speaker 2>Those old cars man mean we've come a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long way.</v>

405
00:17:42.741 --> 00:17:45.410
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty amazing if you go back from</v>

406
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:50.250
<v Speaker 2>1970 car to a 2019 car and you drive and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hit the brakes</v>

407
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:55.230
<v Speaker 1>and he do all the numbers like stopping</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 to zero and handling.</v>

408
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean the cars of today are pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

409
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.740
<v Speaker 1>It is absolutely amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The technology that's out and the fact</v>

410
00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:03.840
<v Speaker 1>that we can use that technology so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier.</v>

411
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can build these kinds of cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything you dream up because you can</v>

412
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 1>literally do it right here with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>google and your pocket.</v>

413
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

414
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 1>I want to do this and this and what have</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

415
00:18:13.711 --> 00:18:18.180
<v Speaker 1>So it ends up being the cars that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting out are definitely just like a</v>

416
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.940
<v Speaker 1>brand new car yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a really interesting time to,</v>

417
00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:24.570
<v Speaker 1>for Resto mods because so many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are into that now.</v>

418
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:27.870
<v Speaker 1>They realized that they liked the looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those old cars,</v>

419
00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:30.300
<v Speaker 1>but they're not really into the way they</v>
<v Speaker 1>drove.</v>

420
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's about comfort and Bluetooth</v>

421
00:18:33.391 --> 00:18:35.340
<v Speaker 1>and all that kind of stuff.</v>

422
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:40.020
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not really that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a 32 ford nut and I kinda like cars</v>

423
00:18:40.021 --> 00:18:43.740
<v Speaker 1>the way that they more or less came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm all for maybe some disc</v>

424
00:18:43.741 --> 00:18:48.060
<v Speaker 1>brakes or safety or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like the squeak it and having to</v>

425
00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:52.760
<v Speaker 1>learn how to drive it and figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the character of transmissions.</v>

426
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

427
00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:59.040
<v Speaker 1>How much longer before the manuals dead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's already got the nails in</v>

428
00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:00.650
<v Speaker 1>the coffin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like it.</v>

429
00:19:00.651 --> 00:19:01.860
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

430
00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:04.560
<v Speaker 1>like American cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come out with cars like the GT</v>

431
00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:06.720
<v Speaker 1>3:50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even get it with an automatic</v>

432
00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:07.830
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

433
00:19:07.831 --> 00:19:09.550
<v Speaker 1>They won't even sell it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

434
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.400
<v Speaker 1>And they're going to hold on with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as they can.</v>

435
00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:12.990
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your big competition cars,</v>

436
00:19:12.991 --> 00:19:14.010
<v Speaker 1>porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferrari,</v>

437
00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Lambo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mercedes,</v>

438
00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:16.890
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

439
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.350
<v Speaker 1>you can't get them in a manual.</v>

440
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants that nurburgring time.</v>

441
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>want that super fast nurburbring time.</v>

442
00:19:23.911 --> 00:19:26.010
<v Speaker 1>And unless you have a double clutch</v>
<v Speaker 1>transmission,</v>

443
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.980
<v Speaker 1>unless you have paddle shifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to miss a second here and</v>

444
00:19:29.981 --> 00:19:33.630
<v Speaker 1>second there and then people are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at it when it's so ridiculous.</v>

445
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:37.230
<v Speaker 1>The people that look at those times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack is the average joe it and going out</v>

446
00:19:37.231 --> 00:19:41.120
<v Speaker 1>there and doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the modern cars mean like the Zl</v>

447
00:19:41.121 --> 00:19:45.720
<v Speaker 1>one that we were talking about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're down to the one lie I</v>

448
00:19:45.721 --> 00:19:50.721
<v Speaker 1>think is down to a seven minute and real</v>
<v Speaker 1>low seconds Nurburg green time,</v>

449
00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:55.620
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's faster than a gt three Rs from a</v>

450
00:19:55.621 --> 00:19:58.930
<v Speaker 1>couple of years ago for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For $60,000 car that you could buy the</v>

451
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Chevy dealership,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh?</v>

452
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Probably close to 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

453
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like 78.</v>

454
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

455
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.320
<v Speaker 1>But they're loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But nominal car,</v>

456
00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:08.030
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

457
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:11.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree that that corvette and probably</v>

458
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:13.800
<v Speaker 1>the demon or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or two cars that are the most bang for</v>

459
00:20:13.801 --> 00:20:16.700
<v Speaker 1>the buck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just get in and go to zero.</v>

460
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.680
<v Speaker 1>One in or the Zr one rather is almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>too stupid.</v>

461
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.190
<v Speaker 1>It's almost too ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like if you're a regular person</v>

462
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.560
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you buy that and you try to take it</v>

463
00:20:25.561 --> 00:20:28.170
<v Speaker 1>somewhere for you to understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>limits of the grip,</v>

464
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.530
<v Speaker 1>how much gas you can apply for you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an educated foot.</v>

465
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:32.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

466
00:20:32.851 --> 00:20:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

467
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.860
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those where they first started making</v>

468
00:20:34.861 --> 00:20:37.380
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was it seven or eight years ago?</v>

469
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a client have me get one.</v>

470
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.580
<v Speaker 1>He brought it back the next day scared</v>
<v Speaker 1>to death because I just sell it because</v>

471
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.710
<v Speaker 1>I'll never drive it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does that.</v>

472
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.800
<v Speaker 1>That is just stupid.</v>

473
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a picture of one the other day in</v>

474
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.710
<v Speaker 1>my Google newsfeed that someone had</v>
<v Speaker 1>bought and wreck the next day.</v>

475
00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Smashed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just reading today.</v>

476
00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:57.334
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

477
00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.760
<v Speaker 1>somebody sent me a link.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

478
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.590
<v Speaker 1>did you see the episode where we built</v>
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] look at that fucking.</v>

479
00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.490
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking wicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing something with that right now</v>

480
00:21:06.491 --> 00:21:07.324
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

481
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.680
<v Speaker 1>I guess I can imagine everything you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

482
00:21:11.681 --> 00:21:12.610
<v Speaker 1>the styling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

483
00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:14.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the carbon fiber points,</v>

484
00:21:14.561 --> 00:21:16.570
<v Speaker 1>the lift in the front and everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we</v>

485
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:21.870
<v Speaker 1>all have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're doing it with a 72 river boat</v>

486
00:21:21.871 --> 00:21:23.770
<v Speaker 1>tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

487
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be frickin sick.</v>

488
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.410
<v Speaker 1>We've already chopped the top and</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought it down so that it doesn't have</v>

489
00:21:29.411 --> 00:21:34.411
<v Speaker 1>that clam mouth and looking windshield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're taking all of the bunch of</v>

490
00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:40.261
<v Speaker 1>our styling cues in our and definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of our driving components ideology</v>

491
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.040
<v Speaker 1>and we're cramming it into a 72.</v>

492
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Ruby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how has that fit?</v>

493
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that going to fit?</v>

494
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not taking the chassis and putting</v>

495
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:52.570
<v Speaker 1>it over there and we were making our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've worked with Chris Austin on it</v>

496
00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:56.620
<v Speaker 1>also using that transmission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that independent suspension.</v>

497
00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A independent rear.</v>

498
00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Got a video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a faggot.</v>

499
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Isn't the 72 riviera like a million</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

500
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:04.480
<v Speaker 1>How much is the thing way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot,</v>

501
00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:07.360
<v Speaker 1>but we're clearing all of that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're working with a speed core and</v>

502
00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:10.770
<v Speaker 1>we're doing a lot of the tops going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be carbon fiber and so will the hood</v>

503
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:15.990
<v Speaker 1>trunk and maybe even the full front clip</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed core did a nasty 1970 Mustang for</v>

504
00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Robert Downey junior that I just saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>online the other day with a supercharged</v>

505
00:22:22.211 --> 00:22:26.770
<v Speaker 1>coyote engine in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a weird color to like a beige,</v>

506
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.650
<v Speaker 1>like a weird kind of yellowish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funky,</v>

507
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.350
<v Speaker 1>funky colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crazier the better.</v>

508
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just let it.</v>

509
00:22:34.451 --> 00:22:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Like the art car is going to be like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>

510
00:22:36.371 --> 00:22:41.371
<v Speaker 1>muted gray with a red and chrome and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carmen and I mean we're,</v>

511
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.010
<v Speaker 1>we're getting pretty crazy with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were about halfway through,</v>

512
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.930
<v Speaker 1>so it's a 72 boat tail Riviera CV and</v>
<v Speaker 1>find one of those.</v>

513
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to picture that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

514
00:22:52.241 --> 00:22:54.040
<v Speaker 1>I had a riviera when I was in high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

515
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to skylar.</v>

516
00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.390
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here you go.</v>

517
00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a stock one.</v>

518
00:23:00.761 --> 00:23:02.920
<v Speaker 1>But then it'll turn into what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

519
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.690
<v Speaker 1>We just started chasing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

520
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.170
<v Speaker 1>So that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

521
00:23:06.171 --> 00:23:07.600
<v Speaker 1>a few people have built them into hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>rods,</v>

522
00:23:07.601 --> 00:23:10.900
<v Speaker 1>but wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you stay on that video,</v>

523
00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:13.300
<v Speaker 1>it'll just feed to where what it's gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like when it's done.</v>

524
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you did.</v>

525
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.900
<v Speaker 1>So you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

526
00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:18.700
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna be nuts.</v>

527
00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.510
<v Speaker 1>It'll probably be at sema this year in</v>
<v Speaker 1>bare metal.</v>

528
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful car.</v>

529
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Don't have wagon wheels on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that stupid thing though.</v>

530
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of those,</v>

531
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.450
<v Speaker 1>those uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a thing for awhile.</v>

532
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.350
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty bad ass.</v>

533
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Pretty ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

534
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.970
<v Speaker 1>You don't see those now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never see that car.</v>

535
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a rare car now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we found a one owner with zero hits,</v>

536
00:23:44.171 --> 00:23:45.790
<v Speaker 1>zero rust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the metal launch.</v>

537
00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:48.090
<v Speaker 1>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are those Australian cars that were</v>

538
00:23:48.091 --> 00:23:49.750
<v Speaker 1>in Max now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

539
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is going to look pretty nasty.</v>

540
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be slammed like that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be nasty to.</v>

541
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:57.680
<v Speaker 1>We're probably going to bring him in for</v>
<v Speaker 1>around 1300 horsepower.</v>

542
00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.030
<v Speaker 1>We're building that one just for sheer</v>
<v Speaker 1>shits and giggles of her phone because</v>

543
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.890
<v Speaker 1>nobody does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

544
00:24:06.891 --> 00:24:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Someone who's going to want it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope they have a lot of money.</v>

545
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:15.560
<v Speaker 1>That's like a money pit right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

546
00:24:15.561 --> 00:24:17.090
<v Speaker 1>How much does something like that cost</v>
<v Speaker 1>to build?</v>

547
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Three 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

548
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To build.</v>

549
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 1>And then how much would you like to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to try to.</v>

550
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.550
<v Speaker 1>I always try to make at least 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

551
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a goal,</v>

552
00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

553
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.070
<v Speaker 1>that's reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

554
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Especially considering all the creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and putting them together and yeah,</v>

555
00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:36.110
<v Speaker 1>we do everything in house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

556
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.660
<v Speaker 1>except for interior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing every single thing in house</v>

557
00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:40.280
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've come a long way since the</v>

558
00:24:40.281 --> 00:24:42.380
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you have that kind of</v>

559
00:24:42.381 --> 00:24:44.270
<v Speaker 1>horsepower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of rubber you're going to have</v>

560
00:24:44.271 --> 00:24:45.104
<v Speaker 1>on that thing?</v>

561
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll have 15 inches on each side.</v>

562
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:52.250
<v Speaker 1>It'll have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we went with 24 hours and 20</v>

563
00:24:52.251 --> 00:24:54.470
<v Speaker 1>twos and super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super wide.</v>

564
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

565
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.660
<v Speaker 1>You kind of have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

566
00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.150
<v Speaker 1>And even then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably gonna spin out everywhere</v>

567
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.670
<v Speaker 1>now because we're using all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

568
00:25:01.671 --> 00:25:04.340
<v Speaker 1>we're using the independent suspension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're using all of the sensors,</v>

569
00:25:04.341 --> 00:25:09.050
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff that's in that brand new</v>
<v Speaker 1>vet application control as well.</v>

570
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you adapt that over to an old car</v>

571
00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:15.620
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just go through the systems.</v>

572
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.140
<v Speaker 1>We've got a guy working for us now that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

573
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:22.280
<v Speaker 1>helped us run our standalone hill</v>
<v Speaker 1>hellcat that they said couldn't be done</v>

574
00:25:22.281 --> 00:25:25.760
<v Speaker 1>when we were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We built a sharp cat and uh,</v>

575
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.320
<v Speaker 1>so he just gets the whole thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts eliminating sensors or adding or,</v>

576
00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:33.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we ended up with all the same</v>

577
00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:36.800
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the sensors understand when a wheel</v>

578
00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:41.801
<v Speaker 1>spinning and then they compensated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks or horsepower breaks,</v>

579
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll get your stupid stupid light,</v>

580
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:47.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

581
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.070
<v Speaker 1>You've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll be able to turn it all on and</v>

582
00:25:49.071 --> 00:25:50.390
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like a brand new car.</v>

583
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So will you have different modes,</v>

584
00:25:52.821 --> 00:25:54.680
<v Speaker 1>like a race mode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>street mode like that?</v>

585
00:25:54.681 --> 00:25:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what a lot of people try to do that</v>

586
00:25:57.021 --> 00:26:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I can't stand is they'll take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>something with that idea and they'll go,</v>

587
00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:02.000
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to pull the body off and</v>

588
00:26:02.001 --> 00:26:04.370
<v Speaker 1>cram this under there and welded</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and hope it works.</v>

589
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.580
<v Speaker 1>And we make everything adapt to the old</v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

590
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Still work though the way it's supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

591
00:26:10.851 --> 00:26:12.770
<v Speaker 1>And I'm brand new car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

592
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:13.850
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

593
00:26:13.851 --> 00:26:15.860
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy online that has,</v>

594
00:26:15.861 --> 00:26:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm on instagram gt 500 super swap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took a,</v>

595
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:25.870
<v Speaker 1>an old gt 500 body and put it on a gt</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 from a modern chassis and piece it</v>

596
00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:30.350
<v Speaker 1>together like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was always thinking with a,</v>

597
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.140
<v Speaker 1>with a setup like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably can't have airbags,</v>

598
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.023
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

599
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.080
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually ways to added into</v>

600
00:26:36.081 --> 00:26:38.440
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you get into the air.</v>

601
00:26:38.441 --> 00:26:39.320
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

602
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:40.980
<v Speaker 1>You get into the geometry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

603
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.560
<v Speaker 1>in the direction of the airbag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So beautiful.</v>

604
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:44.640
<v Speaker 1>That looks so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

605
00:26:44.641 --> 00:26:49.060
<v Speaker 1>But you don't want to play with the R</v>
<v Speaker 1>and d of trying to put an airbag into</v>

606
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.340
<v Speaker 1>something like that unless you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really know what you're doing because</v>

607
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't know refraction of an inch off</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

608
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.860
<v Speaker 1>of being where it needs to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That airbag could do more damage than</v>

609
00:26:58.861 --> 00:27:01.800
<v Speaker 1>good it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird though because you're dealing</v>

610
00:27:01.801 --> 00:27:05.220
<v Speaker 1>with a totally different size body too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wonder how he's doing this.</v>

611
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.460
<v Speaker 1>It's easy isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It?</v>

612
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't sound easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>

613
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:11.610
<v Speaker 1>isn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you done that before?</v>

614
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:12.870
<v Speaker 1>We haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

615
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand the process and really it's</v>

616
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:17.070
<v Speaker 1>just got massage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move in,</v>

617
00:27:17.071 --> 00:27:17.980
<v Speaker 1>move out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

618
00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.160
<v Speaker 1>because there's a company called Mag</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motors.</v>

619
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.750
<v Speaker 1>You ever heard of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have.</v>

620
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Go to a MAG motors.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a.</v>

621
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.320
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing is they're putting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon fiber body on a modern gt 500,</v>

622
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.440
<v Speaker 1>but they're using a 67 like eleanor</v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

623
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.540
<v Speaker 1>but they're making it out of carbon</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiber.</v>

624
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:38.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one's gross.</v>

625
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Go to the silver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One white one looks to hate the eleanor</v>

626
00:27:42.691 --> 00:27:44.880
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're really overplayed.</v>

627
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.040
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

628
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.750
<v Speaker 1>it's just been done so many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who cares?</v>

629
00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.450
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

630
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:51.481
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

631
00:27:51.481 --> 00:27:52.500
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the images,</v>

632
00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:54.900
<v Speaker 1>but go to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it from the side so you get a better</v>

633
00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:57.300
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful car.</v>

634
00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.500
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it sits weird.</v>

635
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.370
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it sits a little too high</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it looks like they're worried,</v>

636
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.000
<v Speaker 1>like I don't know anything about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me looking at it it's like you</v>

637
00:28:06.001 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 1>need to get it down a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a little more agitated,</v>

638
00:28:09.181 --> 00:28:10.740
<v Speaker 1>get a deeper dish on the wheel.</v>

639
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think what they're doing is</v>

640
00:28:13.321 --> 00:28:16.950
<v Speaker 1>trying to use all the geometry of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern car.</v>

641
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you ended up with something.</v>

642
00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:23.160
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it could go four wheeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit,</v>

643
00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:24.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

644
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.550
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely not slammed.</v>

645
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of looks right.</v>

646
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm sure the car runs and drives</v>

647
00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:36.480
<v Speaker 1>and performs unbelievably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's missing a little to me it's</v>

648
00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:38.000
<v Speaker 1>missing some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

649
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:41.320
<v Speaker 1>you know that our company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classic recreation's never seen them.</v>

650
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

651
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.700
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing similar cars like that</v>

652
00:28:44.701 --> 00:28:47.190
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're doing it from the ground up.</v>

653
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.930
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people doing it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's with technology coming the way that</v>

654
00:28:51.931 --> 00:28:52.740
<v Speaker 1>it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

655
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.120
<v Speaker 1>it's not as hard to do as it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

656
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.290
<v Speaker 1>it's still the laborer's task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>

657
00:28:58.291 --> 00:29:01.350
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make all those systems work in</v>

658
00:29:01.351 --> 00:29:04.080
<v Speaker 1>anything and see a guy like you that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>car guy.</v>

659
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.990
<v Speaker 1>You look at an eleanor and you look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it like it's played,</v>

660
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.440
<v Speaker 1>but a person who doesn't see them all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

661
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:13.650
<v Speaker 1>it was not in a car industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was the last time you saw one of</v>

662
00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:15.240
<v Speaker 1>those fucking things on the street?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

663
00:29:15.241 --> 00:29:17.700
<v Speaker 1>I would never say Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like five of them for sale.</v>

664
00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:21.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing if you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like fusion motorsports there,</v>

665
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:23.100
<v Speaker 1>there are down the street here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make,</v>

666
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:27.240
<v Speaker 1>they're the only licensed dealers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have some deal with the woman who</v>

667
00:29:27.241 --> 00:29:31.440
<v Speaker 1>was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was the wife of the guy who wrote,</v>

668
00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:33.780
<v Speaker 1>gone in 60 seconds or producing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

669
00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:37.740
<v Speaker 1>And so they make a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to fusion.</v>

670
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Eleanor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make some pretty sick once.</v>

671
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.360
<v Speaker 1>But you think there's a plate out</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally?</v>

672
00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not an eleanor car fan.</v>

673
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.280
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you hate America?</v>

674
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Richard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could you,</v>

675
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.160
<v Speaker 1>how could you not love that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just there's hundreds if not</v>

676
00:29:54.161 --> 00:29:56.290
<v Speaker 1>thousands of them out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

677
00:29:56.291 --> 00:29:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must say to America,</v>

678
00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.390
<v Speaker 1>no way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

679
00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Currently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I love the mustangs.</v>

680
00:30:00.911 --> 00:30:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I've got three of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself included,</v>

681
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.640
<v Speaker 1>a real 68 shelby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

682
00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it the shape or the color scheme?</v>

683
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

684
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.450
<v Speaker 1>to me it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a popular car in the movie</v>

685
00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:14.320
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

686
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:18.680
<v Speaker 1>too many people did it and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's doing it and it's what have</v>

687
00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:20.170
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

688
00:30:20.171 --> 00:30:21.760
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of them are out there in</v>

689
00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:26.750
<v Speaker 1>comparison to like say a modern Zr One?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was probably nearly as many of those</v>

690
00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.490
<v Speaker 1>thousands of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

691
00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's different companies making tons</v>

692
00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:35.980
<v Speaker 1>of them all car people say that they say</v>
<v Speaker 1>to cars that they think are played out</v>

693
00:30:35.981 --> 00:30:40.030
<v Speaker 1>69 Camaro's and these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody does a 69 Camaro and</v>

694
00:30:40.031 --> 00:30:40.510
<v Speaker 1>everybody does.</v>

695
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Eleanor and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

696
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.410
<v Speaker 1>the dukes of hazzard card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

697
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

698
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Now a bad ass 69 charger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>

699
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:51.910
<v Speaker 1>but painted orange with a flag on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's played out.</v>

700
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.410
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That flag.</v>

701
00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:56.860
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

702
00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.430
<v Speaker 1>You believe they pulled that show off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The air did?</v>

703
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the flag that shows off the</v>

704
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.400
<v Speaker 1>showed on like some weird obscure cable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim pulled it off a TV land.</v>

705
00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.610
<v Speaker 1>That's TV land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a whole thing about it on</v>

706
00:31:09.611 --> 00:31:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how ridiculous it was and I don't know</v>

707
00:31:11.861 --> 00:31:15.700
<v Speaker 1>if I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like trying to erase history</v>

708
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:16.760
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

709
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you live in Dallas though.</v>

710
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a little easier to get by with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>confederate flag and towels.</v>

711
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a bunch of Matcha tea</v>

712
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:27.990
<v Speaker 1>drinkers and what have you like we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>out here in California.</v>

713
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

714
00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in Dallas,</v>

715
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.460
<v Speaker 1>I have to do my business with the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>out here in La and it's,</v>

716
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:38.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting off work before they've had</v>

717
00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:42.220
<v Speaker 1>their two chai lattes and walk their dog</v>
<v Speaker 1>and showed up to the office.</v>

718
00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on guys,</v>

719
00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:49.540
<v Speaker 1>get up and get to work and I get accused</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>

720
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:50.740
<v Speaker 1>have you been drinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

721
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:52.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 7:30 in the night here.</v>

722
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I've been off for two and a half hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get upset at you if you've been</v>

723
00:31:56.051 --> 00:31:56.790
<v Speaker 1>drinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

724
00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.620
<v Speaker 1>when I'm trying to conduct some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business calls that we do in the</v>

725
00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:01.960
<v Speaker 1>evenings because they haven't gotten to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work yet.</v>

726
00:32:01.961 --> 00:32:04.510
<v Speaker 1>And they asked you if you've actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>been drinking sometimes.</v>

727
00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well she's.</v>

728
00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Because they know you from the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we all,</v>

729
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about my agents and managers</v>
<v Speaker 1>networks and whatever.</v>

730
00:32:11.351 --> 00:32:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

731
00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:15.130
<v Speaker 1>because I've been off since 5:00 eyes.</v>

732
00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Most people have a couple beers and sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the shop.</v>

733
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people there.</v>

734
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

735
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:23.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a different world out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of a culture shock.</v>

736
00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:25.360
<v Speaker 1>It is A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

737
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

738
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay,</v>

739
00:32:28.031 --> 00:32:31.100
<v Speaker 1>but I think if I was going to move a gas</v>
<v Speaker 1>monkey anywhere,</v>

740
00:32:31.101 --> 00:32:34.120
<v Speaker 1>it would probably be Scottsdale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scottsdale is nice.</v>

741
00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:37.150
<v Speaker 1>It's freaking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about a million degrees in the</v>

742
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.650
<v Speaker 1>summer though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever go there?</v>

743
00:32:38.651 --> 00:32:42.120
<v Speaker 1>But it's a dry heat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sauna.</v>

744
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.120
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went outside.</v>

745
00:32:45.121 --> 00:32:49.010
<v Speaker 1>I was in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in Phoenix last July and we went</v>

746
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:50.800
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just stood there for a second.</v>

747
00:32:50.801 --> 00:32:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

748
00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:53.850
<v Speaker 1>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should get used to this because this</v>

749
00:32:53.851 --> 00:32:56.900
<v Speaker 1>is what global warming is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an la a few years.</v>

750
00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are going to either be on fire</v>

751
00:32:59.121 --> 00:33:02.150
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the volcanoes or global warming or</v>

752
00:33:02.151 --> 00:33:06.190
<v Speaker 1>whatever or sliding into the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really like Scottsdale.</v>

753
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Fun Fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next week they have any plan in the</v>

754
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Scottsdale opening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Waste Management Open in the</v>

755
00:33:13.461 --> 00:33:15.170
<v Speaker 1>celebrity program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

756
00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you golf?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely suck at it horribly.</v>

757
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.550
<v Speaker 1>I've been a member of the same country</v>
<v Speaker 1>club for about 19 years and I probably</v>

758
00:33:22.551 --> 00:33:25.820
<v Speaker 1>played about 50 rounds of golf in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and they've caught me playing in</v>

759
00:33:25.821 --> 00:33:30.620
<v Speaker 1>the pro am the celebrity thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike we've ever gets teamed out with</v>

760
00:33:30.621 --> 00:33:33.470
<v Speaker 1>me as in big trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to tighten up before you</v>

761
00:33:33.471 --> 00:33:34.940
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to take some lessons or</v>

762
00:33:34.941 --> 00:33:35.930
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way,</v>

763
00:33:35.931 --> 00:33:37.620
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sweating because.</v>

764
00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Because the way I look at it as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

765
00:33:39.891 --> 00:33:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's like be pissed off that I</v>

766
00:33:42.051 --> 00:33:46.070
<v Speaker 1>can't do what the guy told me to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get much better.</v>

767
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:47.510
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like what I tell them on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

768
00:33:47.511 --> 00:33:49.250
<v Speaker 1>but on top of that is I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

769
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:51.860
<v Speaker 1>you think you're so good at golf because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can shoot 72,</v>

770
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

771
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematically this is an 18 shot game,</v>

772
00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can figure it out mathematically.</v>

773
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you had some insane ability.</v>

774
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to have in st ability</v>

775
00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:09.930
<v Speaker 1>to figure out the mathematics of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because it's an 18 shot game guys,</v>

776
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:15.530
<v Speaker 1>but no one's ever done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how is it an 18 child game?</v>

777
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Just mathematically</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a one punch fight?</v>

778
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:20.121
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

779
00:34:20.121 --> 00:34:24.620
<v Speaker 1>it's more like saying that because more</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights are one punch fights than ever.</v>

780
00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:28.790
<v Speaker 1>A golf game is an 18 shot golf game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying mathematically propulsion</v>

781
00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.070
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. And so forth.</v>

782
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.790
<v Speaker 1>You cAn get that ball from that spot to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole thing every time it's</v>

783
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:36.800
<v Speaker 1>possible with enough power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

784
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in what have you.</v>

785
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.890
<v Speaker 1>But that's literally like saying every</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight is a one shot fight.</v>

786
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.240
<v Speaker 1>No way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

787
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of fights are one shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>

788
00:34:45.801 --> 00:34:50.180
<v Speaker 1>but there's never been an 18 hole game</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's played with 18 shots,</v>

789
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.320
<v Speaker 1>but there are whole ones.</v>

790
00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:55.430
<v Speaker 1>So all you need is never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was of the human race.</v>

791
00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.220
<v Speaker 1>I think the most I've ever done in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual real tournament is to.</v>

792
00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Someone's done to I think somebody down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to look it up.</v>

793
00:35:01.821 --> 00:35:03.560
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

794
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:06.020
<v Speaker 1>So one shot fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd probably be,</v>

795
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 1>you fighting me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just hit me and I'd go down.</v>

796
00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:13.430
<v Speaker 1>There's been quite a few in the that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've called one punch and the beginning</v>

797
00:35:13.431 --> 00:35:14.270
<v Speaker 1>of the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bam,</v>

798
00:35:14.271 --> 00:35:17.330
<v Speaker 1>someone gets hit and they go down at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least three or four in the history of</v>

799
00:35:17.331 --> 00:35:20.000
<v Speaker 1>the fai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duane ludwig like six seconds.</v>

800
00:35:20.001 --> 00:35:21.290
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First punch you through.</v>

801
00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:24.170
<v Speaker 1>That probably made me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already talked about working out.</v>

802
00:35:24.171 --> 00:35:27.950
<v Speaker 1>So you're not to go down pretty quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you've never worked out</v>

848
00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:26.160

<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got them,</v>

857
00:37:41.491 --> 00:37:44.850

<v Speaker 2>I'm on instagram too much.</v>

858
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:50.910
<v Speaker 2>it seems like every girl from Texas on</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram has tattoos all over the</v>

859
00:37:50.911 --> 00:37:52.080
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

860
00:37:52.081 --> 00:37:53.460
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

861
00:37:53.461 --> 00:37:55.280
<v Speaker 2>there's 20 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not 100,</v>

862
00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:56.443
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

863
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Out here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thousands.</v>

864
00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:00.030
<v Speaker 2>They're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to like venice Beach.</v>

865
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.850
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find a girl doesn't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tattoo that's unique these days.</v>

866
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:04.460
<v Speaker 2>That's a real rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

867
00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:09.000
<v Speaker 2>Girl with no piercings and no tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's either rebel or boring.</v>

868
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Probably both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's rebelling against being exciting.</v>

869
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.970
<v Speaker 2>I think the girl bodybuilder though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is people get into</v>

870
00:38:20.971 --> 00:38:23.850
<v Speaker 2>something and they forget how weird it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is for everybody else.</v>

871
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.010
<v Speaker 2>So as they get deeper and deeper into</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

872
00:38:26.011 --> 00:38:29.460
<v Speaker 2>they just want to excel at it and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to lift more weights and you know,</v>

873
00:38:29.461 --> 00:38:32.700
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to put more on the squat</v>
<v Speaker 2>rack or they're dead lift in their neck</v>

874
00:38:32.701 --> 00:38:33.540
<v Speaker 2>gets big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

875
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:35.680
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

876

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.500

<v Speaker 1>time that was real into.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of broccoli or to scale.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's good stuff.</v>

920
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell I'm ron white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think your tequila is better.</v>

921
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.750
<v Speaker 1>He'll get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get mad at me.</v>

922
00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:51.170
<v Speaker 1>He loves his tequila.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We came up with this because this is the</v>

923
00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.900
<v Speaker 1>only tequila over finances made in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

924
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you have to do sco,</v>

925
00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real blue golf.</v>

926
00:40:57.301 --> 00:41:02.301
<v Speaker 1>A tequila is always at your America from</v>
<v Speaker 1>elise co to get around that.</v>

927
00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:06.700
<v Speaker 1>I ship it in and tankers and then I do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it here.</v>

928
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:11.470
<v Speaker 1>So we're switching built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our distributors are just distillers</v>

929
00:41:11.471 --> 00:41:16.210
<v Speaker 1>right now and will be made in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't grow it in America.</v>

930
00:41:16.211 --> 00:41:18.880
<v Speaker 1>You can't grow the economy in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

931
00:41:18.881 --> 00:41:21.940
<v Speaker 1>but a real tequila just like champagne</v>
<v Speaker 1>in France,</v>

932
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real tequila is always from elise go</v>

933
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:28.960
<v Speaker 1>area and what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How weird is that?</v>

934
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like burgundy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

935
00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:32.740
<v Speaker 1>These from your burrito burrito.</v>

936
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

937
00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:37.190
<v Speaker 1>that didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's funny.</v>

938
00:41:37.191 --> 00:41:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

939
00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.290
<v Speaker 1>I kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I kind of knew that.</v>

940
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

941
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Can make anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're literally sold out right now</v>

942
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:46.070
<v Speaker 1>worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

943
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:50.060
<v Speaker 1>I took it to the troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went and did a deal with the px</v>

944
00:41:50.061 --> 00:41:55.061
<v Speaker 1>exchanges on all the bases in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they wiped me out and so we're</v>

946
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.270

<v Speaker 1>I had to borrow a couple of bottles from</v>

947
00:42:02.271 --> 00:42:05.540
<v Speaker 1>somebody with hoarding them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a fucking dope logo though.</v>

948
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.480
<v Speaker 1>That monkey with the tongue hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have that on the outside of</v>

949
00:42:08.481 --> 00:42:10.460
<v Speaker 1>your garage.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We've got a little spot where people</v>

952
00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.840
<v Speaker 1>come by and see the cars.</v>

953
00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.270

<v Speaker 1>drink or water and that will be like</v>

972
00:43:13.431 --> 00:43:15.650
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forced them from the property.</v>

973
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.090

<v Speaker 1>accident,</v>

977
00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.240
<v Speaker 1>he could say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the drunk ones,</v>

980
00:43:31.281 --> 00:43:33.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll put them in an uber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm talking about just the crazy</v>

<v Speaker 1>never will.</v>

1147
00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.650
<v Speaker 1>And just because it's like a benchmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

1148
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big proponent and believer in</v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing yourself,</v>

1149
00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth sell it to,</v>

1150
00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:29.950
<v Speaker 1>to want more to do more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1151
00:50:29.951 --> 00:50:32.690
<v Speaker 1>to give yourself motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people just save and save and</v>

1152
00:50:32.691 --> 00:50:34.010
<v Speaker 1>save and I'm more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1153
00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:37.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do something that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably shouldn't do right now so that</v>

1154
00:50:37.551 --> 00:50:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I know I got to work hard to make sure I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to give it up.</v>

1155
00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm wiTh you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1156
00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:43.760
<v Speaker 1>that's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk my friends into that shit.</v>

1157
00:50:43.761 --> 00:50:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I talked to my friend tony into buying a</v>
<v Speaker 1>corvette when he can't afford it.</v>

1158
00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Taught my friend brendan and about a gt</v>
<v Speaker 1>three rs.</v>

1159
00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:51.200
<v Speaker 1>So it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1160
00:50:51.201 --> 00:50:53.210
<v Speaker 1>I bought the car when I probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't,</v>

1161
00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.910
<v Speaker 1>but the show was going and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this will make me work hard on this,</v>

1162
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:58.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sits in the corner when I'm doing it.</v>

1163
00:50:58.341 --> 00:50:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I get up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at it,</v>

1164
00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to make sure that I can afford</v>

1165
00:51:01.941 --> 00:51:03.770
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's go do it too.</v>

1166
00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:06.650
<v Speaker 1>And I believe in that wholeheartedly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say you're ridiculous.</v>

1167
00:51:06.651 --> 00:51:07.484
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1168
00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:08.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1169
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:09.591
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was young,</v>

1170
00:51:09.591 --> 00:51:11.710
<v Speaker 1>I was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I first got into printing and</v>

1171
00:51:11.711 --> 00:51:14.630
<v Speaker 1>advertising at shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could barely make rent.</v>

1172
00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.890
<v Speaker 1>I think I was buying my suits it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1173
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:18.950
<v Speaker 1>a resell shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would go to neiman's and look</v>

1174
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:20.470
<v Speaker 1>around and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1175
00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.290
<v Speaker 1>and think about what I was going to buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1176
00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Just putting the motivation in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1177
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:27.980
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's a big movement now with</v>
<v Speaker 1>making your imagination board or</v>

1178
00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:28.814
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1179
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:30.050
<v Speaker 1>those people are assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1180
00:51:30.051 --> 00:51:34.220
<v Speaker 1>My shit just wanted to reel in your head</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had that vision board.</v>

1181
00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're 20 and you're doing that,</v>

1182
00:51:37.071 --> 00:51:39.080
<v Speaker 1>you don't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My vision boards,</v>

1183
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:41.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old poster of the rock band with his</v>

1184
00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:45.830
<v Speaker 1>weed and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a great mission.</v>

1185
00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real vision board.</v>

1186
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1187
00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer in doing this is what</v>

1188
00:51:52.161 --> 00:51:56.090
<v Speaker 1>I say to someone who can buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can actually buy a ferrari.</v>

1189
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:57.141
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

1190
00:51:57.141 --> 00:51:59.360

<v Speaker 1>who will,</v>

1191
00:51:59.361 --> 00:52:02.000
<v Speaker 1>if you're an 18 year old kid and you got</v>
<v Speaker 1>no money,</v>

1192
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:03.050
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1193
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:06.170
<v Speaker 1>find enough to buy a ferrari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh god,</v>

1194
00:52:06.171 --> 00:52:08.420
<v Speaker 1>I'd be so happy I'd buy that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1195
00:52:08.421 --> 00:52:10.550
<v Speaker 1>you should do it if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

1196
00:52:10.551 --> 00:52:11.840
<v Speaker 1>You should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is it,</v>

1197

<v Speaker 1>is it too much money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's definitely too much money.</v>

1199
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:17.120
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the whole part point of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>

1202
00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:21.260

<v Speaker 1>I use it more as motivation.</v>

1203
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:23.300
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I afford this?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel that way about everything.</v>

1208
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:33.440
<v Speaker 1>So do I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been my mantra forever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Elan musk there,</v>

1217
00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:54.650
<v Speaker 1>he kind of ruined it for us because now</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually have a possibility of</v>

1218
00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:57.410
<v Speaker 1>getting in a car wreck and space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1219
00:52:57.411 --> 00:52:59.960
<v Speaker 1>You could get in a car wreck and space</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that car is just floating around</v>

1220
00:52:59.961 --> 00:53:02.570
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if that car slams into a fucking</v>

1221
00:53:02.571 --> 00:53:05.330
<v Speaker 1>alien?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spaceships is coming to save us and elon</v>

1222
00:53:05.331 --> 00:53:08.630
<v Speaker 1>musk just frivolously shot that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in the orbit.</v>

1223
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:11.240
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just shot it up there and they'd let</v>

1224
00:53:11.241 --> 00:53:13.400
<v Speaker 1>him with a robot sitting in the front</v>
<v Speaker 1>seat.</v>

1225
00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:14.960
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1226
00:53:14.961 --> 00:53:19.340
<v Speaker 1>what if that guy in the front seat is</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a guy who fucked his wife and</v>

1227
00:53:19.341 --> 00:53:22.370
<v Speaker 1>he decided to kill that guy and stick</v>
<v Speaker 1>him in a fucking space suit.</v>

1228
00:53:22.371 --> 00:53:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Shoot him into orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1229
00:53:23.711 --> 00:53:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want to be at the guy if he</v>

1230
00:53:25.831 --> 00:53:27.240
<v Speaker 1>does that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be mad at your wife.</v>

<v Speaker 1>apparel line and so I'll be wearing a</v>

<v Speaker 1>because I've crashed because I thought</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was fun and thrown out of your own</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1275
00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1276
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:21.160
<v Speaker 1>they usually just take me home because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>live on the course,</v>

1277
00:55:21.161 --> 00:55:23.400
<v Speaker 1>so they'll drop me down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

1315
00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:57.550
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

1318
00:57:03.371 --> 00:57:04.460

<v Speaker 3>And by the,</v>

1319
00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:08.650
<v Speaker 3>so if you charge a man with a salt</v>

<v Speaker 3>you should turn in your card.</v>

1321
00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.930
<v Speaker 3>But if we were to tape it was not like</v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing it at him.</v>

1322
00:57:13.931 --> 00:57:16.180
<v Speaker 3>It's not like I've barely with a</v>

<v Speaker 3>slapped him and Fell down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they cuffed me.</v>

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.950
<v Speaker 3>They take me down to the guard house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>focus on is there's a perfectly good</v>

1334
00:57:44.711 --> 00:57:47.800
<v Speaker 3>vegan burrito.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to eat this burrito.</v>

1335
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:52.390
<v Speaker 3>So sit down and literally start eating</v>
<v Speaker 3>the burrito and you're like,</v>

1336
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:53.590
<v Speaker 3>please just tell her you're sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1338
00:57:55.301 --> 00:57:57.640
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I tell him I'm sorry I'm still eating</v>

1339
00:57:57.641 --> 00:58:01.180
<v Speaker 3>a burrito and they just left me there</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a mile from my house at the.</v>

1340
00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:07.060
<v Speaker 3>You walked home with mild drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see the guy since then?</v>

1341
00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:09.483
<v Speaker 3>Oh gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1342
00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:10.271
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1343
00:58:10.271 --> 00:58:13.240
<v Speaker 3>that was perfectly back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was in the days before the</v>

1344
00:58:13.241 --> 00:58:15.880
<v Speaker 3>sprinters are so popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like a stretch limo,</v>

1345
00:58:15.881 --> 00:58:16.400
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1346
00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.790
<v Speaker 3>you just really don't ride it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1347
00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.000
<v Speaker 3>that's a hell of a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Came out of the back window,</v>

1348
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.530
<v Speaker 3>120 inches up to the front,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit the gas squared,</v>

1349
00:58:24.531 --> 00:58:27.320
<v Speaker 3>the fucking chest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should get a medal for that.</v>

1350
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:31.930
<v Speaker 3>Assault</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be a plus in here.</v>

1351
00:58:31.931 --> 00:58:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Assault with a burrito is probably the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first time we've had that.</v>

1352
00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:39.220
<v Speaker 3>And you're a little a podcast room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think it's the first time</v>

1353
00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:42.070
<v Speaker 3>it seems like you'd just be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1354
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:44.470
<v Speaker 3>I just throw it to you because I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk.</v>

1355
00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:47.020
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is really what it was.</v>

1356
00:58:47.021 --> 00:58:49.120
<v Speaker 3>This is what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can hear me on the video going,</v>

1357
00:58:49.121 --> 00:58:50.170
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want a burrito?</v>

1358
00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:54.400
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty ridiculous.</v>

1359
00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:56.530
<v Speaker 3>The guy got a bankcard yang for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1360
00:58:56.531 --> 00:58:58.990
<v Speaker 3>What someone calls us salt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how dare you.</v>

1361
00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:04.080
<v Speaker 3>Some people get beaten to a pulp and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>call him a taco bell burrito flying your</v>

1362
00:59:04.241 --> 00:59:06.260
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thing costs a dollar 99 dude</v>

1363
00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:12.560
<v Speaker 3>and it's barely meet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were going over like how much of</v>

1364
00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:19.240
<v Speaker 3>a ruling on how much meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It actually has to be where you can call</v>

1365
00:59:19.241 --> 00:59:21.740
<v Speaker 3>it a beef burrito,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's fillers</v>

1366
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.270
<v Speaker 1>in that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the filler was like</v>

1367
00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:28.010
<v Speaker 1>silicone or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's something ridiculous like 34</v>

1368
00:59:28.011 --> 00:59:31.270
<v Speaker 1>percent of it is not actually meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

1369
00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 percent for the internet.</v>

1370
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:40.970
<v Speaker 1>They can pretend it's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1371
00:59:40.971 --> 00:59:43.220
<v Speaker 1>the cool thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taco bell now starting to open all their</v>

1372
00:59:43.221 --> 00:59:45.740
<v Speaker 1>ones up with bars inside there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1373

1498
01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:14.340
<v Speaker 2>choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was a better choice of this is why</v>

1499
01:05:14.341 --> 01:05:16.650
<v Speaker 2>he's the better choice because to</v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that our system is completely</v>

1505
01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:30.790
<v Speaker 3>It's a good example of how our system is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best,</v>

1506
01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:35.640
<v Speaker 3>best system in the world for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 3>People fragment out everything you say.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to most guys like myself.</v>

1563
01:08:08.831 --> 01:08:10.750
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what started the hot rod</v>

1564
01:08:10.751 --> 01:08:12.520
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were cheap.</v>

1565
01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:15.970
<v Speaker 3>They were plentIful.</v>

<v Speaker 1>eight in it and that became the hot rod</v>

1568
01:08:23.121 --> 01:08:28.121
<v Speaker 1>scene and right because like in 47,</v>
<v Speaker 1>32 ford was like the old used car that</v>

01:10:04.191 --> 01:10:06.530

1603
01:10:06.531 --> 01:10:09.410
<v Speaker 1>he came back kind of full circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a whole different kind of person</v>

01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:02.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in the state of Texas,</v>

1832
01:20:02.421 --> 01:20:05.660
<v Speaker 3>it's probably the second or third</v>
<v Speaker 3>largest home health care.</v>

1833
01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 3>But I'm talking a real home healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you got to get shots,</v>

1834
01:20:07.981 --> 01:20:09.200
<v Speaker 3>you've got to get therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got,</v>

1835
01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:12.950
<v Speaker 3>these are trends that are going in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not people you go into bathe</v>

1836
01:20:12.970 --> 01:20:14.490
<v Speaker 3>grandma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is your business?</v>

1837
01:20:14.970 --> 01:20:17.910
<v Speaker 3>You hire a bunch of nurses to take care</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people that are at home.</v>

1838
01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:19.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's prescribed,</v>

1839
01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:21.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like through medicare or insurance or</v>

1840
01:20:21.571 --> 01:20:26.190
<v Speaker 3>whatever to where maybe somebody gets a</v>
<v Speaker 3>knee or a shoulder replacement or maybe</v>

1841
01:20:26.191 --> 01:20:29.550
<v Speaker 3>it's an injury or cancer or what have</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1842
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.530
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a very rewarding business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We probably have 3000 to 2,500,</v>

1843
01:20:34.531 --> 01:20:38.070
<v Speaker 3>3000 patients at any given time all</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the state of Texas.</v>

1844
01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:40.020
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>

1845
01:20:40.021 --> 01:20:40.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1846
01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:44.460
<v Speaker 3>it's a fun business to be in that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>really getting help people.</v>

1847
01:20:44.461 --> 01:20:46.800
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit out there,</v>

1848
01:20:46.801 --> 01:20:48.960
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys are,</v>

1849
01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:52.530
<v Speaker 3>they're getting after it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd go into the nursing home and it's</v>

1850
01:20:52.531 --> 01:20:53.600
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

<v Speaker 3>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>the goal is like,</v>

1908
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:27.910
<v Speaker 3>or the bonus rather is that they can't</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's not happening,</v>

01:23:34.601 --> 01:23:36.460
<v Speaker 3>but you can still get some diseases and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1912
01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:38.620
<v Speaker 3>And they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes they do.</v>

<v Speaker 3>done it right.</v>

1916
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:50.790
<v Speaker 3>But did they have it already or they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting it from the building now.</v>

1917
01:23:51.311 --> 01:23:52.930
<v Speaker 3>They had it already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had already.</v>

1918
01:23:52.931 --> 01:23:56.230
<v Speaker 3>So you're dealing with herpes or you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with the real weird ones like</v>

1919
01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:58.030

<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1932
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:20.390
<v Speaker 3>Somebody,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Two thousand 11 chlamydia infections</v>

<v Speaker 3>amongst americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>60 five and over.</v>

1935

<v Speaker 3>Increased by 31 percent and syphilis by</v>
<v Speaker 3>52 percent.</v>

1936
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:34.240

<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1938
01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:40.170
<v Speaker 3>Let's say there's 100 cases and then the</v>
<v Speaker 3>next year there's a 150.</v>

1939
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:45.430
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 52 percent.</v>

1940
01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:48.310

1943
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:56.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to buy some though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the number of percent</v>

1944
01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:00.580
<v Speaker 3>because if there's four people and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next year there's six.</v>

1945
01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:02.830
<v Speaker 3>That's 50 percent increase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I'm saying,</v>

1946
01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:04.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't like numbers like that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could make.</v>

1947
01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an epidemic I want,</v>

1948
01:25:06.971 --> 01:25:10.270
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want numbers like human beings.</v>

1949
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:12.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm sure it's out there on the web,</v>

1950
01:25:12.341 --> 01:25:14.890
<v Speaker 3>but like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad's probably thinks committee as a</v>

1951
01:25:14.891 --> 01:25:15.910
<v Speaker 3>flower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's given me.</v>

1952
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:20.080
<v Speaker 3>He's given this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get you some ideas and</v>

1953
01:25:20.081 --> 01:25:21.340
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1954
01:25:21.341 --> 01:25:23.380
<v Speaker 3>there's no condoms in nursing homes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1955
01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:28.690
<v Speaker 3>we got 3000 reported case of committee</v>
<v Speaker 3>among people.</v>

1956
01:25:28.691 --> 01:25:29.800
<v Speaker 3>40th five and older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1957
01:25:29.801 --> 01:25:32.590
<v Speaker 3>But I'm 45 and older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's normal.</v>

1958
01:25:32.890 --> 01:25:35.450
<v Speaker 3>Forty five and older people are walking</v>
<v Speaker 3>around meeting new people.</v>

1959
01:25:36.410 --> 01:25:38.730
<v Speaker 3>Forty 3000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems like a very low number.</v>

1960
01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Super low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1961
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:44.380
<v Speaker 3>That's why I don't like these percentage</v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers gonorrhea had see from doing</v>

1962
01:25:44.381 --> 01:25:46.480
<v Speaker 3>this podcast all these years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've.</v>

1963
01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:50.830
<v Speaker 3>I understand when people can make things</v>
<v Speaker 3>seem greater than they really are.</v>

1964
01:25:50.831 --> 01:25:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Go back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

<v Speaker 3>to the comedy store,</v>

1967
01:25:58.601 --> 01:26:01.860
<v Speaker 3>but I think that was some asshole</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand.</v>

1968

<v Speaker 3>Sounds low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1971
01:26:07.671 --> 01:26:10.670
<v Speaker 2>this age group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>40th five.</v>

1972
01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:15.470
<v Speaker 2>The thing about 45 and older is 45 year</v>
<v Speaker 2>old people in 2019.</v>

1973
01:26:15.471 --> 01:26:18.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not like 45 year old people in tHe</v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties.</v>

1974
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These animals are out there fucking</v>

<v Speaker 2>flying to Thailand.</v>

1976
01:26:22.821 --> 01:26:25.070
<v Speaker 2>They're probably getting it from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweat on the gym bench.</v>

1977
01:26:25.071 --> 01:26:30.071
<v Speaker 2>They could get staff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lady who almost died from staff</v>

1978

01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:37.250
<v Speaker 2>She had some weird rash on her leg and</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one told her that it was a staph</v>

<v Speaker 2>just one time that I was.</v>

2024
01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:44.050
<v Speaker 2>I was rolling with a friend of mine and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got on top of me,</v>

2025
01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:46.880

<v Speaker 2>like his chest sweat was dripping in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>face and we were laughing about it.</v>

2029
01:28:53.630 --> 01:28:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is starting to get weird.</v>

2030
01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:58.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just part of like learning how to</v>

2031
01:28:58.131 --> 01:29:03.131
<v Speaker 2>kill people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with the of training for Texas.</v>

2032
01:29:03.151 --> 01:29:04.550
<v Speaker 2>We just use guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2033
01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:06.360
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of jujitsu schools in</v>

2034
01:29:06.361 --> 01:29:08.070
<v Speaker 2>tech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at the stats on the std</v>

2035
01:29:08.071 --> 01:29:11.940
<v Speaker 2>thing for older people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is an article I found said only</v>

2036
01:29:11.941 --> 01:29:16.580
<v Speaker 2>five percent of adults are using</v>
<v Speaker 2>medicare to take the std tests,</v>

2037
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:20.010
<v Speaker 2>so it could be way higher if you're just</v>
<v Speaker 2>not getting tested.</v>

2038
01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:21.180
<v Speaker 2>It's way high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2039
01:29:21.181 --> 01:29:23.220
<v Speaker 2>suck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Vietnam.</v>

2040
01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a rash.</v>

2041
01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the thing is like who's trying to</v>

2042
01:29:28.591 --> 01:29:31.560
<v Speaker 2>stop these people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who stopped those people,</v>

2043
01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:32.730
<v Speaker 2>they're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let them,</v>

2044
01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.790
<v Speaker 2>let them drop them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be going in there and passing out</v>

2045
01:29:35.791 --> 01:29:39.860

<v Speaker 2>it math.</v>

2046
01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:41.460

<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do that.</v>

2047

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2050
01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:50.280
<v Speaker 2>it's not even a way out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a way forward.</v>

2051
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:53.000
<v Speaker 2>We gave uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>palm springs,</v>

2117
01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:03.370
<v Speaker 2>California out in the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're developing this enormous</v>

2118
01:33:03.371 --> 01:33:06.430
<v Speaker 2>property where they're going to grow</v>
<v Speaker 2>weed and they're also going to have this</v>

<v Speaker 2>huge place where people can go and have</v>
<v Speaker 2>this resort,</v>

2120
01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:11.560
<v Speaker 2>like a weed amusement park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally,</v>

2121
01:33:11.561 --> 01:33:14.560
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have concerts there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like coachella type events,</v>

2122
01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:16.780
<v Speaker 2>what do they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kush fest or some shit</v>

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:23.630
<v Speaker 2>fucking around the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People behind it have deep pockets and</v>

2124
01:33:23.650 --> 01:33:27.790
<v Speaker 2>they're going hard because what people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have seen in Colorado and people are</v>

2125
01:33:27.791 --> 01:33:30.360
<v Speaker 2>starting to see in Washington state and</v>
<v Speaker 2>now in California,</v>

2126
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:33.940
<v Speaker 2>there's just an enormous amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in marijuana,</v>

2127
01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:35.710
<v Speaker 2>like crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous,</v>

2128
01:33:35.711 --> 01:33:36.544
<v Speaker 2>silly profit.</v>

2129
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:39.790
<v Speaker 2>If you're doing it and you're taxing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're doing it responsibly.</v>

2130
01:33:40.150 --> 01:33:42.070
<v Speaker 2>The way I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no different than going to the</v>

2131
01:33:42.071 --> 01:33:45.070
<v Speaker 2>store to buy beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all combined too much beer and do</v>

2132
01:33:45.071 --> 01:33:48.400
<v Speaker 2>something stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've had four shots in an hour on a</v>

2133
01:33:48.401 --> 01:33:50.910
<v Speaker 2>radio show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a driver driver.</v>

2134
01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.380
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to do it responsibly.</v>

2135
01:33:53.710 --> 01:33:55.190
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2136
01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:57.460
<v Speaker 2>owning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>owning a tequila company in,</v>

2137
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.930
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2138
01:33:57.930 --> 01:34:00.010
<v Speaker 2>in bars and restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of have to.</v>

2139
01:34:00.090 --> 01:34:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes the fun out of it because I'm a</v>

2140
01:34:02.201 --> 01:34:03.190
<v Speaker 2>driver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a car guy.</v>

2141
01:34:03.191 --> 01:34:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2142
01:34:05.410 --> 01:34:07.570
<v Speaker 2>but be responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always be responsible.</v>

2143
01:34:07.810 --> 01:34:08.710
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2144
01:34:08.711 --> 01:34:13.030
<v Speaker 2>the thing is also</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are a person who likes fun,</v>

2145
01:34:13.570 --> 01:34:17.920
<v Speaker 2>like what are you trying to stop fun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone's To smoke a little</v>

2146
01:34:17.921 --> 01:34:19.570
<v Speaker 2>weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a little tequila,</v>

2147
01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.740
<v Speaker 2>drink a couple of beers.</v>

2148
01:34:20.770 --> 01:34:22.960
<v Speaker 2>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that unless people are being</v>

2149
01:34:22.961 --> 01:34:23.920
<v Speaker 2>responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2150
01:34:23.921 --> 01:34:27.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't see a drastic difference between</v>
<v Speaker 2>the alcohol or marijuana.</v>

2151
01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:31.720
<v Speaker 2>As long as you're obeying the laws being</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for paying your taxes.</v>

2152
01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I 100 percent agree.</v>

2153
01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:37.210
<v Speaker 2>I also talk about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if all the people in the world,</v>

2154
01:34:37.211 --> 01:34:41.350
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and jamie and if jamie had decided</v>

2155
01:34:41.351 --> 01:34:45.130
<v Speaker 2>that he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought that we were criminals and</v>

2156
01:34:45.290 --> 01:34:48.040
<v Speaker 2>we're not allowed to drink alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2157
01:34:48.041 --> 01:34:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's getting installed prohibition in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our small community.</v>

2158
01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:53.290
<v Speaker 2>He'll be ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would be like,</v>

2159
01:34:53.291 --> 01:34:56.590
<v Speaker 2>fuck you man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's literally like the</v>

2160
01:34:56.591 --> 01:34:58.820
<v Speaker 2>government telling you you can't do</v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>

2161
01:34:58.870 --> 01:35:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Are the government telling you you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke weed?</v>

2162
01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:05.340
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just a grown man telling other</v>
<v Speaker 2>grown men they can.</v>

2163
01:35:05.630 --> 01:35:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Based on what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not based on what we voted on.</v>

2164
01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Like if people really knew the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information involved in the safety of</v>

2165
01:35:11.391 --> 01:35:12.560
<v Speaker 2>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it freak you out?</v>

2166
01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it does because it makes you</v>

2167
01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:18.350
<v Speaker 2>paranoid 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But does alcohol make you an asshole?</v>

2168
01:35:18.351 --> 01:35:19.960
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yes it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Yeah,</v>

2169
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:21.890
<v Speaker 2>but do I think that everybody should</v>
<v Speaker 2>have all of it?</v>

2170
01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Cbs rejects superbowl that based on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits of medical marijuana.</v>

2171
01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>In their defense there's probably a</v>

2172
01:35:30.531 --> 01:35:34.370
<v Speaker 2>bunch of people or stockholders and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of decisions that are made</v>

2173
01:35:34.371 --> 01:35:38.030
<v Speaker 2>that are made by lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want it just before people get</v>

2174
01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.370
<v Speaker 2>angry about something that cbs decided</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

2175
01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:45.580
<v Speaker 2>You have to understand the cbs is</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for the employment of untold</v>

2176
01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:49.370
<v Speaker 2>thousands of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have bud light ads</v>

2177
01:35:49.371 --> 01:35:51.690
<v Speaker 2>right next to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will or whatever they will.</v>

2178
01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:53.180
<v Speaker 2>They will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bud light,</v>

2179
01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:56.000
<v Speaker 2>bud light ads are not going to affect</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone's bottom line.</v>

2180
01:35:56.150 --> 01:35:58.190
<v Speaker 2>I dOn't agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree,</v>

2181
01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:00.020
<v Speaker 2>but I just want people to understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2182
01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Part of the problem is that the business</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect of this has not been fully</v>

2183
01:36:04.551 --> 01:36:06.530
<v Speaker 2>established.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once it's fully established,</v>

2184
01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:10.310
<v Speaker 2>cbs and all these people are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>realize it isn't any different than bud</v>

2185
01:36:10.311 --> 01:36:12.200
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not any different than anything you</v>

2186
01:36:12.201 --> 01:36:15.740
<v Speaker 2>can get fucked up on bud light if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just drink 20 of them,</v>

2187
01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:18.590
<v Speaker 2>you can get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could walk inTo trees,</v>

2188
01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:19.580
<v Speaker 2>you do it on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2189
01:36:19.670 --> 01:36:21.310
<v Speaker 2>cough medicine or what else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2190
01:36:21.311 --> 01:36:22.570
<v Speaker 2>that stuff's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2191
01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:24.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many pharmaceutical drugs can you</v>

2192
01:36:24.741 --> 01:36:27.650
<v Speaker 2>get fucked up on and do we deny that</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people love,</v>

2193
01:36:27.651 --> 01:36:30.740
<v Speaker 2>like serious injuries benefit greatly</v>
<v Speaker 2>from pain pills?</v>

2194
01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they definitely do.</v>

2195
01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:35.660
<v Speaker 2>The thing about it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all is you got to be honest and let</v>

2196
01:36:35.661 --> 01:36:39.260
<v Speaker 2>people form their own opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of being honest about it,</v>

2197
01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:42.440
<v Speaker 2>about these things is tell them the pros</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the cons.</v>

2198
01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:47.000
<v Speaker 2>Everything has a pro and a con including</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole people banging it out and nursing</v>

2199
01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:49.350
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2200
01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Getting committee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2201
01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not good.</v>

2202
01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:53.380
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2203
01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:56.720
<v Speaker 2>the pro and the con is my dad's a pro</v>
<v Speaker 2>banging old ladies in nursing home,</v>

2204
01:36:57.020 --> 01:37:00.380
<v Speaker 2>but the con is he's probably got some</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff on his little winter down there,</v>

2205
01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:04.310
<v Speaker 2>probably passing some biological</v>
<v Speaker 2>footballs,</v>

2206
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:06.680
<v Speaker 2>but he's not getting pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2207
01:37:06.681 --> 01:37:09.770
<v Speaker 2>he's not getting pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's getting pregnant and listen</v>

2208
01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.180
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get colds.</v>

2209
01:37:11.181 --> 01:37:13.670
<v Speaker 2>TheY get the flu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of weird things happen when</v>

2210
01:37:13.671 --> 01:37:17.150
<v Speaker 2>people corral around are the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we supposed to live like john</v>

2211
01:37:17.151 --> 01:37:20.410
<v Speaker 2>travolta and the boy in the plastic</v>
<v Speaker 2>bubble and fucking lock ourselves in</v>

2212
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:23.480
<v Speaker 2>hermetically sealed chambers and never</v>
<v Speaker 2>touch each other again.</v>

2213
01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck out of this true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just take your penicillin back it off,</v>

2214
01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.390
<v Speaker 2>but that's what napoleon did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walk up.</v>

2215
01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Gladys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you might've given him a thing</v>

2216
01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:35.480
<v Speaker 2>or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just hit the massengill.</v>

2217
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:36.920
<v Speaker 2>You'll be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder.</v>

2218
01:37:36.970 --> 01:37:40.370
<v Speaker 2>I wonder who's delivering these venereal</v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases.</v>

2219
01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:42.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be fascinating if we found it</v>

2220
01:37:42.441 --> 01:37:46.370
<v Speaker 2>was primarily women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like 78 percent of women are the</v>

2221
01:37:46.371 --> 01:37:49.310
<v Speaker 2>original source of the venereal disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2222
01:37:49.311 --> 01:37:50.450
<v Speaker 2>they pulled the apple down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2223
01:37:51.250 --> 01:37:54.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a bitch ass man who</v>

2224
01:37:54.531 --> 01:37:59.531
<v Speaker 2>blamed it on the chick</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I heard that adam and eve story.</v>

2225
01:38:00.631 --> 01:38:01.500
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2226
01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:03.930
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe adam was a bitch.</v>

2227
01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:07.560
<v Speaker 2>She blamed it on eve and he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the guy who could write.</v>

2228
01:38:07.561 --> 01:38:10.830
<v Speaker 2>So he wrote things down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like either drop a and do shit.</v>

2229
01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:14.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm a good listener.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He probably ate the apple first.</v>

2230
01:38:14.970 --> 01:38:17.030
<v Speaker 2>I probably gave it to eve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2231
01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:18.720
<v Speaker 2>history is written by the winners.</v>

2232
01:38:19.170 --> 01:38:21.900
<v Speaker 2>This is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of women just to let that shit</v>

2233
01:38:21.901 --> 01:38:23.490
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let them talk.</v>

2234
01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:25.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right down the night that I will fuck</v>

2235
01:38:25.951 --> 01:38:26.640
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2236
01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.490
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And adam and eve,</v>

2237
01:38:29.550 --> 01:38:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't see adam and eve having that New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York accent</v>

2238
01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:35.340
<v Speaker 2>where they get it in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't there yet.</v>

2239
01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:38.970
<v Speaker 2>I feel like adam and eve would talk like</v>
<v Speaker 2>british people because anytime they have</v>

2240
01:38:38.971 --> 01:38:41.490
<v Speaker 2>a movie where people talk like old</v>
<v Speaker 2>timey,</v>

2241
01:38:41.491 --> 01:38:42.780
<v Speaker 2>whether it's gladiator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2242
01:38:42.781 --> 01:38:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Everyone talks with an english accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever notice that?</v>

2243
01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:48.870
<v Speaker 2>If we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2244
01:38:48.871 --> 01:38:50.450
<v Speaker 2>If we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2245
01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:52.680
<v Speaker 2>there's like the suspension of</v>
<v Speaker 2>disbelief.</v>

2246
01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>latin and latin,</v>

2247
01:38:55.111 --> 01:38:56.610
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounded like.</v>

2248
01:38:56.611 --> 01:38:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>

2249
01:38:57.961 --> 01:39:01.710
<v Speaker 2>when you watching some old ass movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>about people talking lot and they'll</v>

2250
01:39:01.711 --> 01:39:04.170
<v Speaker 2>speak english,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they'll speak it with an english</v>

2251
01:39:04.171 --> 01:39:05.810
<v Speaker 2>accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2252
01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:10.190
<v Speaker 2>That only speak proper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always have some weird old timey</v>

2253
01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:13.290
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's ever watched the movie otherwise?</v>

2254
01:39:13.770 --> 01:39:14.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you.</v>

2255
01:39:14.791 --> 01:39:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why is that?</v>

2256
01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Because it's got to make it watchable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they ruined stories.</v>

2257
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:23.640
<v Speaker 2>What t two english people is that played</v>
<v Speaker 2>out like eleanor's are played out to</v>

2258
01:39:23.641 --> 01:39:24.640
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>

2259
01:39:24.650 --> 01:39:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to english people,</v>

2260
01:39:26.251 --> 01:39:28.950
<v Speaker 2>they hear that accent every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a normal accent.</v>

2261
01:39:29.070 --> 01:39:30.420
<v Speaker 2>But to us it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2262
01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:32.680
<v Speaker 2>this is like an old timey language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hangul.</v>

2263
01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:36.540
<v Speaker 2>Why is russell crowe talking like he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>from fucking london?</v>

2264
01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:37.770
<v Speaker 2>This is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2265
01:39:38.230 --> 01:39:40.620
<v Speaker 2>I got a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big chris,</v>

2266
01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:44.160
<v Speaker 2>and he likes to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we invented the english language</v>

2267
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:45.021
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2268
01:39:45.021 --> 01:39:46.100
<v Speaker 2>and he fucked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2269
01:39:46.110 --> 01:39:48.090
<v Speaker 2>you guys made it so that people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>

2270
01:39:48.091 --> 01:39:49.770
<v Speaker 2>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not smart.</v>

2271
01:39:49.771 --> 01:39:50.640
<v Speaker 2>We've made it better.</v>

2272
01:39:50.730 --> 01:39:54.000
<v Speaker 2>We really did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just say that my rebuttal to him was</v>

2273
01:39:54.001 --> 01:39:54.511
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

2274
01:39:54.511 --> 01:39:58.380
<v Speaker 2>well somebody from your town still</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to be a rapper in their defense</v>

2275
01:39:58.381 --> 01:40:00.630
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will always say to you like,</v>

2276
01:40:00.631 --> 01:40:01.560
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but listen,</v>

2277
01:40:01.561 --> 01:40:04.320
<v Speaker 2>you guys respect our language more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>you respect yours.</v>

2278
01:40:04.530 --> 01:40:06.570
<v Speaker 2>And it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like american english is not as</v>

2279
01:40:06.571 --> 01:40:10.620
<v Speaker 2>respectable as english english because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why they use those english people</v>

2280
01:40:10.621 --> 01:40:13.500
<v Speaker 2>to sell like late night mops and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2281
01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:16.980
<v Speaker 2>Call me dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fucking nonstick frying pans.</v>

2282

<v Speaker 2>accent.</v>

2283

<v Speaker 2>I can just find these eggs and they</v>

2284
01:40:22.291 --> 01:40:26.210
<v Speaker 2>slide right onto the plate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believable.</v>

2285
01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Throw back a nickels in there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>scratch it up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

2355
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:42.940
<v Speaker 2>They understand every word they say so</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:45.020
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not in that environment.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's got a flavor though.</v>

2358
01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:50.990
<v Speaker 2>They have a flavor that we don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2359
01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:55.370
<v Speaker 2>It's a dark old world flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey listen mate,</v>

<v Speaker 2>on a boat and shooting arrows at people.</v>

2361
01:43:59.630 --> 01:44:04.630
<v Speaker 2>They kept that same language</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're always looking to fIght out</v>

2362
01:44:05.781 --> 01:44:08.120
<v Speaker 2>of fucking fight homeready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2363
01:44:08.121 --> 01:44:12.290

<v Speaker 2>I'm a pretty friendly guy,</v>

2364
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:14.000
<v Speaker 2>so most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of that stuff.</v>

2365
01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:18.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't get the guys that I get are</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that want to be like professional</v>

2366
01:44:18.111 --> 01:44:21.020
<v Speaker 2>fighters and then want to just talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it a little bit and they're always</v>

2367
01:44:21.021 --> 01:44:24.980
<v Speaker 2>very friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be amazed like people that aspire</v>

2368
01:44:24.981 --> 01:44:28.640
<v Speaker 2>to be professional fighters are some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nicest fucking human beings you're</v>

2369
01:44:28.641 --> 01:44:32.840
<v Speaker 2>ever gonna run across because they've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've figured out their own ego</v>

2370
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:36.020
<v Speaker 2>through competition to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not really.</v>

2371
01:44:36.170 --> 01:44:37.910
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not worried about like putting</v>

2372
01:44:37.911 --> 01:44:39.110
<v Speaker 2>out an image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know who they are.</v>

2373
01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were like real friendly,</v>

2374
01:44:40.850 --> 01:44:44.420
<v Speaker 2>like some of the nicest people that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever met ever a professional fighters.</v>

2375
01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:48.680
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing for people to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that for men there's</v>

2376
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:54.070
<v Speaker 2>something about trial through combat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just just be just being understanding</v>

2377
01:44:54.471 --> 01:44:56.180
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's like to overcome,</v>

2378
01:44:56.181 --> 01:45:00.410
<v Speaker 2>like an insurmountable obstacles for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>average person just makes them calmer.</v>

2379
01:45:00.650 --> 01:45:03.290
<v Speaker 2>There's a different kind of human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more chill</v>

2380
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:08.390
<v Speaker 3>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My or not my hairdresser for 15 years</v>

2399
01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:00.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be way better with a real razor.</v>

2400
01:46:00.030 --> 01:46:02.910
<v Speaker 3>So main would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's a,</v>

2401
01:46:02.911 --> 01:46:05.550
<v Speaker 3>that's a big deal for people can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>cutting off their hair.</v>

2402
01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:07.320
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always wanted to shave my head at</v>

2403
01:46:07.321 --> 01:46:10.380
<v Speaker 3>least once in life and I never just get</v>
<v Speaker 3>a crew cut.</v>

2404
01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:12.040
<v Speaker 3>You're a beautiful man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

2405

<v Speaker 3>Shaved head,</v>

2406
01:46:13.531 --> 01:46:15.260
<v Speaker 3>you've got a nice thick head of hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2407
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:16.051
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2408
01:46:16.051 --> 01:46:17.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now know contracts with crap.</v>

2409
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:18.880

<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

2410
01:46:18.890 --> 01:46:19.370
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Continuity really?</v>

2412
01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Which I kind of called continuity</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's like,</v>

2413
01:46:24.930 --> 01:46:27.990
<v Speaker 3>do these people really believe I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>did this in an hour or was it over the</v>

2414
01:46:27.991 --> 01:46:29.090
<v Speaker 3>course of a few days?</v>

2415
01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:32.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I'll just tell him.</v>

2416
01:46:32.131 --> 01:46:34.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do y'all think as,</v>

2417
01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:37.440
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as producers and networks and whatever,</v>

2418
01:46:37.690 --> 01:46:40.080
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how bad the I think the american public</v>

2419
01:46:40.081 --> 01:46:40.920
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2420
01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:45.060
<v Speaker 3>how unintelligent that You have to do a</v>
<v Speaker 3>scene where I just walked in your door</v>

2421
01:46:45.061 --> 01:46:48.630
<v Speaker 3>and sat down here and put on my</v>
<v Speaker 3>headphones and then they flipped me over</v>

2422
01:46:48.631 --> 01:46:49.950
<v Speaker 3>somewhere going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you asshole.</v>

2423
01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:51.840
<v Speaker 3>I walked in the door and put on my</v>
<v Speaker 3>headphones.</v>

2424
01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:55.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so insane and it's like,</v>

2425
01:46:55.710 --> 01:46:57.900
<v Speaker 3>it's like the recipe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have to tell them</v>

2426
01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:01.350
<v Speaker 3>everything you do and then I set up for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shot and I have to walk out the</v>

2427
01:47:01.351 --> 01:47:02.184
<v Speaker 3>door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

2428
01:47:02.250 --> 01:47:03.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the audience won't know where you came</v>

2429
01:47:03.421 --> 01:47:05.130
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's my fucking shop.</v>

2430
01:47:05.131 --> 01:47:07.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean</v>

2431
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:11.010
<v Speaker 3>they won't have any idea?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be so confused.</v>

2432
01:47:11.190 --> 01:47:14.640
<v Speaker 3>It's insane and I've tried so hard to</v>
<v Speaker 3>change the recipe a little bit.</v>

2433
01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:17.280
<v Speaker 3>I understand you have to do certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

2434
01:47:17.281 --> 01:47:19.680
<v Speaker 3>but why do you have to tell the audience</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they just saw?</v>

2435
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:22.890
<v Speaker 3>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're noT stupid.</v>

2436
01:47:23.090 --> 01:47:24.810
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you make them stupid,</v>

2437
01:47:24.811 --> 01:47:27.690
<v Speaker 3>you can make them stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd never challenge him ever.</v>

2438
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:30.450
<v Speaker 3>I think that as a society we might be on</v>
<v Speaker 3>our way to that.</v>

2439
01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:31.500
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that show?</v>

2440
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:35.610
<v Speaker 3>Idiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I argued all the time.</v>

2441
01:47:35.611 --> 01:47:37.530
<v Speaker 3>I love my show and I love what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>

2442
01:47:37.610 --> 01:47:40.880
<v Speaker 3>why do I got to come out of the door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put my headphones on and then go.</v>

2443
01:47:41.130 --> 01:47:43.020
<v Speaker 3>So I got there and I put my headphones</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2444
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:45.810
<v Speaker 3>It was unbelievable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially after I came through the</v>

2445
01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:50.130
<v Speaker 3>door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fucking stupid,</v>

2446
01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:53.130
<v Speaker 3>but they've always done it that way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think of it at the same way.</v>

2447
01:47:53.131 --> 01:47:55.470
<v Speaker 3>I think about cbs and their medical</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana ads.</v>

2448
01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:58.470
<v Speaker 3>There's like a bunch of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>just trying to protect jobs.</v>

2449
01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:00.240
<v Speaker 3>They're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to make it easier,</v>

2450
01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:03.660
<v Speaker 3>easier for people to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have anything left to chance.</v>

2451
01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:06.330
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kinda filled her numbers where they</v>

2452
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:09.390
<v Speaker 3>had such a bad thing that they can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>show that commercial,</v>

2453
01:48:09.391 --> 01:48:13.410
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time we're selling boxes</v>
<v Speaker 3>that say this will kill you.</v>

2454
01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2455
01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:18.870
<v Speaker 3>And people are buying them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think they still break up</v>

2456
01:48:18.871 --> 01:48:21.990
<v Speaker 3>shows with commercials?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't it be more effective if they</v>

2457
01:48:21.991 --> 01:48:24.390
<v Speaker 3>didn't do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a monetization problem,</v>

2458
01:48:24.391 --> 01:48:27.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think you could get a little more</v>

2459
01:48:27.241 --> 01:48:29.950
<v Speaker 3>bang for your buck by having this</v>
<v Speaker 3>episode bias.</v>

2460
01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:33.690
<v Speaker 3>So instead of a 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>

2461
01:48:33.691 --> 01:48:37.380
<v Speaker 3>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of having like two or three ads</v>

2462
01:48:37.381 --> 01:48:40.170
<v Speaker 3>every five minutes or whatever they make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it do.</v>

2463
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:42.600
<v Speaker 3>How about you just have a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>product placements?</v>

2464
01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:44.790
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Show and have them cost more.</v>

2465
01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:48.270
<v Speaker 3>Exactly what you put in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you got to put it into the recipe.</v>

2466
01:48:48.271 --> 01:48:51.900
<v Speaker 3>So some guy like us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's car guys that are watching the show</v>

2467
01:48:51.901 --> 01:48:53.160
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit.</v>

2468
01:48:53.161 --> 01:48:56.070
<v Speaker 3>He just bought that porsche and then it</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes commercial and it's like I'm</v>

2469
01:48:56.071 --> 01:48:59.490
<v Speaker 3>getting a beer and I'm going to sit back</v>
<v Speaker 3>down on the couch and in the next five</v>

2470
01:48:59.491 --> 01:49:02.940
<v Speaker 3>minutes has been going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went to la and I bought a porsche.</v>

2471
01:49:04.130 --> 01:49:07.110
<v Speaker 3>You already wasted that guy's tie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2472
01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:10.110
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only reason we have to do It,</v>

2473
01:49:10.111 --> 01:49:13.830
<v Speaker 3>because you imagine that people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming in from these breaks,</v>

2474
01:49:14.190 --> 01:49:17.010
<v Speaker 3>it just jumping in the middle of it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>might,</v>

2475
01:49:17.070 --> 01:49:19.920
<v Speaker 3>they might be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about make them figure it out,</v>

2476
01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:21.900
<v Speaker 3>figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>

2477
01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:23.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>figuring out what they need to get rid</v>

2478
01:49:23.881 --> 01:49:26.310
<v Speaker 3>of the nielsen whole bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2479
01:49:26.370 --> 01:49:28.440
<v Speaker 3>does that real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still counting cable boxes.</v>

2480
01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:31.090
<v Speaker 3>Are they even counting cable boxes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not doing anything?</v>

2481
01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:32.490
<v Speaker 3>You have a nielsen box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2482
01:49:32.491 --> 01:49:35.640
<v Speaker 3>So it's not even like cable box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only like a few thousand or</v>

2483
01:49:35.641 --> 01:49:37.770
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they decide what the rating is</v>

2484
01:49:37.771 --> 01:49:38.660
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you kidding me?</v>

2485
01:49:38.661 --> 01:49:40.050
<v Speaker 3>Because I'll see you in my ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2486
01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:43.400
<v Speaker 3>I know it was more than that on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy company,</v>

2487
01:49:43.401 --> 01:49:44.610
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2488
01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:46.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I own a social media company.</v>

2489
01:49:46.321 --> 01:49:47.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2490
01:49:47.171 --> 01:49:48.050
<v Speaker 3>we had way more than</v>

2491
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:50.920
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how they do really know and</v>

2492
01:49:50.921 --> 01:49:53.860
<v Speaker 2>whether they just accept the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they don't know the real</v>

2493
01:49:53.861 --> 01:49:56.710
<v Speaker 2>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least they have a reliable percentage</v>

2494
01:49:56.711 --> 01:50:00.010
<v Speaker 2>that everyone can agree on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem that everyone agrees on it,</v>

2495
01:50:00.011 --> 01:50:01.840
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll set their advertising rates</v>

2496
01:50:01.841 --> 01:50:06.841
<v Speaker 2>based on that agreement more or less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the real ideology of it is we have</v>

2497
01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:12.790
<v Speaker 2>the access because all these devices and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else to have the real number,</v>

2498
01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:13.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the real,</v>

2499
01:50:13.871 --> 01:50:16.090
<v Speaker 2>real number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But everyone will have to give it up,</v>

2500
01:50:16.091 --> 01:50:18.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like verizon would have to give it up</v>

2501
01:50:18.850 --> 01:50:20.980
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm going to give it to each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other and they want to say,</v>

2502
01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:23.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they just need to remap the</v>

2503
01:50:23.681 --> 01:50:27.610
<v Speaker 2>program and so they can really see how</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people there are.</v>

2504
01:50:27.611 --> 01:50:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Because right now in the industry and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think the viewers are way down</v>

2505
01:50:31.871 --> 01:50:33.790
<v Speaker 2>and I actually tend to disagree.</v>

2506
01:50:34.090 --> 01:50:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I think they're up just the way that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>count them or bad debt.</v>

2507
01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:43.020
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not good because I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>never been counted fucking filled out a</v>

2508
01:50:43.991 --> 01:50:46.720
<v Speaker 2>nielsen thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never used the nielsen box.</v>

2509
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anybody who has I need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2510
01:50:48.791 --> 01:50:49.580
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2511
01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:50.930
<v Speaker 2>I met with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met one boy.</v>

2512
01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:53.530
<v Speaker 2>You'd once said that his brother was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2513
01:50:53.650 --> 01:50:55.630
<v Speaker 2>can you find a picture of the nielsen</v>
<v Speaker 2>box?</v>

2514
01:50:56.130 --> 01:51:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Just like you know that directv has some</v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers,</v>

2515
01:51:00.011 --> 01:51:02.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They must have some digitaL.</v>

2516
01:51:02.081 --> 01:51:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got numbers down to the way.</v>

2517
01:51:04.081 --> 01:51:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't they know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if they're not using it as some</v>

2518
01:51:06.551 --> 01:51:10.090
<v Speaker 2>sort of a rating system that affects the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ratings of a television show,</v>

2519
01:51:10.091 --> 01:51:13.690
<v Speaker 2>you would think that they would want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know how effective their product is.</v>

2520
01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:17.200
<v Speaker 2>If you can measure that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't you measure that and</v>

2521
01:51:17.201 --> 01:51:19.780
<v Speaker 2>they've just never changed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really do need to though.</v>

2522
01:51:20.050 --> 01:51:22.600
<v Speaker 2>It'd be way cool if they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be weird.</v>

2523
01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Be weird if you find out what everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>was watching.</v>

2524
01:51:25.090 --> 01:51:26.620
<v Speaker 2>What if like keeping up with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kardashians,</v>

2525
01:51:26.621 --> 01:51:28.380
<v Speaker 2>like a billion people in episode.</v>

2526
01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:35.740
<v Speaker 2>most of the world is going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

2527
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2528
01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Actually the world is still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks at and goes,</v>

2529
01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:40.690
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2530
01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:43.450
<v Speaker 2>But what if most of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you know what?</v>

2531
01:51:43.570 --> 01:51:48.570
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is like the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>disparity has gotta be it's gotta be</v>

2532
01:51:50.411 --> 01:51:51.730
<v Speaker 2>satellite and cable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2533
01:51:51.731 --> 01:51:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not aLlowed to measure those.</v>

2534
01:51:53.890 --> 01:51:57.970
<v Speaker 2>The mobile phone thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like mobile phones or they say netflix</v>

2535
01:51:58.120 --> 01:51:59.650
<v Speaker 2>specials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like comedy specials.</v>

2536
01:51:59.790 --> 01:52:01.870
<v Speaker 2>they said 40 something percent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2537
01:52:01.871 --> 01:52:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Plus watch them on their phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2538
01:52:04.450 --> 01:52:07.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've started to watch everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my ipad and my phone.</v>

2539
01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:12.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't really watch tv anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched the ufc on my phone on espn</v>

2540
01:52:13.301 --> 01:52:15.400
<v Speaker 2>plus I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2541
01:52:15.401 --> 01:52:17.740
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching live fights on my phone</v>

2542
01:52:17.741 --> 01:52:19.170
<v Speaker 2>with a regular connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

2543
01:52:19.210 --> 01:52:22.000
<v Speaker 2>not wifi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a weird time.</v>

2544
01:52:22.140 --> 01:52:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2545
01:52:22.630 --> 01:52:26.470
<v Speaker 2>I remember when we were younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we spent thousands of dollars for the</v>

2546
01:52:26.471 --> 01:52:30.550
<v Speaker 2>giant tv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the box it had the projectors.</v>

2547
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about the phone is this kind</v>

2548
01:52:33.201 --> 01:52:35.830
<v Speaker 2>of selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like personal,</v>

2549
01:52:35.890 --> 01:52:38.020
<v Speaker 2>like if you're watching a movie on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>

2550
01:52:38.021 --> 01:52:39.690
<v Speaker 2>it's just you watching that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2551
01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:41.770
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't like sit next to your wife and</v>

2552
01:52:41.771 --> 01:52:44.620
<v Speaker 2>watch a movie on your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's going to deal with that.</v>

2553
01:52:44.621 --> 01:52:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're on a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would suck.</v>

2554
01:52:46.730 --> 01:52:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but watching a fight on the phone is</v>

2555
01:52:50.181 --> 01:52:52.340
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way less interesting than watching</v>

2556
01:52:52.341 --> 01:52:54.260
<v Speaker 2>it on the big screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can take it everywhere,</v>

2557
01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:59.290
<v Speaker 2>so eventually they're going to get that</v>
<v Speaker 2>into some large thing like a hologram or</v>

2558
01:52:59.511 --> 01:53:00.470
<v Speaker 2>some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I.</v>

2559
01:53:00.471 --> 01:53:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Or ar augmented reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be too much longer</v>

2560
01:53:04.701 --> 01:53:08.600
<v Speaker 2>before they're doing all the ai and</v>
<v Speaker 2>augmented reality I think is really</v>

2561
01:53:08.601 --> 01:53:08.860
<v Speaker 2>what's.</v>

2562
01:53:08.860 --> 01:53:10.700
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

2563
01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:14.200
<v Speaker 2>netflix doing something with that right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now with that one show they have out or</v>

2564
01:53:14.210 --> 01:53:17.090
<v Speaker 2>you can pick the different endings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2565
01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:17.973
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

2566
01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:21.160
<v Speaker 2>black mirror show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2567
01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go back to that article again.</v>

2568
01:53:24.441 --> 01:53:26.290
<v Speaker 2>What was the kind of new articles saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2569
01:53:26.291 --> 01:53:28.240
<v Speaker 2>An example of one I was going to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2570
01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:30.710
<v Speaker 2>So the tvs are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been known to.</v>

2571
01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:33.620
<v Speaker 2>They would screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They watch what's on your screen and</v>

2572
01:53:33.621 --> 01:53:38.270
<v Speaker 2>send that data back to a database based</v>
<v Speaker 2>off of like everything that's currently</v>

2573
01:53:38.271 --> 01:53:40.220
<v Speaker 2>live on tv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing happens with audio</v>

2574
01:53:40.221 --> 01:53:43.970
<v Speaker 2>streams and shizam or like there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of different companies that do</v>

2575
01:53:43.971 --> 01:53:45.710
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they sell your data?</v>

2576
01:53:46.210 --> 01:53:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then so that they'll sell that back to</v>

2577
01:53:48.291 --> 01:53:51.290
<v Speaker 2>advertisers sort of like the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's happening with some of these</v>

2578
01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:52.393
<v Speaker 2>apps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how that.</v>

2579
01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:56.330
<v Speaker 2>That's how people found out that</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies are tracking you because</v>

2580
01:53:56.331 --> 01:53:59.210
<v Speaker 2>there's third party companies that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>selling that data once they have it</v>

2581
01:53:59.211 --> 01:54:01.070
<v Speaker 2>because they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't need it for everything.</v>

2582
01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:04.730
<v Speaker 2>See the person with the problem with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of shit with people is that</v>

2583
01:54:04.970 --> 01:54:08.360
<v Speaker 2>that's not what the agreement was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The agreement wasn't that you tell</v>

2584
01:54:08.361 --> 01:54:11.030
<v Speaker 2>people that I'm watching the agreement</v>
<v Speaker 2>was I buy a tv from you.</v>

2585
01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:13.580
<v Speaker 2>That was the agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when You say,</v>

2586
01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:15.980
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to sell the data from the</v>

2587
01:54:15.981 --> 01:54:17.840
<v Speaker 2>people that are watching your tv,</v>

<v Speaker 2>buried in your cable deal.</v>

2594
01:54:29.811 --> 01:54:32.910
<v Speaker 2>but you're agreeing to becoming seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>that episode because could becoming a</v>

2595
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:34.280
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

<v Speaker 2>how's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

2597
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Like just just agreeing to the terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>service,</v>

2598
01:54:36.891 --> 01:54:39.440
<v Speaker 2>like you don't know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like the joke on that was that your</v>

2599
01:54:39.441 --> 01:54:41.480
<v Speaker 2>agreement to become a human centipede.</v>

2600
01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I never saw a human centipede either</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a couple bars I've seen.</v>

2601
01:54:52.410 --> 01:54:53.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2602
01:54:53.890 --> 01:54:57.470
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get us in weird ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just trying to find out</v>

2603
01:54:57.471 --> 01:54:58.820
<v Speaker 2>who's watching what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is like,</v>

2604
01:54:58.821 --> 01:55:03.140
<v Speaker 2>should your tv be able to just watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be able To have a line on</v>

2605
01:55:03.141 --> 01:55:06.170
<v Speaker 2>what you're watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I know people now that just use</v>

2606
01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:09.420
<v Speaker 2>netflix and they don't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have an internet connection</v>

2607
01:55:09.430 --> 01:55:12.410
<v Speaker 2>is hooked up to their television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Television connects to netflix</v>

2608
01:55:12.411 --> 01:55:14.330
<v Speaker 2>automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of the native apps.</v>

2609
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're connected to the internet,</v>

2610
01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:17.930
<v Speaker 2>you're getting watched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2611
01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:19.460
<v Speaker 2>is what most people would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2612
01:55:19.530 --> 01:55:22.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm so paranoid about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a little piece of duct tape over</v>

2613
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:24.320
<v Speaker 2>my camera on my ipad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good move.</v>

2614
01:55:24.450 --> 01:55:25.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good move.</v>

2615
01:55:25.611 --> 01:55:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't need that on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is it's like.</v>

2616
01:55:29.150 --> 01:55:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why are you selling data?</v>

2617
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Wants to buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2618
01:55:35.841 --> 01:55:38.450
<v Speaker 2>but why are you allowed to just collect</v>
<v Speaker 2>data from people?</v>

2619
01:55:39.170 --> 01:55:40.840
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty much in the contract you</v>
<v Speaker 2>sign.</v>

2620
01:55:40.841 --> 01:55:43.470
<v Speaker 2>I get shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally there should be two prices.</v>

2621
01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:47.190
<v Speaker 2>This should be one where you're allowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to collect data.</v>

2622
01:55:47.250 --> 01:55:52.250
<v Speaker 2>You can collect data for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it costs like 50 bucks more a year.</v>

2623
01:55:53.370 --> 01:55:56.520
<v Speaker 2>And the other one where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2624
01:55:56.521 --> 01:55:59.170
<v Speaker 2>you can't collect my data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to pay a little bit more money.</v>

2625
01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:01.140
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of happening.</v>

2626
01:56:01.141 --> 01:56:03.480
<v Speaker 2>There are apps you can use that'll track</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>

2627
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:06.540
<v Speaker 2>how much are walking in exchange for</v>
<v Speaker 2>letting them,</v>

2628
01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:09.930
<v Speaker 2>letting you turn on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll give you stuff out,</v>

2629
01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:11.640
<v Speaker 2>like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's useful to you.</v>

2630
01:56:11.641 --> 01:56:11.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2631
01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:14.200
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you walked by mcdonald's,</v>

2632
01:56:14.210 --> 01:56:15.920
<v Speaker 1>they can serve you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mcdonald's ad</v>

<v Speaker 2>for sure for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2634
01:56:17.890 --> 01:56:20.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the ultimate goal,</v>

2635
01:56:20.001 --> 01:56:21.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is to figure out where you are and</v>

2636
01:56:21.741 --> 01:56:23.600
<v Speaker 2>target you with something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2637
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my friend animal green tree was on</v>

2638
01:56:26.511 --> 01:56:29.660
<v Speaker 2>here and we were talking about he lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Australia and he lives.</v>

2639
01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:31.880
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he travels like deep into the outback</v>

2640
01:56:31.881 --> 01:56:34.550
<v Speaker 2>where it takes us three days to drive in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

2641
01:56:34.551 --> 01:56:37.340
<v Speaker 2>everybody has toyota trucks because</v>
<v Speaker 2>those fucking things never break.</v>

2642
01:56:37.341 --> 01:56:38.330
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

2643
01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:41.900
<v Speaker 2>And so he gets ads all of a sudden out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of nowhere on his phone.</v>

2644
01:56:41.901 --> 01:56:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Every time he goes to a website that</v>
<v Speaker 2>says toyota trucks,</v>

2645
01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:45.920
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

2646
01:56:45.921 --> 01:56:47.000
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't google it.</v>

2647

01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:51.860

01:56:51.861 --> 01:56:55.190
<v Speaker 2>search.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that came from something</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2673
01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:09.400
<v Speaker 1>such a hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot topic.</v>

2674
01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:11.440
<v Speaker 1>But that's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2675
01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:14.500
<v Speaker 1>few open yourself up to comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well somebody brought one up the other</v>

2676
01:58:14.501 --> 01:58:17.560
<v Speaker 1>day that was a general discussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>question and it said,</v>

2677
01:58:17.950 --> 01:58:19.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we just do dna?</v>

2678
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Let's say your board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we take your fingerprints,</v>

2679
01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:23.920
<v Speaker 1>we take everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we check you all out.</v>

2680
01:58:24.010 --> 01:58:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we just do the dna and I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the privacy part of it for later on,</v>

2681
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:32.590
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time you're solving a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of problems with the very beginning.</v>

2682
01:58:32.591 --> 01:58:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person just came out of here and</v>

2683
01:58:35.591 --> 01:58:36.990
<v Speaker 1>they've done nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2684
01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:40.900
<v Speaker 1>So now if they ever do anything we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go shoot him in the back of the,</v>

2685
01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:42.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we certainly</v>

2686
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:46.240
<v Speaker 2>could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we would have to place a gigantic</v>

2687
01:58:46.241 --> 01:58:51.190
<v Speaker 2>priority on getting the very best people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in law enforcement.</v>

2688
01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:54.340
<v Speaker 2>You would have to eliminate all</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitheads.</v>

2689
01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:58.630
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to pay those cops way more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and treat them with the respect that</v>

2690
01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:02.920
<v Speaker 2>they deserve as people that literally</v>
<v Speaker 2>are protecting you from violent</v>

2691
01:59:02.921 --> 01:59:05.680
<v Speaker 2>criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was what I know mean I'm a huge</v>

2692
01:59:05.681 --> 01:59:06.890
<v Speaker 2>supporter of cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've.</v>

2693
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:10.420
<v Speaker 2>I've been around cops most of my life</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of martial arts.</v>

2694
01:59:10.630 --> 01:59:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a weird issue with people</v>

2695
01:59:14.411 --> 01:59:18.940
<v Speaker 2>where they fuck the police.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know if you're saying fuck the police,</v>

2696
01:59:18.941 --> 01:59:20.590
<v Speaker 2>you might as well say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck the humans.</v>

2697
01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:23.770
<v Speaker 2>If someone does something bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone does something bad to</v>

2698
01:59:23.771 --> 01:59:24.970
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't say,</v>

2699
01:59:24.971 --> 01:59:27.690
<v Speaker 2>fuck all humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone murdered someone,</v>

2700
01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:29.290
<v Speaker 2>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that guy,</v>

2701
01:59:29.530 --> 01:59:32.890
<v Speaker 2>and then you start breaking it down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever group you're not a part of,</v>

2702
01:59:32.891 --> 01:59:37.891
<v Speaker 2>so it's fuck that x generation guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that lebanese guy or whatever</v>

2703
01:59:38.411 --> 01:59:41.500
<v Speaker 2>nationality he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that straight guy.</v>

2704
01:59:41.710 --> 01:59:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Or if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2705
01:59:42.370 --> 01:59:44.920
<v Speaker 2>if he's gay and he killed somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that gay guy.</v>

2706
01:59:45.130 --> 01:59:49.720
<v Speaker 2>But it's just humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all individuals no matter what it</v>

2707
01:59:49.721 --> 01:59:51.940
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what we're talking about.</v>

2708
01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:55.120
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as you start breaking down</v>
<v Speaker 2>into groups like,</v>

2709
01:59:55.150 --> 01:59:56.980
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck these people,</v>

2710
01:59:57.910 --> 02:00:01.600
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then just because what's that?</v>

2711
02:00:01.630 --> 02:00:03.490
<v Speaker 2>Then it just becomes a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's touching.</v>

2712
02:00:03.610 --> 02:00:05.110
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

2713
02:00:05.230 --> 02:00:08.950
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all fucking in this thing</v>

2714
02:00:08.951 --> 02:00:10.120
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

2715
02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:13.320
<v Speaker 5>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're drunk,</v>

2716
02:00:13.321 --> 02:00:16.210
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably too drunk or not drunk yet.</v>

2717
02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:21.150
<v Speaker 3>You'll have one here that we had all I</v>
<v Speaker 3>needed,</v>

2718
02:00:21.170 --> 02:00:22.710
<v Speaker 3>so I'm probably going to be in trouble</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>

2719
02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:24.780
<v Speaker 3>Did they give you a hard time about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

2720
02:00:24.810 --> 02:00:29.810
<v Speaker 3>Who knows if it's legal in California</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I'm at.</v>

2721
02:00:30.570 --> 02:00:32.340
<v Speaker 3>So it's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2722
02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:36.630
<v Speaker 3>You know how many people used to go down</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Mexico to watch or whatever or do</v>

2723
02:00:36.631 --> 02:00:39.720
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm amazed that people are still</v>

2724
02:00:39.721 --> 02:00:43.320
<v Speaker 3>bringing in weed from Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shows me have a real lack of</v>

2725
02:00:43.321 --> 02:00:45.330
<v Speaker 3>american engine nudity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's outrageous.</v>

2726
02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:46.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the canadians are the ones that are</v>

<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2729
02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:01.840

2731
02:01:06.531 --> 02:01:08.990
<v Speaker 3>They said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

2732
02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:13.640
<v Speaker 3>If people did that that quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got some rocks off automatically</v>

2733
02:01:13.641 --> 02:01:18.641
<v Speaker 3>directed to cut screener.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope discovery channel doesn't get hit</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2739
02:01:31.610 --> 02:01:34.190
<v Speaker 3>It might be more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2740
02:01:34.250 --> 02:01:37.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have some channels that I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>never even heard of like you know the</v>

2741
02:01:37.161 --> 02:01:41.450
<v Speaker 3>brick wall channel or I have idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just insane stuff.</v>

2742
02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:43.490
<v Speaker 3>They divided all down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there needs to be a little</v>

2743
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:46.250
<v Speaker 3>consolidation in the market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2746
02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:53.780
<v Speaker 3>Like top gear is probably like one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest car shows of all time.</v>

2747
02:01:54.110 --> 02:01:56.780

2769
02:02:39.681 --> 02:02:43.070
<v Speaker 3>it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had to reserve myself quite a few times.</v>

2770
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:45.530
<v Speaker 3>People get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

02:02:45.590 --> 02:02:47.360
<v Speaker 3>you're putting a show together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

2772
02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:50.020
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2773
02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:51.320
<v Speaker 3>those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the producers,</v>

2774
02:02:51.321 --> 02:02:52.670
<v Speaker 3>the camera guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sound guys,</v>

2775
02:02:52.671 --> 02:02:56.210
<v Speaker 3>the people that are sitting in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>discovery offices and they have jobs.</v>

2776
02:02:56.690 --> 02:02:59.180
<v Speaker 3>This is my life I'm putting on every</v>
<v Speaker 3>single day,</v>

2777
02:02:59.390 --> 02:03:02.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so not only do I have my whole life</v>

2778
02:03:02.001 --> 02:03:05.600
<v Speaker 3>on it and in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I had to deal with filming it</v>

2779
02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:09.260
<v Speaker 3>and I've tried to explain it to them</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't care to a point if</v>

2780
02:03:09.261 --> 02:03:12.380
<v Speaker 3>the show does well or bad because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'll be another richard on the road.</v>

2781
02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:16.010
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of high volume approach</v>

2782
02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:19.280
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to those kind of like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cable shows,</v>

2783
02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:22.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just try to bang out as many as</v>

2784
02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:23.870
<v Speaker 3>they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>High voLume,</v>

2785
02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:26.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have a formula that they try to</v>

2786
02:03:26.451 --> 02:03:31.400
<v Speaker 3>file when they have a lot of like set up</v>
<v Speaker 3>scenarios where people get in trouble</v>

2787
02:03:31.401 --> 02:03:33.050
<v Speaker 3>for things where they're not really</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting in trouble.</v>

2788
02:03:33.050 --> 02:03:35.290
<v Speaker 3>So it's all set up in advance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2789
02:03:35.950 --> 02:03:37.190
<v Speaker 3>it's almost scripted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2790
02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:39.290
<v Speaker 3>A lot of reality shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them can be.</v>

<v Speaker 3>or is it fit?</v>

2793

<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>should cut back on drinking.</v>

2796
02:03:55.260 --> 02:04:00.260
<v Speaker 3>I tell myself that every morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's so wild because I've known as</v>

02:06:08.551 --> 02:06:10.740
<v Speaker 2>You need to draw the aura.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show me what to watch.</v>

2855
02:06:10.930 --> 02:06:12.450
<v Speaker 2>You get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to have some science behind</v>

2856
02:06:12.451 --> 02:06:14.820
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole ideology of fuck off is my</v>

2857
02:06:14.821 --> 02:06:17.790
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the gas mcgee ring underneath says,</v>

2858
02:06:17.791 --> 02:06:20.970
<v Speaker 2>fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm shaking your hand and</v>

2859
02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:28.860
<v Speaker 2>you should always be able to say fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>off if you can't say fuck off,</v>

2860
02:06:28.890 --> 02:06:30.780
<v Speaker 2>but you have to be judicious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2861
02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:33.870
<v Speaker 2>You have to say fuck off when fuck off</v>
<v Speaker 2>is appropriate,</v>

2862
02:06:33.871 --> 02:06:37.470
<v Speaker 2>but you have to also salute people when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not full of shit.</v>

2863
02:06:37.530 --> 02:06:38.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2864
02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:40.770
<v Speaker 2>You say you're definitely not the person</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling to fuck off.</v>

2865
02:06:40.771 --> 02:06:42.000
<v Speaker 2>You're a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a good dude.</v>

2866
02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:43.590
<v Speaker 2>You're all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2867
02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:46.380
<v Speaker 2>You got to have positive and negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like someone is telling you they're</v>

2868
02:06:46.381 --> 02:06:47.770
<v Speaker 2>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all your auras.</v>

2869
02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be able to.</v>

2870
02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck you're</v>

2871
02:06:52.351 --> 02:06:53.940
<v Speaker 2>seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I barely know what I'm saying.</v>

2872
02:06:53.970 --> 02:06:57.360
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea of what I'm seeing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really even remotely similar to what</v>

2873
02:06:57.361 --> 02:06:59.130
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just assuming.</v>

2874
02:06:59.730 --> 02:07:01.400
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a guess like,</v>

2875
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:03.900
<v Speaker 2>like some people like weird fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars,</v>

2876
02:07:03.901 --> 02:07:07.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some people are really into certain</v>

2877
02:07:07.381 --> 02:07:08.071
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go,</v>

2878
02:07:08.071 --> 02:07:09.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2879
02:07:09.330 --> 02:07:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Like a pinto hatchback or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people are really into.</v>

2880
02:07:12.090 --> 02:07:16.230
<v Speaker 2>Those are popular with some groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people are really into like gross</v>

2881
02:07:16.231 --> 02:07:18.050
<v Speaker 2>look and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2882
02:07:18.070 --> 02:07:20.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're seeing something different</v>

2883
02:07:20.521 --> 02:07:21.400
<v Speaker 2>than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2884
02:07:21.420 --> 02:07:23.740
<v Speaker 2>it's probably a combination of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood,</v>

2885
02:07:23.741 --> 02:07:25.020
<v Speaker 2>their upbringing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what have you,</v>

2886
02:07:25.710 --> 02:07:30.180
<v Speaker 2>but isn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible that like personal taste</v>

2887
02:07:30.210 --> 02:07:35.210
<v Speaker 2>is a lot like sprinting speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like not everybody is going to be Carl</v>

2888
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:37.150
<v Speaker 2>Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2889
02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Not everybody is going to be some who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>another fast guy who's st bull.</v>

2890
02:07:42.850 --> 02:07:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Hussein bolt is the fastest ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be.</v>

2891
02:07:45.431 --> 02:07:46.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the fastest.</v>

2892
02:07:46.571 --> 02:07:48.280
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everybody could do that.</v>

2893
02:07:48.580 --> 02:07:52.600
<v Speaker 2>So isn't it possible that that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>also apply to taste?</v>

2894
02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:56.110
<v Speaker 2>That there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people out there that really get</v>

2895
02:07:56.111 --> 02:08:00.430
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with your fucking shitty</v>
<v Speaker 2>taste and there's other people out there</v>

2896
02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:02.410
<v Speaker 2>that likes fox body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mustang.</v>

2897
02:08:04.170 --> 02:08:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Fox body I think is the best looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>carval's it's the best ever.</v>

2898
02:08:07.541 --> 02:08:10.480
<v Speaker 2>I just left barrett jackson and when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see something real across the stage and</v>

2899
02:08:10.481 --> 02:08:14.500
<v Speaker 2>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why in the hell is somebody that I don't</v>

2900
02:08:14.501 --> 02:08:16.960
<v Speaker 2>get it and they're over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're clapping and they're all happy</v>

2901
02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:18.850
<v Speaker 2>ordering drinks for their friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2902
02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:23.710
<v Speaker 2>I just bought an 81,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thunderbird turbo mustang.</v>

2903
02:08:23.711 --> 02:08:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Five point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2904
02:08:24.641 --> 02:08:26.740
<v Speaker 2>like vanilla ice had in this video.</v>

2905

<v Speaker 2>Mad my buddy sold when it barrett last</v>

2906

<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>High scar.</v>

2907
02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:39.400
<v Speaker 2>It's not the worst car in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you had to compare,</v>

2908
02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:42.850
<v Speaker 2>what is that like 87,</v>
<v Speaker 2>88.</v>

2909
02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:44.750
<v Speaker 2>Like what was that car?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What year was that?</v>

2910
02:08:45.610 --> 02:08:47.630
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 89.</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 nine</v>

2911
02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:52.120
<v Speaker 2>mustang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five point maybe it was 87.</v>

2912
02:08:52.180 --> 02:08:54.430
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had to drop top down so his locks can</v>

2913
02:08:54.431 --> 02:08:55.264
<v Speaker 2>flow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't he?</v>

2914
02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2915
02:08:57.941 --> 02:09:00.700
<v Speaker 2>he grew up just up the street from where</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up.</v>

2916
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:03.070
<v Speaker 2>I met him at a ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

2917
02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:05.710
<v Speaker 2>I believe he was very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

2918
02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My uh,</v>

2919
02:09:07.420 --> 02:09:09.520
<v Speaker 2>my friend kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jason had one of those but he didn't</v>

2920
02:09:09.521 --> 02:09:14.170
<v Speaker 2>have a convertible rolling in dough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were like fucking 20 years old.</v>

2921
02:09:15.100 --> 02:09:19.750
<v Speaker 2>That car back in the day was the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had one of those cars,</v>

2922
02:09:19.751 --> 02:09:21.130
<v Speaker 2>you are a fucking hero.</v>

2923
02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:22.190
<v Speaker 2>It was fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2924
02:09:22.510 --> 02:09:26.830
<v Speaker 2>it was also like it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car to have 230 horsepower and it</v>

2925
02:09:26.831 --> 02:09:28.090
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2926
02:09:28.650 --> 02:09:30.400
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might not have had any more,</v>

2927
02:09:30.430 --> 02:09:33.070
<v Speaker 2>but it was good because we were all</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid and we didn't know how to drive</v>

2928
02:09:33.071 --> 02:09:36.460
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those cars were that at that time</v>

2929
02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:38.970
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>

2930
02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:42.370
<v Speaker 2>whatever was wrong with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a good looking car.</v>

2931
02:09:42.580 --> 02:09:46.090
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at that car could pick</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a 69 mach one,</v>

2932
02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:49.780
<v Speaker 2>like get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you do this?</v>

2933
02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Go to a 69.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mach one black 1969.</v>

2934
02:09:54.821 --> 02:09:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Mach one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely best car ever.</v>

2935
02:09:56.770 --> 02:09:59.290
<v Speaker 2>It's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2936
02:09:59.291 --> 02:10:01.150
<v Speaker 2>there's some arguments out there of one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

2937
02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:06.180
<v Speaker 2>but it's in fucking race for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in the top three to five black,</v>

2938
02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:10.720
<v Speaker 2>69.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mach one mach piece of shit.</v>

2939
02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:12.760

<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

2940
02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:15.400
<v Speaker 2>That is rest of my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this shape is an order.</v>

2941
02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:16.333
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

2942
02:10:19.050 --> 02:10:20.740

<v Speaker 2>This is the missing sidelights.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now dodge chevy and a ford are</v>

3003
02:13:10.750 --> 02:13:12.290
<v Speaker 2>kind of doing the same thing right now.</v>

3004
02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:14.480
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also elevated everybody's</v>

3005
02:13:14.481 --> 02:13:17.000
<v Speaker 2>interior game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which keep that up there.</v>

3006
02:13:17.210 --> 02:13:19.640
<v Speaker 2>Don't you take that down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like shutting down porn.</v>

3007
02:13:19.650 --> 02:13:23.750
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with everybody's interior</v>
<v Speaker 2>game stepped up to because it used to be</v>

3008
02:13:23.751 --> 02:13:27.170
<v Speaker 2>like the germans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The japanese had much higher build</v>

3009
02:13:27.171 --> 02:13:30.890
<v Speaker 2>quality with the interiors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but corvette has had to step up.</v>

3010
02:13:30.891 --> 02:13:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Its considerably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new corvettes are very nice</v>

3011
02:13:33.961 --> 02:13:36.780
<v Speaker 2>interior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony hinchcliffe has one standup</v>

3012
02:13:36.810 --> 02:13:38.400
<v Speaker 2>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary tony hinchcliffe.</v>

3013
02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:42.240
<v Speaker 2>He's got a grand sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whiCh a lot of people think is the best</v>

3014
02:13:42.241 --> 02:13:46.170
<v Speaker 2>of the because it's not too overpowered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still got the wide body,</v>

3015
02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:49.470
<v Speaker 2>but I look at the interior go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a nice interior men.</v>

3016
02:13:49.500 --> 02:13:52.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It used to be the car as fast as fuck.</v>

3017
02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:54.690
<v Speaker 2>It's put the seat and there's nothing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3018
02:13:55.650 --> 02:13:59.580
<v Speaker 2>You have a two spoke steering wheel that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you can actually bend it,</v>

3019
02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:00.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

3020
02:14:00.630 --> 02:14:02.910
<v Speaker 2>those cars were terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just noticed her,</v>

3021
02:14:02.911 --> 02:14:04.690
<v Speaker 2>these fake clouds in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3022
02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:09.030
<v Speaker 2>What they are is these lights that used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have clear covers.</v>

3023
02:14:09.450 --> 02:14:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got this thing from octo lights and</v>

3024
02:14:12.781 --> 02:14:14.130
<v Speaker 2>they're a company that makes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3025
02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:18.480
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a photograph of clouds that</v>

3026
02:14:18.481 --> 02:14:23.460
<v Speaker 2>you could see through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we put it over the top of the light</v>

3027
02:14:23.461 --> 02:14:26.150
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did octo mom start that until lights?</v>

3028
02:14:26.350 --> 02:14:27.183
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

3029
02:14:30.570 --> 02:14:34.870
<v Speaker 3>Because there's only six lights in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a well in the old place we had them.</v>

3030
02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:36.940
<v Speaker 3>They were stars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the news place,</v>

3031
02:14:36.941 --> 02:14:39.480
<v Speaker 3>the lights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these led lights are just not as bright</v>

3032
02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:43.200
<v Speaker 3>so we had to change it to clouds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it looks at the new roles with the</v>

3033
02:14:43.201 --> 02:14:46.120
<v Speaker 3>star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got A wraith,</v>

3034
02:14:46.210 --> 02:14:48.630
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's got the shooting star every</v>

3035
02:14:48.631 --> 02:14:49.890
<v Speaker 3>once in awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And really?</v>

3036
02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people don't know that the</v>

3037
02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:56.520
<v Speaker 3>star pattern that they put in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>headliner in the car is the exact star</v>

3038
02:14:56.521 --> 02:15:00.510
<v Speaker 3>pattern from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess the original factory or</v>

3039
02:15:00.511 --> 02:15:01.710
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow.</v>

<v Speaker 3>My neighbor has one of those.</v>

3045
02:15:10.730 --> 02:15:14.130
<v Speaker 3>That car is epic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a two door,</v>

3046
02:15:14.490 --> 02:15:17.370
<v Speaker 3>four door knock at the door and get in</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3047
02:15:17.370 --> 02:15:19.110
<v Speaker 3>And you go with this car is</v>
<v Speaker 3>preposterous.</v>

3048
02:15:19.450 --> 02:15:22.830
<v Speaker 3>It's so quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're barely connected to the</v>

3049
02:15:22.831 --> 02:15:24.410
<v Speaker 3>outside world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Barely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>YOu barely paid attention.</v>

<v Speaker 3>around looking at people.</v>

3058
02:15:45.450 --> 02:15:49.170
<v Speaker 3>Did theY develop poodles for some</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific hunting reason?</v>

02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:50.940
<v Speaker 3>So they were hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3060
02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:54.000
<v Speaker 3>like people think of poodles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think of poodles is like a,</v>

3061
02:15:54.270 --> 02:15:56.760
<v Speaker 3>like a rich person's to beverly hills</v>
<v Speaker 3>dog.</v>

3062
02:15:57.150 --> 02:15:58.260
<v Speaker 3>The ballet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I poodles</v>

3063
02:15:59.870 --> 02:16:01.400

<v Speaker 3>And what happened?</v>

3064
02:16:01.450 --> 02:16:02.350
<v Speaker 3>A matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mine,</v>

02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:03.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3066
02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:07.080
<v Speaker 3>I called her fifi as her name and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>brought a rabbit in.</v>

<v Speaker 3>up this rabbit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They bring them to the master as a sign</v>

<v Speaker 2>put it down to the runaway.</v>

3081
02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Actually about 10 minutes is what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>took it to come out of frozen state.</v>

3082
02:16:48.670 --> 02:16:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just got eight by poodle and</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought into bed with me.</v>

3083
02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:53.560
<v Speaker 2>It probably feels like as long as it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>alive,</v>

3084
02:16:53.561 --> 02:16:58.020
<v Speaker 2>just to go with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go limp and hope you're just a toy.</v>

3085
02:16:58.090 --> 02:16:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Just hope it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3086
02:16:59.381 --> 02:17:02.020
<v Speaker 2>That's the good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got her own instagram.</v>

3087
02:17:02.021 --> 02:17:05.920
<v Speaker 2>She's doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's always showing off domestic dogs,</v>

3088
02:17:05.980 --> 02:17:07.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't need to eat.</v>

3089
02:17:08.170 --> 02:17:10.100
<v Speaker 2>They don't need to kill you to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're,</v>

3090
02:17:10.101 --> 02:17:11.710
<v Speaker 2>they're only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're only grabbing you.</v>

3091
02:17:11.711 --> 02:17:15.080
<v Speaker 2>So rabbit's probably just keep it</v>
<v Speaker 2>together and he'll eventually get bored.</v>

3092
02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has really want to eat you.</v>

3093
02:17:16.990 --> 02:17:19.570
<v Speaker 2>What does that to a poodle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>16,</v>

3094
02:17:19.571 --> 02:17:22.300
<v Speaker 2>49.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An engraving.</v>

3095
02:17:22.310 --> 02:17:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about in 16?</v>

3096
02:17:24.701 --> 02:17:27.520
<v Speaker 2>40 nine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They already fucked dogs up to that</v>

3097
02:17:27.521 --> 02:17:32.521
<v Speaker 2>point because all dogs come from wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what one of the favorite read</v>

3098
02:17:33.220 --> 02:17:34.800
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They one of the biggest.</v>

3099
02:17:36.130 --> 02:17:41.130
<v Speaker 2>One of the weirdest stories that came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of a genetics is understanding that</v>

3100
02:17:41.230 --> 02:17:44.200
<v Speaker 2>all dogs came from wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't think that.</v>

3101
02:17:44.201 --> 02:17:47.740
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm pretty sure they thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all dogs.</v>

3102
02:17:47.741 --> 02:17:52.240
<v Speaker 2>We're like a combination of a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things like wild dogs and</v>

3103
02:17:52.241 --> 02:17:55.750
<v Speaker 2>different things that eventually became</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a mass diff or something,</v>

3104
02:17:56.110 --> 02:18:01.030
<v Speaker 2>but now they realize no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single dog from a chihuahua to a</v>

3105
02:18:01.031 --> 02:18:03.580
<v Speaker 2>great dane comes from a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3106
02:18:03.581 --> 02:18:06.160
<v Speaker 2>but I mean there are some dogs that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with them?</v>

3107
02:18:06.250 --> 02:18:10.050
<v Speaker 2>I meaN you've got 150 pound massive that</v>
<v Speaker 2>just lays there and slobbers.</v>

3108
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I had 140 pound master if he lived to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>13 years old.</v>

3109
02:18:13.211 --> 02:18:14.870
<v Speaker 2>He was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a greaT dog now.</v>

3110
02:18:14.871 --> 02:18:18.600
<v Speaker 2>They're great dogs with this air and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're smart.</v>

3111
02:18:18.910 --> 02:18:21.070
<v Speaker 2>TheY're smart and they're big and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like take.</v>

3112
02:18:21.130 --> 02:18:22.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind.</v>

3113
02:18:22.390 --> 02:18:23.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially here in California,</v>

3114
02:18:23.831 --> 02:18:25.730
<v Speaker 2>you got to pick up the dogs crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

3115
02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:28.810
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to pick up a crap that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger than mine.</v>

3116
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You find dog.</v>

3117
02:18:30.131 --> 02:18:33.430
<v Speaker 2>She just shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you got to pick it up.</v>

3118
02:18:33.431 --> 02:18:34.090
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3119
02:18:34.090 --> 02:18:37.810
<v Speaker 2>it's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people walking along and that</v>

3120
02:18:37.811 --> 02:18:38.830
<v Speaker 2>just cracks me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3121
02:18:38.831 --> 02:18:41.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to follow this giant animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and pick up and shit.</v>

3122
02:18:42.010 --> 02:18:44.560
<v Speaker 2>That's the least of your worries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is it doesn't</v>

3123
02:18:44.561 --> 02:18:48.150
<v Speaker 2>understand how big it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it knocks people downstairs and you</v>

3124
02:18:48.190 --> 02:18:50.920
<v Speaker 2>gotta be real careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have steep stairs and a big dog,</v>

3125
02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:53.290
<v Speaker 2>you have to really train that</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker correctly.</v>

3126
02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:54.281
<v Speaker 2>You have to let them know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3127
02:18:54.281 --> 02:18:58.000
<v Speaker 2>you can't jump on the four year old at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top stair you fucking dummy.</v>

3128
02:18:59.140 --> 02:19:01.990
<v Speaker 2>But he's a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just loves you.</v>

3129
02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:03.220
<v Speaker 2>They love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get a,</v>

3130
02:19:03.310 --> 02:19:04.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bIg dogs.</v>

3131
02:19:04.241 --> 02:19:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Like my friend Johnny Cash was my dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's um,</v>

3132
02:19:08.770 --> 02:19:12.190
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend joe sold it to me and he was a</v>

3133
02:19:12.191 --> 02:19:14.320
<v Speaker 2>trainer of dogs for movies and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3134
02:19:15.010 --> 02:19:15.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie,</v>

3135
02:19:15.761 --> 02:19:20.350
<v Speaker 2>the incredible hulk with the one with</v>
<v Speaker 2>eric bana when nick nolte,</v>

3136
02:19:20.351 --> 02:19:22.540
<v Speaker 2>he plays his dad and nicole is the bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

3137
02:19:22.541 --> 02:19:26.830
<v Speaker 2>And he's like a scientist and he sticks</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hulk serum into these dogs and he</v>

3138
02:19:26.831 --> 02:19:29.480
<v Speaker 2>turns these dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these big giant hoking mastiffs.</v>

3139
02:19:29.630 --> 02:19:34.630
<v Speaker 2>While the original dog was actually my</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend's dog and he was a trainer of</v>

3140
02:19:34.911 --> 02:19:38.360
<v Speaker 2>these dogs and he brought them to fear</v>
<v Speaker 2>failure and on fear factor.</v>

3141
02:19:38.361 --> 02:19:41.930
<v Speaker 2>These doctors just laying around like</v>
<v Speaker 2>super chill like that.</v>

3142
02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:45.020
<v Speaker 2>That's the cartoon dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was lIke a real dog before</v>

3143
02:19:45.021 --> 02:19:46.520
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name the dog was,</v>

3144
02:19:46.850 --> 02:19:50.660
<v Speaker 2>he's a regency massive and his name was</v>
<v Speaker 2>curly.</v>

3145
02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:53.690
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

3146
02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:58.240
<v Speaker 2>he developed these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He raised these dogs and made them too.</v>

3147
02:19:58.780 --> 02:20:02.120
<v Speaker 2>He bred them to this place where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just had no aggression,</v>

3148
02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:06.290
<v Speaker 2>no aggression to dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no aggression to people like this dog</v>

3149
02:20:06.291 --> 02:20:09.560
<v Speaker 2>was like a hulk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a giant mass muscle.</v>

3150
02:20:09.650 --> 02:20:11.560
<v Speaker 2>But you can come up to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody come up to him,</v>

3151
02:20:11.570 --> 02:20:13.790
<v Speaker 2>pet it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little kids were petting it and he was</v>

3152
02:20:13.791 --> 02:20:17.060
<v Speaker 2>like gently kissing their face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the sweetheart of sweethearts.</v>

3153
02:20:17.550 --> 02:20:20.630
<v Speaker 2>We run in here and look at one more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got more people out there.</v>

3154
02:20:20.810 --> 02:20:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

3155
02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:26.300
<v Speaker 2>he's a big dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was a super sweetheart.</v>

3156
02:20:26.450 --> 02:20:29.130
<v Speaker 2>It's all about like breeders know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how they breed them.</v>

3157
02:20:29.140 --> 02:20:29.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

3158
02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:33.170
<v Speaker 2>What kind of dogs do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a fifi.</v>

3159
02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:35.000
<v Speaker 2>The poodle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Standard poodle.</v>

3160
02:20:36.250 --> 02:20:38.990
<v Speaker 2>How much does fifi way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably 60.</v>

3161
02:20:39.140 --> 02:20:42.320
<v Speaker 2>So reasonable shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're cleaning up a reasonable handful.</v>

3162
02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:46.580
<v Speaker 2>I know several times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you have like an english</v>

3163
02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:48.490
<v Speaker 2>mastiff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3164
02:20:48.510 --> 02:20:50.290
<v Speaker 2>you got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the one bag,</v>

3165
02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:53.240
<v Speaker 2>two bags a hunk of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you've got to figure out how to</v>

3166
02:20:53.241 --> 02:20:58.241
<v Speaker 2>roll this one and roll with this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a pot roast of shit that comes ouT</v>

3167
02:20:58.731 --> 02:21:01.550
<v Speaker 2>of that animal's asshole every few</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

3168
02:21:01.790 --> 02:21:03.270
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3169
02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:06.890
<v Speaker 2>That's a poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fellows and gals don't live very long</v>

3170
02:21:06.891 --> 02:21:08.150
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>

3171
02:21:08.380 --> 02:21:10.970
<v Speaker 2>That's what's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those really big dogs like eight,</v>

3172
02:21:10.971 --> 02:21:12.080
<v Speaker 2>nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're done.</v>

3173
02:21:12.140 --> 02:21:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Mine lived to be 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was extraordinary.</v>

3174
02:21:14.510 --> 02:21:17.560
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was hurt and I had,</v>

3175
02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to carry him to his food</v>

3176
02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:24.200
<v Speaker 2>and then carry him back outside.</v>

3177
02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:25.850
<v Speaker 2>So you can go to the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was bad</v>

3178
02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:32.540
<v Speaker 2>trials and tribulations of big dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just on the jra.</v>

3179
02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:35.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can tune in on a screener document,</v>

3180
02:21:42.530 --> 02:21:44.810
<v Speaker 2>might be one of the greatest things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ever happened in the history of</v>

3181
02:21:44.811 --> 02:21:48.020
<v Speaker 2>this show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is [inaudible] dot com trending yet?</v>

3182
02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:50.780
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

3183
02:21:50.781 --> 02:21:54.230
<v Speaker 2>and people are going to be mad at us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't you have to use a derogatory</v>

3184
02:21:54.231 --> 02:21:55.890
<v Speaker 2>term for months?</v>
<v Speaker 2>China?</v>

3185
02:21:56.080 --> 02:21:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call it a big deck screener.</v>

3186
02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:00.980
<v Speaker 2>He's guys are dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're assholes.</v>

3187
02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Dixon assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet you chose con.</v>

3188
02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were thinking about manhole,</v>

3189
02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:10.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Australia has the proper use of the</v>

3190
02:22:10.761 --> 02:22:14.690
<v Speaker 2>word cunt and too much reverence to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>word in America.</v>

3191
02:22:14.900 --> 02:22:17.180
<v Speaker 2>people get confused about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Australia,</v>

3192
02:22:17.181 --> 02:22:20.700
<v Speaker 2>they just throw that bitch around like</v>

<v Speaker 2>what I was going to get to is one of the</v>

3245
02:24:32.401 --> 02:24:37.401
<v Speaker 2>things that those movies did was they,</v>

3402
02:31:51.631 --> 02:31:54.210
<v Speaker 2>that car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a 2001.</v>

3403
02:31:54.240 --> 02:31:56.090
<v Speaker 2>That was like a zero or a one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3404

<v Speaker 2>the way it's put together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is so fucking pretty.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's a different feel,</v>

3408
02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:11.940
<v Speaker 2>but that's a fucking amazing car and</v>

3409
02:32:11.941 --> 02:32:14.370

<v Speaker 2>of money for a to a to z and it was</v>

3419
02:32:44.791 --> 02:32:47.700
<v Speaker 2>being shipped and the truck burn to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking ground.</v>

3420
02:32:49.490 --> 02:32:50.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

3421
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the whole trailer burn to the</v>

3422
02:32:53.971 --> 02:32:54.511
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3423
02:32:54.511 --> 02:32:58.500
<v Speaker 2>you know how there's been these fires</v>
<v Speaker 2>out here in the northeast,</v>

3424
02:32:58.501 --> 02:33:01.860
<v Speaker 2>but still do you know about California</v>
<v Speaker 2>has had some pretty crazy fires.</v>

3425
02:33:02.070 --> 02:33:03.540
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy up the street that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>really nice.</v>

3426
02:33:03.541 --> 02:33:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Three series bmw burned to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still sitting there.</v>

3427
02:33:08.501 --> 02:33:11.190
<v Speaker 2>I took pictures of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it on my instagram out.</v>

3428
02:33:11.191 --> 02:33:12.150
<v Speaker 2>You need to tell him to call me.</v>

3429
02:33:12.150 --> 02:33:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I think we do because there</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been some really amazing cars that</v>

3430
02:33:15.721 --> 02:33:18.660
<v Speaker 2>have burned with the fires that happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>this past year.</v>

3431
02:33:19.260 --> 02:33:21.200
<v Speaker 2>The panels are still good though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3432
02:33:21.390 --> 02:33:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about the panels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We take them.</v>

3433
02:33:23.370 --> 02:33:26.040
<v Speaker 2>I need to make you this in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This conference table.</v>

3434
02:33:26.310 --> 02:33:30.720
<v Speaker 2>You take it and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you take the real special car that</v>

3435
02:33:30.721 --> 02:33:32.670
<v Speaker 2>burned down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You blow everything out,</v>

<v Speaker 2>conference table called burning up the</v>

3438
02:33:40.501 --> 02:33:45.501

3439
02:33:45.631 --> 02:33:47.760
<v Speaker 2>expensive burned out cars would make</v>

<v Speaker 2>because the [inaudible] is a totallY</v>

3462
02:34:50.181 --> 02:34:53.370
<v Speaker 2>different thing than an m three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful and it's amazinG.</v>

3463
02:34:53.371 --> 02:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Like an [inaudible] from bmw is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an amazing driver.</v>

3464
02:34:58.010 --> 02:34:59.840
<v Speaker 2>like if you want to drive that car every</v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

3465
02:34:59.841 --> 02:35:04.190
<v Speaker 2>you'll be super pleased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That performance is unprecedented in the</v>

3466
02:35:04.191 --> 02:35:08.090
<v Speaker 2>edm world and most of the car world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only things that are faster like</v>

3467
02:35:08.091 --> 02:35:11.480
<v Speaker 2>fucking gtrs and corvettes that are zr</v>
<v Speaker 2>one zero,</v>

3468
02:35:11.490 --> 02:35:15.690
<v Speaker 2>zero six as a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's different because in m three</v>

3469
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:19.790
<v Speaker 2>was really light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really light and uncomplicated.</v>

3470
02:35:19.820 --> 02:35:22.600
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't any traction control or if</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

3471
02:35:22.601 --> 02:35:26.180
<v Speaker 2>it was minimal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly it was just antilock brakes and</v>

3472
02:35:26.181 --> 02:35:27.320
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3473
02:35:27.410 --> 02:35:32.410
<v Speaker 2>3000 pound car and it had 333 horsepower</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is perfectly balanced for the right</v>

3474
02:35:32.811 --> 02:35:36.800
<v Speaker 2>amount of thrust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right amount of grip with the tires</v>

3475
02:35:36.801 --> 02:35:39.680
<v Speaker 2>because they weren't the widest tires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were wide enough.</v>

3476
02:35:39.681 --> 02:35:42.350
<v Speaker 2>they a little bit of fender flare that</v>
<v Speaker 2>made them wider than a standard three</v>

3477
02:35:42.351 --> 02:35:45.050
<v Speaker 2>series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just a perfect understated</v>

3478
02:35:45.051 --> 02:35:48.080
<v Speaker 2>looking car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at that [inaudible] 46 and</v>

3479
02:35:48.081 --> 02:35:50.060
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at that car like that sudden</v>

3480
02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:53.120
<v Speaker 2>that's a fucking good neutral zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>LIke they nailed it.</v>

3481
02:35:53.570 --> 02:35:56.300
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If anybody has one of those I'm buying,</v>

3482
02:35:57.870 --> 02:36:00.320
<v Speaker 3>you can reach me to cast mucky duck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sell it,</v>

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3484
02:36:03.410 --> 02:36:06.320
<v Speaker 3>Well what we do is we buy like 10 or 20</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them and then we sell one at auction</v>

3485
02:36:06.321 --> 02:36:08.420
<v Speaker 3>for like 15 times what they normally</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring them.</v>

3486
02:36:08.421 --> 02:36:10.400
<v Speaker 3>Then we sell the rest of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look at that car.</v>

3487
02:36:10.610 --> 02:36:12.920
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good car</v>

3488
02:36:13.110 --> 02:36:15.060
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a balance.</v>

3489
02:36:15.061 --> 02:36:18.630
<v Speaker 2>That car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a ferrari for 88 or some</v>

3490
02:36:18.631 --> 02:36:21.210
<v Speaker 2>shit like that where it's so outrageous.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're a sore.</v>

3496

<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've got one behind you.</v>

02:36:44.900 --> 02:36:47.330
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to eat 46 m three in my life.</v>

3502
02:36:47.331 --> 02:36:48.470
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a.</v>

3503
02:36:48.990 --> 02:36:52.340
<v Speaker 3>It might be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's perfectly understated and yet</v>

3504
02:36:52.341 --> 02:36:54.740
<v Speaker 3>flashy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a balance.</v>

3505
02:36:54.741 --> 02:36:57.020
<v Speaker 3>So what's the value on that right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm serious.</v>

3506
02:36:57.021 --> 02:36:59.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't watch that kind of car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not crazy.</v>

3507
02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:02.780
<v Speaker 3>They're not crazy becauSe I think people</v>
<v Speaker 3>overlook them.</v>

3508
02:37:02.810 --> 02:37:06.550
<v Speaker 3>They overlook them for more extravagant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like [inaudible],</v>

3509
02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:09.190

<v Speaker 3>what would you pay for one right now?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Those kinds of cars.</v>

3516
02:37:21.330 --> 02:37:24.590
<v Speaker 2>There's something about that car that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very appealing because it's a balance</v>

3517
02:37:24.591 --> 02:37:26.900
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like there's something about</v>

3527
02:37:54.890 --> 02:37:58.250
<v Speaker 2>eight years because it was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was my daily driver.</v>

3528
02:37:58.251 --> 02:38:00.050
<v Speaker 2>It was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After I would get out of it,</v>

3529
02:38:00.051 --> 02:38:01.640
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this car is everything.</v>

3530
02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:04.700
<v Speaker 2>I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's understated and yet it's wicked,</v>

3531
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:08.560
<v Speaker 2>it's got veto power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet it's not preposterous.</v>

3532
02:38:08.570 --> 02:38:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Like the wheels don't break loose every</v>
<v Speaker 2>time you hit the gas it has a double</v>

3533
02:38:12.711 --> 02:38:15.590
<v Speaker 2>clutch transmission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's good and traffic and it also has</v>

3534
02:38:15.591 --> 02:38:19.760
<v Speaker 2>a whale because it's got this high</v>
<v Speaker 2>revving va and in so many things that I</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think I can get ahold of bmw.</v>

3538
02:38:30.550 --> 02:38:31.910

<v Speaker 2>So you'll get to.</v>

3541
02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:43.370

<v Speaker 2>correcting and hitting the target proper</v>

3550
02:39:19.161 --> 02:39:24.161
<v Speaker 2>apex and stomping on the gas and knowing</v>
<v Speaker 2>when to brake and knowing when to like</v>

02:47:38.571 --> 02:47:42.980
<v Speaker 3>$3,000 of the bull runs and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one guy appeared on the scene for a</v>

3738
02:47:42.980 --> 02:47:45.950
<v Speaker 3>few years and it was kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was there but he wasn't there and he</v>

02:47:45.951 --> 02:47:50.060
<v Speaker 3>was kinda not really competing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had all these expensive cars.</v>

3740
02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:53.030
<v Speaker 3>It turns out that that's all he'd been</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing for four or five years,</v>

3741
02:47:53.270 --> 02:47:55.850
<v Speaker 3>was shipping these cars from town to</v>
<v Speaker 3>town,</v>

3742
02:47:56.210 --> 02:48:00.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>gumball rally.</v>

3746
02:48:07.730 --> 02:48:09.170

3752
02:48:21.410 --> 02:48:22.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something about like,</v>

3753
02:48:22.810 --> 02:48:24.210
<v Speaker 3>like a lamborghini,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3755
02:48:26.601 --> 02:48:31.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like you want to kind of slightly</v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly escape from society's</v>

3756
02:48:31.610 --> 02:48:33.290
<v Speaker 3>constraints.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that is better.</v>

3873
02:53:32.350 --> 02:53:35.860
<v Speaker 3>It was like everybody just got smelling</v>
<v Speaker 3>salts under their nose and then the</v>

3874
02:53:35.861 --> 02:53:37.790
<v Speaker 3>kardashians fucked it up for all this.</v>

3875
02:53:38.080 --> 02:53:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Everybody woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think did,</v>

3876
02:53:40.031 --> 02:53:43.060
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They exploited a hole in the system.</v>

3877
02:53:43.510 --> 02:53:47.110
<v Speaker 3>You know like Jennifer Lopez had strong</v>
<v Speaker 3>ass game way before them,</v>

3878
02:53:47.380 --> 02:53:52.180
<v Speaker 3>but it was a legit latina asking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct from years of dancing and</v>

3879
02:53:52.181 --> 02:53:55.410
<v Speaker 3>fucking running upstairs and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3880
02:53:55.590 --> 02:53:57.100
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck she did.</v>

3881
02:53:57.160 --> 02:54:00.070
<v Speaker 3>Well also she's like four foot two</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>

3882
02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:02.800
<v Speaker 3>It's just pretty short.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's probably five foot one or</v>

3883
02:54:02.801 --> 02:54:06.610
<v Speaker 3>something and she was pretty short pack</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all in small area.</v>

3884
02:54:06.700 --> 02:54:10.450
<v Speaker 3>He got to get it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But those movies,</v>

3885
02:54:10.451 --> 02:54:12.370
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like burt reynolds movies for whatever,</v>

3886
02:54:12.400 --> 02:54:14.800
<v Speaker 3>deliverance doesn't get the respect it</v>
<v Speaker 3>deserves.</v>

3887
02:54:15.040 --> 02:54:20.020
<v Speaker 3>That is one of the all time greatest</v>
<v Speaker 3>drama movies of all time.</v>

3888
02:54:20.050 --> 02:54:22.830
<v Speaker 3>I actually have a picture when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>filming with burton's house,</v>

3889
02:54:23.070 --> 02:54:24.760
<v Speaker 3>a similar in my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never find it.</v>

3890
02:54:24.850 --> 02:54:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

3891
02:54:26.470 --> 02:54:31.470
<v Speaker 3>I was in his memorabilia room which also</v>
<v Speaker 3>doubled as a weight room and just there</v>

3892
02:54:31.530 --> 02:54:33.580
<v Speaker 3>was stuff everywhere and I was texting</v>
<v Speaker 3>away,</v>

3893
02:54:33.610 --> 02:54:37.360
<v Speaker 3>I was dealing with a problem and</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody snapped a picture of it and the</v>

3894
02:54:37.361 --> 02:54:42.250
<v Speaker 3>deliverance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a canoe is laying up against the wall</v>

3895
02:54:42.251 --> 02:54:44.950
<v Speaker 3>and there's all these different</v>
<v Speaker 3>memorabilia things in there.</v>

3896
02:54:44.951 --> 02:54:48.160
<v Speaker 3>And when I say memorabilia like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a hoarding room.</v>

3897
02:54:48.260 --> 02:54:51.370
<v Speaker 3>There was just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything was in there and it was</v>

3898
02:54:51.371 --> 02:54:53.170
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the most surreal thing because</v>

3899
02:54:53.171 --> 02:54:57.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm hammering away and there's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything behind you do that.</v>

3900
02:54:57.791 --> 02:54:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Did you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the other thing about that movie.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>burt reynolds,</v>

3904
02:55:06.470 --> 02:55:09.170

<v Speaker 2>compound bows.</v>

3905
02:55:09.380 --> 02:55:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know what a compound bow</v>
<v Speaker 2>was until I saw that movie.</v>

3906
02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:16.430

<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

3923
02:55:52.551 --> 02:55:56.550

<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
