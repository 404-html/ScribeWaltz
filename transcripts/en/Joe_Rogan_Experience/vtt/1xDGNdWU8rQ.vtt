1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.900
<v Speaker 1>We are doing this show and the honor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Derek,</v>

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:08.901
<v Speaker 1>the safari guide who was killed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cecil's cousin in Africa today will all </v>

3
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:15.411
<v Speaker 1>day my fucking facebook has been a mess </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of people angry at me thinking </v>

4
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>that I really cared that this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>safari guide got killed.</v>

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>But Abby Martin is here to straighten </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything out.</v>

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Did you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you cry when Cecil?</v>

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't shed any tears.</v>

8
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

9
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I cried when Jimmy Kimmel cried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.050
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these stories are just.</v>

11
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like they're manufactured </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of outrage and feign outrage for </v>

12
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>people to just feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

13
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.761
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you should love animals and </v>

14
00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Speaker 1>humans and have solidarity with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>living things,</v>

15
00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:46.881
<v Speaker 1>but it just seemed really manufacturing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when I read interviews with </v>

16
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:46.881
<v Speaker 1>people who lived there and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

17
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:51.351
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck is cecil the lion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the way the hysteria in this </v>

18
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>country made it seem like he was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>their national animal.</v>

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Like this was the lion that was like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion,</v>

20
00:00:57.811 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This beloved creature.</v>

21
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>And everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do Americans care so much about this</v>

22
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:06.321
<v Speaker 1>lion who no one had heard anything about</v>
<v Speaker 1>him at all until this guy killed them.</v>

23
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>And then once we decided that there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a name to.</v>

24
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.230
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>then it became this big thing where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had justin wren,</v>

26
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>who's a friend of mine who works in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Congo,</v>

27
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.210
<v Speaker 1>he builds water wells for these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Congo that don't have a fresh </v>

29
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.841
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said the most sobering statistic </v>

30
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:27.841
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

31
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:31.911
<v Speaker 1>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>children between the age of up to the </v>

32
00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:35.091
<v Speaker 1>age of five die every day in the Congo </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they drink dirty water.</v>

33
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>$5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a day,</v>

34
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even comprehend.</v>

35
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:45.201
<v Speaker 1>So insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to wrap your head </v>

36
00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:45.201
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

37
00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 1>black lives don't matter.</v>

38
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Lions matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>

39
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

40
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.200
<v Speaker 1>that someone else wrote a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>poignant editorial like this African </v>

41
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was just like this,</v>

42
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much death and destruction </v>

43
00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.510
<v Speaker 1>basically because of just so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

44
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with the raping of the Congo,</v>

45
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>the civil war there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>

46
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 1>but lions matter more than black lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the absolute truth.</v>

47
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:11.301
<v Speaker 1>And I think when people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropomorphize this creature and feel </v>

48
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:16.251
<v Speaker 1>some sort of connection to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do that about anything you can </v>

49
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:16.251
<v Speaker 1>do that about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do it for,</v>

50
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:19.850
<v Speaker 1>with our dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the truth is we're eating animals </v>

51
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.850
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just seemed like picking and choosing</v>

53
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.670
<v Speaker 1>just because it's this majestic </v>
<v Speaker 1>creature.</v>

54
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was also,</v>

55
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:29.541
<v Speaker 1>it gives people an opportunity to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>really angry and not think about the </v>

56
00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was all these people in front</v>

57
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:31.510
<v Speaker 1>of Cecil's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:33.010
<v Speaker 1>or this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dentist,</v>

59
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 1>a dentist's office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were saying they should have </v>

60
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>his head on their wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

61
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see his head on a wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you really want.</v>

62
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you want a person to be killed now </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

63
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

64
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I actually hit me a little bit too close</v>
<v Speaker 1>to home because I saw the,</v>

65
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:54.231
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of wave of hysteria and like </v>

66
00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:57.591
<v Speaker 1>vitriol against this guy and actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>lambasting him with the death threats </v>

67
00:02:57.591 --> 00:03:01.970
<v Speaker 1>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People going in Samaritan blood on his </v>

68
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.970
<v Speaker 1>office and stuff and I just</v>

69
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 2>was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really horrified because I was like,</v>

70
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

71
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 2>this happened to me on a really micro </v>
<v Speaker 2>scale with the Chris Kyle stuff.</v>

72
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.470
<v Speaker 2>I was just like getting like incessantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>peddled with death threats and that's </v>

73
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.470
<v Speaker 2>awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wrong.</v>

74
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.421
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that to someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all human beings and you can't do </v>

75
00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:22.411
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you hate someone or think that </v>

76
00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:22.411
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

77
00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 2>if you personally want someone to die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can't just be like,</v>

78
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 2>you should die because you hunted a </v>
<v Speaker 2>line,</v>

79
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 2>you should die because you were a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Kyle shirt.</v>

80
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.760
<v Speaker 2>I just think that apply it across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>board and this kind of online bullying </v>

81
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.361
<v Speaker 2>and like driving people into a hole or </v>
<v Speaker 2>doxing them and exposing their personal </v>

82
00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 2>information because you disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that they did.</v>

83
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.710
<v Speaker 2>It's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mia Farrow Docs,</v>

84
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 2>the dentist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pharaoh,</v>

85
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 2>she put the dentist to dress online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

86
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 2>The last person that I would ever expect</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

87
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 2>That's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so interesting.</v>

88
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

89
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 2>To fuck with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ellen.</v>

90
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 2>What do you want for it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a joke,</v>

91
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 2>it's not a joke to get docs and to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>like peddled with death threats.</v>

92
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

93
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had the Chris Kyle t shirt the fuck </v>

94
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.680
<v Speaker 2>cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carl t shirt.</v>

95
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did it for?</v>

96
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.050
<v Speaker 2>Was it the being on the show that did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

97
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.180
<v Speaker 2>So you did warn me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just in case people haven't heard </v>

98
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.180
<v Speaker 2>the last episode that I was on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

99
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I talked about how Chris Kyle was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociopath.</v>

100
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 2>I talked about how he lied in his book </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

101
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing people.</v>

102
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm beating dogs or horses so bad that </v>
<v Speaker 2>his hand broke.</v>

103
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.280
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is he's lied about so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

104
00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 2>I just even tours proven that he lied </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that fight and stuff.</v>

105
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 2>So we can't really trust what he said in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his book.</v>

106
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.310
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's just odd that someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>would lie about killing black people in </v>

107
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Hurricane Katrina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would you brag about that?</v>

108
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 2>You think that you would brag about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story about like saving a child,</v>

109
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.310
<v Speaker 2>but instead he talked about how he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually bragging about like </v>

110
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 2>slaughtering people who release,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is super fucking weird or stealing</v>

111
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 2>things super fucking weird and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to make it very clear that I have a</v>

112
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 2>lot of respect for veterans and soldiers</v>
<v Speaker 2>who choose a defect.</v>

113
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of heroic people like Ben </v>

114
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.450
<v Speaker 2>Griffin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>special operations and in the UK who </v>

115
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 2>basically went to Iraq and just refuse </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go back.</v>

116
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:13.261
<v Speaker 2>So there's a ton of amazing veterans and</v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers who I think that should be </v>

117
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:17.221
<v Speaker 2>praised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when we're looking at </v>

118
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:17.221
<v Speaker 2>something like the Iraq war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a complete disaster,</v>

119
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 2>countless dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>callous,</v>

120
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:21.160
<v Speaker 2>maimed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Isis is erupted.</v>

121
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.160
<v Speaker 2>So when we have these heroes that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythologized in our society and when we </v>

122
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.881
<v Speaker 2>have someone like Chris Kyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the pinnacle of what the hero </v>

123
00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 2>should be from that war and rewriting </v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of the Iraq war,</v>

124
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just,</v>

125
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

126
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.080
<v Speaker 2>I talked about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I really felt about Chris Kyle and </v>

127
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people got really upset.</v>

128
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.660
<v Speaker 2>My friend Leo who runs this clothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

129
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.540
<v Speaker 2>printed a shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a one off shirt fuckers,</v>

130
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 2>kyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was just like,</v>

131
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 2>he want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wanted me to wear it.</v>

132
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

134
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.210

<v Speaker 2>And I posted on my instagram account,</v>

135
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 2>my instagram account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like doesn't have that many followers.</v>

136
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:59.461
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not know the shitstorm that would </v>

137
00:05:59.461 --> 00:05:59.461
<v Speaker 2>be in suing whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>war the fuck Chris Collared Shirt,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

140
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two weeks go by and I was like,</v>

141
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

142
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wake up to every,</v>

143
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.920
<v Speaker 2>like it almost started where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

144
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:17.921
<v Speaker 2>this is gonna be a really good art </v>
<v Speaker 2>project because I was getting peddled </v>

145
00:06:17.921 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 2>with like the craziest shit you've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard.</v>

146
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Like rape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like genital mutilation.</v>

147
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 2>So detailed that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this isis actually writing these </v>

148
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.601
<v Speaker 2>comments because it seems like these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people actually admire racists because </v>

149
00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:31.781
<v Speaker 2>it's like the most grotesque disturbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things about my vagina and what they </v>

150
00:06:31.781 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 2>wanted isis to do to it that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck.</v>

151
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Like you guys must have like some sick </v>
<v Speaker 2>admiration for Isis.</v>

152
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you saw that,</v>

153
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 2>do you report those people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it started.</v>

154
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was going to Baltimore and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I just was getting it so frequently that</v>

155
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck.</v>

156
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:50.381
<v Speaker 2>So my instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of had to like make it private </v>

157
00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:52.211
<v Speaker 2>immediately because someone had gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people had gone through and said </v>

158
00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 2>we're going to put our raping shoes on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and find you all this shit,</v>

159
00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

160
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shut that down.</v>

161
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 2>And then I went on facebook and saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

162
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single art post that I had on my </v>

163
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.430
<v Speaker 2>art page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single public.</v>

164
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.430
<v Speaker 2>So I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

165
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to shut it down because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

166
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to defer to these threats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time it was getting so </v>

167
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.660
<v Speaker 2>extreme that I couldn't handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the volume of,</v>

168
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:17.170
<v Speaker 2>of death and rape threats because at </v>
<v Speaker 2>first I was like category cataloging </v>

169
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.170
<v Speaker 2>them and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

170
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking screenshots of all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make this giant like,</v>

171
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.750
<v Speaker 2>like art project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

172
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:21.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>

173
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.480
<v Speaker 2>not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually getting way,</v>

174
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.850
<v Speaker 2>way too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

175
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.920
<v Speaker 2>and then I got doxed by this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm this veteran who basically just </v>

176
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 2>wrote me and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

177
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:33.940
<v Speaker 2>I just posted your address and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>veteran and sniper forums.</v>

178
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's sniper forms.</v>

179
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.900
<v Speaker 2>And he was like telling people you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to find you.</v>

180
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:43.901
<v Speaker 2>And then I found out that my mom got </v>
<v Speaker 2>doxed so my mom's personal information </v>

181
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 2>got exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so luckily I was already moving in a</v>

182
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:47.690
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was just like,</v>

183
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is shit crazy.</v>

184
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 2>So I tried to contact the cops for like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

185
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.830
<v Speaker 2>I think there was like 10 really graphic</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm going to come to your house </v>

186
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.770
<v Speaker 2>this Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut your clit off,</v>

187
00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 2>like let you bleed to death on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>floor.</v>

188
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Like just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean things like that.</v>

189
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:05.981
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was a person's public facebook </v>

190
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:05.981
<v Speaker 2>page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see as like license plate in the</v>

191
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:06.440
<v Speaker 2>photo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had like a baby,</v>

192
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just like these people out there</v>

193
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:13.541
<v Speaker 2>who are just totally proud to be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely homicidal and rapey and </v>

194
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:14.750
<v Speaker 2>really sociopathic acting.</v>

195
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 2>So I went to the cops and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

196
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:18.590
<v Speaker 2>there's like five people who I know who </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

197
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 2>They've said that they're going to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill me or raped me or cut my clit off.</v>

198
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there anything that you can,</v>

199
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.500
<v Speaker 2>you can do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they basically just took the report </v>

200
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 2>and nothing ever happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were supposed to go to the FBI.</v>

201
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.220
<v Speaker 2>Didn't do it was so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called the FBI and they're like,</v>

202
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

203
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.140
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>online threats?</v>

204
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go to this website and file it.</v>

205
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably so many online threats </v>

206
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:43.850
<v Speaker 2>going on every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

207
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Especially with killing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

208
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:46.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing,</v>

209
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 2>the thing that was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just upset me so much because people </v>

210
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.750
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were comparing me to like Pamela </v>

211
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Geller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

212
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.621
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can wear a fuckers kyle shirt and </v>

213
00:08:59.621 --> 00:08:59.621
<v Speaker 2>like Pamela Geller can have the drama </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muhammad contest.</v>

214
00:08:59.621 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

215
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Stop Dfi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Chris Kyle was like a prophet.</v>

216
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's insane.</v>

217
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>second of all,</v>

218
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 2>we're not talking about a marginalized </v>
<v Speaker 2>portion of society,</v>

219
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:12.600
<v Speaker 2>which is like Arabs who are basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

220
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.080
<v Speaker 2>this generation's like demonized </v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

221
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about Chris Kyle,</v>

222
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:19.440
<v Speaker 2>which is like the peak of the empire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

223
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:24.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homicidal soldier who's like glorified </v>

224
00:09:24.441 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 2>and in war propaganda and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't really compare the two.</v>

225
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.420
<v Speaker 2>But I just think it's really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand the real history of the </v>

226
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Iraq war and I think American sniper </v>
<v Speaker 2>really not only whitewashed it but just </v>

227
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.610
<v Speaker 2>doubled down on the myth and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment chooses these war heroes </v>

228
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:44.580
<v Speaker 2>to perpetuate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Chris Kyle is not a hero.</v>

229
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.120
<v Speaker 2>I think that there are countless heroes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we would be much more appropriate </v>

230
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:51.120
<v Speaker 2>to hail.</v>

231
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard too,</v>

232
00:09:52.571 --> 00:09:55.420
<v Speaker 3>when you look at a story like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>American sniper story,</v>

233
00:09:55.421 --> 00:10:00.421
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to figure out what really </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened because there were definitely </v>

234
00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:01.990
<v Speaker 3>some fabrications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's hard to figure out,</v>

235
00:10:01.991 --> 00:10:04.270
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Military people,</v>

236
00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:06.880
<v Speaker 3>when they retire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do not get much money.</v>

237
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:07.430
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

238
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.850
<v Speaker 3>it's piss poor and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite an embarrassment.</v>

239
00:10:09.851 --> 00:10:13.270
<v Speaker 3>It's an embarrassment as far as the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're treated medically.</v>

240
00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

241
00:10:14.621 --> 00:10:19.621
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC has worked really hard to </v>

242
00:10:19.621 --> 00:10:20.830
<v Speaker 3>provide money for the intrepid institute</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

243
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for traumatic brain injuries,</v>

244
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 3>which is a huge issue with soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the medical community has made </v>

245
00:10:30.221 --> 00:10:33.670
<v Speaker 3>so many incredible advances that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>live that didn't live,</v>

246
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30,</v>

247
00:10:34.361 --> 00:10:36.070
<v Speaker 3>40 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now these,</v>

248
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.190
<v Speaker 3>these guys are living with some </v>
<v Speaker 3>significant brain injuries.</v>

249
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.640
<v Speaker 3>And while we were doing one of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundraisers,</v>

250
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.840
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was hitting me.</v>

251
00:10:43.841 --> 00:10:48.841
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why the amount of billions and billions </v>

252
00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:52.530
<v Speaker 3>of dollars that are spent on this war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck could they not allocate a </v>

253
00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:55.240
<v Speaker 3>similar amount to take care of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers?</v>

254
00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.550
<v Speaker 3>Because the soldiers don't have a voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like nobody gives a fuck for them.</v>

255
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.630
<v Speaker 3>Nobody cares.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when these guys retire,</v>

256
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.500
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I was trying to figure out,</v>

257
00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:10.501
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would a guy like Chris Kyle make up </v>

258
00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:13.771
<v Speaker 3>all these stories?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about shooting car </v>

259
00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:14.020
<v Speaker 3>jackers in Texas that turned out to not </v>
<v Speaker 3>be true.</v>

260
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:18.280
<v Speaker 3>He said he was shooting people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Katrina that were looting.</v>

261
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:23.670
<v Speaker 3>There was all these stories that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>hold water and I was trying to think it </v>

262
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.421
<v Speaker 3>was do you that maybe this guy was </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to fabricate a bunch of crazy </v>

263
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:30.070
<v Speaker 3>shit and put it in his book because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would make the book more sensational and</v>

264
00:11:30.071 --> 00:11:35.071
<v Speaker 3>sell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this would be a way that this guy </v>

265
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:35.071
<v Speaker 3>could provide for his family.</v>

266
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:35.071
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean me?</v>

267
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

268
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.760
<v Speaker 2>bringing it back to the human level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

269
00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.940
<v Speaker 2>But I mean I keep going back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who just is like,</v>

270
00:11:40.941 --> 00:11:45.941
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel for soldiers who come back with </v>

271
00:11:45.941 --> 00:11:46.340
<v Speaker 2>traumatic brain injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do honestly think,</v>

272
00:11:46.341 --> 00:11:47.240
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

273
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:52.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dating a veteran who was in the initial </v>

274
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:52.270
<v Speaker 2>invasion of Iraq and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

275
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.670
<v Speaker 2>there are people who the military </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they want to kill people.</v>

276
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.550
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people joined the military </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have no options.</v>

277
00:11:57.551 --> 00:12:02.551
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people joined the military </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they believed in the Iraq war </v>

278
00:12:02.551 --> 00:12:06.310
<v Speaker 2>and the war on terror and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people just want to slaughter people.</v>

279
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:08.620
<v Speaker 2>And I think Chris Kyle was one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

280
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.160
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you become one of those </v>

281
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.160
<v Speaker 2>people once you get out there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exacerbated?</v>

282
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>astronomically.</v>

283
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

284
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 4>Once you shoot the first few people like</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and that was a part of the,</v>

285
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.410
<v Speaker 4>the movies that the first person he shot</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a kid,</v>

286
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

287
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:27.910
<v Speaker 4>the movie wasn't good and I was really </v>
<v Speaker 4>confused by that.</v>

288
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.370
<v Speaker 4>You didn't think it was good?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

289
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.820
<v Speaker 4>that was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was a terrible movie.</v>

290
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't well done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a clunky made for TV movie.</v>

291
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.760
<v Speaker 4>It felt like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see it?</v>

292
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not gonna.</v>

293
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.650
<v Speaker 4>It's not a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In Arusha fear was talking about how bad</v>

294
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:47.230
<v Speaker 4>it was and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought when Ari was saying that,</v>

295
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:51.570
<v Speaker 4>that he was just being hypercritical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ari hates a lot of things and I'm like,</v>

296
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.980
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe he's sorry,</v>

297
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:53.980
<v Speaker 4>but our watch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

298
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.430
<v Speaker 4>this is not a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not a good movie.</v>

299
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bradley Cooper is a really good actor,</v>

300
00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 4>but it was wooden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I felt like it was just,</v>

301
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:06.670
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't have a life to.</v>

302
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:11.730
<v Speaker 4>It goes to Chris Kyland and felt like it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was just.</v>

303
00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:13.000
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did he really say that?</v>

304
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:13.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I was like,</v>

305
00:13:13.991 --> 00:13:16.960
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going for it.</v>

306
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:22.100
<v Speaker 4>Going for all in golf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Hollywood superstar who wants to be </v>

307
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.420
<v Speaker 4>the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm seeing the movie.</v>

308
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And aside from just the movie,</v>

309
00:13:27.331 --> 00:13:29.340
<v Speaker 2>be mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just unfortunate to kind of</v>

310
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.610
<v Speaker 2>personalize this character so much when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

311
00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:34.770
<v Speaker 2>ignoring basically people came out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie,</v>

312
00:13:34.771 --> 00:13:39.771
<v Speaker 2>sanding rockies are savages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was all like justified because </v>

313
00:13:39.771 --> 00:13:40.170
<v Speaker 2>they're looking through the eyes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like Chris Kyle when really,</v>

314
00:13:40.171 --> 00:13:41.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at Iraq today.</v>

315
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Millions of refugees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

316
00:13:44.731 --> 00:13:47.400
<v Speaker 2>as I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture is just completely destroyed</v>

317
00:13:47.401 --> 00:13:48.660
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about those people?</v>

318
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:49.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

319
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:54.711
<v Speaker 2>we can humanize Chris Kyle and of course</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can humanize every soldier that's </v>

320
00:13:54.711 --> 00:13:56.580
<v Speaker 2>coming back because they were sold false</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretenses to go to war.</v>

321
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.950
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have to feel more for the,</v>

322
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:04.910
<v Speaker 2>for the people who are just the </v>
<v Speaker 2>occupants of the country and they just </v>

323
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.910
<v Speaker 2>were casualties of this mess</v>

324
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.400
<v Speaker 4>should I think we should feel for all </v>
<v Speaker 4>humans equally,</v>

325
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:12.500
<v Speaker 4>especially people that we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea that they're not as </v>

326
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.710
<v Speaker 4>valuable because they live over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

327
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:19.030
<v Speaker 4>If there was something that happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>over here where there was a foreign </v>

328
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.371
<v Speaker 4>invasion that caused a million </v>
<v Speaker 4>casualties that from innocent civilians </v>

329
00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:24.940
<v Speaker 4>would be up in arms and horrified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know what the real numbers </v>

330
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.610
<v Speaker 4>are for the Iraq invasion because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard to figure it out.</v>

331
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.330
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of different argued </v>
<v Speaker 4>numbers.</v>

332
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:37.930
<v Speaker 4>Let's say it's the low ball number,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is more than a hundred thousand </v>

333
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.040
<v Speaker 4>innocent civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's horrific.</v>

334
00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.580
<v Speaker 4>It's horrific to think that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>low ball number and the high ball </v>

335
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.510
<v Speaker 4>number,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere around 2 million Sam Harris.</v>

336
00:14:47.511 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 4>Come on right up to this big on the low </v>
<v Speaker 4>ball numbers.</v>

337
00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:52.200
<v Speaker 4>Here's</v>

338
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.210
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I am,</v>

339
00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all I'm going to say about Santa</v>

340
00:14:55.340 --> 00:15:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Ana because I know that you offered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate and I really appreciate that </v>

341
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:00.340
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

342
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.610
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really appreciate you offering that </v>

343
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:03.610
<v Speaker 1>because I know that we've been going </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth on twitter and shit.</v>

344
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I've gone back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

345
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:06.920
<v Speaker 1>like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually wrote or he,</v>

346
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:11.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the firehose of bullshit saying </v>

347
00:15:11.921 --> 00:15:13.901
<v Speaker 1>that all I was saying was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperbolic sensational figures and </v>

348
00:15:13.901 --> 00:15:18.101
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem that I have with Sam </v>

349
00:15:18.101 --> 00:15:18.101
<v Speaker 1>Harris and debating him is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

350
00:15:18.101 --> 00:15:21.671
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I should or need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate in neuroscience about foreign </v>

351
00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:22.760
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't.</v>

352
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:27.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in what he has to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>about like neuroscience and interesting </v>

353
00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.881
<v Speaker 1>things that are like what he studied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as someone arguing with me </v>

354
00:15:30.881 --> 00:15:30.881
<v Speaker 1>about like the US foreign policy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>empire,</v>

355
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a neuroscientist,</v>

356
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:36.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any reason that I would get </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of that.</v>

357
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Especially someone who talks about mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties with zero empathy.</v>

358
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think he's talking </v>

359
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.961
<v Speaker 1>about it with zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Empathy I think was like a stone cold </v>

360
00:15:46.961 --> 00:15:50.531
<v Speaker 1>killer was trying to be objective about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the numbers and not interject emotions </v>

361
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:52.130
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

362
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:57.220
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think that he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would I talk to someone who was a </v>

363
00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.350
<v Speaker 1>reporter about foreign policy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

364
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Journalists I think are much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>credible than just like scientists who </v>

365
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.360
<v Speaker 1>are just jumping into mix new atheism </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement and just being like,</v>

366
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:10.361
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a giant debate all about </v>

367
00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:10.361
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

368
00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:10.361
<v Speaker 1>I just don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

369
00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:10.361
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

370
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.570
<v Speaker 1>the information information is available</v>
<v Speaker 1>to anybody in this day and age.</v>

371
00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's innovate in what he is.</v>

372
00:16:16.881 --> 00:16:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he has a degree in neuroscience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he is a neuroscientist,</v>

373
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:26.261
<v Speaker 1>but really he's an author and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>researches things and he talks about </v>

374
00:16:26.261 --> 00:16:29.621
<v Speaker 1>things and agree with them or disagree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them in the way he presents the </v>

375
00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:30.920
<v Speaker 1>numbers and the way he's presenting </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

376
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:31.820
<v Speaker 1>this argument.</v>

377
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of debate as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as how many people died over there.</v>

378
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well here's the number.</v>

379
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem with hin is that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

380
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.980
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's basically.</v>

381
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.530
<v Speaker 1>He nitpicked all my numbers saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were huge,</v>

382
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.250
<v Speaker 1>but all he did was basically site </v>
<v Speaker 1>official casualty count numbers from the</v>

383
00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Pentagon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

384
00:16:50.241 --> 00:16:53.450
<v Speaker 1>do you think that that's the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck or number that's way worse going to</v>

385
00:16:53.451 --> 00:16:56.840
<v Speaker 1>the lowest ball number of casualties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying this is cited.</v>

386
00:16:56.841 --> 00:17:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Some other people as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the high number that he was citing I</v>

387
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:02.690
<v Speaker 1>think was around 200,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

388
00:17:02.691 --> 00:17:04.130
<v Speaker 1>It was that do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

389
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good at recalling numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's.</v>

390
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's funny that that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hammered in on his meat.</v>

391
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Basically blowing up the numbers when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically went to the.</v>

392
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:17.260
<v Speaker 1>The most extreme small calculations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been determined by military </v>

393
00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 1>personnel when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when basically the General Dempsey said,</v>

394
00:17:21.231 --> 00:17:23.780
<v Speaker 1>we don't do body counts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said during the Iraq war.</v>

395
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.350
<v Speaker 1>We don't do body counts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

396
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.670
<v Speaker 1>it is really hard to tell how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people died,</v>

397
00:17:28.671 --> 00:17:31.420
<v Speaker 1>but the international business times did</v>
<v Speaker 1>a study in 2006.</v>

398
00:17:31.421 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 1>It said a million were dead at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

399
00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:34.820
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is hard.</v>

400
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I just am sending include,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they include Shia and Sunni in </v>

401
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 1>fighting as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

402
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Which is a lot of it was caused by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq war,</v>

403
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:48.730
<v Speaker 1>which really triggered a huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civil unrest because there was a power </v>

404
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 1>going on between</v>

405
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:55.130
<v Speaker 3>the Sunni and the Shia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which were was more under control when </v>

406
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Saddam Hussein was in control of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>rack.</v>

407
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.700
<v Speaker 3>That is calculated in that casualty </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure.</v>

408
00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:00.560
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

409
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

410
00:18:02.971 --> 00:18:05.960
<v Speaker 2>and a direct result of like a directory</v>

411
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:11.230
<v Speaker 3>and that's what brings it really high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really bad and I think that's one </v>

412
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.741
<v Speaker 3>of the things that he argues against </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can't attribute that to the </v>

413
00:18:14.741 --> 00:18:18.730
<v Speaker 3>United States military invasion because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of a side effect of the </v>

414
00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:19.550
<v Speaker 3>military invasion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the civil war that's going on there.</v>

415
00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Even though all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though Cheney back in 2000 or 1996 </v>

416
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:24.660
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly what's gonna happen.</v>

417
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.581
<v Speaker 2>If we invaded Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces of Iraq are going to fly off </v>

418
00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:31.711
<v Speaker 2>Saddam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can never out him at this point </v>

419
00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:31.711
<v Speaker 2>because this is exactly what's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

420
00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:31.960
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

421
00:18:31.961 --> 00:18:35.020
<v Speaker 2>you can say that was just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>happenstance,</v>

422
00:18:35.021 --> 00:18:37.900
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is everyone knew what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna happen.</v>

423
00:18:37.901 --> 00:18:38.800
<v Speaker 2>So you know.</v>

424
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what he's just saying,</v>

425
00:18:41.961 --> 00:18:44.360
<v Speaker 3>that it's difficult to attribute that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Number two,</v>

426
00:18:44.361 --> 00:18:47.570
<v Speaker 3>what the United States is responsible </v>
<v Speaker 3>for because it's really civil war</v>

427
00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.420
<v Speaker 2>or based on a complete destabilization </v>
<v Speaker 2>and destruction of an entire.</v>

428
00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:54.000
<v Speaker 2>The entire pot</v>

429
00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:59.020
<v Speaker 3>emulation and entire population that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>run by an evil dictator in his </v>

430
00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.970
<v Speaker 3>homicidal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sociopathic sons and yeah,</v>

431
00:19:00.971 --> 00:19:05.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was all gross before that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean more people are dead now,</v>

432
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.970
<v Speaker 3>but it was gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's gross.</v>

433
00:19:06.971 --> 00:19:11.920
<v Speaker 3>Now the whole world is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the,</v>

434
00:19:11.921 --> 00:19:14.050
<v Speaker 3>the thing about Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you see that shit with a,</v>

435
00:19:14.051 --> 00:19:17.680
<v Speaker 3>blew up some ancient structures a couple</v>
<v Speaker 3>of days ago.</v>

436
00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.390
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they blew up some,</v>

437
00:19:19.391 --> 00:19:20.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient monuments.</v>

438
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.050
<v Speaker 3>Pull that up because this is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrifying.</v>

439
00:19:23.051 --> 00:19:27.100
<v Speaker 3>They beheaded some guy who's the head of</v>
<v Speaker 3>antiquities in Syria,</v>

440
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently this beloved guy who just was</v>

441
00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:36.810
<v Speaker 3>unwilling to bow to their demands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they behead this guy and then they blew </v>

442
00:19:37.121 --> 00:19:42.121
<v Speaker 3>up some ancient monuments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some are really well preserved ancient </v>

443
00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:43.770
<v Speaker 3>structures that were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

444
00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.980
<v Speaker 3>archeological treasures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're blowing these fucking things out</v>

445
00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:48.950
<v Speaker 3>of the Taliban.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blew up all those like Buddhist.</v>

446
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:54.630
<v Speaker 3>Now look at this fucking unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They released the first images showing </v>

447
00:19:54.671 --> 00:19:59.490
<v Speaker 3>the destruction of the temple in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Balsamiq fuck off.</v>

448
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.250
<v Speaker 3>I said that right?</v>

449
00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:05.460
<v Speaker 2>It's just insane how rich isis is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they've just stolen so much </v>

450
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:10.261
<v Speaker 2>equipment and money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the whole isis thing is so </v>

451
00:20:10.261 --> 00:20:13.480
<v Speaker 2>disturbing because it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a self fulfilling prophecy.</v>

452
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:18.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like everyone's wanted this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this group of like crazy Islam as that </v>

453
00:20:19.061 --> 00:20:20.470
<v Speaker 2>we can look at and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

454
00:20:20.471 --> 00:20:25.471
<v Speaker 2>this is why we need this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like never ending war and isis just be </v>

455
00:20:25.471 --> 00:20:28.381
<v Speaker 2>co comes out of the shadows of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>destabilizing an entire region of the </v>

456
00:20:28.381 --> 00:20:28.760
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

457
00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:32.140
<v Speaker 2>and this is what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is the manifestation of,</v>

458
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

459
00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:38.460
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what the tin foil hat people </v>

460
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.201
<v Speaker 3>have always been saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The United States engineer's the United </v>

461
00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:41.320
<v Speaker 3>States will prop up a country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prop up a military,</v>

462
00:20:41.321 --> 00:20:42.630
<v Speaker 3>and then go in and invade them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

463
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.110
<v Speaker 3>we got to invade them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're dangerous.</v>

464
00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.450
<v Speaker 3>They're dangerous because we made them </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>

465
00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Mean this is the</v>

466
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.090
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when you remember when Obama was</v>

467
00:20:52.091 --> 00:20:54.520
<v Speaker 4>on tv saying that we had to invade </v>
<v Speaker 4>Syria.</v>

468
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:59.730
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only two years ago he was ready to Bama </v>

469
00:20:59.730 --> 00:20:59.730
<v Speaker 4>side and we were all like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

470
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.810
<v Speaker 4>And the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty much universally it was like,</v>

471
00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:04.180
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not going into another place.</v>

472
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:09.330
<v Speaker 4>We're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not gonna start another war that </v>

473
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:09.330
<v Speaker 4>we can't win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the United States backed off.</v>

474
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.170
<v Speaker 4>They just let it go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then coincidentally,</v>

475
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.410
<v Speaker 4>the rise of Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like right when that happened.</v>

476
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:15.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck man.</v>

477
00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:17.620
<v Speaker 4>If you wanted to make a conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 4>theory,</v>

478
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:21.280
<v Speaker 4>there's no better one than the isis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right in front of everybody's face.</v>

479
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.400
<v Speaker 4>It's adorable and how ridiculous it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

480
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.260
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not saying that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy theory.</v>

481
00:21:26.261 --> 00:21:31.060
<v Speaker 4>I believe that this is real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's amazing how quick it filled the</v>

482
00:21:31.061 --> 00:21:34.660
<v Speaker 4>void left by our hysteria to go into </v>
<v Speaker 4>Syria.</v>

483
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.460
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

484
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:39.940
<v Speaker 4>will you reduce our grass bombing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>are they using poisonous gas?</v>

485
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:40.960
<v Speaker 4>That was the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

486
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:46.140
<v Speaker 4>Poisonous gas as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's rules how you're supposed to </v>

487
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:46.900
<v Speaker 4>kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll also why his WMD,</v>

488
00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:49.000
<v Speaker 4>that pretense that we should just go in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and invade a country.</v>

489
00:21:49.001 --> 00:21:49.410
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

490
00:21:49.411 --> 00:21:51.070
<v Speaker 4>like the Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so funny because people are like,</v>

491
00:21:51.071 --> 00:21:52.450
<v Speaker 4>we didn't find WMD.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They light.</v>

492
00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:55.210
<v Speaker 4>It's like if we did find WMD is would it</v>
<v Speaker 4>have been justified?</v>

493
00:21:55.211 --> 00:21:57.040
<v Speaker 4>Then like just because Assad is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>glove,</v>

494
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.860
<v Speaker 4>is that justified to go and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>invade the country?</v>

495
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.680
<v Speaker 4>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a crazy hysteria.</v>

496
00:22:02.681 --> 00:22:05.110
<v Speaker 4>They'll post nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was just undeniable,</v>

497
00:22:05.111 --> 00:22:10.111
<v Speaker 4>there's a blood lust than America that </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't be ignored and then they just </v>

498
00:22:10.111 --> 00:22:12.910
<v Speaker 4>pointed it at something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in Iraq and we were over there before</v>

499
00:22:12.911 --> 00:22:13.760
<v Speaker 4>anybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

500
00:22:13.761 --> 00:22:15.590
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Iraq.</v>

501
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.370
<v Speaker 4>Like it didn't make any sense like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>had nothing to do with it.</v>

502
00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.070
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saudi Arabia,</v>

503
00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.950
<v Speaker 4>which is where all the fucking hijackers</v>
<v Speaker 4>came from,</v>

504
00:22:23.951 --> 00:22:26.970
<v Speaker 4>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oil money.</v>

505
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.150
<v Speaker 4>We liked those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

506
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:28.420
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

507
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:29.440
<v Speaker 4>I racked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

508
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:34.530
<v Speaker 4>that guy's an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck his son's a piece of shit and </v>

509
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:34.530
<v Speaker 4>they've got oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's get over there,</v>

510
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.310
<v Speaker 4>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we were over there,</v>

511
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:40.200
<v Speaker 4>now we're in Syria with Isis and Obama </v>
<v Speaker 4>just issued this statement saying like,</v>

512
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:44.680
<v Speaker 4>we can now attack Assad forces while </v>
<v Speaker 4>battling isis if we need to.</v>

513
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:49.710
<v Speaker 4>So it's just another proxy war that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>gotten completely out of hand with </v>

514
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:54.430
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at these people that were training </v>

515
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.380
<v Speaker 4>to these FSA people and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're beheading people and shit</v>

516
00:22:56.381 --> 00:22:57.970
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like acting like Isis.</v>

517
00:22:57.971 --> 00:22:59.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's insane.</v>

518
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.220
<v Speaker 4>The fsn basically like training all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these Syrian.</v>

519
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm like revolutionaries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

520
00:23:05.381 --> 00:23:07.960
<v Speaker 4>all these people in these rebel groups.</v>

521
00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.960
<v Speaker 4>And then they go over either abandoned </v>
<v Speaker 4>post after we spent a shitload of money </v>

522
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.800
<v Speaker 4>training them to fight isis or they join</v>
<v Speaker 4>isis.</v>

523
00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.410
<v Speaker 4>It's a complete disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

524
00:23:17.411 --> 00:23:20.410
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to get Muslims to fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>against Muslims.</v>

525
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:25.470
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when their core values and their core </v>

526
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.050
<v Speaker 4>beliefs in religion are so much a part </v>
<v Speaker 4>of their life.</v>

527
00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:31.290
<v Speaker 4>And then they have these people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>telling them that you're supposed to </v>

528
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.261
<v Speaker 4>fight these people that have the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>core values that celebrate Ramadan,</v>

529
00:23:34.451 --> 00:23:35.980
<v Speaker 4>that believe in hello,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

530
00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:40.981
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have the same ideas that these </v>

531
00:23:40.981 --> 00:23:40.981
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

532

<v Speaker 4>matter.</v>

649

<v Speaker 4>No one's being jeopardized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>

650
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:25.350
<v Speaker 4>the whole remember the hope and change </v>
<v Speaker 4>website.</v>

651
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:30.650
<v Speaker 4>The hope and change website that obama </v>
<v Speaker 4>had wheN he's running for president had </v>

652
00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:30.810
<v Speaker 4>a whole piece in there about supporting </v>
<v Speaker 4>with blowers,</v>

653
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.680
<v Speaker 4>transparency and supporting </v>
<v Speaker 4>whistleblowers when he was persecuted </v>

654
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.590
<v Speaker 4>more than any other president under the </v>
<v Speaker 4>espionage act.</v>

655
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:42.710
<v Speaker 4>What happens when you get in there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they just show you fucKing ufo </v>

656
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:43.840
<v Speaker 4>landing on the north pole and what do </v>
<v Speaker 4>they show you?</v>

657
00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:45.640
<v Speaker 4>They show you where all the bombs are </v>
<v Speaker 4>being planted.</v>

658
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:50.670
<v Speaker 2>I think that yoU're so someone who has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is as young and impressionable as </v>

659
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:54.731
<v Speaker 2>obama that at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was vetted really early when </v>

660
00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:56.780
<v Speaker 2>he was at harvard and I think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just was so fucking young.</v>

661
00:29:56.781 --> 00:29:57.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

662
00:29:57.111 --> 00:29:59.390
<v Speaker 2>He was barely even a senator for a term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

663
00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:04.660
<v Speaker 2>and he just gets plucked out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>obscurity and catapulted to the </v>

664
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:08.060
<v Speaker 2>president's ship president ship </v>
<v Speaker 2>precedent ship the presidency.</v>

665
00:30:08.061 --> 00:30:10.130
<v Speaker 2>And then he just surrounded by a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of fucking.</v>

666
00:30:10.131 --> 00:30:11.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not excusing him at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is a war criminal.</v>

667
00:30:11.961 --> 00:30:16.270
<v Speaker 2>I really strongly dislike obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's like a great manipulator.</v>

668
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.340
<v Speaker 2>A bit of a left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone,</v>

669
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:18.690
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of a lefty there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Astronomy,</v>

670
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:21.260
<v Speaker 2>martin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I definitely think that god,</v>

671
00:30:21.261 --> 00:30:23.360
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine who was just surrounding</v>
<v Speaker 2>him at all times,</v>

672
00:30:23.361 --> 00:30:28.361
<v Speaker 2>like he had hillary clinton barking into</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero mccain like these crazy neo-cons </v>

673
00:30:28.361 --> 00:30:32.501
<v Speaker 2>who are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need more war and I think that you </v>

674
00:30:32.501 --> 00:30:35.051
<v Speaker 2>saw all the neocon establishment really </v>
<v Speaker 2>promoting obama until the Syria thing </v>

675
00:30:35.051 --> 00:30:38.621
<v Speaker 2>happened where we backed down and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you kind of saw this like </v>

676
00:30:38.621 --> 00:30:41.620
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous schism where now netanyahu's </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming to visit and it's like this </v>

677
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.080
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>where obama's like week now.</v>

679
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:46.820
<v Speaker 2>So that's been an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or they basically were like,</v>

680
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:49.880
<v Speaker 2>they were pissed off about the Syria </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing really well.</v>

681
00:30:49.881 --> 00:30:50.420
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

682
00:30:50.421 --> 00:30:52.130
<v Speaker 2>we're about to have a civil war in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

683
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this could get ugly if they invaded </v>

684
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.471
<v Speaker 2>Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows what would have </v>

685
00:30:59.471 --> 00:30:59.471
<v Speaker 2>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would have gotten really ugly in this</v>

686
00:30:59.471 --> 00:30:59.930
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most.</v>

687
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Whoever would Be the most dominant </v>
<v Speaker 2>militant force on the ground would rise </v>

688
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:04.990
<v Speaker 2>to power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>

689
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:06.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look at Libya for fuck sake.</v>

690
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.420

<v Speaker 2>total disaster in the past or now.</v>

691
00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.180
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrifying place now apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

692
00:31:14.181 --> 00:31:14.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's.</v>

693
00:31:14.841 --> 00:31:16.930

<v Speaker 2>assad,</v>

694
00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's about people's sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

695
00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.200
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That a guy like you,</v>

696
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.050
<v Speaker 4>you look at these dictators and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

697
00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:28.970
<v Speaker 4>no one wants kadafi to stay in power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously it's bad to have kadafi there,</v>

698
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.190
<v Speaker 4>and when kadafi got killed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

699
00:31:31.191 --> 00:31:36.191
<v Speaker 4>it was one of the most bizarre and </v>
<v Speaker 4>strange moments in social media and in </v>

700
00:31:39.221 --> 00:31:43.310
<v Speaker 4>the power of cell phone videos and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to distribute information.</v>

701
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:46.490
<v Speaker 4>The fact that they had video of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>

702
00:31:46.491 --> 00:31:48.290
<v Speaker 4>the thing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

703
00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:53.340
<v Speaker 4>and a moments he's dying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the like the moments they captured him </v>

704
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:57.190
<v Speaker 4>and they're all screaming and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing something that no one has ever </v>

705
00:31:58.131 --> 00:32:03.131
<v Speaker 4>seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one ever seen a dictator captured by </v>

706
00:32:03.131 --> 00:32:03.200
<v Speaker 4>rebels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess now.</v>

707
00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's happened throughout history.</v>

708
00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.450
<v Speaker 4>It's never been documented and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>distributed to everybody.</v>

709
00:32:08.451 --> 00:32:09.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could all watch and we could watch it</v>

710
00:32:09.891 --> 00:32:14.891
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie could pull it up right now and we </v>

711
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:16.961
<v Speaker 4>can kick back and just the comfort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this woodland hills office suite and </v>

712
00:32:16.961 --> 00:32:19.540
<v Speaker 4>watch this fucking guy get bain edited </v>
<v Speaker 4>in his asshole.</v>

713
00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>

714
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:26.510
<v Speaker 2>It's horrifying and especially this </v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster porn that's put out there by </v>

715
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:31.041
<v Speaker 2>like jay sock and this video and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the us didn't film the video but </v>

716
00:32:31.051 --> 00:32:36.051
<v Speaker 2>it was showed everywhere and we also </v>
<v Speaker 2>released photos of saddam's sons with </v>

717
00:32:36.211 --> 00:32:39.000
<v Speaker 2>all the bullet holes in them on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on tv and shit.</v>

718
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.870
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like,</v>

719
00:32:39.871 --> 00:32:42.320
<v Speaker 2>look what you did that's fucking sick </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

720
00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.400
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

721
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:47.800
<v Speaker 2>we can see isis videos all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have these crazy hollywood style sets of</v>

722
00:32:47.801 --> 00:32:49.400
<v Speaker 2>where people are getting beheaded and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like.</v>

723
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:54.401
<v Speaker 2>And you get mowed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumpsuits and it's like this crazy </v>

724
00:32:54.401 --> 00:32:56.501
<v Speaker 2>fucking manifestation of like hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and the military industrial </v>

725
00:32:56.501 --> 00:32:59.111
<v Speaker 2>complex rolled into one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time you have our </v>

726
00:32:59.111 --> 00:33:01.400
<v Speaker 2>military uploading every drone strike on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fucking youtube channel.</v>

727
00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.210
<v Speaker 2>What are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the why are including the ones that</v>

728
00:33:04.211 --> 00:33:05.270
<v Speaker 2>kill civilians?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

729
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.220
<v Speaker 2>aBsolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

730
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like just in case you're wondering </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing here,</v>

731
00:33:08.811 --> 00:33:11.240
<v Speaker 2>you can watch our youtube channel and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see how the people were killing.</v>

732
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:12.500
<v Speaker 2>It's really Weird.</v>

733
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:17.590
<v Speaker 3>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's horrific that when you watched her </v>

734
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.590
<v Speaker 3>decision making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should we shoot?</v>

735
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Should we shoot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just shoot like,</v>

736
00:33:18.031 --> 00:33:19.290
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like that.</v>

737
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:22.350
<v Speaker 3>She's like tRying to figure it out on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fly and then you realize like,</v>

738
00:33:22.351 --> 00:33:24.960
<v Speaker 3>this is what precision drone strikes are</v>
<v Speaker 3>all about.</v>

739
00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.720
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing precise about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not surgical.</v>

740
00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:32.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have a bad person that may</v>
<v Speaker 3>or may not be in this area.</v>

741
00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:37.370
<v Speaker 3>You have good information that the bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>persons in this area let the missiles </v>

742
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:38.520
<v Speaker 3>fly and they fly and then everybody is </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere near.</v>

743
00:33:38.521 --> 00:33:43.521
<v Speaker 3>That guy gets fucked up too and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>Just supposed to accept that because </v>

744
00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:44.460
<v Speaker 3>that's just a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to get them out.</v>

745
00:33:44.461 --> 00:33:46.770
<v Speaker 3>We need to take out the bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If other bad people,</v>

746
00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.420
<v Speaker 3>aren't we a bad person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we're killing innocent people,</v>

747
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:52.360
<v Speaker 3>it isn't that the whole idea behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

748
00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:57.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good to want to protect us against </v>

749
00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:58.800
<v Speaker 3>bad people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that way is bad.</v>

750
00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a bad way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're saying you have a better </v>

751
00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:04.050
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>

752
00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:04.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a better way.</v>

753
00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:08.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a better way that that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I know is that isis has gotten a </v>

754
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:08.680
<v Speaker 2>shitload of us military equipment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>billions of dollars,</v>

755
00:34:08.681 --> 00:34:11.140
<v Speaker 2>so maybe we should stop just a bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

756
00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:14.230
<v Speaker 2>all of the stuff that we've tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>train the iraqi army,</v>

757
00:34:14.231 --> 00:34:19.231
<v Speaker 2>like this isn't working because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>abandoning and like isis is just taking </v>

758
00:34:19.231 --> 00:34:22.990
<v Speaker 2>large swathes of equipment and humvees </v>
<v Speaker 2>and grenade launchers and shit.</v>

759
00:34:22.991 --> 00:34:25.930
<v Speaker 2>So I mean wHen I look at stuff like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>

760
00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:31.290
<v Speaker 2>it's just like we just need to remove </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves from the situation and let </v>

761
00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.200
<v Speaker 2>like allied states that are in the area </v>
<v Speaker 2>really take hold of whatever</v>

762
00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.460
<v Speaker 3>going out the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there a.</v>

763
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.930
<v Speaker 3>Is there justifiable war in your eyes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like now when you look at it?</v>

764
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh you mean in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at what's going on with </v>

765
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:43.960
<v Speaker 3>isis right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're decapitating,</v>

766
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:48.701
<v Speaker 3>the syrian head of antiquities and </v>
<v Speaker 3>blowing up these ancient cherished </v>

767
00:34:48.701 --> 00:34:50.040
<v Speaker 3>monuments is they're justifiable war </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

768
00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:55.180
<v Speaker 3>Are these bad guys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you go in there and stop these bad </v>

769
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:55.180
<v Speaker 3>guys?</v>

770
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:58.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there is a justifiable war</v>
<v Speaker 2>with isis because isis was created out </v>

771
00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:02.591
<v Speaker 2>of the vacuum of just a large war and </v>
<v Speaker 2>countless casualties and refugees and </v>

772
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:09.130
<v Speaker 2>the civil war thing that happened there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that isis is a direct result </v>

773
00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:13.000
<v Speaker 2>of us military intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that more us military </v>

774
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.821
<v Speaker 2>intervention to stop isis is just going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to exacerbate the problem and I </v>

775
00:35:15.821 --> 00:35:17.180
<v Speaker 2>definitely do not think that that should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

776
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an option whatsoever.</v>

777
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what do you do?</v>

778
00:35:19.991 --> 00:35:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you let them take over and just start</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing more?</v>

779
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.170
<v Speaker 2>This is the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the trick is like,</v>

780
00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.530
<v Speaker 2>it's always going to be something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>first it was all caden.</v>

781
00:35:27.531 --> 00:35:32.531
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's like isis is like pulling it </v>

782
00:35:32.531 --> 00:35:34.900
<v Speaker 2>people's heartstrings so much because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're seeing these crazy images and </v>

783
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.180
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we just sit back and do nothing?</v>

784
00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.620
<v Speaker 2>The thing is there's genocides happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Congo.</v>

785
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:41.460
<v Speaker 2>Are we going to go invade and take out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

786
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

787
00:35:42.211 --> 00:35:46.020
<v Speaker 2>why are we picking and choosing what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're putting in front of the tv screens</v>

788
00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.810
<v Speaker 2>and brainwashed and everyone's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you,</v>

789
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:51.930
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do about isis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First it was fucking a bolt.</v>

790
00:35:51.931 --> 00:35:56.931
<v Speaker 2>What happened to a bulla that was all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the fucking tv and we curate it.</v>

791
00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Annuity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much going on.</v>

792
00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I just think to hone in on isis and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>say like,</v>

793
00:36:02.071 --> 00:36:05.790
<v Speaker 2>we all need to focus on destroying isis </v>
<v Speaker 2>militarily is,</v>

794
00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:08.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just a farce because a,</v>

795
00:36:08.011 --> 00:36:09.960
<v Speaker 2>it came out of military intervention and</v>
<v Speaker 2>b,</v>

796
00:36:09.961 --> 00:36:13.020
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to fucking destroy isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to galvanize more people</v>

797
00:36:13.021 --> 00:36:15.930
<v Speaker 2>to join isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're recruiting is so high</v>

798
00:36:15.931 --> 00:36:18.060
<v Speaker 2>across the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are just like,</v>

799
00:36:18.061 --> 00:36:23.061
<v Speaker 2>fuck tHis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're being drawn to isis </v>

800
00:36:23.061 --> 00:36:26.271
<v Speaker 2>because of the endless warfare going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just think I don't have the </v>

801
00:36:26.271 --> 00:36:28.260
<v Speaker 2>answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that regional players need to</v>

802
00:36:28.261 --> 00:36:32.070
<v Speaker 2>take a step in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means Syria.</v>

803
00:36:32.071 --> 00:36:33.720
<v Speaker 2>That means you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq,</v>

804
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.070
<v Speaker 2>people in the region that understand the</v>
<v Speaker 2>region are not coming from like this neo</v>

805
00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:41.340
<v Speaker 2>colonial lens and just like all we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>is military solutions because that's all</v>

806
00:36:41.341 --> 00:36:44.250
<v Speaker 2>we fucking know because we're the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking empire.</v>

807
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.260
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris got rescued.</v>

808
00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:56.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that there's any clear </v>
<v Speaker 4>solution and I think that's a real part </v>

809
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.170
<v Speaker 4>of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that everybody who looks at isis</v>

810
00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:03.610
<v Speaker 4>decapitating decapitated head of </v>
<v Speaker 4>antiquities and blowing up monuments and</v>

811
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:05.920
<v Speaker 4>lighting people on fire with slow </v>
<v Speaker 4>motion.</v>

812
00:37:05.921 --> 00:37:07.780
<v Speaker 4>Let me just see that video that they did</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they have,</v>

813
00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:13.140
<v Speaker 4>they have slow motion video cameras like</v>
<v Speaker 4>complicated techniques where they're </v>

814
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.980
<v Speaker 4>showing these people getting lit on </v>
<v Speaker 4>fire.</v>

815
00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:18.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean what they're doing is promoting </v>
<v Speaker 4>terror.</v>

816
00:37:18.191 --> 00:37:21.180
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to scare people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing it with these videos.</v>

817
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:26.190
<v Speaker 4>Videos of decapitations assassinations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it weird that they put them on </v>

<v Speaker 2>empire.</v>

<v Speaker 2>MuShrooms.</v>

829
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:58.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's funny because I'm jumping from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia state television to latin </v>

830

<v Speaker 4>unlike our tea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not in as many households on tv and</v>

865
00:39:43.241 --> 00:39:48.241

<v Speaker 4>It would just be like when Jeff </v>

866
00:39:48.241 --> 00:39:48.620
<v Speaker 4>Stevenson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shane smith went to North Korea and they</v>

<v Speaker 4>just set it up for you.</v>

868
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:56.080
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to talk about the anniversary </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the atomic bombs.</v>

869
00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:57.640
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

870
00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.740
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about that?</v>

871
00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:05.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a fascinatinG moment in </v>

872
00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:07.951
<v Speaker 4>history and an amazing moment for amazes</v>
<v Speaker 4>me more than anything that we haven't </v>

873
00:40:07.951 --> 00:40:11.560
<v Speaker 4>blown up an atomic bomb since 1947.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the most amazing thing.</v>

874
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.940
<v Speaker 4>So somehow or another we have had the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brains to go,</v>

875
00:40:15.941 --> 00:40:16.550
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what will,</v>

876
00:40:16.551 --> 00:40:17.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that 60,</v>

877
00:40:17.711 --> 00:40:20.710
<v Speaker 4>70,</v>
<v Speaker 4>66 slash 68 years,</v>

<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>60,</v>

879
00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:24.370
<v Speaker 4>68 years without.</v>

880
00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:28.510
<v Speaker 4>And he's put his fucking city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it glows in the dark.</v>

881
00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.610
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

882
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:35.640
<v Speaker 4>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's truly amazing is how much </v>

883
00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.460
<v Speaker 4>ignorance was involved in the testing </v>
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>

884
00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.410
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

885
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:42.450
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the initial bombs that they blew up in </v>

886
00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:42.550
<v Speaker 4>the desert where they had soldiers run </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the bombs.</v>

887
00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.790
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see those videos on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little like a,</v>

888
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.030
<v Speaker 4>like the thinG where you're looking at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>solar eclipse,</v>

889
00:40:49.031 --> 00:40:51.220
<v Speaker 4>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm your cardboard glasses kids,</v>

890
00:40:51.221 --> 00:40:53.790
<v Speaker 4>and it's like 10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

891
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:58.810
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had these ones where they would </v>

892
00:40:58.810 --> 00:40:59.470
<v Speaker 4>blow up these fake cities and they would</v>
<v Speaker 4>have these guys in a trench.</v>

893
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:04.500
<v Speaker 4>They would blow up the fixed cities and </v>
<v Speaker 4>thEy would jump out of the trench and </v>

894
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:04.500
<v Speaker 4>then run towardS the blast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which never seen that.</v>

895
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.120
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can find those,</v>

896
00:41:07.121 --> 00:41:07.890
<v Speaker 4>jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're,</v>

897
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:09.030
<v Speaker 4>they're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

898
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.380
<v Speaker 4>theY didn't do it because they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it was gonna affect them.</v>

899
00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.690
<v Speaker 4>They were teaching them to run towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>the blast.</v>

900
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.300
<v Speaker 4>The idea would be that this nuclear bomb</v>
<v Speaker 4>would go off.</v>

901
00:41:16.301 --> 00:41:21.301
<v Speaker 4>Everybody would be disoriented and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up and that these american gis </v>

902
00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:25.660
<v Speaker 4>would run in there and take over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These guys all died.</v>

903
00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.120
<v Speaker 4>Not only did they die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but john wayne died.</v>

904
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:32.790
<v Speaker 4>John the bomb killed john wayne.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you know that no one knows that nuts,</v>

905
00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:37.850
<v Speaker 4>the bomb killed the fucking greatest </v>
<v Speaker 4>american actor of all time.</v>

906
00:41:38.791 --> 00:41:43.791
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bomb killed the man who played </v>

907
00:41:43.791 --> 00:41:43.791
<v Speaker 4>gangas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does everyone realize?</v>

908
00:41:43.791 --> 00:41:44.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this is what they would do.</v>

909
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.970
<v Speaker 4>They would all get in these trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

910
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.390
<v Speaker 4>these are the actual trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

911
00:41:47.391 --> 00:41:48.980
<v Speaker 4>it's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

912
00:41:48.981 --> 00:41:53.400
<v Speaker 4>it's horrific that they had these four </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking soldiers.</v>

913
00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:55.490
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was ridiculous.</v>

914
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.700
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these gUys,</v>

915
00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:01.750
<v Speaker 4>they're playing cards and shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some women just like john mccain and so </v>

916
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:06.560
<v Speaker 4>they blow these things off and when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>watched the impact,</v>

917
00:42:06.561 --> 00:42:11.561
<v Speaker 4>look at these guys are just ducking </v>
<v Speaker 4>their head and so they have this close </v>

918
00:42:11.811 --> 00:42:14.810
<v Speaker 4>enough that you see the blast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like super clearly.</v>

919
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.660
<v Speaker 4>So they have these fake bodies out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

920
00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:22.730
<v Speaker 4>They're all like drawn japanese likes to</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch how this goes off.</v>

921
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:28.450
<v Speaker 4>They set it off and then the guys get </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

922
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:32.930
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my god.</v>

923
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.820
<v Speaker 4>It's right in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

924
00:42:34.821 --> 00:42:36.800
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck five miles away,</v>

925
00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.540
<v Speaker 4>six miles away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

926
00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.440
<v Speaker 4>but look at the impact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hits them and then they're closing their</v>

927
00:42:42.441 --> 00:42:46.250
<v Speaker 4>ears and then they run towards the blast</v>
<v Speaker 4>and those guys are all dead,</v>

928
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:48.200
<v Speaker 4>all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they died young.</v>

929
00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:51.350
<v Speaker 4>See the blast hits some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

930
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is all nuclear radiation,</v>

931
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:56.900
<v Speaker 4>intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super high doses of nuclear radiation.</v>

932
00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.970
<v Speaker 4>So who knows what happened and then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean,</v>

933
00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:02.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure a good percentage of them died </v>
<v Speaker 4>of cancer.</v>

934
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.720
<v Speaker 4>A few outlier survive because of freak </v>
<v Speaker 4>genes,</v>

935
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.660
<v Speaker 4>but most of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just liKe the Gipper,</v>

936
00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.190
<v Speaker 4>not the gipper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was he?</v>

937
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.590
<v Speaker 4>What was it was john wayne.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

938
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.540
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just running toward it.</v>

939
00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:17.030
<v Speaker 4>Ronald reagan was the gipper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was john wayne?</v>

940
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.160
<v Speaker 4>Fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My god.</v>

941
00:43:19.161 --> 00:43:21.070
<v Speaker 4>Look at like the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not just the plume,</v>

942
00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.020
<v Speaker 4>But those crazy late or smoke formations</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the left.</v>

943
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.440
<v Speaker 4>I Don't know what those are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want.</v>

944
00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.340
<v Speaker 4>My favorite one is the one that they did</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the ocean.</v>

945
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:30.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one that they didn't really know how</v>

946
00:43:30.531 --> 00:43:33.830
<v Speaker 4>much of an impact it was going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fucking just tRied shit,</v>

947
00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like they tried this,</v>

948
00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:41.080
<v Speaker 4>see if you could find the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the video of the ocean nuclear </v>

949
00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.220
<v Speaker 4>explosions that they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they did it off of guam.</v>

950
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:45.590
<v Speaker 4>I think that's where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember though,</v>

951
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.000
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

952
00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:52.120
<v Speaker 4>they had all these battleships that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>stationed around where the bombs would </v>

953
00:43:52.941 --> 00:43:55.460
<v Speaker 4>go off and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they,</v>

954
00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.940
<v Speaker 4>when they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything got fucked up.</v>

955
00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:03.970
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything anywhere near it got fucKed </v>

956
00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:03.970
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go for this.</v>

957
00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:06.740
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this comes out of the water.</v>

958
00:44:06.741 --> 00:44:11.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're talking about like a mile </v>
<v Speaker 4>of water straight up in the air and just</v>

959
00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:15.420
<v Speaker 4>ignore gulfs that battleship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

960
00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:18.620
<v Speaker 4>That battleship got fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John lin was the duke,</v>

961
00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:22.130
<v Speaker 4>the duke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

962
00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:22.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

963
00:44:22.551 --> 00:44:27.551
<v Speaker 4>it went straight up and straight down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm sure it had incredible </v>

964
00:44:27.551 --> 00:44:30.911
<v Speaker 4>repercussions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but look at it just they have no idea </v>

965
00:44:30.911 --> 00:44:30.911
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

966
00:44:30.911 --> 00:44:30.920
<v Speaker 4>they didn't want to waste that.</v>

967
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:37.040
<v Speaker 1>They would try to blow some stuff up </v>
<v Speaker 1>underwater and wonder how close they </v>

968
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.100
<v Speaker 1>could be while it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turns out not close.</v>

969
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's all know is that the atomic bomb </v>

970
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:46.310
<v Speaker 1>would obliterate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like incinerate tens of thousands of </v>

971
00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:50.091
<v Speaker 1>lives in an instant and that takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of the greatest war </v>

972
00:44:50.091 --> 00:44:52.910
<v Speaker 1>crimes that are perpetrated on humanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's one of the greatest </v>

973
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.910
<v Speaker 1>crimes against humanity that's ever been</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

974
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:57.680
<v Speaker 1>And whenever I say This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Japan last year and went to </v>

975
00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:02.151
<v Speaker 1>the hiroshima every museum with like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>in utero blast survivor and it was one </v>

976
00:45:02.151 --> 00:45:03.930
<v Speaker 1>of the most intense museums I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>been to because we grew up,</v>

977
00:45:03.931 --> 00:45:04.770
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

978
00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

979
00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:08.850
<v Speaker 1>so it was his mother's stomach when she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was right there.</v>

980
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:14.480
<v Speaker 1>It was just like a random chance that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she just survived and he happens to be </v>

981
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:14.480
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

982
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was such a traumatizing.</v>

983
00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:21.450
<v Speaker 1>It's wicked good hearing his arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch.</v>

984
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish that's what it was like,</v>

985
00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:25.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just really,</v>

986
00:45:25.921 --> 00:45:27.690
<v Speaker 1>really horrified museum because we grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

987
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.720
<v Speaker 1>That is probably the biggest myth that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we grow up learning is that the bombs </v>

988
00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.251
<v Speaker 1>were necessary to end the war and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they save lives and it's just like a way</v>

989
00:45:37.261 --> 00:45:40.380
<v Speaker 1>to legitimize a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really horrific atrocity.</v>

990
00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two of them actually will.</v>

991
00:45:43.491 --> 00:45:48.491
<v Speaker 1>The issue is that Japan was already </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to surrender and that we didn't </v>

992
00:45:48.751 --> 00:45:51.360
<v Speaker 1>want them to surrender because we wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try the bombs out.</v>

993
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:56.390
<v Speaker 1>That's whether or not that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the bIg debate and that's </v>

994
00:45:56.390 --> 00:46:00.770
<v Speaker 1>something that a lot of people still to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this day argued back and forth on </v>

995
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:03.330
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it's actually the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it is the case,</v>

996
00:46:03.331 --> 00:46:06.240
<v Speaker 1>it's even more horrific because just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what they wanted to do in the ocean</v>

997
00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:11.241
<v Speaker 1>where they tried that bomb out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched a mile high wave of water </v>

998
00:46:11.241 --> 00:46:12.570
<v Speaker 1>overcome that fucking battleship.</v>

999
00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:17.840
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to see what happens when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped that shit on a city and they </v>

1000
00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 1>dropped Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their cock.</v>

1001
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They show.</v>

1002
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really,</v>

1003
00:46:20.701 --> 00:46:25.701
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't actually up for debate anymore </v>

1004
00:46:25.701 --> 00:46:25.701
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a problem.</v>

1005
00:46:25.701 --> 00:46:29.151
<v Speaker 1>It's just like the Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just these people kind of holding </v>

1006
00:46:29.151 --> 00:46:31.761
<v Speaker 1>onto this last ditch like gasp of air </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to hold onto like american </v>

1007
00:46:31.761 --> 00:46:35.661
<v Speaker 1>exceptionalism and it really just is </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally debunked at this point because </v>

1008
00:46:35.661 --> 00:46:36.450
<v Speaker 1>even truman himself instilled an atomic </v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb survey,</v>

1009
00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:40.470
<v Speaker 1>university of Colorado featured to and </v>
<v Speaker 1>of just like dozens of american military</v>

1010
00:46:40.471 --> 00:46:43.050
<v Speaker 1>experts and leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>internal interviews,</v>

1011
00:46:43.051 --> 00:46:48.051
<v Speaker 1>diaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other declassified materials basically </v>

1012
00:46:48.051 --> 00:46:50.690
<v Speaker 1>involved in a bomb decision and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them had one unit unanimous commonality </v>

1013
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:54.861
<v Speaker 1>among them that every single one said </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bomb was not a military necessity </v>

1014
00:46:54.861 --> 00:46:58.431
<v Speaker 1>and it did not need to happen for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrender that Japan was ready to </v>

1015
00:46:58.431 --> 00:46:59.680
<v Speaker 1>surrender because if you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like 100,000</v>

1016
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:04.700
<v Speaker 1>or maybe 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were incinerated in tokyo just </v>

1017
00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:04.700
<v Speaker 1>weeks prior with the fire bombing.</v>

1018
00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:09.410
<v Speaker 1>So the u s had already dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these bombs basically eviscerated </v>

1019
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:12.120
<v Speaker 1>tokyo and so countless people died way </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

1020
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:15.420
<v Speaker 1>People actually died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then in the initial atomic bomb drops.</v>

1021
00:47:15.421 --> 00:47:17.280
<v Speaker 1>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a really,</v>

1022
00:47:17.281 --> 00:47:22.281
<v Speaker 1>really unfortunate kind of thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetuated and people just still hold </v>

1023
00:47:22.281 --> 00:47:22.281
<v Speaker 1>onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1024
00:47:22.281 --> 00:47:23.130
<v Speaker 1>they say it would have saved lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1025
00:47:23.131 --> 00:47:26.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have saved us soldiers lives,</v>

1026
00:47:26.191 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 1>but instead it took like probably half a</v>
<v Speaker 1>million japanese.</v>

1027
00:47:30.011 --> 00:47:33.220
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the countless maimed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>radiation poisoning,</v>

1028
00:47:33.221 --> 00:47:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think like 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>died instantly and with the incineration</v>

1029
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.870
<v Speaker 1>was something that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awful.</v>

1030
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:44.980
<v Speaker 1>The only argument that could be said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it saved lives is that a kept other</v>

1031
00:47:44.981 --> 00:47:47.890
<v Speaker 1>people from using nuclear weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is so horrific.</v>

1032
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you look at all the war that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has taken place since 1947 and not one </v>

1033
00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.370
<v Speaker 1>person has used a nuclear bomb.</v>

1034
00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.120
<v Speaker 1>It could be argued that it was because </v>
<v Speaker 1>how horrific that was when it did happen</v>

1035
00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:03.630

<v Speaker 1>that we became one nation under god </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the comedy scare,</v>

1046
00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:33.570
<v Speaker 1>the 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really the mccarthy scares what led </v>

1047
00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:34.060
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To add that to the pledge of allegiance.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I pledge allegiance to the flag of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>

1049
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:42.880
<v Speaker 1>one nation indivisible for liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had one nation under god,</v>

1050
00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:43.660
<v Speaker 1>indivisible.</v>

1051
00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:48.660
<v Speaker 1>They had to add that to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to add that to it because of </v>

1052
00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:49.210
<v Speaker 1>the kami scare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's unreal.</v>

1053
00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.430
<v Speaker 1>So 19 fifties male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1054
00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before the mccarthy hearings,</v>

1055
00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:55.390
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have undergone.</v>

1056
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane,</v>

1057
00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:03.250
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about people that believe in </v>

1058

1061
00:49:04.751 --> 00:49:09.751
<v Speaker 1>Then I Just assume that they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>change it again to one nation under </v>

1062
00:49:09.751 --> 00:49:12.961

<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

1067
00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure if I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1068
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:23.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>don't know what happened though.</v>

1070
00:49:25.651 --> 00:49:27.520

<v Speaker 1>the jesse ventura thing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well he was a navy seal was before it </v>

1073
00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:35.750
<v Speaker 1>was thought they were both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't that.</v>

1074
00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.510
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't a navy seal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to be,</v>

1075
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:42.630
<v Speaker 1>it was something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was another name for like before </v>

1076

<v Speaker 1>so jesse ventura,</v>

1079
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:49.150

1081
00:49:50.891 --> 00:49:54.130
<v Speaker 1>He's really on point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

1082
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:57.280
<v Speaker 1>chris kyle was ever in a movie slack </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1084
00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he and chris kyle's book,</v>

1085
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:07.870
<v Speaker 1>it makes up this giant bar fight that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>like beat up jesse ventura.</v>

1086
00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:09.910
<v Speaker 1>And if you know who jesse ventura is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well he's an older gentleman too.</v>

1088
00:50:13.841 --> 00:50:17.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean born in 1951 I think because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1089
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:22.530
<v Speaker 1>But still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you're going to fucking go </v>

1090

<v Speaker 1>out there and say that you beat the shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of jesse ventura,</v>

1091
00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:25.630
<v Speaker 1>you like socked him in a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a might be a bad idea.</v>

1092
00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what happened.</v>

1093
00:50:26.831 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 1>He in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he</v>

1094
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:32.090
<v Speaker 4>wasn't referred to as jesse ventura.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was referred to a scruffy.</v>

1095
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:37.120
<v Speaker 4>He called them scruffy and he was saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this guy was some celebrity they'd </v>

1096
00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:40.320
<v Speaker 4>beat up because this guy had said </v>
<v Speaker 4>something bad about navy seals.</v>

1097
00:50:40.321 --> 00:50:43.160
<v Speaker 4>So chris kyle came along and socked him </v>
<v Speaker 4>for America.</v>

1098
00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:47.450
<v Speaker 4>He was a udt underwater demolition team </v>
<v Speaker 4>is the original seals.</v>

1099
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:52.550
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he said oN the opiod,</v>

1100
00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:55.550

<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

1101
00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.530
<v Speaker 4>chris kyle said that it was a jesse </v>
<v Speaker 4>ventura.</v>

1102
00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:01.790
<v Speaker 4>That's when he was goated into saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>who the guy was.</v>

1103
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:03.530

<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure.</v>

1104
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:08.180
<v Speaker 4>And I'm in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when jesse ventura said,</v>

1105
00:51:08.181 --> 00:51:10.970

1110
00:51:23.431 --> 00:51:28.121

1111
00:51:28.121 --> 00:51:30.320
<v Speaker 4>chris kyle the option to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to just to,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He's a murderer to another guy that </v>

1118
00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.690
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean murdered chris kyle for no </v>

1119
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:49.690
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Said ptsd.</v>

1120
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:50.570
<v Speaker 4>Shot him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shot the other guy that was with him,</v>

1121
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:52.880

<v Speaker 4>I mean he was fucked.</v>

1122
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:58.010
<v Speaker 4>War of that level of that scale </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously fucks people's head up.</v>

1123
00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:03.140
<v Speaker 4>And when he died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jesse ventura continued with the lawsuit</v>

1124
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:07.070
<v Speaker 4>and that's where he got criticized and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's you're assuming the widow and all</v>

1125
00:52:07.071 --> 00:52:12.071
<v Speaker 4>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they said he was suing the book </v>

1126
00:52:12.071 --> 00:52:12.071
<v Speaker 4>company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said he was.</v>

1127
00:52:12.071 --> 00:52:13.220
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm suing everybody that's profiting off</v>

1128
00:52:13.221 --> 00:52:17.810
<v Speaker 4>of this lie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that scully and his take on it was.</v>

1129
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:22.730
<v Speaker 4>PEople also should be aware of the truth</v>
<v Speaker 4>of what this guy not,</v>

1130
00:52:22.731 --> 00:52:24.890
<v Speaker 4>didn't just lie about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he lied.</v>

1131
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:27.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jesse ventura did several inteRviews.</v>

1132
00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:28.700
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about all the different </v>
<v Speaker 4>lies.</v>

1133
00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.390
<v Speaker 4>There's more than one line that book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1134
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:34.160
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that there aren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>heroes.</v>

1135
00:52:34.161 --> 00:52:36.020
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that the military is </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad.</v>

1136
00:52:36.021 --> 00:52:39.580
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that there aren't people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that genuinely go into the military like</v>

1137
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:42.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure your boyfriend did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking that they're going to do good,</v>

1138
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.080
<v Speaker 4>that they have these ideals that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to protect.</v>

1139
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:50.230
<v Speaker 4>They want to protect liberty and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe in the american way of life and </v>

1140
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:54.041
<v Speaker 4>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it all gets convoluted because you're </v>

1141
00:52:54.041 --> 00:52:56.170
<v Speaker 4>either with us or against us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're with us or again,</v>

1142
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:57.440
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

1143
00:52:57.441 --> 00:52:59.420
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not us.</v>

1144
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:04.510
<v Speaker 4>What you're doing is not as lies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't us murder's not us shooting </v>

1145
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:05.030
<v Speaker 4>looters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not us.</v>

1146
00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:07.730

<v Speaker 4>These decisions are not us.</v>

1147
00:53:07.731 --> 00:53:10.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean we have more in solidarity with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people in Iraq than we do it.</v>

1148
00:53:10.551 --> 00:53:12.470
<v Speaker 4>Like the elite that are making these </v>
<v Speaker 4>decisions.</v>

1149
00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:13.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1150
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:18.170
<v Speaker 4>the people that are complete neo-cons </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are complete chicken hawks that are</v>

1151
00:53:18.171 --> 00:53:22.040
<v Speaker 4>outside of the consequences of war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ones pulling the strings.</v>

1152
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:25.280
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's a big problem with </v>
<v Speaker 4>just the militarization,</v>

1153
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 4>our society</v>

1154
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.030
<v Speaker 2>where we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1155
00:53:27.031 --> 00:53:29.460
<v Speaker 2>every sports game has this giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>

1156
00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:35.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like drama thing going on where</v>
<v Speaker 2>we pay tax payer sponsored fucking </v>

1157
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:38.580
<v Speaker 2>fighter jets flying over the stadiums </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>

1158
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single thing is militarized.</v>

1159
00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're,</v>

1160
00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:47.450
<v Speaker 2>when we're conditioned in this way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>glorify the military so much that it </v>

1161
00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:51.891
<v Speaker 2>becomes an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're at the helm of </v>

1162
00:53:51.891 --> 00:53:53.691
<v Speaker 2>the empire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thAt is the largest military force in </v>

1163
00:53:53.691 --> 00:53:53.691
<v Speaker 2>the world that's consolidated like </v>
<v Speaker 2>military super power.</v>

1164
00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:59.240
<v Speaker 2>That's the only solution to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bola sending the fucking military </v>

1165
00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.660
<v Speaker 2>isis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's bomb them.</v>

1166
00:54:00.661 --> 00:54:04.710
<v Speaker 2>More riots in the streets or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1167
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:10.010
<v Speaker 2>sending the fucking militarize riot cops</v>
<v Speaker 2>who just got trained next to israeli </v>

1168
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.320
<v Speaker 2>troops in Bahrain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1169
00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:15.980
<v Speaker 2>good god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we need to start really removing </v>

1170
00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:15.980
<v Speaker 2>ourselves with this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>militaristic,</v>

1171
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>characterization of our society because </v>

1172
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:22.400
<v Speaker 2>it's really fucking toxic man.</v>

1173
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:26.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also it creates military problems </v>

1174
00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.980
<v Speaker 3>abroad because the rest of the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>identifies us with that as well.</v>

1175
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:30.530
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're doing shit like what we've done</v>

1176
00:54:30.531 --> 00:54:34.640
<v Speaker 3>in the Iraq war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which whatever the number is,</v>

1177
00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:39.880
<v Speaker 3>whether it's sam harris is number one </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he adheres to or whether it's the </v>

1178
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.750
<v Speaker 3>one of the far left adheres to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking people,</v>

1179
00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:46.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of fucking people died and that </v>

1180
00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:46.790
<v Speaker 3>those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it creates without a doubt,</v>

1181
00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:51.940
<v Speaker 3>martyrs and it creates without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>support for the opposition because we </v>

1182
00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:56.560
<v Speaker 3>were looked at in other parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world as the dark empire and also if </v>

1183
00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:57.860
<v Speaker 3>they're muslim and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1184
00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:03.140
<v Speaker 3>they support muslim ideals and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>see that these people who are have a </v>

1185
00:55:03.921 --> 00:55:08.030
<v Speaker 3>completely different faith or attacking </v>
<v Speaker 3>and invading their homeland,</v>

1186
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:11.360
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty easy to support that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they,</v>

1187
00:55:11.361 --> 00:55:13.220
<v Speaker 3>it Just piles on and next thing you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1188
00:55:13.221 --> 00:55:18.221
<v Speaker 3>we got a problem and we got a current </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem and we have a past problem and </v>

1189
00:55:18.221 --> 00:55:22.061
<v Speaker 3>we've got a future problem and we have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>military industrial complex that's just </v>

1190
00:55:22.061 --> 00:55:26.411
<v Speaker 3>fucking rakesh and allows problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>because problems means we may get to </v>

1191
00:55:26.411 --> 00:55:28.460
<v Speaker 3>make more missiles and more missiles </v>
<v Speaker 3>means mum.</v>

1192
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Money keeps going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean money,</v>

1193
00:55:30.611 --> 00:55:35.611
<v Speaker 3>more problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see the hunter s thompson </v>

1194
00:55:35.611 --> 00:55:35.900
<v Speaker 3>documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1195
00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:39.320
<v Speaker 3>IT's a gonzo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was called.</v>

1196
00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:40.360
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1197
00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:42.260
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

1198
00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:47.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a great documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the best parts about it was </v>

1199
00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.840
<v Speaker 3>mcgovern when he was recounting his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his days with,</v>

1200
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:54.910
<v Speaker 3>with hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when hunter was writing that fear and </v>

1201
00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:57.811
<v Speaker 3>loading on the campaign trail and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>followed around the press corps for a </v>

1202
00:55:57.811 --> 00:55:58.250
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then wrote that book,</v>

1203
00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:03.670
<v Speaker 3>but mcgovern was just talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just sick and tired of old men in</v>

1204
00:56:05.451 --> 00:56:10.451
<v Speaker 3>air conditioned buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making decisions that are to send young </v>

1205
00:56:10.491 --> 00:56:15.491
<v Speaker 3>men off to war and I'll just never </v>
<v Speaker 3>forget the way he was saying that.</v>

1206
00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:16.520
<v Speaker 3>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you knoW,</v>

1207
00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:19.750
<v Speaker 3>mcgovern when he was doing that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1208
00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:22.580
<v Speaker 3>he was an old guy when they were doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that documentary.</v>

1209
00:56:22.581 --> 00:56:25.510
<v Speaker 3>He died 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was,</v>

1210
00:56:25.511 --> 00:56:29.310
<v Speaker 3>he was old when they were doing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary and he was just saying,</v>

1211
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:31.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm just tired of it.</v>

1212
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:36.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he died very shortly after that </v>

1213
00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:36.970
<v Speaker 3>documentary was made some of the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>days of his life.</v>

1214
00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:42.450
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he ran for president and was the </v>

1215
00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:44.350
<v Speaker 3>seventies [inaudible] 72,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think 70,</v>

1216
00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:45.490
<v Speaker 3>72,</v>
<v Speaker 3>72,</v>

1217
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:52.800
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was during the Vietnam war and </v>

1218
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 3>just that kind of voice and he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>win.</v>

1219
00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:01.120
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons why I didn't win is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because his vice presidential candidate </v>

1220
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:01.300
<v Speaker 3>turned out that he had undergone shock </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy,</v>

1221
00:57:01.301 --> 00:57:04.150
<v Speaker 3>electrical shock therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kind of hid that from everybody.</v>

1222
00:57:04.151 --> 00:57:06.370
<v Speaker 3>And it came out during the campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was ahead.</v>

1223
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.430
<v Speaker 3>Mcgovern was a head and part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason why he was ahead,</v>

1224
00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:14.440
<v Speaker 3>it was because hunter was supporting </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and hunter was writing for the </v>

1225
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:14.440
<v Speaker 3>rolling stone and he would write crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1226
00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:19.441
<v Speaker 3>like that was where he wrote about ed </v>
<v Speaker 3>muskie who was also running for </v>

1227
00:57:19.441 --> 00:57:23.401
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was saying that ed muskie was </v>

1228
00:57:23.401 --> 00:57:24.210
<v Speaker 3>bringing in brazilian doctors and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were treating him for his ibogaine.</v>

1229
00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:24.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Addiction.</v>

1230
00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:30.100
<v Speaker 4>I've been addicted to ibogaine scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one even kneW what it was back then.</v>

1231
00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:36.330
<v Speaker 4>Ed muskie was clearly exhibiting signs </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was really funny because they </v>

1232
00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:39.310
<v Speaker 4>interviewed hunter on one of these in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the documentary.</v>

1233
00:57:39.311 --> 00:57:40.940
<v Speaker 4>He's on one of these talk shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes wearing,</v>

1234
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:45.950
<v Speaker 4>well there was a rumor that a ed muskie </v>
<v Speaker 4>was addicted to ibogaine and I started </v>

1235
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:50.821
<v Speaker 4>the rumor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was at journalist,</v>

1236
00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.760
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was a journalist,</v>

1237
00:57:54.761 --> 00:57:57.640
<v Speaker 4>but he was also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was writing fiction but easily like I</v>

1238
00:57:57.641 --> 00:58:00.360
<v Speaker 4>thought everybody knew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody knew it was bullshit.</v>

1239
00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.100
<v Speaker 4>He's my favorite of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's one of my favorite people that ever</v>

1240
00:58:06.101 --> 00:58:08.560
<v Speaker 4>lived and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just,</v>

1241
00:58:08.561 --> 00:58:10.780
<v Speaker 4>he knew it was bullshit and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he thought it was.</v>

1242
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:15.800
<v Speaker 4>Other people knew it was bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he also knew that he could make an </v>

1243
00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.301
<v Speaker 4>impact with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he thought that he thought that </v>

1244
00:58:18.301 --> 00:58:18.430
<v Speaker 4>muskie was just fucking ridiculous hack.</v>

1245
00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:23.640
<v Speaker 4>So he just mocked him and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and talked about him being under the </v>

1246
00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:26.940
<v Speaker 4>throes of this addiction that they had </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought in this brazilian doctor and,</v>

1247
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:32.600
<v Speaker 4>and then musky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like have these breakdowns on the </v>

1248
00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:32.600
<v Speaker 4>campaign trail because he was dealing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

1249
00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:37.340
<v Speaker 4>Because nobody had ever dealt with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of negativity from the press </v>

1250
00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:41.131
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody ever running for president had </v>

1251
00:58:41.131 --> 00:58:41.770
<v Speaker 4>dealt with just someone fabricating </v>
<v Speaker 4>craziness about them.</v>

1252
00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:44.110
<v Speaker 4>And it's the pressure of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could tell he wasn't.</v>

1253
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:49.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know where to start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you run for president and you don't </v>

1254
00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:52.591
<v Speaker 4>have a thick skin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can't deal with people getting </v>

1255
00:58:52.591 --> 00:58:54.781
<v Speaker 4>mad at you on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making shit up about you and the huff </v>

1256
00:58:54.781 --> 00:58:54.781
<v Speaker 4>post or whatever they would want to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1257
00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.290
<v Speaker 4>You really shouldn't be running for </v>
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>

1258
00:58:56.291 --> 00:58:58.570
<v Speaker 4>You have to develop some sort of rhinos </v>
<v Speaker 4>scan at this point,</v>

1259
00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:00.520

1261
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.000
<v Speaker 4>There's only been a few presidents that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were on tv and they don't have the </v>

1262
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:08.000
<v Speaker 4>billion dollar campaigns where they're </v>

01:00:09.761 --> 01:00:11.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean I would definitely do it if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to do it,</v>

1287
01:00:11.571 --> 01:00:16.571
<v Speaker 4>but it wouldn't pursue it and if I.</v>

<v Speaker 4>ever get out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what you.</v>

<v Speaker 4>enemies if you really went for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that is the last person in the </v>

1293
01:00:30.641 --> 01:00:32.750
<v Speaker 4>world you want to like put a.</v>

1294
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:36.410
<v Speaker 4>You want to put you in a book or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>category,</v>

1295
01:00:36.411 --> 01:00:37.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is.</v>

1296
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:42.440
<v Speaker 4>he's on the fuck with lists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I traveled too much in the world.</v>

1297
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:48.250
<v Speaker 4>arguably right up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The most powerful figurehead in the </v>

1298
01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:48.530
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if not the most powerful.</v>

1299
01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.920
<v Speaker 4>Certainly top four or five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just thought of something really fucking</v>

1300
01:00:51.921 --> 01:00:54.590
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bomb that we stopped being an atomic</v>

1301
01:00:54.591 --> 01:00:57.170
<v Speaker 4>bomb that those obviously dropped on </v>
<v Speaker 4>hiroshima and nagasaki.</v>

1302
01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.920
<v Speaker 4>We have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's Like fucking babysit.</v>

1303
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:01.280
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hydrogen?</v>

1304
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:04.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thirty 300 times stronger.</v>

1305
01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:06.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even understand.</v>

1306
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:09.020
<v Speaker 4>Thirty $300.</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would that even do?</v>

1307
01:01:09.021 --> 01:01:11.650
<v Speaker 4>Like picture what we just saw exploding </v>
<v Speaker 4>that little battleship.</v>

1308
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:13.110
<v Speaker 4>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1309
01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.530
<v Speaker 4>how do we have that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1310
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:16.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1311
01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:20.220
<v Speaker 4>I guess we want to kill better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Better at it.</v>

1312
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.260
<v Speaker 4>The more fucked up is the research </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've done into anti-matter weapons.</v>

1313
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:26.090
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really crazy.</v>

1314
01:01:26.091 --> 01:01:28.250
<v Speaker 4>Because we don't know whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the.</v>

1315
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:31.640
<v Speaker 4>This is just theoretical guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bring me one of them.</v>

1316
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.480
<v Speaker 4>Alcohol beverages to young jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1317
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:39.730
<v Speaker 4>we don't know whether or not it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>theoretical or whether this is actually </v>

1318
01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:43.301
<v Speaker 4>a proof of concept.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether anti-matter can be developed </v>

1319
01:01:43.301 --> 01:01:46.301
<v Speaker 4>into a weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do know there's research being done </v>

1320
01:01:46.301 --> 01:01:46.910
<v Speaker 4>on it and when they do develop </v>
<v Speaker 4>anti-matter research,</v>

1321
01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:49.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean when they do develop anti-matter </v>
<v Speaker 4>weapons,</v>

1322
01:01:49.131 --> 01:01:51.170
<v Speaker 4>whether it's in our lifetime or in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>future lifetimes,</v>

1323
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:54.530
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about a world destroyer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about something they might</v>

1324
01:01:54.531 --> 01:01:56.990
<v Speaker 4>just shoot over at pluto like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1325
01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:02.120
<v Speaker 4>it'll take nine years and we'll watch </v>
<v Speaker 4>pluto blow up from the sky just to see </v>

1326
01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.230
<v Speaker 4>if we can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's very possible.</v>

1327
01:02:03.231 --> 01:02:08.231
<v Speaker 4>They might do that someday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just decided to launch it in some </v>

1328
01:02:08.231 --> 01:02:08.231
<v Speaker 4>fucking planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1329
01:02:08.231 --> 01:02:12.580
<v Speaker 4>do you know that that's your </v>
<v Speaker 4>justification for continuing the </v>

1330
01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.420
<v Speaker 4>trillion dollars that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>spend just updating and refurbishing the</v>

1331
01:02:14.421 --> 01:02:19.421
<v Speaker 4>nuclear arsenal is that they keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>doubling down on the fucking star wars </v>

1332
01:02:19.421 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 4>fantasy that reagan had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gorbachev went</v>

1333
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.480
<v Speaker 2>to reagan and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's disarm.</v>

1334
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Let's fucking end it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And reagan was like,</v>

1335
01:02:23.611 --> 01:02:28.611
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm senile and I want to create this </v>

1336
01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:28.611
<v Speaker 2>giant star wars program that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1337
01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:33.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the shield and the sky and we're </v>

1338
01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:33.170
<v Speaker 2>going to do this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone was like,</v>

1339
01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:33.170
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never going to fucking work.</v>

1340
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:38.180
<v Speaker 2>And of course it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's still like a dress of </v>

1341
01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.590
<v Speaker 2>vacation to battle asteroids to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these nuclear weapons here and continued</v>

1342
01:02:39.591 --> 01:02:40.050
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1343
01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:42.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Video game,</v>

1344
01:02:42.381 --> 01:02:47.381
<v Speaker 4>asteroids out when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say that if you do blow up an </v>

1345
01:02:47.991 --> 01:02:51.050
<v Speaker 4>asteroid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real issue is you're going to create</v>

1346
01:02:51.051 --> 01:02:53.780
<v Speaker 4>more asteroids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just mass.</v>

1347
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:55.260
<v Speaker 4>Like you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>

1348
01:02:55.261 --> 01:02:57.740
<v Speaker 4>you have something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't relate it.</v>

1349
01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.040
<v Speaker 4>If you have something that has masked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's five miles across,</v>

1350
01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:03.380
<v Speaker 4>you're going to develop a 100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1351
01:03:03.381 --> 01:03:08.381
<v Speaker 4>half mile ones or whatever you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or 500 yard ones and they're going to </v>

1352
01:03:08.381 --> 01:03:08.960
<v Speaker 4>kill everybody to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to come down.</v>

1353
01:03:08.961 --> 01:03:11.930
<v Speaker 4>It's going to rain metal and rock from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the sky.</v>

1354
01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:14.660
<v Speaker 4>Do you mean people that don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 4>an asteroid is?</v>

1355
01:03:14.661 --> 01:03:17.120
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them are iron.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're metal,</v>

1356
01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:21.080
<v Speaker 4>they're just giant chunks of metal and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you fucking space.</v>

1357
01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:24.540
<v Speaker 4>It's a trip where here's a great theory </v>
<v Speaker 4>for her.</v>

1358
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:26.510
<v Speaker 4>Great conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is actually true.</v>

1359
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:28.330
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go ahead.</v>

1360
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:29.370
<v Speaker 4>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1361
01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:30.330
<v Speaker 4>we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go ahead.</v>

1362
01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:34.310
<v Speaker 4>Just do your p and we'll have jamie pull</v>
<v Speaker 4>this up to pull up.</v>

1363
01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:39.700
<v Speaker 4>I want you to pull up this star wars </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists that have been killed,</v>

1364
01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:45.940
<v Speaker 4>star wars scientists that have either </v>
<v Speaker 4>been murdered or committed suicide </v>

1365
01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:49.640
<v Speaker 4>because what's really fascinating about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the star wars program,</v>

1366
01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.520
<v Speaker 4>and I'll have to at least slightly </v>
<v Speaker 4>reiterate this,</v>

1367
01:03:52.521 --> 01:03:57.521
<v Speaker 4>when young abby martin gets back because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think she was completely aware </v>

1368
01:03:57.521 --> 01:04:02.501
<v Speaker 4>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when the star wars weapons defense </v>

1369
01:04:02.691 --> 01:04:07.310
<v Speaker 4>system was created,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea behind it was the United States</v>

1370
01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:12.311
<v Speaker 4>was going to create a military.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were going to create some sort of a</v>

1371
01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:17.620
<v Speaker 4>military solution with satellites that </v>
<v Speaker 4>could shoot these missiles out of the </v>

1372
01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:21.080
<v Speaker 4>sky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now while they were doing it,</v>

1373
01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:26.140
<v Speaker 4>they were spending fuck loads of money </v>
<v Speaker 4>on this and apparently it was never </v>

1374
01:04:26.421 --> 01:04:30.770
<v Speaker 4>effective and if you could pull up the </v>
<v Speaker 4>numbers,</v>

01:04:30.771 --> 01:04:33.500
<v Speaker 4>just pull up like there's a list of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the star wars.</v>

1376
01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:36.740
<v Speaker 4>See if he could find a better article.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See like that.</v>

1377
01:04:36.741 --> 01:04:39.450
<v Speaker 4>Who killed all the star wars scientists </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1378
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:44.150
<v Speaker 4>See if you could find out who go to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a rent is rents legit.</v>

1379

<v Speaker 4>Ariana see isn't like a super conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 4>website,</v>

1380
01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:52.550
<v Speaker 4>mysterious deaths of scientists like </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists killed,</v>

1381
01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:55.790
<v Speaker 4>star wars scientist murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>killed,</v>

1382
01:04:57.270 --> 01:05:00.830
<v Speaker 4>but a giant number of them have all been</v>

1386
01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:17.830
<v Speaker 4>because there's so many fucking goofy </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy theory websites that lumped a</v>

1387
01:05:18.461 --> 01:05:22.240
<v Speaker 4>star wars people in with um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chem trails.</v>

1388
01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:25.750
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the star wars program,</v>

1389
01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:31.060
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the theory being the star wars program </v>

1390
01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.601
<v Speaker 4>has apparently never really effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the scientists that were behind the </v>

1391
01:05:33.601 --> 01:05:38.491
<v Speaker 4>star wars program,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fuck load of them died by suicide,</v>

1392
01:05:39.131 --> 01:05:44.131
<v Speaker 4>by murder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a giant list of them and </v>

1393
01:05:44.131 --> 01:05:44.980
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the most fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracies,</v>

1394
01:05:45.010 --> 01:05:47.350
<v Speaker 4>modern time to find it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1396
01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:53.020
<v Speaker 4>these guys that knew the people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>knew the scientists,</v>

1397
01:05:53.021 --> 01:05:56.110
<v Speaker 4>the engineers dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like almost all of them,</v>

1398
01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:00.730
<v Speaker 4>they all died like murdered suicide and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like very,</v>

1399
01:06:00.731 --> 01:06:02.710
<v Speaker 4>very suspicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And someone did like a number,</v>

1400
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:03.450
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they did like a percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what are the odds that all these </v>

1402
01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:08.800
<v Speaker 4>people were murdered inside of billion </v>

1405
01:06:14.191 --> 01:06:14.191
<v Speaker 4>star wars program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd spend millions,</v>

1406
01:06:14.191 --> 01:06:18.721
<v Speaker 4>untold billions of dollars to develop </v>
<v Speaker 4>this completely ineffective system to </v>

1407
01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:21.880
<v Speaker 4>shoot missiles at a sky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was never proven to work ever.</v>

1408
01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:25.660
<v Speaker 4>And those scientists are all dead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>

1409
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:27.880
<v Speaker 4>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dead scientists.</v>

1410
01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:32.930
<v Speaker 4>And look at us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the list mark coney scientists </v>

1474
01:09:28.941 --> 01:09:33.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's abandoning like a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar career to go fight him because he</v>

1475
01:09:33.231 --> 01:09:38.231
<v Speaker 2>really believed it and he's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking smart and he realized that it </v>

1476
01:09:38.231 --> 01:09:41.921
<v Speaker 2>was based on lies and shit and he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>this diary and it's an incredible </v>

1477
01:09:41.921 --> 01:09:45.551
<v Speaker 2>documentary that just talks about his </v>
<v Speaker 2>transition and people who knew him and </v>

1478
01:09:45.551 --> 01:09:49.571
<v Speaker 2>when he was changing his mind and he had</v>
<v Speaker 2>this diary all written up and they </v>

1479
01:09:49.571 --> 01:09:49.571
<v Speaker 2>fucking burned it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

1480
01:09:49.571 --> 01:09:50.870
<v Speaker 2>when they killed him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they did,</v>

1481
01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:53.180
<v Speaker 2>they say it was friendly fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

1482
01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.220
<v Speaker 2>But his brother thinks that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>targeted.</v>

1483
01:09:55.221 --> 01:10:00.221
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he definitely would have come out </v>

1484
01:10:00.221 --> 01:10:00.221
<v Speaker 2>and been like another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like chomsky,</v>

1485
01:10:00.221 --> 01:10:02.060
<v Speaker 2>like he would have come out and said he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have been a figurehead against the</v>

1486
01:10:02.061 --> 01:10:06.320
<v Speaker 2>war and he died from friendly fire and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they burned all of his shit.</v>

1487
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:10.640
<v Speaker 2>They burned his diary so we could set </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is fucking crazy.</v>

1488
01:10:10.890 --> 01:10:12.260
<v Speaker 2>And then look at the Jessica Lynch </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1489
01:10:12.261 --> 01:10:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Remember her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1490
01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:16.030
<v Speaker 2>And they said she was raped and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden then she was like,</v>

1491
01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:21.040
<v Speaker 2>the rocky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like military was like helping her just </v>

1492
01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:21.040
<v Speaker 2>put it on in a hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like taking care of her,</v>

1493
01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.540
<v Speaker 2>then they've staged that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

1494
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:28.390
<v Speaker 4>the narrative was that she was trapped </v>
<v Speaker 4>and she was being kidnapped by the </v>

1495
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:31.250
<v Speaker 4>iraqis and that the United States </v>
<v Speaker 4>military went in and rescued her and she</v>

1496
01:10:31.251 --> 01:10:33.740
<v Speaker 4>was his hero and she was paraded around </v>
<v Speaker 4>on television,</v>

1497
01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:39.100
<v Speaker 4>but she spoke out against it and she got</v>
<v Speaker 4>death threats and she essentially </v>

1498
01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:42.710
<v Speaker 4>vanished and she just went quiet on it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they never talked to her again.</v>

1499
01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.630
<v Speaker 4>It's so sad too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they chose her.</v>

1500
01:10:44.631 --> 01:10:49.631
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to prop you up as this </v>

1501
01:10:49.631 --> 01:10:49.631
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

1502
01:10:49.631 --> 01:10:49.631
<v Speaker 4>what are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She just got swept up in it.</v>

1503
01:10:49.631 --> 01:10:52.460
<v Speaker 4>It's just so crazy the idea that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>would just do that to someone and,</v>

1504
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:57.550
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and force them into some sort of a </v>

1505
01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:57.550
<v Speaker 4>situation like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1506
01:10:57.550 --> 01:11:00.680
<v Speaker 4>I just don't understand why they would </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that you would just play along.</v>

1507
01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:05.920
<v Speaker 4>I guess they just assume like we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>goiNg to kill people or they're telling </v>

1508
01:11:06.351 --> 01:11:07.700
<v Speaker 4>you to do this or telling you to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1509
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
<v Speaker 4>And it was one of the first times that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we had women in active duty two and you </v>

1510
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:13.000
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1511
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.250
<v Speaker 4>in combat duty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1512
01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.530
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1513
01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:17.280
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just not a lot of.</v>

1514
01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:18.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>

1515
01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:23.860
<v Speaker 3>when you're dealing with death and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with what you would call </v>

1516
01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:25.290
<v Speaker 3>a sanctioned murder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1517
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:30.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're in the military and you are </v>

1518
01:11:30.751 --> 01:11:33.720
<v Speaker 3>supposed to go over there and shoot some</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad guys,</v>

1519
01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:36.360
<v Speaker 3>whether they're good or bad guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go murder those people.</v>

1520
01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.670
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sanctioned murder and it's one of</v>

1521
01:11:38.671 --> 01:11:42.960
<v Speaker 3>the weirdest things about civilization </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we salute sanctioned murder.</v>

1522
01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:46.470
<v Speaker 3>Murder is awful when you don't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone and you killed them.</v>

1523
01:11:46.471 --> 01:11:51.471
<v Speaker 3>We want to lock you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we tell you you can kill someone </v>

1524
01:11:51.471 --> 01:11:53.040
<v Speaker 3>as long as it's written down on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we all collectively agree,</v>

1525
01:11:53.290 --> 01:11:58.290
<v Speaker 3>but we don't really collectively agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where it gets weird as a small </v>

1526
01:11:58.290 --> 01:12:02.000
<v Speaker 3>group of people that decide who you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>and can't kill and then everybody else </v>

1527
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:02.200
<v Speaker 3>has to fall in line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1528
01:12:02.210 --> 01:12:07.210
<v Speaker 3>if those people were beyond reproach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they were these incredibly </v>

1529
01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:10.461
<v Speaker 3>enlightened people that had only our </v>
<v Speaker 3>best wishes and hopes in mind and could,</v>

1530
01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:16.940
<v Speaker 3>could not make a bad decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it makes sense to just give </v>

1531
01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:16.940
<v Speaker 3>into them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're smarter than us.</v>

1532
01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.150
<v Speaker 3>We're the ants and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the,</v>

1533
01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.250
<v Speaker 3>they're the geniuses and we'll just </v>
<v Speaker 3>follow along.</v>

1534
01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:21.960
<v Speaker 3>But that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never been there.</v>

1535
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:27.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing that bothers me about the </v>

1536
01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.641
<v Speaker 2>obama administration is that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's famed as this like transparency </v>

1537
01:12:29.641 --> 01:12:30.220
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1538
01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:35.221
<v Speaker 2>we talked about the whistleblower thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything is the opposite of </v>

1539
01:12:35.221 --> 01:12:35.221
<v Speaker 2>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this,</v>

1540
01:12:35.221 --> 01:12:38.491
<v Speaker 2>our wellington new era where you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nsa's spying now,</v>

1541
01:12:38.831 --> 01:12:42.370
<v Speaker 2>like the patriot act sunsetted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think that the patriot acts over.</v>

1542
01:12:42.371 --> 01:12:47.371
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just that the clause that they </v>

1543
01:12:47.371 --> 01:12:48.760
<v Speaker 2>were able to illegally spinus through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nsa in the patriot act expired,</v>

1544
01:12:48.761 --> 01:12:53.761
<v Speaker 2>and then they just passed a new law to </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically codified legal spine just </v>

1545
01:12:53.761 --> 01:12:55.090
<v Speaker 2>through another caveat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called the freedom act,</v>

1546
01:12:55.630 --> 01:12:56.060
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

1547
01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:05.380
<v Speaker 3>and you can't vote against the patriot </v>
<v Speaker 3>act either because the name is just </v>

1548
01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:05.380
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1549
01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:06.170
<v Speaker 3>You're not a patriot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't like freedom,</v>

1550
01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.020
<v Speaker 3>but you don't want to answer not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not freedom.</v>

1551
01:13:09.130 --> 01:13:09.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>

1552
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:11.780
<v Speaker 3>Who do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want death,</v>

1553
01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.100
<v Speaker 3>what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Destruction.</v>

1554
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.680
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1555
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:18.710
<v Speaker 2>the prisoner to pass the freedom act </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1556
01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:20.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course we'd been torturing people.</v>

1557
01:13:20.581 --> 01:13:25.581
<v Speaker 2>There's been wars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been extrajudicial </v>

1558
01:13:25.581 --> 01:13:27.530
<v Speaker 2>assassinations but never before has it </v>
<v Speaker 2>been like openly codified and like </v>

1559
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:29.670
<v Speaker 2>legislated executively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1560
01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:34.671
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost this weird era of </v>
<v Speaker 2>normalization and conditioning where </v>

1561
01:13:34.671 --> 01:13:38.121
<v Speaker 2>people just accept this as a new normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the empire and just the post nine </v>

1562
01:13:38.121 --> 01:13:40.050
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just do these thiNgs now and it's all</v>

1563
01:13:40.051 --> 01:13:40.860
<v Speaker 2>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1564
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:44.160
<v Speaker 2>It's illegal because we've created all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these legal caveats to do them.</v>

1565
01:13:44.161 --> 01:13:46.980
<v Speaker 2>So what is legal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when it gets weird.</v>

1566
01:13:46.981 --> 01:13:49.400
<v Speaker 2>It's just like what is legal and what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not legal?</v>

1567
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:55.090
<v Speaker 2>They write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's legal tender pentagram just issued </v>

1568
01:13:55.090 --> 01:13:56.490
<v Speaker 2>this field manual to basically for all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the branches in the military and in it.</v>

1569
01:13:56.491 --> 01:14:01.491
<v Speaker 2>I guess because citizen journalism is on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rise and it's really hard to </v>

1570
01:14:01.491 --> 01:14:02.830
<v Speaker 2>distinguish like who is like an official</v>
<v Speaker 2>established journalist are not are who's</v>

1571
01:14:02.831 --> 01:14:07.831
<v Speaker 2>like embedded with the enemy and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically said that journalists can be </v>

1572
01:14:07.831 --> 01:14:10.020
<v Speaker 2>killed legally now by a us military </v>
<v Speaker 2>personnel.</v>

1573
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:11.890
<v Speaker 2>That crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1574
01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:13.530
<v Speaker 2>That's in the new pentagon arms.</v>

1575
01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:19.130
<v Speaker 4>Well that was one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened during the obama obama </v>

1576
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:22.251
<v Speaker 4>administration that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they started at assassinating </v>

1577
01:14:22.251 --> 01:14:22.650
<v Speaker 4>american citizens without trial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1578
01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:24.630
<v Speaker 4>if they were to due process and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1579
01:14:24.631 --> 01:14:27.000
<v Speaker 4>the rule of law and as long as you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>over there though,</v>

1580
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:29.310
<v Speaker 4>they can just assassinate you drone </v>
<v Speaker 4>strikes.</v>

1581
01:14:29.311 --> 01:14:30.840
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is this?</v>

1582
01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.360
<v Speaker 4>It's I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

1583
01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:38.450
<v Speaker 4>If they're absolutely honest and beyond </v>
<v Speaker 4>reproach and the most enlightened beings</v>

1584
01:14:38.851 --> 01:14:41.100
<v Speaker 4>in the world that are dictating what </v>
<v Speaker 4>these actions would be.</v>

1585
01:14:41.101 --> 01:14:46.101
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you have some fucking hitler </v>
<v Speaker 4>character over there and you want to </v>

1586
01:14:46.101 --> 01:14:46.101
<v Speaker 4>assassinate him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

1587
01:14:46.101 --> 01:14:46.860
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1588
01:14:46.861 --> 01:14:50.770
<v Speaker 4>you want to us in the loop and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1589
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.400
<v Speaker 4>this guy's hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>two point.</v>

1590
01:14:53.401 --> 01:14:56.450
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is black and classified Mrs.</v>

1591
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:57.120
<v Speaker 4>Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't.</v>

1592
01:14:57.121 --> 01:15:02.121
<v Speaker 4>You work for Russia when you boot on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ground that continues as a tax against </v>

1593
01:15:04.381 --> 01:15:05.340
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like john,</v>

1594
01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:10.580
<v Speaker 4>he's barely paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had his aide do that while you're </v>

1595
01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:10.580
<v Speaker 4>still in the middle of poker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1596
01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:12.150
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't know how to tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably barely.</v>

1597
01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:13.650
<v Speaker 4>Seaweeds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think he tweets?</v>

1598
01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:15.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think obama tweet either.</v>

1599

<v Speaker 4>Smiley face.</v>

1602
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:31.500

1606
01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:43.260
<v Speaker 4>Everybody would dissect it forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When They look back at us in the future,</v>

1607
01:15:43.261 --> 01:15:44.100
<v Speaker 4>when they,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1610
01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:52.890

<v Speaker 4>looking at these people that were </v>

1611

<v Speaker 4>When is that going to not be the case?</v>

1615
01:15:59.650 --> 01:16:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's just in,</v>

1621
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:16.750
<v Speaker 2>in the realm Of reality television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to empathize with like this</v>

1622
01:16:16.751 --> 01:16:21.751
<v Speaker 2>fat lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really we're just watching like a </v>

<v Speaker 2>giant whale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live her life and,</v>

1624
01:16:21.751 --> 01:16:24.800

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.280
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's evolved through technology but it's</v>

1629
01:16:36.281 --> 01:16:39.610
<v Speaker 2>still that weird innate human trait that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really understand.</v>

1630
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:42.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1642
01:17:17.121 --> 01:17:21.890
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what what it is about human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings that when everything is great and</v>

<v Speaker 4>we just start getting really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>strange.</v>

01:17:36.471 --> 01:17:38.450
<v Speaker 4>my strange addiction one is like almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:42.260
<v Speaker 4>well having worked in reality tv and </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing how much of it is bullshit,</v>

1649
01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.640
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does that work?</v>

1650
01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.870
<v Speaker 4>Because it just super shit will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>even when,</v>

1651
01:17:45.871 --> 01:17:50.871
<v Speaker 4>when I did that saifai show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they fucking just fake things like your </v>

1652
01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:51.350
<v Speaker 4>reaction shots and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always wonder if you're like,</v>

1653
01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:56.440
<v Speaker 4>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they definitely edit things and put </v>

1654
01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:56.440
<v Speaker 4>certain reaction things where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

1655
01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:01.000
<v Speaker 4>where they didn't belong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To just have to face the way he's </v>

1656
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.430
<v Speaker 4>looking at what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was one where they did without a </v>

1657
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:07.080
<v Speaker 4>sci fi show that I did where they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a thing that people believe in </v>

1658
01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:10.160
<v Speaker 4>called sky quakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is probably bullshit,</v>

1659
01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:12.440
<v Speaker 4>most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sounds from the sky,</v>

1660
01:18:12.441 --> 01:18:17.441
<v Speaker 4>like a crazy like horns and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out what these sounds </v>

1661
01:18:17.441 --> 01:18:17.570
<v Speaker 4>were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1662
01:18:17.571 --> 01:18:20.960
<v Speaker 4>they took a video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is one guy sending this video where</v>

1663
01:18:20.961 --> 01:18:22.340
<v Speaker 4>he was just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was actually,</v>

1664
01:18:22.341 --> 01:18:24.980
<v Speaker 4>it's really hilarious because the one </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy that they put the video,</v>

1665
01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:30.220
<v Speaker 4>he was like a chem trail believer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he believes in a different kind of </v>

1666
01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:34.301
<v Speaker 4>bull shit and he was pointing at the sky</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we kind of mocked him for his camp </v>

1667
01:18:34.301 --> 01:18:36.200
<v Speaker 4>trail beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then these fucking dummies that made</v>

1668
01:18:36.201 --> 01:18:41.201
<v Speaker 4>the show that the editors took a chunk </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this guy's video and then added some </v>

1669
01:18:41.361 --> 01:18:46.361
<v Speaker 4>sound to it and then put it on the show </v>
<v Speaker 4>and said that he was pointing to a sky </v>

1670
01:18:46.361 --> 01:18:46.970
<v Speaker 4>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he wasn't.</v>

1671
01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:50.480
<v Speaker 4>it was just fate and I found out about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1672
01:18:50.481 --> 01:18:53.330
<v Speaker 4>I freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had them remove it from the show,</v>

1673
01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:58.420
<v Speaker 4>but it aired the first time it aired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was on the show and then after it </v>

1674
01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:00.680
<v Speaker 4>aired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they aired it for a second time,</v>

1675
01:19:00.681 --> 01:19:02.210
<v Speaker 4>they removed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So disingenuous.</v>

1676
01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:05.000
<v Speaker 4>That's what they do and that's what they</v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

1677
01:19:05.001 --> 01:19:10.001
<v Speaker 4>That's what those shows are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those shows are just bullshit and most </v>

1678
01:19:10.001 --> 01:19:12.311
<v Speaker 4>of those shows are bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And saifai at the time had a ton of </v>

1679
01:19:12.311 --> 01:19:15.971
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was one show that was all about a </v>

1680
01:19:15.971 --> 01:19:19.180
<v Speaker 4>family that was trapped in a house in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Maine because there was werewolf's </v>

1684
01:19:29.610 --> 01:19:33.131
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was covenant for just making </v>

1685
01:19:33.131 --> 01:19:33.131
<v Speaker 4>things up and that was the whole shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>and they're just drawn to it loses a </v>
<v Speaker 4>ufo.</v>

1712
01:20:35.011 --> 01:20:40.011
<v Speaker 4>It says it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just certain subjects that </v>

1713
01:20:40.011 --> 01:20:41.820
<v Speaker 4>people will always want to believe and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to believe in psychics.</v>

1714
01:20:41.821 --> 01:20:46.821
<v Speaker 4>They want to believe in chem trails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ufo the government experiments,</v>

1715
01:20:47.230 --> 01:20:52.230
<v Speaker 4>the mind control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't you know about majestic twirl </v>

1716
01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:56.840
<v Speaker 4>government was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's been some mind control </v>

1717
01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.260
<v Speaker 4>experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was definitely those lsd dude,</v>

1718
01:20:58.261 --> 01:21:01.150
<v Speaker 4>mk ultra where they were just watching </v>
<v Speaker 4>people fucking like a,</v>

1719
01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:04.890
<v Speaker 4>like a whorehouse and liked like dosing </v>
<v Speaker 4>them with acid and then these fbi agents</v>

1720
01:21:04.891 --> 01:21:09.891
<v Speaker 4>would sit behind like one way mirrors </v>
<v Speaker 4>and just watch him operation midnight </v>

1721
01:21:09.891 --> 01:21:09.990
<v Speaker 4>climate in that class.</v>

1722
01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:12.600
<v Speaker 4>It must be really cool to be an fbi </v>
<v Speaker 4>agent during the fucking.</v>

1723
01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:18.020
<v Speaker 4>They dose people with acid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they went to whorehouses guys went </v>

1724
01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:21.261
<v Speaker 4>to whore houses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would slip acid in their drink and </v>

1725
01:21:21.261 --> 01:21:24.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they really didn't really want to sex </v>

1726
01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:24.660
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thinking about life,</v>

1727
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:29.870
<v Speaker 4>existential angst is really kind of true</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the us government has like half the</v>

1728
01:21:32.311 --> 01:21:35.050
<v Speaker 4>world is lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>

1729
01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:36.630
<v Speaker 4>is that a bullshit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1730
01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:41.680
<v Speaker 4>it's most likely bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's why it's bullshit because lsd as </v>

1731
01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:42.300
<v Speaker 4>a half life and it doesn't last.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a,</v>

1732
01:21:42.301 --> 01:21:47.301
<v Speaker 4>a vat of lsd and you leave it in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>house for 10 years and most likely it's </v>

1733
01:21:47.301 --> 01:21:50.550
<v Speaker 4>not really effective after aWhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so them having that,</v>

1734
01:21:50.551 --> 01:21:55.551
<v Speaker 4>they seized a bunch of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really good asset during that whole </v>

1735
01:21:55.551 --> 01:21:55.551
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I guess yeah,</v>

1736
01:21:55.551 --> 01:21:55.890
<v Speaker 4>sure they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1737
01:21:55.891 --> 01:21:58.360
<v Speaker 4>but it wouldn't unless they figured out </v>
<v Speaker 4>some way to contain it.</v>

1738
01:21:58.770 --> 01:22:01.530
<v Speaker 4>Vacuum seal it in some special way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1739
01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:03.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1740
01:22:03.301 --> 01:22:05.370
<v Speaker 4>as far as I know of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think like,</v>

1741
01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:09.270
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of substances or just not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why vitamins,</v>

1742
01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:11.280
<v Speaker 4>if you get vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like most vitamins,</v>

1743
01:22:11.281 --> 01:22:16.281
<v Speaker 4>you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not really effective after like </v>

1744
01:22:16.281 --> 01:22:16.860
<v Speaker 4>six months or a year to become less and </v>
<v Speaker 4>less effective over time.</v>

1745
01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:19.370
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty sure that's the case with lsd.</v>

1746
01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:22.800
<v Speaker 4>Don't quote me on though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know it is with weed I've gotten.</v>

1747
01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:25.920
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately it doesn't last.</v>

1748
01:22:25.921 --> 01:22:28.970
<v Speaker 4>It's like life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to get it fresh and young.</v>

1749
01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:32.250
<v Speaker 4>Get that carbon in the fucking possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1750
01:22:32.251 --> 01:22:33.930
<v Speaker 4>even edibles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go bad.</v>

1751
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:36.990
<v Speaker 4>Even if they break them down into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cookie,</v>

1752
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:39.270
<v Speaker 4>put that cookie in a piece of plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to eat it.</v>

1753
01:22:39.271 --> 01:22:44.271
<v Speaker 4>A couple years from now we'd we just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we just took this epic road trip and </v>

1754
01:22:44.271 --> 01:22:44.730
<v Speaker 4>got back this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was amazing that I.</v>

1755
01:22:44.731 --> 01:22:48.630
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to tell your audience about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Utah thing because it was so funny.</v>

1756
01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:53.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean here you are in these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>massive like rock formations carved by </v>

1757
01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.240
<v Speaker 4>millions of years of water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sandstone,</v>

1758
01:22:55.350 --> 01:23:00.090
<v Speaker 4>fucking whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like slate all this shit insane.</v>

1759
01:23:00.091 --> 01:23:02.490
<v Speaker 4>Like anyone who has not been to Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to go.</v>

1760
01:23:02.491 --> 01:23:05.040
<v Speaker 4>Bryce canyon national park is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>most absurd things I've ever.</v>

1761
01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.000
<v Speaker 4>It's like these things called the</v>

1762
01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:08.350
<v Speaker 2>hoodoos that are just carved over </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of years at the stone.</v>

1763
01:23:08.710 --> 01:23:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arches national park obviously that </v>

1764
01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:13.710
<v Speaker 2>iconic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all the,</v>

1765
01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:16.830
<v Speaker 2>the orange arches that are carved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of years like we can carbon </v>

1766
01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:21.061
<v Speaker 2>date them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know the geological processes very </v>

1767
01:23:21.061 --> 01:23:23.461
<v Speaker 2>easy to explain through science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're reading the official park </v>

1768
01:23:23.461 --> 01:23:23.690
<v Speaker 2>literature and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1769
01:23:23.691 --> 01:23:24.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm like so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fascinated.</v>

1770
01:23:24.941 --> 01:23:29.941
<v Speaker 2>Like how did this form?</v>
<v Speaker 2>AnD so like crazy and it makes you just </v>

1771
01:23:29.941 --> 01:23:29.941
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate time.</v>

1772
01:23:29.941 --> 01:23:31.360
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what the desert is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking appreciate time.</v>

1773
01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Like that is as you look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the top of the grand </v>

1774
01:23:36.690 --> 01:23:36.690
<v Speaker 2>staircase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe.</v>

1775
01:23:36.690 --> 01:23:37.540
<v Speaker 2>That's the newest part of the grand </v>
<v Speaker 2>staircase.</v>

1776
01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:39.660
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in,</v>

1777
01:23:39.670 --> 01:23:42.160
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a standing army.</v>

1778
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:47.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A few people that are just listening to </v>

1779
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.590
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would it looks like?</v>

1780
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:49.850
<v Speaker 4>Obviously it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it looks like something that someone</v>

1781
01:23:49.851 --> 01:23:54.851
<v Speaker 4>has designed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Looks like something someone carved out </v>

1782
01:23:54.851 --> 01:23:58.151
<v Speaker 4>of the stone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like some of those things look like </v>

1783
01:23:58.151 --> 01:23:58.151
<v Speaker 4>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1784
01:23:58.151 --> 01:23:58.490
<v Speaker 4>They look like columns in a building.</v>

1785
01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.920
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1786
01:24:01.190 --> 01:24:03.500
<v Speaker 2>and so in you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is all Utah of course,</v>

1787
01:24:03.501 --> 01:24:06.200
<v Speaker 2>named after some mormon guy named bryce </v>
<v Speaker 2>who discovered it,</v>

1788
01:24:06.230 --> 01:24:07.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

1789
01:24:07.551 --> 01:24:11.120
<v Speaker 2>there's arches arches that are created </v>
<v Speaker 2>by just wind and time.</v>

1790
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000
<v Speaker 2>That's what you like the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most crazy thing aboUt being out in </v>

1791
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:17.000
<v Speaker 2>the desert for as long as you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just like,</v>

1792
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.070
<v Speaker 2>this took millions of years to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to happen.</v>

1793
01:24:19.071 --> 01:24:24.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you just appreciate fucking </v>

1794
01:24:24.071 --> 01:24:24.410
<v Speaker 2>time and evolution and like how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth has changed and this is only think</v>

1795
01:24:24.411 --> 01:24:26.570
<v Speaker 2>about how old the earth is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>BillioNs of years old.</v>

1796
01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:28.760
<v Speaker 2>this was only the last couPle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>

1797
01:24:28.761 --> 01:24:30.830
<v Speaker 2>If you look at something called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>black canyon,</v>

1798
01:24:30.831 --> 01:24:34.160
<v Speaker 2>which is actually way deeper than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grand canyon and way more narrow.</v>

1799
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

1800
01:24:35.481 --> 01:24:37.160
<v Speaker 2>this must have taken billions of years </v>
<v Speaker 2>to form.</v>

1801
01:24:37.161 --> 01:24:37.880
<v Speaker 2>And it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>

1802
01:24:37.881 --> 01:24:39.620
<v Speaker 2>just the last 2 million years just </v>
<v Speaker 2>popped up.</v>

1803
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:40.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1804
01:24:40.850 --> 01:24:45.850
<v Speaker 2>It just makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just makes you just appreciate like </v>

1805
01:24:45.850 --> 01:24:47.330
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and geology and science.</v>

1806
01:24:47.331 --> 01:24:52.331
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this official park literature and </v>

1807
01:24:52.331 --> 01:24:53.000
<v Speaker 2>arches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it explains everything very,</v>

1808
01:24:53.001 --> 01:24:55.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely at the very end of it.</v>

1809
01:24:55.071 --> 01:24:55.970
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1810
01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:01.240
<v Speaker 2>we just explained how all this worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the history of arches national </v>

1811
01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:05.621
<v Speaker 2>park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it says probably all of the </v>

1812
01:25:05.621 --> 01:25:06.380
<v Speaker 2>evidence is circumstantial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>

1813
01:25:06.381 --> 01:25:07.370
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1814
01:25:07.371 --> 01:25:09.260
<v Speaker 2>whaT do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the evidence is circumstantial.</v>

1815
01:25:09.261 --> 01:25:11.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like all the evidence is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstantial.</v>

1816
01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Evidence is proven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know how old these rocks are,</v>

1817
01:25:13.821 --> 01:25:16.790
<v Speaker 2>we know exactly what's carved them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can test all the sediments,</v>

1818
01:25:17.150 --> 01:25:19.250
<v Speaker 2>we can test all the rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was just like,</v>

1819
01:25:19.251 --> 01:25:24.251
<v Speaker 2>holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like has the mormon lobby just lobbied </v>

1820
01:25:24.251 --> 01:25:26.861
<v Speaker 2>all the fucking parks in Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are the best parks in the country </v>

1821
01:25:26.861 --> 01:25:28.040
<v Speaker 2>and the most amazing state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And basically forced them to say,</v>

1822
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:29.680
<v Speaker 2>none of this is real.</v>

1823
01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:37.740
<v Speaker 4>It was 14 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He found golden tablets containing the </v>

1824

<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1913
01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:17.360
<v Speaker 1>The planned parenthood thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about it earlier in a </v>

1914
01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.731
<v Speaker 1>different podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were trying to figure out what the </v>

1915
01:30:19.731 --> 01:30:21.480
<v Speaker 1>fuck was going on with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they supposed to fucking do?</v>

1916
01:30:21.481 --> 01:30:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Throw the baby's in the trash case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1917
01:30:23.070 --> 01:30:23.990
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1918
01:30:23.991 --> 01:30:26.520
<v Speaker 1>like I would like them to you if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1919
01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:29.010
<v Speaker 1>if abortion is legal and I think it </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>

1920
01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:30.480
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue?</v>

1921
01:30:30.481 --> 01:30:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be better if that tissue </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets used,</v>

1922
01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:37.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's a fucking super disturbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>video when they start going through the </v>

1923
01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:38.650
<v Speaker 1>parts and you realize what abortion </v>
<v Speaker 1>really is like,</v>

1924
01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:40.500
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is in canadian.</v>

1925
01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1926
01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:46.940
<v Speaker 1>More convenient for me to think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a bundle of cells don't really </v>

1927
01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:48.120
<v Speaker 1>want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is just like,</v>

1928
01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:53.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like abortion is legal and I would </v>

1929
01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:56.931
<v Speaker 1>rather have them utilize the tissue for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's scientific instead of </v>

1930
01:30:56.931 --> 01:30:57.840
<v Speaker 1>just throwing the garbage can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1931
01:30:57.841 --> 01:30:58.740
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1932
01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I think what a lot of people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about,</v>

1933
01:31:00.811 --> 01:31:05.811
<v Speaker 1>not just this is that they were going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another influence people to </v>

1934
01:31:05.811 --> 01:31:07.470
<v Speaker 1>do it for money influence people to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>abortions for money.</v>

1935
01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

1936
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:10.680
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't.</v>

1937
01:31:10.770 --> 01:31:13.650
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to have an abortion for money.</v>

1938
01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:15.660
<v Speaker 1>What dId they get paid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like?</v>

1939
01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Planned parenthood wasn't the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue that planned parenthood was making</v>

1940
01:31:19.111 --> 01:31:20.220
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selling the tissue,</v>

1941
01:31:20.221 --> 01:31:21.630
<v Speaker 1>but then they said that that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

1942
01:31:21.730 --> 01:31:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was like some black market </v>

1943
01:31:26.730 --> 01:31:27.270
<v Speaker 1>thing where people can have abortions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like sell the tissue,</v>

1944
01:31:27.271 --> 01:31:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1945
01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:33.590
<v Speaker 1>it's super confusing because the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>implies that planned parenthood was </v>

1946
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:36.870
<v Speaker 1>profiting off of it and that this woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>was trying to say that she could sort of</v>

1947
01:31:36.871 --> 01:31:38.820
<v Speaker 1>structure it so they can make more </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1948
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I know is planned parents fucking </v>

1949
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.870
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1950
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.870
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

1951
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it gets important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1952
01:31:50.250 --> 01:31:52.140
<v Speaker 1>And people wHo want to talk shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1953
01:31:52.141 --> 01:31:53.760
<v Speaker 1>planned parenthood isn't talk about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby thing.</v>

1954
01:31:53.761 --> 01:31:58.761
<v Speaker 1>It's just so ridiculous because I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have healthcare for like three months </v>

1955
01:31:58.761 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 1>after I quit tea and I</v>

1956
01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:02.440
<v Speaker 4>was on birth control and I was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1957
01:32:02.441 --> 01:32:07.441
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck would I do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would I do if planned parenthood </v>

1958
01:32:07.441 --> 01:32:09.790
<v Speaker 4>wasn't here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't have helped them control.</v>

1959
01:32:10.010 --> 01:32:13.930
<v Speaker 4>How about working for somebody other </v>
<v Speaker 4>than Russia extends your benefits.</v>

1960
01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.550
<v Speaker 4>There's some shit that you need </v>
<v Speaker 4>prescribed.</v>

1961
01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.030
<v Speaker 4>You don't have unemployment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Broken for lunch.</v>

1962
01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:19.900
<v Speaker 4>Just go fucking up certain birth </v>
<v Speaker 4>controls at this,</v>

1963
01:32:19.901 --> 01:32:24.901
<v Speaker 4>at the convenient store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was rush limbaugh that killed rush </v>

1964
01:32:24.901 --> 01:32:24.901
<v Speaker 4>limbaugh's career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't it?</v>

1965
01:32:24.901 --> 01:32:27.710
<v Speaker 4>We was talking about some girl beer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See that too,</v>

1966
01:32:28.250 --> 01:32:32.020
<v Speaker 4>but he was talking about some girl being</v>
<v Speaker 4>a slut because she wanted birth control,</v>

1967
01:32:32.021 --> 01:32:35.260
<v Speaker 4>so college student member,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was like 2012.</v>

1968
01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:38.700
<v Speaker 4>That was the dropoff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was where it ended for rush limbo.</v>

1969
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:40.420
<v Speaker 4>Oxy didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That did it.</v>

1970
01:32:40.570 --> 01:32:45.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was seeing a bunch of really rude </v>

1971
01:32:45.570 --> 01:32:47.341
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boys probably oxford out of his fucking </v>

1972
01:32:47.341 --> 01:32:47.341
<v Speaker 4>head while you're saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1973
01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:54.460
<v Speaker 4>are coming in your nose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>

1974
01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:57.490
<v Speaker 4>that literally like ended his career.</v>

1975
01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.600
<v Speaker 4>That was like aRound 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I remember correctly.</v>

1976
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:03.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to remember what the story </v>
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

1977
01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:08.880
<v Speaker 4>but it was some college girl and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>calling her a slut and I think it was a </v>

1978
01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:09.690
<v Speaker 4>rape victim or no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1979
01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:13.030
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it wAs even over the top rush.</v>

1980
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:19.030
<v Speaker 4>Chris commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what he wanted to do was he </v>

1981
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:22.171
<v Speaker 4>wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was mocking her because she was </v>

1982
01:33:22.171 --> 01:33:25.190
<v Speaker 4>saying that a birth control should be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of something.</v>

1983
01:33:25.710 --> 01:33:30.710
<v Speaker 4>See if he could find that rush limbo </v>
<v Speaker 4>college girl slot birth control.</v>

1984
01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.210
<v Speaker 4>Google that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1985
01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:34.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like he was.</v>

1986
01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:38.680
<v Speaker 4>She was saying that it should be a part </v>
<v Speaker 4>of her health care.</v>

1987
01:33:38.681 --> 01:33:43.540
<v Speaker 4>I think he was calling her a slut </v>
<v Speaker 4>because she wanted birth control.</v>

1988
01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:45.210
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.310
<v Speaker 4>do you think of a big black man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2053
01:37:03.550 --> 01:37:06.140
<v Speaker 4>When ted cruz talks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hear a gay man.</v>

2054
01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.730
<v Speaker 4>I hear a gay man is how he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is he talking?</v>

2055
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:11.240
<v Speaker 4>Let's hear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's hear ted cruz because he's gay.</v>

2056
01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:14.570
<v Speaker 4>I think he's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's super conservative,</v>

2057
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:19.930
<v Speaker 4>super conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my thought is this guy cannot </v>

2058
01:37:19.930 --> 01:37:22.961
<v Speaker 4>fucking wait to get done talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>just run up thrawn some women's clothes </v>

<v Speaker 4>and suck some cock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just sounds gay.</v>

2060
01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:26.840
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he's gay,</v>

2061
01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:28.480
<v Speaker 4>but I've never met anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sounds great.</v>

2062
01:37:28.481 --> 01:37:30.740
<v Speaker 4>It's not gay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so nothing wrong with being gay.</v>

2063
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:33.260
<v Speaker 4>I want to say this again because I sit </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the earlier podcasts.</v>

2064
01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.210

<v Speaker 4>I'd love gay people,</v>

2065

2241
01:45:48.521 --> 01:45:51.130
<v Speaker 1>during the reagan administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort of changed the rules for what </v>

2242
01:45:51.130 --> 01:45:54.011
<v Speaker 1>made you're mentally ill and what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinctions were and that's when they </v>

2243
01:45:54.011 --> 01:45:55.610
<v Speaker 1>sort of opened up the doors and let all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people on the street.</v>

2244
01:45:55.640 --> 01:46:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I remember it like really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really clearly when I was a kid because </v>

2245
01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:02.230
<v Speaker 1>there was a big debate like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2246
01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:03.560
<v Speaker 1>like wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't eat,</v>

2247
01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:04.490
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2248
01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:09.491
<v Speaker 1>you can't fucking do with those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just change the </v>

2249
01:46:09.491 --> 01:46:12.280
<v Speaker 1>classification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The classification for people that have </v>

2250
01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:12.560
<v Speaker 1>mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they did and all throughout New York</v>

2251
01:46:12.561 --> 01:46:13.310
<v Speaker 1>and boston.</v>

2252
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:17.660
<v Speaker 1>That was like all these new mentally ill</v>
<v Speaker 1>people wandering around the streets.</v>

2253
01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:22.900
<v Speaker 1>it was like a real clear moments there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read the statistic that </v>

2254
01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:24.390
<v Speaker 1>homelessness has gone up like 25 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last four years,</v>

2255
01:46:24.450 --> 01:46:29.450
<v Speaker 1>just in la if people homes on freeway </v>
<v Speaker 1>overpass and jet and I remember like I </v>

2256
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:33.581
<v Speaker 1>told you the five percent swear to god </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I remember I posted it and someone </v>

2257
01:46:33.581 --> 01:46:33.581
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2258
01:46:33.581 --> 01:46:34.580
<v Speaker 1>just move out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't afford la.</v>

2259
01:46:34.581 --> 01:46:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Just move out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2260
01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I can't afford them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you go homeless,</v>

2261
01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:45.520
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude speaking really quickly before we </v>

2262
01:46:45.951 --> 01:46:47.330
<v Speaker 1>wrap it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to tell you I,</v>

2263
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:52.390
<v Speaker 1>we sHould talk about Cuba next time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I there and did a whole report </v>

2264
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.390
<v Speaker 1>on</v>

2265
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.390
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm zero homelessness.</v>

2266
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:54.270
<v Speaker 2>That was the most iconic thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>being in Cuba.</v>

2267
01:46:54.271 --> 01:46:59.271
<v Speaker 2>No trash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no homelessness because everyone has </v>

2268
01:46:59.271 --> 01:47:01.851
<v Speaker 2>their basiC needs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shelter and there's rational system </v>

2269
01:47:01.851 --> 01:47:06.381
<v Speaker 2>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just interesting to see like </v>

2270
01:47:06.381 --> 01:47:07.850
<v Speaker 2>the low crime rate when people have like</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic shelter and healthcare,</v>

2271
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:11.760
<v Speaker 2>a lot of problems still very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I.</v>

2272
01:47:12.450 --> 01:47:14.940
<v Speaker 2>It was very different than every other </v>
<v Speaker 2>latin american country.</v>

2273
01:47:14.941 --> 01:47:15.900
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy shit.</v>

2274
01:47:15.901 --> 01:47:18.420
<v Speaker 2>There's no homeless people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beggars and.</v>

2275
01:47:18.421 --> 01:47:20.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

2276
01:47:20.421 --> 01:47:25.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not an ideal environment because </v>

2277
01:47:25.421 --> 01:47:27.801
<v Speaker 2>you're forced into certain jobs and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of decide what you do on certain </v>

2278
01:47:27.801 --> 01:47:27.801
<v Speaker 2>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2279
01:47:27.801 --> 01:47:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bullshit.</v>

2280
01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:31.200
<v Speaker 2>What about for athletes when they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that for athletes?</v>

2281
01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:34.710
<v Speaker 2>So that's what my friend who's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>economist actually when I came back from</v>

2282
01:47:34.711 --> 01:47:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

2283
01:47:35.191 --> 01:47:37.200
<v Speaker 2>so how is it like everyone's assigned a </v>
<v Speaker 2>job?</v>

2284
01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:37.800
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2285
01:47:37.801 --> 01:47:42.801
<v Speaker 2>it's not like a brave new world where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're babies are born in incubators and </v>

2286
01:47:42.801 --> 01:47:42.801
<v Speaker 2>trained to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a doctor,</v>

2287
01:47:42.801 --> 01:47:44.250
<v Speaker 2>you're a florist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your this is not like that at all.</v>

2288
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:46.020
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2289
01:47:46.021 --> 01:47:48.870
<v Speaker 2>there is a rational system and they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>get paid very little.</v>

2290
01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just interesting because people</v>

2291
01:47:51.091 --> 01:47:52.680
<v Speaker 2>just have a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindset.</v>

2292
01:47:52.681 --> 01:47:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember I spoke to a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors and I was like,</v>

2293
01:47:54.721 --> 01:47:56.910
<v Speaker 2>why are you a doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting paid anything.</v>

2294
01:47:57.340 --> 01:47:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Like why would I care about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2295
01:47:59.761 --> 01:48:02.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm helping my community and family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like completely.</v>

2296
01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:05.370
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a totally like a wall of </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding.</v>

2297
01:48:05.371 --> 01:48:10.371
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming from the hub of capitalism </v>

2298
01:48:10.371 --> 01:48:10.371
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand the incentive.</v>

2299
01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.240
<v Speaker 2>So it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really,</v>

2300
01:48:12.241 --> 01:48:14.760
<v Speaker 2>really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'd recommend everyone check out.</v>

2301
01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cuba series I did on breaking the </v>

2302
01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:20.550
<v Speaker 2>set if you want to learn more and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>checkout ethos space.</v>

2303
01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Abby martin.org</v>
<v Speaker 2>is my part that have lived there and </v>

2304
01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Cuba really hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hated the oppression.</v>

2305
01:48:25.861 --> 01:48:30.861
<v Speaker 2>They hated the way they were treated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They escaped because they had more </v>

2306
01:48:30.861 --> 01:48:31.740
<v Speaker 2>opportunity in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You launched the athletes.</v>

2307
01:48:31.741 --> 01:48:36.450
<v Speaker 2>There's three laws that America has put </v>
<v Speaker 2>into place that coke's defectors.</v>

2308
01:48:36.451 --> 01:48:41.451
<v Speaker 2>So one of them is basically trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>subvert cuba's whole medical </v>

2309
01:48:41.451 --> 01:48:44.421
<v Speaker 2>internationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Cuba has been forced into this like </v>

2310
01:48:44.421 --> 01:48:44.970
<v Speaker 2>because of the blockade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the embargo,</v>

2311
01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:48.570
<v Speaker 2>they've been forced into like total </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking self,</v>

2312
01:48:48.571 --> 01:48:50.960
<v Speaker 2>like you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like had like all organics and they have</v>

2313
01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:55.980
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maintain these old cars and they </v>

2314
01:48:55.980 --> 01:48:55.980
<v Speaker 2>like don't let anything break down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinda cool.</v>

2315
01:48:55.980 --> 01:49:00.060
<v Speaker 2>And so they've also developed instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>invading countries and bombing the shit </v>

2316
01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:00.630
<v Speaker 2>out of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've also developed an entire,</v>

2317
01:49:00.631 --> 01:49:03.800
<v Speaker 2>like a medical thing for their income.</v>

2318
01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:06.600
<v Speaker 2>So they basically lease out doctors </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world,</v>

2319
01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:09.330
<v Speaker 2>even when you go back to the Haiti </v>
<v Speaker 2>earthquake,</v>

2320
01:49:09.331 --> 01:49:12.150
<v Speaker 2>they were the first country that sent </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the biggest contingent of doctors,</v>

2321
01:49:12.210 --> 01:49:17.210
<v Speaker 2>a bola biggest contingent of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they basically leased out like </v>

2322
01:49:17.210 --> 01:49:18.270
<v Speaker 2>doctors to get oil from Venezuela to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like get help.</v>

2323
01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because people are </v>

2324
01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:23.660
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2325
01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:23.660
<v Speaker 2>well they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2326
01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:24.630
<v Speaker 2>they're like creating doctors to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>just get oil and shit.</v>

2327
01:49:24.631 --> 01:49:25.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2328
01:49:25.210 --> 01:49:30.210
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing what they can with the </v>

2329
01:49:30.210 --> 01:49:31.761
<v Speaker 2>resources that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're under a very crippling economic </v>

2330
01:49:31.761 --> 01:49:34.431
<v Speaker 2>embargo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have subversion programs going on </v>

2331
01:49:34.431 --> 01:49:35.430
<v Speaker 2>through usa id every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despite the normalization process that's</v>

2332
01:49:35.431 --> 01:49:38.430
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The usa id is still spending $20,000,000</v>

2333
01:49:38.431 --> 01:49:41.490
<v Speaker 2>a year to subvert cuba's political </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

2334
01:49:41.491 --> 01:49:45.060
<v Speaker 2>So we've subverted the hip hop movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've created a fake hiv program.</v>

2335
01:49:45.061 --> 01:49:50.061
<v Speaker 2>We've created a fake twitter called zoom</v>
<v Speaker 2>zoom that's tried to like get people </v>

2336
01:49:50.061 --> 01:49:50.061
<v Speaker 2>against castro.</v>

2337
01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:55.080
<v Speaker 2>But the most disturbing part is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical internationalism where you have </v>

2338
01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:58.111
<v Speaker 2>like 75,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors working around the world on all </v>

2339
01:49:58.111 --> 01:50:01.591
<v Speaker 2>these fronts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the us has created a law that said </v>

2340
01:50:01.591 --> 01:50:04.620
<v Speaker 2>you can defect to the us and become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor here and just leave your posts.</v>

2341
01:50:04.901 --> 01:50:07.540
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we trying to subvert like actual</v>

2342
01:50:07.541 --> 01:50:10.420
<v Speaker 2>medical missions and humanitarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>missions that cuba's doing?</v>

2343
01:50:10.810 --> 01:50:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Really the only reason is because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to subvert the socialist government</v>

2344
01:50:15.221 --> 01:50:18.670
<v Speaker 2>that survived after the cold war that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>still fucking can't accept.</v>

2345
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:22.990
<v Speaker 2>And there's also the wet foot dry foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy that offers a cuban immigrants.</v>

2346
01:50:23.050 --> 01:50:26.380
<v Speaker 2>No other immigrant in the world has this</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can just come here and just be</v>

2347
01:50:26.381 --> 01:50:31.381
<v Speaker 2>an american citizen if you're keeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because no questions asked what foot </v>

2348
01:50:31.381 --> 01:50:31.381
<v Speaker 2>drive still?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2349
01:50:31.381 --> 01:50:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must suck for mexicans.</v>

2350
01:50:34.210 --> 01:50:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck,</v>

2351
01:50:35.311 --> 01:50:36.020
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2352
01:50:36.090 --> 01:50:41.090
<v Speaker 1>what is this bullshit like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why shut down.</v>

2353
01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

2354
01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:47.600
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should have a conversation with joey</v>

2355
01:50:47.601 --> 01:50:48.840
<v Speaker 1>diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be fucking screaming,</v>

2356
01:50:48.841 --> 01:50:50.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to Cuba,</v>

2357
01:50:51.090 --> 01:50:53.730
<v Speaker 1>came over on a boat and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people,</v>

2358
01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:53.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2359
01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:56.120
<v Speaker 2>look when you're a cuban and your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2360
01:50:56.150 --> 01:51:01.150
<v Speaker 2>your honor ration system and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in this country that's kind of </v>

2361
01:51:01.150 --> 01:51:01.830
<v Speaker 2>isolated and you're like watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>american movies and you're like,</v>

2362
01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:04.710
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck am I here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can be there,</v>

2363
01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:09.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're seeing mountains of cocaine </v>

2364
01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:09.980
<v Speaker 2>and the cases and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

2365
01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:14.120
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is a lot of doctors </v>
<v Speaker 2>defect and they come over here and then </v>

2366
01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:17.391
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're caught for years and years and </v>

2367
01:51:17.391 --> 01:51:17.391
<v Speaker 2>years they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're licensed,</v>

2368
01:51:17.391 --> 01:51:17.880
<v Speaker 2>doesn't apply like they have to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through all day.</v>

2369
01:51:17.881 --> 01:51:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Ended up being like a waitress in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant for a decade,</v>

2370
01:51:20.761 --> 01:51:23.690
<v Speaker 2>trying to become a practicing doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I was over there,</v>

2371
01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:25.950
<v Speaker 2>not only they have free health care </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously for everyone in the country,</v>

2372
01:51:25.951 --> 01:51:29.460
<v Speaker 2>but they also have an international </v>
<v Speaker 2>medical school that trains doctors.</v>

2373
01:51:29.461 --> 01:51:34.461
<v Speaker 2>Whoever wants to train all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world can go and just be a doctor for </v>

2374
01:51:34.461 --> 01:51:34.461
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>

2375
01:51:34.461 --> 01:51:34.800
<v Speaker 2>So I met like 20 americans who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and I was like,</v>

2376
01:51:34.801 --> 01:51:36.840
<v Speaker 2>why are you here getting your medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>license?</v>

2377
01:51:36.841 --> 01:51:41.841
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to fucking be </v>

2378
01:51:41.841 --> 01:51:41.841
<v Speaker 2>$100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>in debt in America,</v>

2379
01:51:41.841 --> 01:51:46.820
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to get my medical license so </v>

2380
01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:46.820
<v Speaker 2>then I can go train and be a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2381
01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:49.770
<v Speaker 2>Free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of shit can be talked about how</v>

2382
01:51:49.771 --> 01:51:54.771
<v Speaker 2>things are run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a totally different society </v>

2383
01:51:54.771 --> 01:51:58.371
<v Speaker 2>when you have basic needs met and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare and like humans come first </v>

2384
01:51:58.371 --> 01:52:01.110
<v Speaker 2>out of necessity because of the blockade</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they had to create this.</v>

2385
01:52:01.111 --> 01:52:05.970
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily of altruism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's evolved in this such an insane.</v>

2386
01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Just dichotomy of how society has </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioned super interesting.</v>

2387
01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:14.130
<v Speaker 2>What's going to be fascinating now the </v>
<v Speaker 2>embargo has been lifted.</v>

2388
01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:17.040
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be lifted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still not enough.</v>

2389
01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:19.290
<v Speaker 2>So now look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>travel restrictions.</v>

2390
01:52:19.290 --> 01:52:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now they've looked at travel </v>

2391
01:52:24.290 --> 01:52:25.341
<v Speaker 2>restrictions and now raul has like </v>
<v Speaker 2>opened up some private enterprise and </v>

2392
01:52:25.341 --> 01:52:26.610
<v Speaker 2>stuff and that was a whole diplomatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>process within the country to where they</v>

2393
01:52:26.670 --> 01:52:31.670
<v Speaker 2>lifted some economic things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now private businesses can flourish </v>

2394
01:52:31.670 --> 01:52:35.841
<v Speaker 2>and so it's opening up because they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized that they can't obviously have </v>

2395
01:52:35.841 --> 01:52:36.750
<v Speaker 2>it like that forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially now that the travels lifted,</v>

2396
01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:38.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's gonna be really interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see what happens,</v>

2397
01:52:38.761 --> 01:52:41.910
<v Speaker 2>especially now that the us still has </v>
<v Speaker 2>this aversion tactics going on,</v>

2398
01:52:41.911 --> 01:52:45.020
<v Speaker 2>these programs in place that encouraged </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to defect and then also get.</v>

2399
01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:46.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a perpetual</v>

2400
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:48.800
<v Speaker 1>occupation of fucking Cuba that raul has</v>
<v Speaker 1>said time and again,</v>

2401
01:52:49.130 --> 01:52:52.760
<v Speaker 1>give us guantanamo bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You leased it under false pretenses.</v>

2402
01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:55.790
<v Speaker 1>We really want it back and the us as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's off the table.</v>

2403
01:52:55.791 --> 01:53:00.290
<v Speaker 1>So that's the way the empire works back </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

2404
01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:03.830
<v Speaker 1>So how has that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We liked least it 19.</v>

2405
01:53:03.831 --> 01:53:08.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We leased the guantanamo bay naval base </v>

2406
01:53:08.831 --> 01:53:09.380
<v Speaker 1>was just a giant swath of land for </v>
<v Speaker 1>housing,</v>

2407
01:53:09.381 --> 01:53:12.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's connected to Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on Cuba in Cuba.</v>

2408
01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:15.860
<v Speaker 1>So we lease it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what's battista was an alum,</v>

2409
01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:20.920
<v Speaker 1>our boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tessa was like a corporate fucking </v>

2410
01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:20.920
<v Speaker 1>lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2411
01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:21.690
<v Speaker 1>And so we had all these private </v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprises in Cuba and,</v>

2412
01:53:21.691 --> 01:53:26.691
<v Speaker 1>and the socialist revolution happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the lease agreement said this </v>

2413
01:53:26.841 --> 01:53:31.700
<v Speaker 1>has to be agreed by both parties to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue or I'm sorry to dissolve.</v>

2414
01:53:31.701 --> 01:53:33.470
<v Speaker 1>And then when the cuban revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

2415
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Cuba was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us back guantanamo and the us was </v>

2416
01:53:38.770 --> 01:53:38.770
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2417
01:53:38.770 --> 01:53:39.080
<v Speaker 1>we don't agree to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're just gonna keep it.</v>

2418
01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:45.760
<v Speaker 1>And they never accepted a diamond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never cashed a dime for the rent lease </v>

2419
01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:46.860
<v Speaker 1>after the 1956 or whatever the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2420
01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:48.260
<v Speaker 1>the revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2421
01:53:48.261 --> 01:53:48.950
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2422
01:53:50.150 --> 01:53:51.560
<v Speaker 1>that's really disturbing to me because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2423
01:53:51.561 --> 01:53:53.150
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucking go down to a bay.</v>

2424
01:53:53.151 --> 01:53:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Like you can pretend that were normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with coupa,</v>

2425
01:53:55.401 --> 01:53:58.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's never gonna be normal unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>you give them some respect and if you're</v>

2426
01:53:58.401 --> 01:54:03.350
<v Speaker 1>so scared of socialism and if you are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that socialism is a failure,</v>

2427
01:54:03.351 --> 01:54:05.680
<v Speaker 1>then let them fucking fail on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lift the block caden,</v>

2428
01:54:05.690 --> 01:54:08.300
<v Speaker 1>let Cuba just function and let's see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens.</v>

2429
01:54:08.301 --> 01:54:09.860
<v Speaker 1>But right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2430
01:54:09.861 --> 01:54:13.520
<v Speaker 1>it's been so crippled in so many ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's impossible to really know what</v>

2431
01:54:13.521 --> 01:54:15.560
<v Speaker 1>the country would be like without us </v>
<v Speaker 1>interference.</v>

2432
01:54:15.590 --> 01:54:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very bizarre that we're allowed to </v>

2433
01:54:20.590 --> 01:54:22.420
<v Speaker 1>trade with all sorts of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that are accused of all sorts </v>

2434
01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:23.300
<v Speaker 1>of different heinous crimes against </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

2435
01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:26.400
<v Speaker 1>But we can't with Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2436
01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:31.600
<v Speaker 1>just thinking about all the different </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that we're allowed to trade </v>

2437
