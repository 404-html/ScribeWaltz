00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.830
<v Speaker 1>How'd you get involved in this?</v>

3
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:05.664
<v Speaker 1>You started,</v>

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.870
<v Speaker 2>you said 24 years ago doing drug research on animals.</v>

5
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.440
<v Speaker 2>How did,</v>

6
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.711
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

7
00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:10.221
<v Speaker 2>what was,</v>

8
00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:11.960
<v Speaker 2>what led you to want to go down this road?</v>

9
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.340
<v Speaker 2>So I was in,</v>

10
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I tell the story in the book and so I was in the air force back in the 80s,</v>

11
00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:19.670
<v Speaker 2>like you mentioned about crack cocaine.</v>

12
00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:21.560
<v Speaker 2>So I was in the air force over in England,</v>

13
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

14
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.420
<v Speaker 2>86,</v>

15
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.171
<v Speaker 2>87,</v>

16
00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:29.171
<v Speaker 2>88 and crack cocaine was a big deal in the United States as you point out.</v>

17
00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:34.211
<v Speaker 2>And I grew up in the hood and Miami and Miami was a cocaine capital in the</v>

18
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:35.511
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

19
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:35.830
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

20
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.280
<v Speaker 2>and so things that were happening in my community that were not good,</v>

21
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

22
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 2>high unemployment crime,</v>

23
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:44.540
<v Speaker 2>all of these kinds of things,</v>

24
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.310
<v Speaker 2>I blame crack cocaine for that.</v>

25
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.700
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought that if I go to school and get a degree in order to study</v>

26
00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:52.311
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

27
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 2>the effects of drugs on the brain,</v>

28
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I could solve the problems that face my community or problems that I thought</v>

29
00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:00.080
<v Speaker 2>were in the community,</v>

30
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.180
<v Speaker 2>particularly those related to drugs.</v>

31
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.350
<v Speaker 2>And so I began studying drugs as an undergraduate and then went on to graduate</v>

32
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:11.351
<v Speaker 2>school to study drugs on the brains of animals and to try to figure out the</v>

33
00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 2>neuro biological mechanisms that were responsible for addiction.</v>

34
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 2>So you just got</v>

35
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.460
<v Speaker 1>fascinated by this idea of fixing this,</v>

36
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:22.940
<v Speaker 1>this issue that you saw in your community and then you just fell into a rabbit</v>

37
00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:23.630
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>

38
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:26.960
<v Speaker 2>So when I started along my journey,</v>

40
00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:27.561
<v Speaker 2>my path,</v>

41
00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:29.810
<v Speaker 2>I actually got an education and you know,</v>

42
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 2>so as James Baldwin said,</v>

43
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

44
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

45
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

46
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.461
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

47
00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:33.980
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

48
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.420
<v Speaker 2>the paradox of education,</v>

49
00:01:35.421 --> 00:01:38.530
<v Speaker 2>that's precisely it is as one begins to become educated,</v>

50
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.750
<v Speaker 2>conscious one begins to question.</v>

51
00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:43.100
<v Speaker 2>It's the society in which he's being educated.</v>

52
00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:44.360
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happened with me.</v>

53
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.160
<v Speaker 2>And so along the way I discovered things like the majority of people who use</v>

54
00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:50.600
<v Speaker 2>these drugs are not addicted.</v>

55
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:51.860
<v Speaker 2>That was one thing I discovered.</v>

56
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.610
<v Speaker 2>I discovered that many of the things that we set about crack about crack cocaine</v>

57
00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:57.020
<v Speaker 2>were just simply not true.</v>

58
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Like the cold crack baby myths.</v>

59
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.350
<v Speaker 2>And people said that when W.</v>

60
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.370
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

61
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.070
<v Speaker 2>How generation B should be prepared to have,</v>

62
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

63
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.140
<v Speaker 2>an army of kids who couldn't learn because of being exposed to crack cocaine.</v>

64
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 2>That just simply wasn't true when all the data came out beginning in the mid</v>

65
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:14.960
<v Speaker 2>1990s,</v>

66
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 2>we realized that that simply wasn't true.</v>

67
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

68
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.750
<v Speaker 2>other things that I learned that just simply wasn't true.</v>

69
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

70
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

71
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.671
<v Speaker 2>things like,</v>

72
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:23.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

73
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 2>one hit of crack cocaine,</v>

74
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.130
<v Speaker 2>you're addicted.</v>

75
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Not True.</v>

76
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 2>That crack cocaine was different from powder cocaine.</v>

77
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.113
<v Speaker 2>Not True.</v>

78
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.820
<v Speaker 2>All of these things I discovered along the way,</v>

79
00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:32.570
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't,</v>

80
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.470
<v Speaker 2>they weren't true.</v>

81
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.910
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>

82
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I discovered that this wasn't new.</v>

83
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:42.611
<v Speaker 2>I went back to the early 19 hundreds and saw the same sorta hysteria,</v>

84
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.470
<v Speaker 2>mainly race hysteria surrounding drugs occurred even then.</v>

85
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.180
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought,</v>

86
00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:50.510
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

87
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.410
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

88
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.920
<v Speaker 2>And then that helped me to be more critical about my issue.</v>

89
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Is there a difference in the,</v>

90
00:02:57.371 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 1>the effect of crack cocaine,</v>

91
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>physical effect,</v>

92
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.321
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

93
00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

94
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>and cocaine and heroin?</v>

95
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.171
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>

96
00:03:03.171 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 2>let's think about crack cocaine,</v>

97
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.570
<v Speaker 2>heroin rather vague about crack cocaine and powder cocaine.</v>

98
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Let's just think about the chemical structure.</v>

99
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.940
<v Speaker 2>The only difference between crack cocaine and powder cocaine is that the powder</v>

100
00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:17.480
<v Speaker 2>cocaine has this thing called the hydrochloride salt attached to it.</v>

101
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.180
<v Speaker 2>That salt prevents it from being smoked.</v>

102
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Now you can dissolve the powder cocaine and,</v>

103
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.010
<v Speaker 2>and water and then shooting in your arm.</v>

104
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.590
<v Speaker 2>And so you have the effects of cocaine,</v>

105
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.513
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

106
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.380
<v Speaker 2>onset of the effects within seconds.</v>

107
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.170
<v Speaker 2>The same is true with crack cocaine.</v>

108
00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:36.530
<v Speaker 2>The effects or onset of a sex effects are within seconds.</v>

109
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Now the biological activity of cocaine,</v>

110
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.150
<v Speaker 2>it's at the base,</v>

111
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.170
<v Speaker 2>not that,</v>

112
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.180
<v Speaker 2>so that hydrochloride portion on the,</v>

113
00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:44.271
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

114
00:03:44.271 --> 00:03:46.010
<v Speaker 2>on the cocaine powder,</v>

115
00:03:46.011 --> 00:03:48.770
<v Speaker 2>on powder cocaine has no biological activity.</v>

116
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Whereas so,</v>

117
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.240
<v Speaker 2>so that means that crack and powder are the same drug.</v>

118
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.520
<v Speaker 2>They are exactly the same drug,</v>

119
00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:56.420
<v Speaker 2>the same effect,</v>

120
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.320
<v Speaker 2>same drug.</v>

121
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.591
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

122
00:03:57.591 --> 00:03:59.630
<v Speaker 2>So it's indistinguishable to the user.</v>

123
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Indistinguishable.</v>

124
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Now why is it that they prepare it that way?</v>

125
00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the benefit of preparing it is just</v>

126
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.420
<v Speaker 2>quicker.</v>

127
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.253
<v Speaker 2>A question.</v>

128
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.480
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that you,</v>

129
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.080
<v Speaker 2>you might recall Richard Pryor back in the days when he got,</v>

130
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.570
<v Speaker 2>he burnt and he burned himself with smoking.</v>

131
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.610
<v Speaker 2>So he was freebasing and so he was removing that hydrochloride portion of the</v>

132
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:21.570
<v Speaker 2>salt off of,</v>

133
00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:24.090
<v Speaker 2>off of the cocaine base so he could actually smoke it.</v>

134
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Now he was using ether,</v>

135
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.760
<v Speaker 2>which is highly flammable with crack cocaine,</v>

136
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.210
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

137
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.631
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

138
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:32.190
<v Speaker 2>you no longer need the ether.</v>

139
00:04:32.191 --> 00:04:37.110
<v Speaker 2>You just mix it up with baking soda and water and the cocaine and you mix it up</v>

140
00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:38.520
<v Speaker 2>and you get rid of that salt.</v>

141
00:04:38.521 --> 00:04:41.850
<v Speaker 2>So eat there is no longer need it and is not as dangerous.</v>

142
00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:45.960
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the reasons that we have crack cocaine as a result of that.</v>

143
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.520
<v Speaker 2>And it also,</v>

144
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.070
<v Speaker 2>it made it so you could sell them in,</v>

145
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:53.100
<v Speaker 2>in unit doses to make the drug appear to be cheaper.</v>

146
00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Because you also might recall in early 1980s,</v>

147
00:04:56.131 --> 00:04:57.120
<v Speaker 2>1970s,</v>

148
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.960
<v Speaker 2>you had to buy cocaine powder and bulk and that made it more expensive.</v>

149
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.050
<v Speaker 2>Crack cocaine made it a lot more simple,</v>

150
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.870
<v Speaker 2>simple for people to buy it who didn't have,</v>

151
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

152
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.071
<v Speaker 2>the kind of,</v>

153
00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:08.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

154
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

155
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.280
<v Speaker 2>expendable income that was required before the mid 1980.</v>

156
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.050
<v Speaker 2>So essentially they just brought it down to bite sized portions.</v>

157
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.913
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

158
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.401
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

159
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:17.550
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

160
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.400
<v Speaker 2>rather than selling this whole six pack or 12 pack,</v>

161
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.530
<v Speaker 2>now you can sell one item,</v>

162
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:23.850
<v Speaker 2>one can have one bottle.</v>

163
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.920
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk more about this,</v>

164
00:05:24.921 --> 00:05:28.610
<v Speaker 1>but I should just clarify that Richard Pryor changed his story as he got older</v>

165
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.530
<v Speaker 1>and actually said that he tried to kill himself.</v>

166
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.850
<v Speaker 1>He lit himself on fire.</v>

167
00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:32.684
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>

168
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

169
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge Richard Pryor fan and I know that that was originally what he had</v>

170
00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:36.981
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

171
00:05:36.981 --> 00:05:40.250
<v Speaker 1>that he got burnt doing freebase but I think he changed his story later.</v>

172
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

173
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.170
<v Speaker 1>I actually worked with them a bunch of times right before he died.</v>

174
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.490
<v Speaker 1>It was a real honor.</v>

175
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.430
<v Speaker 1>He's a real special dude as far as standup comedians go.</v>

176
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

177
00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Which you but that,</v>

178
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.180
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

179
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

180
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>style of like free base was a thing that we know is associated with people that</v>

181
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:58.641
<v Speaker 1>were really,</v>

182
00:05:58.641 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 1>really fucked up.</v>

183
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

184
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Like the guys doing coke.</v>

185
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

186
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:02.031
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

187
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:02.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

188
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>he's probably gonna mess up his life.</v>

189
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>He's freebasing.</v>

190
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

191
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

192
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.621
<v Speaker 1>he's gone,</v>

193
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:06.861
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

194
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 1>He's based and he's a bass had.</v>

195
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

196
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.171
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

197
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Base head was the thing before crack was bass heads.</v>

198
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

199
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.630
<v Speaker 1>I described a couple of people in the book from my neighborhood who got into</v>

200
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 1>freebase thing and exactly the same way you just talked about,</v>

201
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

202
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.103
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

203
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

204
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.680
<v Speaker 1>now everybody has this idea in their head that crime and that everything</v>

205
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>escalated and the world changed when crack was introduced.</v>

206
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Is that a myth as well?</v>

207
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

208
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:33.914
<v Speaker 1>it's the myth that,</v>

209
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:34.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

210
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>let me clarify it because on the one hand,</v>

211
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 2>so when crack hit the market,</v>

212
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 2>it was first sort of,</v>

213
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

214
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 2>talked about December,</v>

215
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.181
<v Speaker 2>1984 and the La Times,</v>

216
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 2>the first time we heard a crack,</v>

217
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.980
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't become more widely known or available until maybe the mid 19,</v>

218
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 2>may of 1985.</v>

219
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Now once crack cocaine hit the markets,</v>

220
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.380
<v Speaker 2>what happened was that people were fighting over various new markets and</v>

221
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 2>whenever there are new illicit markets,</v>

222
00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:02.451
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

223
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get some violent activity until the market settles down.</v>

224
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 2>That happened with any illicit market and that's certainly happened with crack</v>

225
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:10.544
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>

226
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

227
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.740
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that people,</v>

228
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 2>there are a number of things that people attribute to try to crack in terms of</v>

229
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:19.940
<v Speaker 2>crime and all of the sort of downfall of certain communities.</v>

230
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.531
<v Speaker 2>Unemployment.</v>

231
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:25.700
<v Speaker 2>They said that unemployment really rose as a result of crack cocaine being</v>

232
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:30.701
<v Speaker 2>around now 1982 the unemployment rate in this country was about 11% of white</v>

233
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:34.760
<v Speaker 2>folks and it was double that for black people.</v>

234
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 2>That was before crack,</v>

235
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.730
<v Speaker 2>at least two,</v>

236
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 2>three years before crack even hit the market.</v>

237
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Now doing the whole crack era,</v>

238
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 2>unemployment has never been as high as 1982 that's number one.</v>

239
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.590
<v Speaker 2>People said things like,</v>

240
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

241
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:54.130
<v Speaker 2>people from my community did crack cocaine was responsible for these mothers.</v>

242
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.000
<v Speaker 2>These grandmothers now raising new generations of kids because their daughters</v>

243
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:02.360
<v Speaker 2>were strung out on crack and so now they have to take care of these kids.</v>

244
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 2>That simply wasn't true.</v>

245
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:05.540
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly happened in,</v>

246
00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 2>in my community,</v>

247
00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:09.650
<v Speaker 2>but it happened before crack cocaine was ever on the market.</v>

248
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Certainly happened in my family long before crack cocaine ever hit the market.</v>

249
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 2>When we look at other communities,</v>

250
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:17.300
<v Speaker 2>like particularly immigrant community,</v>

251
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.460
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the Jewish community,</v>

252
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:22.100
<v Speaker 2>when they came over to eastern European Jews,</v>

253
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:23.420
<v Speaker 2>when they came over in the country,</v>

254
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.900
<v Speaker 2>the early 1,908 or 18 hundreds and so forth,</v>

255
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:27.591
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

256
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:31.370
<v Speaker 2>what you see is that you had a seamless sort of phenomenon going on and those</v>

257
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:32.420
<v Speaker 2>kind of communities,</v>

258
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.080
<v Speaker 2>what's his name,</v>

259
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.411
<v Speaker 2>urban,</v>

260
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:34.244
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

261
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

262
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 2>his great book land of our fathers,</v>

263
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 2>a home of our fathers,</v>

264
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.470
<v Speaker 2>he kind of described all of these pathological behaviors that happened in that</v>

265
00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:43.304
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

266
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Many of those same behaviors were attributed to crack cocaine and black people</v>

267
00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:48.254
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>

268
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's not it,</v>

269
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 2>they were there long before crack cocaine was there,</v>

270
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 2>but crack cocaine became the scapegoat.</v>

271
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.490
<v Speaker 1>That's a fascinating scapegoat</v>

272
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 2>because I bought into it hook,</v>

273
00:08:57.961 --> 00:08:58.621
<v Speaker 2>line and sinker.</v>

274
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 2>I really thought that there was a difference between the 1980s in the 1990s as</v>

275
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 2>far as like when crack was introduced,</v>

276
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:04.951
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

277
00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:05.640
<v Speaker 2>it took off.</v>

278
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.750
<v Speaker 2>It was sort of something that was just always discussed as like common facts.</v>

279
00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:10.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

280
00:09:10.371 --> 00:09:10.600
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

281
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I bought into a too and that's what drove me to pursue my education.</v>

282
00:09:14.531 --> 00:09:15.420
<v Speaker 2>And the way I did.</v>

283
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.860
<v Speaker 2>But as a result of pursuing that education,</v>

284
00:09:17.861 --> 00:09:20.770
<v Speaker 2>I discovered that it was not true.</v>

285
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.140
<v Speaker 1>So are these cultural myths the result of a politician like political campaigns,</v>

286
00:09:27.111 --> 00:09:30.260
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to clean up the streets and they attributed to certain issues,</v>

287
00:09:30.261 --> 00:09:31.094
<v Speaker 1>or is it,</v>

288
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.050
<v Speaker 1>is it something more widespread?</v>

289
00:09:33.051 --> 00:09:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Is it the media just to we're running with a narrative.</v>

290
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:36.711
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

291
00:09:36.711 --> 00:09:37.341
<v Speaker 1>How'd it get started?</v>

292
00:09:37.341 --> 00:09:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

293
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.810
<v Speaker 2>there were multiple sort of of factors and players involved.</v>

294
00:09:40.811 --> 00:09:42.250
<v Speaker 2>So when we think about the politicians,</v>

295
00:09:42.251 --> 00:09:43.084
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

296
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.320
<v Speaker 2>politicians,</v>

297
00:09:44.321 --> 00:09:46.150
<v Speaker 2>if crack cocaine is the problem,</v>

298
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:51.070
<v Speaker 2>nevermind the fact that unemployment rate was out of control before crack</v>

299
00:09:51.071 --> 00:09:51.970
<v Speaker 2>cocaine hit the mark,</v>

300
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.073
<v Speaker 2>hit the market,</v>

301
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.000
<v Speaker 2>unemployment was out of control.</v>

302
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.000
<v Speaker 2>A number of things were already uh,</v>

303
00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.893
<v Speaker 2>problematic.</v>

304
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Now you have crack cocaine.</v>

305
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.870
<v Speaker 2>If you blame crack cocaine,</v>

306
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.440
<v Speaker 2>it's really easy to simply say,</v>

307
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.210
<v Speaker 2>we'll put more law enforcement,</v>

308
00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.111
<v Speaker 2>we'll hire more.</v>

309
00:10:08.111 --> 00:10:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Cops will put more efforts in controlling drugs.</v>

310
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.850
<v Speaker 2>A lot easier to say,</v>

311
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.550
<v Speaker 2>we'll lock people up for selling these drugs,</v>

312
00:10:15.551 --> 00:10:16.870
<v Speaker 2>for using these drugs.</v>

313
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.310
<v Speaker 2>In the process.</v>

314
00:10:18.311 --> 00:10:22.270
<v Speaker 2>What you do is you create jobs for a select group of people and then you don't</v>

315
00:10:22.271 --> 00:10:24.340
<v Speaker 2>have to deal with the real issues,</v>

316
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.350
<v Speaker 2>the real issues of unemployment,</v>

317
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:27.790
<v Speaker 2>of deprivation.</v>

318
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.380
<v Speaker 2>All of these things you don't have to deal with.</v>

319
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.340
<v Speaker 2>There are far more complicated and so politicians are happy to buy in.</v>

320
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.061
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

321
00:10:34.061 --> 00:10:38.140
<v Speaker 2>one of the things about crack cocaine is that when we think about the law that</v>

322
00:10:38.141 --> 00:10:42.070
<v Speaker 2>punishes or punish crack cocaine a hundred times more harshly than powder</v>

323
00:10:42.071 --> 00:10:42.904
<v Speaker 2>cocaine,</v>

324
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.510
<v Speaker 2>and the vast majority of people who got punished under these laws were black.</v>

325
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:46.961
<v Speaker 2>80,</v>

326
00:10:46.961 --> 00:10:48.250
<v Speaker 2>85% of the people,</v>

327
00:10:48.251 --> 00:10:50.740
<v Speaker 2>even though they don't make up the majority of the users.</v>

328
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.600
<v Speaker 2>So people will say things like,</v>

329
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:52.841
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

330
00:10:52.841 --> 00:10:57.010
<v Speaker 2>where those laws racist and the laws themselves weren't racist because the</v>

331
00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.780
<v Speaker 2>congressional black caucus,</v>

332
00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:02.690
<v Speaker 2>17 of the 21 members voted to uh,</v>

333
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.790
<v Speaker 2>for these laws,</v>

334
00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:07.390
<v Speaker 2>for these laws that punish crack cocaine a hundred times more harshly.</v>

335
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.470
<v Speaker 2>But the point is,</v>

336
00:11:08.471 --> 00:11:10.570
<v Speaker 2>is that everyone bought into it.</v>

337
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Parents bought into it because the parents,</v>

338
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:13.871
<v Speaker 2>for the parents,</v>

339
00:11:13.871 --> 00:11:18.100
<v Speaker 2>what this meant is that you don't actually have to educate your kids about this.</v>

340
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.590
<v Speaker 2>You just say that they're bad and stay away from it.</v>

341
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.090
<v Speaker 2>No education required.</v>

342
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

343
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.390
<v Speaker 2>even sciences and treatment providers,</v>

344
00:11:25.391 --> 00:11:27.970
<v Speaker 2>they all bought into it because you got a problem,</v>

345
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.440
<v Speaker 2>we're going to solve your problem.</v>

346
00:11:29.441 --> 00:11:31.760
<v Speaker 2>So we are needed and we are valued all.</v>

347
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:36.730
<v Speaker 2>So you had all of these sort of constituencies from society benefiting from the</v>

348
00:11:36.731 --> 00:11:39.490
<v Speaker 2>vilification or to escape goating of crack cocaine.</v>

349
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.600
<v Speaker 2>All of those things think came together nicely and then we think about the</v>

350
00:11:43.601 --> 00:11:44.434
<v Speaker 2>wrappers.</v>

351
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.490
<v Speaker 2>They all came into the game too because it's like unconscious.</v>

352
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say that this is a problem in my community and I care about my,</v>

353
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.180
<v Speaker 2>and this is the way that I can show it.</v>

354
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 2>So everybody had a stake in this sort of.</v>

355
00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

356
00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

357
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.400
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely fascinating.</v>

358
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:02.743
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

359
00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.010
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've,</v>

360
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.160
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to quite a few people about when it comes to,</v>

361
00:12:07.161 --> 00:12:07.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

362
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.300
<v Speaker 1>issues like real complex issues like drug addiction.</v>

363
00:12:11.301 --> 00:12:16.301
<v Speaker 1>And violence and poverty is that once you feed it with any organism,</v>

364
00:12:17.631 --> 00:12:21.650
<v Speaker 1>whether it's that organism is law enforcement or that organism is education,</v>

365
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.050
<v Speaker 1>whichever one you feed is the one that's going to grow.</v>

366
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:29.000
<v Speaker 1>And once you feed the law enforcement one and you look at this really complex</v>

367
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.863
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

368
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.430
<v Speaker 1>I think law enforcement is important,</v>

369
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.420
<v Speaker 1>but I think education is probably more important to avoid future law</v>

370
00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:35.991
<v Speaker 1>enforcement.</v>

371
00:12:35.991 --> 00:12:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Like the more I think the more education we have,</v>

372
00:12:38.301 --> 00:12:38.811
<v Speaker 1>the the,</v>

373
00:12:38.811 --> 00:12:43.811
<v Speaker 1>the more nuanced our ability to raise children is the more we understand that</v>

374
00:12:44.391 --> 00:12:45.380
<v Speaker 1>we're all in this together,</v>

375
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.000
<v Speaker 1>the less you're gonna need law enforcement.</v>

376
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.930
<v Speaker 1>But when law enforcement becomes this machine that lobbies against the</v>

377
00:12:50.931 --> 00:12:52.730
<v Speaker 1>legalization of certain drugs,</v>

378
00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:54.800
<v Speaker 1>which when you start looking at the data,</v>

379
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:56.570
<v Speaker 1>there's only one reason to do that.</v>

380
00:12:56.571 --> 00:12:59.510
<v Speaker 1>And the only reason is that you're trying to stay alive.</v>

381
00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:00.680
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to grow,</v>

382
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:01.580
<v Speaker 1>you're an organism,</v>

383
00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:02.180
<v Speaker 1>you're trying,</v>

384
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.250
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to eat the sugar that's trying to keep going.</v>

385
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:08.240
<v Speaker 1>So you're creating more jobs by putting people in jail.</v>

386
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.110
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially,</v>

387
00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.730
<v Speaker 1>no one wants to look at it like this,</v>

388
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:11.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's a form of slavery.</v>

389
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

390
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.510
<v Speaker 2>I think we in the house,</v>

391
00:13:14.511 --> 00:13:15.440
<v Speaker 2>I live in the film,</v>

392
00:13:15.441 --> 00:13:16.890
<v Speaker 2>Eugene Gr direct these film that,</v>

393
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the kind of analogy he was trying to draw in that film.</v>

394
00:13:20.241 --> 00:13:20.841
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

395
00:13:20.841 --> 00:13:21.674
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

396
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:22.910
<v Speaker 2>I think we get it.</v>

397
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.620
<v Speaker 2>I think a number of people get that.</v>

398
00:13:24.621 --> 00:13:26.180
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what it is.</v>

399
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:28.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
