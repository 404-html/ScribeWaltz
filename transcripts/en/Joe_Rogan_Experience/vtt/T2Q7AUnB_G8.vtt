00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:03.291
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3
00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 2>this is a quote from Ray Kurzweil,</v>

4
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:06.930
<v Speaker 2>which is things aren't getting worse.</v>

5
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Our information's getting better,</v>

6
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

7
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 2>And so with Hillary Clinton,</v>

8
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.260
<v Speaker 2>who is a career politician,</v>

9
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.273
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

10
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.070
<v Speaker 2>And we've all known since we were young,</v>

11
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:20.701
<v Speaker 2>most people,</v>

12
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 2>I think when they think about politicians,</v>

13
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 2>they don't think those are some honest people.</v>

14
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Those politicians,</v>

15
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 2>they usually are telling the truth.</v>

16
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 2>I think most of his think politicians,</v>

17
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.003
<v Speaker 2>they lie,</v>

18
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 2>they warp things,</v>

19
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:34.350
<v Speaker 2>they fabricate things,</v>

20
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.560
<v Speaker 2>they use a form of deception to gain control of various power structures.</v>

21
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 2>That's what the animal does.</v>

22
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.550
<v Speaker 2>So that's not new information when you find out that Hillary Clinton and the</v>

23
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 2>DNC,</v>

24
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know if they completely connected those two,</v>

25
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 2>but when you find out that they,</v>

26
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

27
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 2>they were not,</v>

28
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 2>they didn't do what they're supposed to do.</v>

29
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.860
<v Speaker 2>They helped Hillary Clinton become the Democratic nominee and they actively</v>

30
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 2>tried to fuck up Bernie Sanders.</v>

31
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

32
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.983
<v Speaker 2>That's creepy.</v>

33
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 2>But it's not a new thing.</v>

34
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.571
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

35
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:07.321
<v Speaker 1>but it is creepy.</v>

36
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>It's creepy.</v>

37
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's even more creepy that the woman who was in charge resigns and then</v>

38
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>immediately gets hired.</v>

39
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Great Shot.</v>

40
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.611
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

41
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Great job.</v>

42
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton's like,</v>

43
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

44
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hire you and it won't do anything.</v>

45
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.580
<v Speaker 2>She hires her.</v>

46
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.670
<v Speaker 2>She's so fucking unafraid of what's going to happen that she hires the woman who</v>

47
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:27.690
<v Speaker 2>did such shitty thing,</v>

48
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 2>she</v>

49
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 1>had to resign booed off stage.</v>

50
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Hires her into her fucking party cause she's like,</v>

51
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.433
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

52
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting elected.</v>

53
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Are Not stopping it.</v>

54
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

55
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>But this is again tech.</v>

56
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>It's gangster too though.</v>

57
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>It's also a move in on her part where,</v>

58
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:50.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's looking at it like what Trump is calling her crooked Hillary like</v>

59
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

60
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a gangster move to hire a woman like that.</v>

61
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Like right in front of you.</v>

62
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:01:55.381 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Wasserman Schultz top post mission accomplished the DNC.</v>

64
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.171
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

65
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>this is not a new,</v>

66
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>this is not a new thing man.</v>

67
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>This is what exactly,</v>

68
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>well let's go over this because what exactly did they do that's so awful about</v>

69
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:09.901
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders?</v>

70
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:10.734
<v Speaker 1>What did they do?</v>

71
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.310
<v Speaker 2>They apparently came up with a way to disseminate information to the press,</v>

72
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 2>highlighting certain aspects of Bernie Sanders that would be unappealing to the</v>

73
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:19.010
<v Speaker 2>voter</v>

74
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.050
<v Speaker 1>and they did this and this has all been confirmed.</v>

75
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Can you,</v>

76
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.951
<v Speaker 1>can you,</v>

77
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:22.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Google that?</v>

79
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Find out what they actually said.</v>

80
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.921
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out what the,</v>

81
00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:28.670
<v Speaker 1>actually summarize the Wiki if we think they're being a bunch of whiny bitches,</v>

82
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 1>but for sure they wanted him.</v>

83
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.591
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

84
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:33.440
<v Speaker 1>she's got way deeper arms in politics.</v>

85
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 1>She's way more connected than he is for sure.</v>

86
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:35.810
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

87
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.860
<v Speaker 1>and this is what we're seeing too,</v>

88
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>that it's like a big part of being a political candidate is how many favors do</v>

89
00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:41.030
<v Speaker 1>you have?</v>

90
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>How many people you are you connected to,</v>

91
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.010
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

92
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.720
<v Speaker 1>how deep does your influence go?</v>

93
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

94
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.210
<v Speaker 1>And obviously her influence didn't just sit within her are her own little group</v>

95
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:53.270
<v Speaker 1>of people that were working for it had gotten to the DNC itself.</v>

96
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:54.020
<v Speaker 1>So she's,</v>

97
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 1>she's deeply embedded in this whole system,</v>

98
00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>whether it's because of friendships or ideologies or people just wanted her,</v>

99
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>she's the chosen one.</v>

100
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Whatever reason,</v>

101
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>whatever deals were made or whoever,</v>

102
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>who knows who knows what it is.</v>

103
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>But when you find out that an organization that's supposed to be the head,</v>

104
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.521
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be,</v>

105
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>

106
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>if everything was on the up and up,</v>

107
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be objective and looking for what the people want as the best</v>

108
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>

109
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.210
<v Speaker 1>but now they're actually actively steering it,</v>

110
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>which is massively corrupt and kind of scary is that these people are deciding</v>

111
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>to steer an entire party,</v>

112
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>which is 50% of a political process because there's no,</v>

113
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

114
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.190
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

115
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>we've got libertarian party for the first time people are taking Gary Johnson.</v>

116
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:32.481
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>

117
00:03:32.481 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>it's going to do that.</v>

118
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

119
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

120
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>a town hall debate on Wednesday or town hall,</v>

121
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>one of those town hall things on Wednesday on CNN,</v>

122
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part it's Democrats or Republicans in most people's eyes.</v>

123
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>So would there essentially doing is rigging half of that process?</v>

124
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

125
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>That's Carrie that we just,</v>

126
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 1>we don't think anything's wrong with that,</v>

127
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 1>but we put Martha Stewart in jail for not telling exactly the truth about where</v>

128
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:58.950
<v Speaker 1>she bought and sold stocks or whatever the fuck she lied about.</v>

129
00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.630
<v Speaker 1>We do that</v>

130
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.250
<v Speaker 2>think something's wrong about it,</v>

131
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.650
<v Speaker 2>but we can't do anything about it.</v>

132
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.180
<v Speaker 2>We do think something's wrong,</v>

133
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.133
<v Speaker 2>but right now,</v>

134
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.891
<v Speaker 2>but okay,</v>

135
00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:11.891
<v Speaker 2>so if like that institution is corrupt and if the Republican institution is in</v>

136
00:04:12.261 --> 00:04:13.430
<v Speaker 2>some ways corrupt,</v>

137
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.130
<v Speaker 2>I think it might be safe to say,</v>

138
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.810
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think too many people would be outraged at the idea that there is a</v>

139
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.590
<v Speaker 2>institutionalized corruption in the entire American political system and it's</v>

140
00:04:27.321 --> 00:04:30.500
<v Speaker 2>very similar to the problem that happens in bike racing.</v>

141
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 2>If one motherfucker rigs their bike or gets on fucking doping stuff that can't</v>

142
00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:37.034
<v Speaker 2>be detected.</v>

143
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.170
<v Speaker 2>If you want to have a fair advantage,</v>

144
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.290
<v Speaker 2>you've got a rig your bike and start doping to,</v>

145
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.020
<v Speaker 2>or the person who rigs their bike will always win.</v>

146
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.080
<v Speaker 2>So if politics is a competition,</v>

147
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.490
<v Speaker 2>which it clearly is,</v>

148
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 2>and if members of the competition are using nefarious means to achieve their</v>

149
00:04:55.131 --> 00:04:55.641
<v Speaker 2>goals,</v>

150
00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:56.600
<v Speaker 2>which they clearly are,</v>

151
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.830
<v Speaker 2>which they clearly are,</v>

152
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.370
<v Speaker 2>then that would imply that if you wanted to survive in that system,</v>

153
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.720
<v Speaker 2>you would also have to use nefarious means dom,</v>

154
00:05:05.721 --> 00:05:06.554
<v Speaker 2>dom.</v>

155
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.053
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

156
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.540
<v Speaker 2>this is not new.</v>

157
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 2>This is old,</v>

158
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>

159
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.661
<v Speaker 2>old shit.</v>

160
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 2>What's new is technology.</v>

161
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.510
<v Speaker 2>What's new is now people like Julian Assan change are shining a light on the</v>

162
00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 2>corruption in his whole ideas.</v>

163
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.410
<v Speaker 2>If I reveal this information,</v>

164
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.650
<v Speaker 2>it will force reform via the outrage of the people who are supposed to be</v>

165
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 2>represented by a person who's breaking the law.</v>

166
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.760
<v Speaker 2>That's his idea.</v>

167
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.080
<v Speaker 2>We need reform.</v>

168
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 2>And right now we're at the point where it's very similar to when you're in a</v>

169
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:44.890
<v Speaker 2>family and this is one of the worst things can fucking happen,</v>

170
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

171
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 2>In a family.</v>

172
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 2>If there is somebody who's molesting somebody,</v>

173
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:51.110
<v Speaker 2>it happens all the time where uh,</v>

174
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

175
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 2>a father or a brother,</v>

176
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 2>we'll start fucking molesting somebody,</v>

177
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

178
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 2>But in people in the family know it,</v>

179
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 2>but they don't do anything about it.</v>

180
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.030
<v Speaker 2>Because to talk about what GRANDPA does every couple of years means the complete</v>

181
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 2>disintegration of the fucking family,</v>

182
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 2>an apocalypse for the family.</v>

183
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.210
<v Speaker 2>And the same way is more of these revelations become clear,</v>

184
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 2>which we always knew.</v>

185
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 2>But you could always float into a happy place and be like,</v>

186
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

187
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm just being a conspiracy dude.</v>

188
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure the stuff they're doing up on Capitol Hill is all fair and square.</v>

189
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.670
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

190
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

191
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 2>you can just pretend to believe it now it's like,</v>

192
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 2>well now you're wrong.</v>

193
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

194
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

195
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 2>here's the fucking proof and here's going to be more proof and there's going to</v>

196
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 2>be more proof and there's going to be more proof until finally the American</v>

197
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 2>people are going to have to either just be like,</v>

198
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to believe that fours three and three is four because I have a</v>

199
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:54.920
<v Speaker 2>nice comfortable life and I don't want to fucking deal with this shit,</v>

200
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:55.580
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

201
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to trust the banks because the banks lie.</v>

202
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 2>They like money at my job and as long as I keep my job,</v>

203
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 2>I'll keep my benefits.</v>

204
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

205
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

206
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.511
<v Speaker 2>ps,</v>

207
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

208
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.340
<v Speaker 2>when you consider that,</v>

209
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's something pragmatic about that.</v>

210
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:12.160
<v Speaker 2>As sad as it is theirs,</v>

211
00:07:12.161 --> 00:07:12.341
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

212
00:07:12.341 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

213
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.641
<v Speaker 2>as depressing.</v>

214
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:14.040
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

215
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.451
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

216
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:19.451
<v Speaker 2>But they're the real awful problem is that this country,</v>

217
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 2>I think is that they get metaphysical machine that was built by some very</v>

218
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:30.260
<v Speaker 2>intelligent people who understood the energy flow that comes through a society</v>

219
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.250
<v Speaker 2>and the elections were supposed to be an outlet valve for the pressure that</v>

220
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 2>builds up when people feel that they're being repressed,</v>

221
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:37.880
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

222
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.880
<v Speaker 2>And if you start fucking with that output valve by putting up fake politicians</v>

223
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.540
<v Speaker 2>that don't truly represent the people and hope that the people will believe that</v>

224
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:49.010
<v Speaker 2>they have elected these people,</v>

225
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 2>if you put two shitty choices in front of us and we're supposed to look at that</v>

226
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:53.580
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>

227
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.413
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

228
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.820
<v Speaker 2>everything's fine,</v>

229
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 2>then you're,</v>

230
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.790
<v Speaker 2>you're missing the point,</v>

231
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.840
<v Speaker 2>which is that there is an energetic system that needs to get released.</v>

232
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

233
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.080
<v Speaker 2>at some point the energy's got to go out.</v>

234
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't go out,</v>

235
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.480
<v Speaker 2>you get revolution.</v>

236
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.690
<v Speaker 2>That's what the way the energy goes out the wrong way.</v>

237
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 2>The idea is let's fucking the American revolution,</v>

238
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.130
<v Speaker 2>brutal,</v>

239
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 2>bloody,</v>

240
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.460
<v Speaker 2>awful fucked these geniuses.</v>

241
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.310
<v Speaker 2>Many of them Freemasons got together and they were like,</v>

242
00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:23.144
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

243
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Is there a way that we can program history so that a society doesn't destroy</v>

244
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 2>itself intermittently with a fucking revolution?</v>

245
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Because if we could do that,</v>

246
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:37.570
<v Speaker 2>we'll build one of the most powerful never ending societies on earth because we</v>

247
00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:41.540
<v Speaker 2>figured out a way to outflow the pressure that builds up.</v>

248
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 2>So when you start fucking with a goddamn political system and pretend that</v>

249
00:08:45.261 --> 00:08:46.610
<v Speaker 2>everything's gonna be okay,</v>

250
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.170
<v Speaker 2>you are missing,</v>

251
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.760
<v Speaker 2>I think the the point which is that people who are very smart,</v>

252
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:57.910
<v Speaker 2>maybe a lot smarter than then the politicians we have today recognize something,</v>

253
00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.820
<v Speaker 2>built a thing and said,</v>

254
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:01.440
<v Speaker 2>let's just trust the fucking people.</v>

255
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Let's trust the people release the steam and while ah,</v>

256
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 2>everything runs according to plan.</v>

257
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Now the gears are a little fucking gummed up man.</v>

258
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.880
<v Speaker 2>A little,</v>

259
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.713
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

260
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.580
<v Speaker 2>a little how gummed up,</v>

261
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 2>how gummed up the gears are really crazy comes up.</v>

262
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.060
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time we're realizing how much money people make by running for</v>

263
00:09:23.061 --> 00:09:23.894
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

264
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.531
<v Speaker 1>How much,</v>

265
00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:24.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

266
00:09:24.771 --> 00:09:26.420
<v Speaker 1>money costs to run for president.</v>

267
00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:31.421
<v Speaker 1>But how much money top political figures make and donations and in speeches have</v>

268
00:09:31.551 --> 00:09:31.731
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

269
00:09:31.731 --> 00:09:34.760
<v Speaker 1>have you paid attention to how much they make in speeches like Rudy Giuliani and</v>

270
00:09:34.761 --> 00:09:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton may bribes?</v>

271
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

272
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.020
<v Speaker 1>this is what it is.</v>

273
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.910
<v Speaker 1>These corporations can fund various,</v>

274
00:09:43.911 --> 00:09:44.091
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

275
00:09:44.091 --> 00:09:45.020
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>

276
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:49.640
<v Speaker 1>They can donate money to have all sorts of different programs where they would</v>

277
00:09:49.641 --> 00:09:53.720
<v Speaker 1>have someone speak and they can decide who gets to speak and who doesn't get to</v>

278
00:09:53.721 --> 00:09:54.320
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>

279
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.540
<v Speaker 1>And they also have like the Clinton Foundation,</v>

280
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.400
<v Speaker 1>people donate money into that.</v>

281
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.180
<v Speaker 1>They don't donate to sh fuck loads of now it's all these things,</v>

282
00:10:02.181 --> 00:10:05.270
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a second says all these things with what they are essentially.</v>

283
00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:05.601
<v Speaker 1>Or you're,</v>

284
00:10:05.601 --> 00:10:10.010
<v Speaker 1>you're paying someone to speak for an hour and you're going to give him $750,000</v>

285
00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:11.570
<v Speaker 1>and you want me to pretend that that's normal.</v>

286
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.130
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

287
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.420
<v Speaker 1>And what does this person do?</v>

288
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.620
<v Speaker 1>They are a public servant.</v>

289
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

290
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:17.061
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

291
00:10:17.061 --> 00:10:19.550
<v Speaker 1>So there are public servant and while they're publicly serving,</v>

292
00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:23.480
<v Speaker 1>they're also making $750,000 to talk.</v>

293
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

294
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.670
<v Speaker 1>that seems a little crazy,</v>

295
00:10:25.671 --> 00:10:26.360
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

296
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:26.541
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

297
00:10:26.541 --> 00:10:29.840
<v Speaker 1>why do they make so much money to do that and who was paying them and what what,</v>

298
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.490
<v Speaker 1>what do you have to benefit by having them come and read some nonsense,</v>

299
00:10:34.491 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>

300
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.800
<v Speaker 1>boring speech.</v>

301
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.860
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine went to see Rudy Giuliani after post nine one one when he was</v>

302
00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:40.820
<v Speaker 1>on his victory tour.</v>

303
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.400
<v Speaker 1>He was on like a lap of the country doing these,</v>

304
00:10:43.401 --> 00:10:46.310
<v Speaker 1>these speeches because everybody loved him because he's saved the world.</v>

305
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.540
<v Speaker 1>During September 11th he was the guy who stood strong,</v>

306
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.271
<v Speaker 1>everybody like,</v>

307
00:10:50.271 --> 00:10:50.601
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

308
00:10:50.601 --> 00:10:51.151
<v Speaker 1>Rudy Giuliani,</v>

309
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:51.531
<v Speaker 1>he's a good man.</v>

310
00:10:51.531 --> 00:10:54.290
<v Speaker 1>So he wrote that and he started doing these speeches and he'd come to colleges</v>

311
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.910
<v Speaker 1>and a friend of mine went to see him and said it was dog shit that he just,</v>

312
00:10:58.911 --> 00:11:03.440
<v Speaker 1>it was a boring ass like reading with no passion.</v>

313
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.820
<v Speaker 1>It was a chick chain go in there and say some nonsense about freedom and the</v>

314
00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:12.590
<v Speaker 1>American way and terrorism or whatever the fuck and first responders and just</v>

315
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

316
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.420
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't anything real.</v>

317
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:15.050
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

318
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.130
<v Speaker 1>it was a performance.</v>

319
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.270
<v Speaker 1>It was like he was doing a one man show all across the country for exorbitant</v>

320
00:11:20.271 --> 00:11:21.104
<v Speaker 1>sums of money.</v>

321
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:21.981
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

322
00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:24.920
<v Speaker 1>that'd be fucking great if he was actually doing a one man show,</v>

323
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:29.950
<v Speaker 1>hundred and $53 million in bill and Hillary Clinton speaking fees documented.</v>

324
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:31.641
<v Speaker 1>This is just,</v>

325
00:11:31.641 --> 00:11:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Jamie just pulled this up.</v>

326
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.290
<v Speaker 1>That that is stunning.</v>

327
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a s dunning amount of money and whatever,</v>

328
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.211
<v Speaker 1>15 years.</v>

329
00:11:41.211 --> 00:11:44.540
<v Speaker 1>It's from 2001 to about now it's it still,</v>

330
00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:45.171
<v Speaker 1>it's more than,</v>

331
00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:45.590

337
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.573
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

338
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 1>She prefers a private jet and prefers a Gulfstream four 50 or larger.</v>

339
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 1>The memo outlines at Clinton requires travel by private jet.</v>

340
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.391
<v Speaker 2>Is this like,</v>

344
00:12:09.391 --> 00:12:11.310
<v Speaker 2>what if you are like a mad billionaire?</v>

345
00:12:11.311 --> 00:12:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Could you just get Hillary Clinton to come to your house and like just speak to</v>

346
00:12:14.881 --> 00:12:16.650
<v Speaker 2>you for an hour and your living room?</v>

347
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 1>This is fascinating.</v>

348
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:20.301
<v Speaker 1>Hold up,</v>

349
00:12:20.301 --> 00:12:21.310
<v Speaker 1>but scroll back down there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She may $21 million to and what?</v>

351
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.770

352
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:29.423
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

353
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.650
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

354
00:12:31.651 --> 00:12:32.910
<v Speaker 2>That's so much money.</v>

355
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:37.740
<v Speaker 2>She's like a kind of like crazy animal that you can like lure with money.</v>

356
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Like you can actually,</v>

357
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.430
<v Speaker 2>if you have enough money you can learn again,</v>

358
00:12:41.431 --> 00:12:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton into your house.</v>

359
00:12:42.811 --> 00:12:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Like you just have to lay it out.</v>

360
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.941
<v Speaker 2>She'll show up.</v>

361
00:12:44.941 --> 00:12:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Like if I put carrots in my backyard,</v>

362
00:12:46.591 --> 00:12:47.850
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably get a rabbit or two.</v>

363
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.110
<v Speaker 2>If you have enough money,</v>

364
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.610
<v Speaker 2>you can get politicians to come and start feeding it your mansion.</v>

365
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:53.950
<v Speaker 1>When does it become,</v>

366
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.260
<v Speaker 1>when does it become bribe?</v>

367
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:55.661
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

368
00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:57.640
<v Speaker 1>so should she like say,</v>

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:57.881
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

370
00:12:57.881 --> 00:12:58.900
<v Speaker 1>you can never be,</v>

371
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.120
<v Speaker 1>it's weird,</v>

372
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:01.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

373
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.450
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't be someone who is in public office and go and also have like a,</v>

374
00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:11.731
<v Speaker 1>a book reading tour where you read from your novel about crime or something like</v>

375
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:11.951
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

376
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:16.320
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to be like a no fiction person who's we?</v>

377
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.230
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking,</v>

378
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about what you do for work.</v>

379
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.680
<v Speaker 1>That's part of what you're talking about.</v>

380
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:20.951
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

381
00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:24.910
<v Speaker 1>nobody's gonna re ask Hillary Clinton to come and speak about the history of</v>

382
00:13:24.911 --> 00:13:26.110
<v Speaker 1>jazz in the United States.</v>

383
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.591
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

384
00:13:26.591 --> 00:13:28.000
<v Speaker 1>She's not going to give speeches on that.</v>

385
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.740
<v Speaker 1>It's going to give speeches on politics.</v>

386
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.633
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

387
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:31.250
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

388
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:31.570
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

389
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:31.751
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

390
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:32.320
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

391
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.030
<v Speaker 1>so why is that okay.</v>

392
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Why can you like have two jobs?</v>

393
00:13:35.801 --> 00:13:37.300
<v Speaker 1>That means you're having a second job.</v>

394
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Like you're doing your job.</v>

395
00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>

396
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.500
<v Speaker 1>you're saying the things that you say during your job,</v>

397
00:13:41.501 --> 00:13:42.910
<v Speaker 1>but somebody else is paying you to,</v>

398
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.470
<v Speaker 1>why is it okay that,</v>

399
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:45.490
<v Speaker 1>why is it okay to do that?</v>

400
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

402
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.380
<v Speaker 1>that seems like very problematic.</v>

403
00:13:50.381 --> 00:13:51.214
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

404
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.850
