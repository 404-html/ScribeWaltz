<v Speaker 1>books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

44
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I became a big fan of audio books many </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

45
00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best ways to spend time </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're forced to sit down and,</v>

46
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually it's wasted time whether you're </v>

47
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.530
<v Speaker 1>on a plane or whether you're driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere stuck in traffic or on a train</v>

48
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:22.531
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Audio books make an amazing companion </v>

49
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:25.180
<v Speaker 1>and actually make a boring trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enjoyable.</v>

50
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm Christopher Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our friend who is on the podcast again </v>

51
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.110
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe your book is available.</v>

52
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex at dawn is available in audio form.</v>

53
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.210
<v Speaker 2>It was voted one of the best audio books</v>
<v Speaker 2>of 2010 when it came out.</v>

54
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.320
<v Speaker 2>And I actually read the preface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a story of being attacked by a </v>

55
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.020
<v Speaker 2>monkey who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

56
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.260
<v Speaker 2>who read the book for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who reads the other two actors.</v>

57
00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:52.810
<v Speaker 2>There's a female and a male actor who </v>
<v Speaker 2>read,</v>

58
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we,</v>

59
00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:56.800
<v Speaker 2>we asked that there be two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a male and a female voice,</v>

60
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since it was coauthored with my,</v>

61
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.360
<v Speaker 2>someone's</v>

62

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:05.520
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of weird though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

65
00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:06.120
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

66
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't you read it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While I offer to.</v>

67
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.900
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't let him in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

68
00:03:09.901 --> 00:03:10.590
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>

69
00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sons of bitches.</v>

70
00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:14.100
<v Speaker 2>But no thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

71
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're a first time author you </v>

72
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.130
<v Speaker 2>don't get a lot of respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to say.</v>

73
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.380
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second time around,</v>

74
00:03:19.381 --> 00:03:21.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole different thing if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first book sell.</v>

75
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine.</v>

76
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But first time around you,</v>

77
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.040
<v Speaker 2>they treat you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

78
00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:29.430
<v Speaker 2>I had a dispute with one of the editors </v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

79
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.710
<v Speaker 2>which ended with her crying and hanging </v>
<v Speaker 2>up on me</v>

80
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 3>and in earlier crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no crying in publishing</v>

81
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.930
<v Speaker 2>and then she quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

82
00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:40.850
<v Speaker 2>like within A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

83
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I really made her quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

84
00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:45.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that it was me or I was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last straw,</v>

85
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.290
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

86
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:49.200
<v Speaker 2>it didn't end well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But an earlier conversation with her,</v>

87
00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:54.201
<v Speaker 2>she was saying something and I said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were talking about the cover </v>

88
00:03:54.511 --> 00:03:57.510
<v Speaker 2>art and they had different ideas and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

89
00:03:57.511 --> 00:03:58.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

90
00:03:58.111 --> 00:03:59.310
<v Speaker 2>the one you sent me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cool,</v>

91
00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:04.311
<v Speaker 2>but why don't you send me your other </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and then we can brainstorm </v>

92
00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:04.860
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>

93
00:04:04.861 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

94
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.500
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

95
00:04:06.501 --> 00:04:11.501
<v Speaker 2>we authors can only see one idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I were business partners here.</v>

96
00:04:11.671 --> 00:04:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Why can't I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

97
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.080
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

98
00:04:15.081 --> 00:04:16.860
<v Speaker 2>why can't I be involved in this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>

99
00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:21.861
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't have the inmates running the </v>

100
00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:21.861
<v Speaker 2>asylum.</v>

101
00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:22.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a prisoner now.</v>

102
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.620
<v Speaker 3>A mental Haas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

103
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a psychologist.</v>

104
00:04:25.941 --> 00:04:30.941
<v Speaker 3>My wife actually does run a mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>hospital or a 32 year old idiot.</v>

105
00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:36.830
<v Speaker 3>So this is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What made her quit?</v>

106
00:04:36.831 --> 00:04:40.250
<v Speaker 3>You call her a 32 year old idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I use those words,</v>

107
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.380
<v Speaker 3>but that was my implication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might have called her a cunt.</v>

108
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.480
<v Speaker 3>I might have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might have it comes out sometimes </v>

109
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.520
<v Speaker 3>there's moments when it's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a audible.</v>

110
00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:50.480
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than that,</v>

111
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.910
<v Speaker 3>audible has nothing to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christopher Ryan incident.</v>

112
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were wonderful except for not </v>

113
00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 3>letting me read the whole book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sons of bitches.</v>

114
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with you people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the monkey attacks the most </v>

115
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 3>important part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

116
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.240
<v Speaker 3>And you read that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did read that they should do a revised</v>

117
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.000
<v Speaker 3>version.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let you do it because I generally prefer</v>

118
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 3>except Stephen King,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stephen King is God damn terrible at </v>

119
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 3>reading his books.</v>

120
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.570
<v Speaker 3>He's so boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

121
00:05:14.571 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 3>when you have an author read the Stephen</v>
<v Speaker 3>King books that become exciting.</v>

122
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.260
<v Speaker 3>There's so much drama and but Stephen </v>
<v Speaker 3>King is so flat.</v>

123
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.230
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing author and one of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite fiction authors,</v>

124
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.950
<v Speaker 3>authors ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

125
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.690
<v Speaker 3>if you get his audio books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do not get one that's read by him,</v>

148
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.410

<v Speaker 1>one of the things he talked about was </v>

149
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.180
<v Speaker 1>you and he said that you're a dear </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and that if,</v>

152
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you actually bothered to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the trip all the way down from San </v>

153
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Francisco and do a podcast along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

154
00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.960
<v Speaker 1>How can they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can people get that podcast that you</v>

155
00:06:58.961 --> 00:06:59.740
<v Speaker 1>guys did along the way?</v>

156
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

157
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:03.640
<v Speaker 2>I guess we'll put it up this week and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:07:03.641 --> 00:07:08.641
<v Speaker 2>we've got a bunch in the pipeline but </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just bump everybody else and yet </v>

159
00:07:08.641 --> 00:07:12.880
<v Speaker 2>people can hear us driving down from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bakersfield on route five complaining </v>

160
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:12.880
<v Speaker 2>about the cow shit smell</v>

161
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.300
<v Speaker 1>big part of that trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

162
00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:16.690
<v Speaker 1>That is a weird drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

163
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took that drive before the elections </v>

164
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.370
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you realize a California,</v>

165
00:07:24.371 --> 00:07:29.371
<v Speaker 1>although California is mainly liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's these pockets where we have </v>

166
00:07:29.371 --> 00:07:31.260
<v Speaker 1>cities where everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:36.270
<v Speaker 1>is fairly literate and educated and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you spread out towards where they </v>

168
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.300
<v Speaker 1>grow things for some reason those folks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to believe and nonsense.</v>

169
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.930
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had Mitt Romney bumper stickers and</v>

170
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Mitt Romney posters and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where am I?</v>

171
00:07:46.781 --> 00:07:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Am I in Idaho or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>

172
00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:53.290
<v Speaker 1>What do you know who met Romney is?</v>

<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

174
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.500
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that line about Pennsylvania.</v>

175
00:07:56.501 --> 00:08:00.220
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in Pennsylvania and they say </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's Philadelphia on one side,</v>

176
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Pittsburgh on the other side in Alabama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

177
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.730
<v Speaker 1>so true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents,</v>

178
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.120
<v Speaker 1>my parents used to live in Wilkes Barre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

179
00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:07.680

<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

180
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:13.060
<v Speaker 1>that's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where people wear camouflage to </v>

181
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:13.060
<v Speaker 1>the grocery store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's total rush limbaugh country.</v>

<v Speaker 1>duck behind a car and shoot.</v>

184
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

185
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tangentially speaking,</v>

186
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:24.811
<v Speaker 2>that's the name of my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone wants to check out my extended </v>

187
00:08:24.811 --> 00:08:24.811
<v Speaker 2>conversation with Stanley?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they had.</v>

188
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.400

<v Speaker 2>Never enough.</v>

189
00:08:27.401 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Stanley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Stanley.</v>

190
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.140
<v Speaker 2>What was your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your name that the Shaman gave you,</v>

191
00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:33.640
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your spirit name?</v>

192
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rolling thunder gave me the name.</v>

193
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's everybody's favorite because </v>

194
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.250
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talked to me,</v>

195
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.230
<v Speaker 2>but a native American who was not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shotgun,</v>

196
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I dedicated this book to add </v>

197
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Richardson gave me the of Costa Wash </v>
<v Speaker 2>Day.</v>

198
00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:02.930
<v Speaker 5>And the best way to translate that is to</v>
<v Speaker 5>use a yiddish term mench.</v>

199
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.250
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I thought that was a great either </v>

200
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.951
<v Speaker 5>coming from the first native American </v>
<v Speaker 5>who got a clinical psychology phd in the</v>

201
00:09:12.141 --> 00:09:12.560
<v Speaker 5>country.</v>

202
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's this gentleman rolling </v>

203
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 1>thunder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

204
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.000
<v Speaker 5>the other guy who we dedicated the book </v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

205
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.150
<v Speaker 5>and regrettably as soon as the book came</v>
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>

206
00:09:23.151 --> 00:09:28.151
<v Speaker 5>he passed over to the advanced age,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the book is dedicated to him and his </v>

207
00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:31.430
<v Speaker 5>memory and our long friendship over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

208
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Now you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the few people that is alive </v>

209
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.721
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can say they did ask him with </v>

210
00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:40.721
<v Speaker 1>Timothy leary.</v>

211
00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:40.721
<v Speaker 5>Oh good heavens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm.</v>

212
00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there are more</v>

213
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.080
<v Speaker 1>people because tim leary to the acid </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of people.</v>

214
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the numbers are fairly small.</v>

215
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's less than one 10th of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one percent of the population,</v>

216
00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.700
<v Speaker 1>but you know how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small numbers can have magnificent </v>

217
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.760
<v Speaker 1>effects in chaos theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have about the butterfly wings </v>

218
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.210
<v Speaker 1>causing the typhoon and Malaysia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

219
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.450
<v Speaker 1>that's what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's.</v>

220
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.890
<v Speaker 1>People don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a metaphor.</v>

221
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a metaphor.</v>

222
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.880
<v Speaker 5>It's like a lot of stuff in shamanism is</v>
<v Speaker 5>metaphor.</v>

223
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.230
<v Speaker 5>You deal with it at the metaphorical </v>
<v Speaker 5>level than that.</v>

224
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.040
<v Speaker 5>Make sense?</v>

225
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.600
<v Speaker 1>The whole term shamanism is very tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

226
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:30.180
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say it amongst the respectable </v>

227
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:30.180
<v Speaker 1>company and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

228
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.960
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

229
00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:36.961
<v Speaker 1>Shamans and what happens with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>shamans do you do go to spirit worlds </v>

230
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.650
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

231
00:10:38.651 --> 00:10:40.600
<v Speaker 1>yes actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then like,</v>

232
00:10:40.601 --> 00:10:45.601
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then immediately the conversation </v>

233
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:45.601
<v Speaker 1>becomes they're talking to a silly </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

234
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:46.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is what I talked to</v>

235
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:51.670
<v Speaker 5>just I don't even use the word spirit </v>
<v Speaker 5>world for one thing to be a mom and you </v>

236
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:56.171
<v Speaker 5>have to be appointed the Shaman via </v>
<v Speaker 5>community and if the community doesn't </v>

237
00:10:56.241 --> 00:10:59.840
<v Speaker 5>consider you worthy of being a spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 5>leader,</v>

238
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.200
<v Speaker 5>then you don't pass the test and instead</v>
<v Speaker 5>of saying we go to a spirit world,</v>

239
00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:06.410
<v Speaker 5>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

240
00:11:06.411 --> 00:11:11.411
<v Speaker 5>Sharma's get knowledge and information </v>
<v Speaker 5>in ways that other members of their </v>

241
00:11:11.411 --> 00:11:15.440
<v Speaker 5>community camp and I just leave it up to</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

242
00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:15.980
<v Speaker 5>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

243
00:11:15.981 --> 00:11:16.780
<v Speaker 5>what ways?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

244
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.820
<v Speaker 5>they get information from their dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get information by observing </v>

245
00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.880
<v Speaker 5>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>observing people.</v>

246
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:28.120
<v Speaker 5>They have a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very keen sense of observation and </v>

247
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.720
<v Speaker 5>insight and then that starts to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense to them.</v>

248
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.560
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you mean like a Sarah Apis?</v>

249
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shamans were the first therapists </v>

250
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.970
<v Speaker 5>because they mediated problems between </v>
<v Speaker 5>couples.</v>

251
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.480
<v Speaker 5>They did a lot to keep the community </v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

252
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:46.810
<v Speaker 5>They help people to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they were sick or if they were </v>

253
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.381
<v Speaker 5>feeling poorly and so they were also the</v>
<v Speaker 5>first physicians of the first doctors </v>

254
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.950
<v Speaker 5>and they used herbs for reason or </v>
<v Speaker 5>another seem to work,</v>

255
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.190
<v Speaker 5>so taking it down to a very practical </v>
<v Speaker 5>level,</v>

256
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.940
<v Speaker 5>you can talk about shamanism and give </v>
<v Speaker 5>them the due respect,</v>

257
00:12:01.941 --> 00:12:03.350
<v Speaker 5>the life that they deserve,</v>

258
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.110
<v Speaker 1>but as a psychologist there's and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you are,</v>

259
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.640
<v Speaker 1>not that many people in that realm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional business who accept those </v>

260
00:12:13.921 --> 00:12:16.770
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use the term Shaman and it's.</v>

261
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.150
<v Speaker 1>That's where it gets tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

262
00:12:18.151 --> 00:12:23.151
<v Speaker 1>It gets tricky in that it's almost like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a professional word to you </v>

263
00:12:23.151 --> 00:12:27.741
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to to replace it with that people are </v>

264
00:12:27.741 --> 00:12:27.741
<v Speaker 1>going to accept in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

265
00:12:27.741 --> 00:12:27.840
<v Speaker 1>in the mainstream.</v>

266
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.380
<v Speaker 5>Actually the word Shaman Commerce from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the field of anthropology and the word </v>

267
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:39.631
<v Speaker 5>Shaman originated in Siberia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody knows just win because there were</v>

268
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:42.330
<v Speaker 5>three different tribes in Siberia that </v>
<v Speaker 5>used words,</v>

269
00:12:42.331 --> 00:12:44.160
<v Speaker 5>some of the Shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they'll.</v>

270
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:49.190
<v Speaker 5>Anthropologists began to notice that </v>
<v Speaker 5>spiritual practitioners and other </v>

271
00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:52.930
<v Speaker 5>indigenous societies did pretty much the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same things.</v>

272
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.510
<v Speaker 5>They helped people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They healed people.</v>

273
00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.610
<v Speaker 5>They use their imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did rituals,</v>

274
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.730
<v Speaker 5>they told myths and narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so these other people who had their </v>

275
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:12.661
<v Speaker 5>own words for shaman all got lumped </v>
<v Speaker 5>together by anthropologists using the </v>

276
00:13:12.911 --> 00:13:17.911
<v Speaker 5>term Shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we're sort of stuck with it and all </v>

277
00:13:17.911 --> 00:13:22.291
<v Speaker 5>that I can say is don't take it that </v>
<v Speaker 5>seriously because each tribe that you </v>

278
00:13:22.291 --> 00:13:24.730
<v Speaker 5>visit has its own word rolling thunder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

279
00:13:24.731 --> 00:13:29.731
<v Speaker 5>the subject of our book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Voice of Rolling Thunder never </v>

280
00:13:29.731 --> 00:13:32.761
<v Speaker 5>called himself a shaman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He called himself an inter tribal </v>

281
00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:36.451
<v Speaker 5>medicine man because he was able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>learn the medicine systems of five or </v>

282
00:13:37.421 --> 00:13:42.421
<v Speaker 5>six different native American tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had a whole trailer full of herbs,</v>

283
00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:48.571
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of herbs that I saw them </v>
<v Speaker 5>firsthand and he would take the herbs </v>

284
00:13:49.271 --> 00:13:53.410
<v Speaker 5>that would be most suitable for whoever </v>
<v Speaker 5>he was helping out as he put it,</v>

285
00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:58.411
<v Speaker 5>whoever he was doctoring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then of course he did a little </v>

286
00:13:58.411 --> 00:13:58.480
<v Speaker 5>ritual that went along with it.</v>

287
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Now how much of the herbs that he gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were actually effective and how </v>

288
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:04.130
<v Speaker 1>much of it was a placebo.</v>

289
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is one of the important ways in </v>

290
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.151
<v Speaker 5>which shamans contributed to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>evolution of the human species.</v>

291
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.990
<v Speaker 5>Obviously some of the herbs were </v>
<v Speaker 5>additional,</v>

292
00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:22.270
<v Speaker 5>obviously some of them were not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they work anyway because of the </v>

293
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.871
<v Speaker 5>placebo effect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but imagine a sick person coming to a </v>

294
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:27.830
<v Speaker 5>shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the shaman and giving them herbs,</v>

295
00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:32.980
<v Speaker 5>doing a ritual waving or a feather </v>
<v Speaker 5>rattling or rattle banging a drum and </v>

296
00:14:35.001 --> 00:14:37.610
<v Speaker 5>the person for one reason or other gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

297
00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.310
<v Speaker 5>Now what about the people that don't get</v>
<v Speaker 5>well?</v>

298
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.130
<v Speaker 5>Those are people that don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>imagination,</v>

299
00:14:43.131 --> 00:14:47.630
<v Speaker 5>they don't have the response to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>placebo effect,</v>

300
00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.700
<v Speaker 5>and so they die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happens when they die?</v>

301
00:14:50.701 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 5>Their drop out of</v>

302
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 6>the gene pool?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who is left?</v>

303
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:59.290
<v Speaker 6>The people who are left,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the people who are able to access their </v>

304
00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.560
<v Speaker 6>inner healing ability and passed down </v>
<v Speaker 6>those genes to their descendants and </v>

305
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:07.300
<v Speaker 6>that's why today we have hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have biofeedback,</v>

306
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.700
<v Speaker 6>we have visual imagery and all of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>other products of mind,</v>

307
00:15:11.701 --> 00:15:14.030
<v Speaker 6>body medicine that work.</v>

308
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.510
<v Speaker 3>The placebo effect highlights a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating aspect of the human animal.</v>

309
00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:24.540
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this ability to heal itself by being </v>

310
00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.091
<v Speaker 3>tricked or tricking itself into </v>
<v Speaker 3>believing that it's taking medicine and </v>

311
00:15:27.091 --> 00:15:29.560
<v Speaker 3>then forcing some sort of an effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very.</v>

312
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:34.710
<v Speaker 3>It's a very strange and slippery term or</v>
<v Speaker 3>slippery ability and it seems so strange</v>

313
00:15:36.791 --> 00:15:41.260
<v Speaker 3>that the ability to be tricked would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>of evolutionary advantage.</v>

314
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:46.380
<v Speaker 3>The ability to trick yourself into </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking you're taking medicine and </v>

315
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.110
<v Speaker 3>healing yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't really do that consciously.</v>

316
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.710
<v Speaker 6>We couldn't do it consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but let's go back to evolution.</v>

317
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:56.490
<v Speaker 6>Rolling Thunder often use the term.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes you have to trick a person </v>

318
00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:00.361
<v Speaker 6>that they are getting well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to trick a person into using </v>

319
00:16:00.361 --> 00:16:03.721
<v Speaker 6>their own self healing capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their own inner shaman as he put it out.</v>

320
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:09.690
<v Speaker 6>Now you can use that deliberately.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have people who are able to hypnotize</v>

321
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:16.230
<v Speaker 6>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who are able to get visual images of </v>

322
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:20.161
<v Speaker 6>their bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>mending the bones together and getting </v>

323
00:16:20.161 --> 00:16:23.260
<v Speaker 6>well of the cancer cells shrinking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This doesn't work for everybody,</v>

324
00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:28.530
<v Speaker 6>but visual imagery as a part of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>holistic program were mainstream </v>

325
00:16:29.201 --> 00:16:33.640
<v Speaker 6>medicine is also used,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can give that extra little edge that can</v>

326
00:16:33.641 --> 00:16:38.641
<v Speaker 6>help a person to get well out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That little extra edge is a linear </v>

327
00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:42.610
<v Speaker 6>descendant of what Charmin's did some </v>
<v Speaker 6>50,000</v>

328
00:16:42.611 --> 00:16:43.180
<v Speaker 6>years ago.</v>

329
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.190
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

330
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.090
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the placebo effect in that it,</v>

331
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.760
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a scientific term,</v>

332
00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.420
<v Speaker 3>but yet it's not a very scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>action.</v>

333
00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:59.510
<v Speaker 3>The action is really sort of mystical in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to heal with the mind and </v>

334
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.000
<v Speaker 3>using the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>

335
00:17:03.001 --> 00:17:08.001
<v Speaker 3>very strange thing and it's very strange</v>
<v Speaker 3>and connected with Sherman hasn't begun </v>

336
00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:13.161
<v Speaker 3>shamanism itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that these plants contain </v>

337
00:17:13.161 --> 00:17:15.210
<v Speaker 3>information and that especially like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca,</v>

338
00:17:15.211 --> 00:17:20.211
<v Speaker 3>it's my favorite shamanistic brew just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the fact that they had to </v>

339
00:17:20.221 --> 00:17:25.221
<v Speaker 3>figure out over these hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of different plants in the </v>

340
00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:28.881
<v Speaker 3>Amazon which one contained dmt and which</v>
<v Speaker 3>one contained an Mao inhibitor and </v>

341
00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:32.970
<v Speaker 3>combined the two of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know what that means,</v>

342
00:17:32.971 --> 00:17:34.410
<v Speaker 3>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the DMT,</v>

343
00:17:34.411 --> 00:17:37.370
<v Speaker 3>which is the most potent psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>drug known to man it,</v>

344
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.140
<v Speaker 3>it exists in a bunch of different forms </v>
<v Speaker 3>in nature,</v>

345
00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.000
<v Speaker 3>but it's not orally active.</v>

346
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Speaker 3>The reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

347
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could eat grass and you don't get,</v>

348
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.590
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a dmt trip is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>your body produces something called </v>

349
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.010
<v Speaker 3>Monell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amy and oxidase and monoamine oxidase,</v>

350
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.370
<v Speaker 3>you can inhibit that and you can inhibit</v>
<v Speaker 3>it with natural plants.</v>

351
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:01.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another in the course of who </v>

352
00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.040
<v Speaker 3>went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows how many thousands of years </v>

353
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.100
<v Speaker 3>the Amazon Shaman have had figured out </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to take the vine of one plant in the</v>

354
00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:13.641
<v Speaker 3>leaves of another plant and combine them</v>
<v Speaker 3>together and it was dmt and a natural </v>

355
00:18:13.951 --> 00:18:17.760
<v Speaker 3>Mao inhibitor and that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what created Iowasca,</v>

356
00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:20.070
<v Speaker 3>which is an orally active version of </v>
<v Speaker 3>DMT,</v>

357
00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:24.390
<v Speaker 3>the only orally active version that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're we're aware of and they did it.</v>

358
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.390
<v Speaker 3>They say by talking to the plants and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the plants told them,</v>

359
00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:31.270
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is discussed in another recent book</v>

360
00:18:31.271 --> 00:18:36.271
<v Speaker 6>of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>be mystifying shamanism where we take </v>

361
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.690
<v Speaker 6>all these mysteries of shamanism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a book by Adam Rock and myself,</v>

362
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.200
<v Speaker 6>and we demystify them and cook them into</v>
<v Speaker 6>a psychological terms.</v>

363
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.510
<v Speaker 6>Now what you say about Iowasca is </v>
<v Speaker 6>absolutely correct,</v>

364
00:18:50.511 --> 00:18:53.710
<v Speaker 6>and I've been to the Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've taken Iowasca in Brazil,</v>

365
00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.560
<v Speaker 6>and that's very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's very valuable.</v>

366
00:18:56.561 --> 00:19:01.561
<v Speaker 6>That's a very good teaching tool to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>people down there and even the people </v>

367
00:19:01.561 --> 00:19:04.540
<v Speaker 6>from Western cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the question comes up,</v>

368
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.930
<v Speaker 6>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of all of the thousands of plants in the</v>

369
00:19:07.931 --> 00:19:12.931
<v Speaker 6>rain forest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how did Shamans know how to put these </v>

370
00:19:12.931 --> 00:19:15.790
<v Speaker 6>two plants together?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I've asked them about that.</v>

371
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:16.390
<v Speaker 6>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

372
00:19:16.391 --> 00:19:19.930
<v Speaker 6>the plant's taught us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's good enough for them.</v>

373
00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.250
<v Speaker 6>I think that it was a little more </v>
<v Speaker 6>complicated than that.</v>

374
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.760
<v Speaker 6>I think that they watched animals take </v>
<v Speaker 6>plants and as the animals began to turn </v>

375
00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.860
<v Speaker 6>on and show unusual behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the shamans began to do that themselves.</v>

376
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.180
<v Speaker 6>Now this doesn't really account for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>combination of the plants,</v>

377
00:19:43.181 --> 00:19:48.181
<v Speaker 6>but maybe they were able to use trial </v>
<v Speaker 6>and effect besides being the first </v>

378
00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:53.340
<v Speaker 6>doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The first psychotherapist Shamans were </v>

379
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.771
<v Speaker 6>the first scientists they used to trial </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the fact they tried out substances </v>

380
00:19:55.901 --> 00:19:58.540
<v Speaker 6>on themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If they worked on themselves,</v>

381
00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.720
<v Speaker 6>they turn to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the genesis of Iowasca is sort of </v>

382
00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:08.950
<v Speaker 6>lost in the mists of prehistory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's a fascinating topic.</v>

383
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.040
<v Speaker 6>And everything that you say about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Moa inhibitor isn't the DMT is </v>

384
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:14.040
<v Speaker 6>absolutely correct.</v>

385
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:19.170
<v Speaker 3>It really is a fascinating topic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a fragile piece of history </v>

386
00:20:19.271 --> 00:20:23.920
<v Speaker 3>because the shamans are the ones who </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand and know how to make the brew</v>

387
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.160
<v Speaker 3>and they pass this information down from</v>
<v Speaker 3>generation to generation and if they're </v>

388
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.991
<v Speaker 3>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're lost and we're losing rain </v>

389
00:20:33.991 --> 00:20:33.991
<v Speaker 3>forest by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

390
00:20:33.991 --> 00:20:38.190
<v Speaker 3>by the acre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally as we're talking acres </v>

391
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:42.210
<v Speaker 3>are being dissolved and slowly but </v>
<v Speaker 3>surely these people are getting pushed </v>

392
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.740
<v Speaker 3>out of their natural home and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>losing the lungs of the earth.</v>

393
00:20:44.741 --> 00:20:47.080
<v Speaker 3>Literally the rain forests are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lungs,</v>

394
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 3>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's</v>

395
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:53.040
<v Speaker 1>where most of our oxygen comes from and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a fragile thing that we,</v>

396
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:59.430
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know so little about its origins and </v>

397
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.990
<v Speaker 1>its right there and it's just these few </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are,</v>

398
00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:07.010
<v Speaker 1>that are living there that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that truly understand that their </v>

399
00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.260
<v Speaker 1>traditions and they've had them passed </v>
<v Speaker 1>down generation to generation.</v>

400
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:13.320
<v Speaker 5>You used the very same terms at me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hell Gorbachev used when I talked with </v>

401
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.870
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted him to give me some advice that</v>

402
00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:21.871
<v Speaker 5>I could pass onto an ecology conference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was going into Brazil to speak at and </v>

403
00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:27.391
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell the Brazilians that the lungs of </v>

404
00:21:27.391 --> 00:21:30.601
<v Speaker 5>the earth are the Siberian tiger and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Amazon rain forest and that the Amazon </v>

405
00:21:31.841 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 5>rain forest just destroyed one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>lungs will be destroyed.</v>

406
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.560
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now there are Brazilian laws protecting </v>

407
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.100
<v Speaker 5>the rain forest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

408
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:47.130
<v Speaker 5>the Brazilian army,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Brazilian police can't protect all </v>

409
00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.821
<v Speaker 5>of the rain forest and a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ranchers and lumber companies are just </v>

410
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:57.100
<v Speaker 5>coming in and slicing up that rain </v>
<v Speaker 5>forest.</v>

411
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:02.190
<v Speaker 5>Right and left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was in southern Brazil with the </v>

412
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:07.740
<v Speaker 5>Guarani tribe and the Guarani Sharman </v>
<v Speaker 5>invited me to a very sacred ceremony and</v>

413
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:14.970
<v Speaker 5>that ceremony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he passed around some brew that I drank </v>

414
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:19.121
<v Speaker 5>from some stuff that I smoked and other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people also and after around of shall we</v>

415
00:22:21.221 --> 00:22:26.221
<v Speaker 5>say six gourds or pipes of psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 5>substances.</v>

416
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:32.670
<v Speaker 5>I was waiting for visions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they never arrived and said I could </v>

417
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:36.151
<v Speaker 5>think very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very clearly and then he wanted me to </v>

418
00:22:36.151 --> 00:22:39.301
<v Speaker 5>give a prayer and it my best Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I couldn't have done ordinarily.</v>

419
00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.230
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

420
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:46.150
<v Speaker 5>Tell your young people to stop hanging </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves from the trees because it was</v>

421
00:22:46.151 --> 00:22:49.440
<v Speaker 5>an epidemic of suicide to protest the </v>
<v Speaker 5>destruction of the rain forest.</v>

422
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.590
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

423
00:22:50.591 --> 00:22:55.591
<v Speaker 5>you met.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get the young people to be active and </v>

424
00:22:55.591 --> 00:22:56.430
<v Speaker 5>fight the people who are destroying the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rainforest.</v>

425
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.660
<v Speaker 5>Go into politics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>become lawyers.</v>

426
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 5>Fight this to save the rain forest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>

427
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.880
<v Speaker 5>how did you know our young people were </v>
<v Speaker 5>hanging themselves from the trees?</v>

428
00:23:06.881 --> 00:23:07.420
<v Speaker 5>I says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

429
00:23:07.421 --> 00:23:12.421
<v Speaker 5>I'm a member of the rainforest action </v>
<v Speaker 5>network and San Francisco and we keep </v>

430
00:23:12.421 --> 00:23:13.750
<v Speaker 5>track of what's happening to the rain </v>
<v Speaker 5>forest.</v>

431
00:23:13.751 --> 00:23:18.751
<v Speaker 5>It's very important for us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's important for the world in Shamans </v>

432
00:23:18.751 --> 00:23:22.540
<v Speaker 5>like you are way ahead of the game </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you know what will happen if the</v>

433
00:23:22.541 --> 00:23:23.860
<v Speaker 5>rain forests are destroyed.</v>

434
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:29.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very fascinating idea that </v>

435
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.511
<v Speaker 1>there's an intelligence to plants and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that these rain forests are networks of </v>

436
00:23:33.581 --> 00:23:36.850
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that we can't quite tap into it and</v>

437
00:23:36.851 --> 00:23:41.851
<v Speaker 1>that somehow or another during these </v>
<v Speaker 1>altered states you can and then that's </v>

438
00:23:41.851 --> 00:23:43.270
<v Speaker 1>where the information comes to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shaman.</v>

439
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>native from both</v>

440
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:50.330
<v Speaker 6>north and South America use the term in </v>
<v Speaker 6>one language or another.</v>

441
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:55.331
<v Speaker 6>All our relations and all of our </v>
<v Speaker 6>relations are not wholly human beings,</v>

442
00:23:55.431 --> 00:24:00.431
<v Speaker 6>but the creatures who walk on four legs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the creatures who crawl on their </v>

443
00:24:00.431 --> 00:24:02.420
<v Speaker 6>bellies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the creatures who swim in the seas,</v>

444
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:07.660
<v Speaker 6>the creatures who put their roots into </v>
<v Speaker 6>the ground or who stand tall in the </v>

445
00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.860
<v Speaker 6>forest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all of these are relations.</v>

446
00:24:09.861 --> 00:24:13.610
<v Speaker 6>This is the web of life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is the ecosystem,</v>

447
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:18.910
<v Speaker 6>and you start to destroy that ecosystem </v>
<v Speaker 6>and human beings are not far along the </v>

448
00:24:19.671 --> 00:24:22.100
<v Speaker 6>way in terms of being destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 6>themselves.</v>

449
00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:23.000
<v Speaker 6>Is it a weird</v>

450
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.380
<v Speaker 1>thing that we can't recognize that while</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing it,</v>

451
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:30.500
<v Speaker 1>the human race for some reason is doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and can understand what it's doing </v>

452
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:30.500
<v Speaker 1>to itself.</v>

453
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.090
<v Speaker 6>Doesn't that come back?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So at the end of it,</v>

454
00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 6>doesn't that come back to what you were </v>
<v Speaker 6>saying earlier about the placebo effect </v>

455
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:37.900
<v Speaker 6>and the no cbo effect,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which you know,</v>

456
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.360
<v Speaker 6>a tricking ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

457
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:44.260
<v Speaker 6>We're tricking ourselves not to notice </v>
<v Speaker 6>that we're tricking ourselves every damn</v>

458
00:24:44.261 --> 00:24:49.261
<v Speaker 6>day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're telling ourselves will never die </v>

459
00:24:49.261 --> 00:24:52.111
<v Speaker 6>and so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So and so loves me when you know damn </v>

460
00:24:52.111 --> 00:24:55.231
<v Speaker 6>well she doesn't or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we trick ourselves to make life </v>

461
00:24:55.231 --> 00:24:55.231
<v Speaker 6>tolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

462
00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.090
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So within that context,</v>

463
00:24:58.091 --> 00:25:01.360
<v Speaker 6>tricking yourself to heal yourself seems</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it makes perfect sense.</v>

464
00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:02.990
<v Speaker 6>It really does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just,</v>

465
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.010
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's weird that we're able to do.</v>

466
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:11.300
<v Speaker 6>It's like when you're driving car and </v>
<v Speaker 6>your car is a broken pipe and you see </v>

467
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.790
<v Speaker 6>black smoke come out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got to get to work and not really </v>

468
00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:14.790
<v Speaker 6>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>

469
00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:15.940
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we somehow or another,</v>

470
00:25:15.941 --> 00:25:19.960
<v Speaker 6>don't feel the impact of the horrible </v>
<v Speaker 6>things that we do in psychology.</v>

471
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:24.960
<v Speaker 6>We call this denial and people deny </v>
<v Speaker 6>what's right there in front of them </v>

472
00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:28.300
<v Speaker 6>because they have other agendas and </v>
<v Speaker 6>other preoccupations.</v>

473
00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:33.690
<v Speaker 6>This is one reason I was so interested </v>
<v Speaker 6>in rolling thunder and why we wrote the </v>

474
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:39.300
<v Speaker 6>Book Rolling Thunder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Voice of rolling thunder because he </v>

475
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.050
<v Speaker 6>saw all of this 30 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He saw the global warming.</v>

476
00:25:41.051 --> 00:25:43.270
<v Speaker 6>He saw the destruction of the rain </v>
<v Speaker 6>forest.</v>

477
00:25:43.271 --> 00:25:47.080
<v Speaker 6>She saw the pollution of the earth and </v>
<v Speaker 6>who listened to him.</v>

478
00:25:47.081 --> 00:25:50.540
<v Speaker 6>His audiences listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that politicians listen to them.</v>

479
00:25:50.541 --> 00:25:54.250
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our politicians listing to him now go to</v>

480
00:25:54.251 --> 00:25:59.110
<v Speaker 6>some of the debates in Congress and they</v>
<v Speaker 6>say that global warming is junk science.</v>

481
00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:04.650
<v Speaker 6>Here's massive denial from people who </v>
<v Speaker 6>could make a difference and you take the</v>

482
00:26:05.891 --> 00:26:09.760
<v Speaker 6>polls of what the main concerns are of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the American people.</v>

483
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.990
<v Speaker 6>Concern for the environment is now </v>
<v Speaker 6>number five or six down the list.</v>

484
00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird thing,</v>

485
00:26:16.171 --> 00:26:21.171
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Concern for the actual environment is </v>

486
00:26:21.171 --> 00:26:24.141
<v Speaker 1>not at the top of the list of poisoning </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our own earth is not at the top of </v>

487
00:26:24.181 --> 00:26:29.181
<v Speaker 1>the list and could be avoided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're human beings are so in ingenuity,</v>

488
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:36.320
<v Speaker 1>ingenious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have such amazing abilities to </v>

489
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.530
<v Speaker 1>figure out new methods to extract energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>from things.</v>

490
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.920
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we're still relying on </v>
<v Speaker 1>fossil fuels and we're still burning </v>

491
00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.940
<v Speaker 1>things and pumping smoke into the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it does make the best sounding </v>

492
00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:51.321
<v Speaker 1>engines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough to argue with that at those </v>

493
00:26:51.321 --> 00:26:51.321
<v Speaker 1>goddamn hybrids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

494
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:53.220
<v Speaker 1>anything sucking the soul away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

495
00:26:53.221 --> 00:26:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a prius.</v>

496
00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Toyota Prius is especially ones with </v>
<v Speaker 1>bumper stickers.</v>

497
00:26:57.031 --> 00:26:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Something about them makes them extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying.</v>

498
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Isn't the plural pre I should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be illegal,</v>

499
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:07.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned to all our relations a </v>

500
00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:08.310
<v Speaker 1>cocoa in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

501
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.670
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hardback have sex at dawn.</v>

502
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.250
<v Speaker 1>The first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it called at the beginning,</v>

503
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.630
<v Speaker 1>the preface and know that is an epic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ram is like,</v>

504
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.820
<v Speaker 1>to my mother and father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dedication,</v>

505
00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:22.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We dedicated,</v>

506
00:27:22.081 --> 00:27:26.240
<v Speaker 1>it said to all our relations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking of this North American,</v>

507
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.280
<v Speaker 1>South American Indian thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people thought it was </v>

508
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:31.280
<v Speaker 1>referring to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

509
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.180
<v Speaker 1>group sex or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All our lovers or something.</v>

510
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

511
00:27:35.621 --> 00:27:37.270
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Changed it in the,</v>

512
00:27:37.271 --> 00:27:38.460
<v Speaker 1>in the favor back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

513
00:27:38.461 --> 00:27:40.290
<v Speaker 1>that's too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd leave that in there.</v>

514
00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:42.060
<v Speaker 1>That's actually cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool thing to say.</v>

515
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

516
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:48.130
<v Speaker 6>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this takes us back to the very first </v>

517
00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:48.130
<v Speaker 6>question you asked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You think of sharp and Lucy.</v>

518
00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.450
<v Speaker 6>Me think of mystical stuff of talking to</v>
<v Speaker 6>spirits.</v>

519
00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:55.040
<v Speaker 6>Know Shamans are very down to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They are concerned with the here and the</v>

520
00:27:55.041 --> 00:27:57.590
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are concerned with the future.</v>

521
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.450
<v Speaker 6>They talk about five,</v>
<v Speaker 6>six,</v>

522
00:27:59.451 --> 00:28:03.290
<v Speaker 6>seven generations in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is gonna Happen to the Earth in the</v>

523
00:28:03.291 --> 00:28:04.700
<v Speaker 6>future?</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are very,</v>

524
00:28:04.701 --> 00:28:06.020
<v Speaker 6>very practical people.</v>

525
00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Now you've done research on dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>telepathy and you've,</v>

526
00:28:12.961 --> 00:28:15.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've actually been cited in scientific</v>

527
00:28:15.941 --> 00:28:19.900
<v Speaker 1>journals and you've been on tv talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this stuff,</v>

528
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:24.310
<v Speaker 1>including the tonight show with Johnny </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carson was at back in the seventies,</v>

529
00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.580
<v Speaker 1>back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heyday of Johnny Carson.</v>

530
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Did you have a cocktail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have cocktails.</v>

531
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Did they smoke cigarettes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They smoke cigarettes,</v>

532
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.360
<v Speaker 1>right on Johnny Carson show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they smoke cigarettes on the set?</v>

533
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Not when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

534
00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny didn't smoke.</v>

535
00:28:40.691 --> 00:28:42.910
<v Speaker 1>I thought Johnny was constantly puffing </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

536
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what happened.</v>

537
00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I was just doing attorney carson sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

538
00:28:52.061 --> 00:28:53.620
<v Speaker 1>that's Ed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Ed Mcmahon.</v>

539
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Carson show 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is dream telepathy?</v>

540
00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:05.170
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this actually goes back to shamanism </v>

541
00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:08.980
<v Speaker 6>because shamans felt that they could </v>
<v Speaker 6>communicate with other Shabas who were </v>

542
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:12.020
<v Speaker 6>kilometers away,</v>
<v Speaker 6>miles away,</v>

543
00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.730
<v Speaker 6>through mental focusing and through </v>
<v Speaker 6>imagination,</v>

544
00:29:16.731 --> 00:29:18.260
<v Speaker 6>through imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>

545
00:29:18.261 --> 00:29:21.440
<v Speaker 6>this tradition has come to us through </v>
<v Speaker 6>time and science,</v>

546
00:29:21.441 --> 00:29:23.390
<v Speaker 6>by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't take it seriously,</v>

547
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:28.930
<v Speaker 6>but a small group of scientists called </v>
<v Speaker 6>Paris psychologists devise methods to </v>

548
00:29:29.181 --> 00:29:34.181
<v Speaker 6>put this to a scientific test.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now to look into dream telepathy,</v>

549
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.900
<v Speaker 6>what we did was to take a soundproof </v>
<v Speaker 6>room,</v>

550
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 6>could a dreamer and the soundproof room </v>
<v Speaker 6>electrodes</v>

551
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:47.220
<v Speaker 5>to the dreamers head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at the electroencephalograph </v>

552
00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.150
<v Speaker 5>machine in those little icicle back and </v>
<v Speaker 5>forth,</v>

553
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:54.330
<v Speaker 5>rapid eye movements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'd wake up the person and asked them </v>

554
00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.990
<v Speaker 5>what they were dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now at the very same time,</v>

555
00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:00.610
<v Speaker 5>there was one of our staff members and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the distant building and slash,</v>

556
00:30:00.611 --> 00:30:03.730
<v Speaker 5>or a distant room who is looking at a </v>
<v Speaker 5>picture,</v>

557
00:30:03.731 --> 00:30:07.090
<v Speaker 5>usually a famous art print,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of them by several door valley.</v>

558
00:30:07.091 --> 00:30:12.091
<v Speaker 5>By the way out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The staff member was trying to project </v>

559
00:30:12.491 --> 00:30:17.491
<v Speaker 5>that image to the dreamer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The dreamer is trying to reach out and </v>

560
00:30:17.491 --> 00:30:21.610
<v Speaker 5>see that picture and none of them would </v>
<v Speaker 5>transcribe the dreams and then we'd have</v>

561
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:25.780
<v Speaker 5>a team of dream experts try to match the</v>
<v Speaker 5>dreams with the picture.</v>

562
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.080
<v Speaker 5>After nine or 10 or 11 or 12 sessions </v>
<v Speaker 5>had taken place.</v>

563
00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:36.860
<v Speaker 5>And then you can use statistics to find </v>
<v Speaker 5>out if the matches happen more often by </v>

564
00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:37.330
<v Speaker 5>chance.</v>

565
00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:42.070
<v Speaker 5>Then they would ordinarily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And much to our surprise,</v>

566
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:47.490
<v Speaker 5>most of the times they did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we did about a dozen different </v>

567
00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.360
<v Speaker 5>series.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And about nine of these series,</v>

568
00:30:49.361 --> 00:30:54.361
<v Speaker 5>we're above chance levels,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we can't say that we have </v>

569
00:30:54.361 --> 00:30:57.310
<v Speaker 5>demonstrated dream telepathy because </v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes it works,</v>

570
00:30:57.311 --> 00:31:01.390
<v Speaker 5>sometimes it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All we can say is that we've made a case</v>

571
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:06.391
<v Speaker 5>for dream telepathy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think the most important thing we </v>

572
00:31:06.391 --> 00:31:09.781
<v Speaker 5>did was to take green telepathy off the </v>
<v Speaker 5>list of symptoms of mental illness back </v>

573
00:31:11.621 --> 00:31:16.621
<v Speaker 5>when we first started out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if people said that they dreamed about </v>

574
00:31:16.621 --> 00:31:19.981
<v Speaker 5>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dreamed about what a friend was doing </v>

575
00:31:19.981 --> 00:31:21.310
<v Speaker 5>that got a check mark,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a sign of schizophrenia.</v>

576
00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:24.850
<v Speaker 5>That's a sign of delusional thinking no </v>
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>

577
00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.760
<v Speaker 5>You take a look at the psychiatric </v>
<v Speaker 5>indices.</v>

578
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:32.230
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty far down the list.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think we made a signal contribution</v>

579
00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:36.250
<v Speaker 5>in terms of letting the </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychotherapeutic world,</v>

580
00:31:36.251 --> 00:31:41.251
<v Speaker 5>especially the psychiatric world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>know that one can make a case that </v>

581
00:31:41.651 --> 00:31:46.630
<v Speaker 5>sometimes dream telepathy does indeed </v>
<v Speaker 5>occur and that the Shamans,</v>

582
00:31:46.631 --> 00:31:48.820
<v Speaker 5>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were ahead of their time because they</v>

583
00:31:48.821 --> 00:31:51.910
<v Speaker 5>did this as part of their regular </v>
<v Speaker 5>practice thousands of years ago.</v>

584
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:57.370
<v Speaker 3>The original,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when when people are with the Western </v>

585
00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.420
<v Speaker 3>world originally started studying </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca,</v>

586
00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:04.510
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that they wanted to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>was call harming before they had </v>

587
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:08.411
<v Speaker 3>isolated that it was harming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to call it telepathy and </v>

588
00:32:08.411 --> 00:32:08.411
<v Speaker 3>that was the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the name.</v>

589
00:32:08.411 --> 00:32:12.131
<v Speaker 3>They came to it because it gave these </v>
<v Speaker 3>group sort of telepathic.</v>

590
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:18.510
<v Speaker 3>It gave some sort of an effect that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were able to communicate in </v>

591
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:18.800
<v Speaker 3>groups.</v>

592
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.070
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my old friend Alan Ginsburg,</v>

593
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.790
<v Speaker 5>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was the coauthor of the Ya hey,</v>

594
00:32:25.791 --> 00:32:29.470
<v Speaker 5>papers y'all hate is another word for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole Osca.</v>

595
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:34.690
<v Speaker 5>He and William burroughs wrote these </v>
<v Speaker 5>wonderful letters back and forth and </v>

596
00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:39.221
<v Speaker 5>they experienced telepathy and alums.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ginsburg went around trying to persuade </v>

597
00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:40.610
<v Speaker 5>her a psychologist,</v>

598
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:45.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>use the South American urban your </v>

599
00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:46.130
<v Speaker 6>experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I took him seriously,</v>

600
00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:51.131
<v Speaker 6>but I didn't have a way together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody else took him seriously and that </v>

601
00:32:51.131 --> 00:32:55.610
<v Speaker 6>experiments still remains to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now the Iowasca is available now that it</v>

602
00:32:55.611 --> 00:33:00.611
<v Speaker 6>is being used in some experiments or </v>
<v Speaker 6>another one could see if it lives up to </v>

603
00:33:00.611 --> 00:33:01.960
<v Speaker 6>its nickname.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Telepathic.</v>

604
00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>

605
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:08.710
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating that it was already the</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific nomenclature was already home</v>

606
00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:13.980
<v Speaker 3>harming for it because it stuck with </v>
<v Speaker 3>telepathy and that was like the actual </v>

607
00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.300
<v Speaker 3>scientific word that we use today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be a.</v>

608
00:33:16.301 --> 00:33:21.301
<v Speaker 3>that's a real tricky sort of a slippery </v>
<v Speaker 3>slope of a scientific name for something</v>

609
00:33:22.721 --> 00:33:25.870
<v Speaker 3>that impart some sort of mystical </v>
<v Speaker 3>properties.</v>

610
00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:31.940
<v Speaker 6>Well that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and of course to be properly scientific </v>

611
00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:36.320
<v Speaker 6>one often weeds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These terms out that are a little too </v>

612
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:40.791
<v Speaker 6>esoteric or a little bit off the off the</v>
<v Speaker 6>cliff and so we use words like harmony </v>

613
00:33:43.711 --> 00:33:48.090
<v Speaker 6>and harmony into describe dmt to </v>
<v Speaker 6>describe these active ingredients.</v>

614
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:53.510
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting to think about all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>different names for what we now call </v>

615
00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:54.000
<v Speaker 6>hallucinogenic drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

616
00:33:54.001 --> 00:33:59.001
<v Speaker 6>they were psychotic mimetics there for </v>
<v Speaker 6>awhile and then psychedelics and what </v>

617
00:33:59.001 --> 00:34:03.380
<v Speaker 6>were some of the other three or four?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Actually always liked the word </v>

618
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.070
<v Speaker 6>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hans never caught on,</v>

619
00:34:05.071 --> 00:34:08.370
<v Speaker 6>but the yellow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they induced fantasy and theologians and</v>

620
00:34:08.371 --> 00:34:09.340
<v Speaker 6>the agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well No,</v>

621
00:34:09.341 --> 00:34:11.540
<v Speaker 6>I'm theo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>John doesn't work because him,</v>

622
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.420
<v Speaker 6>Theo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Janice,</v>

623
00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:17.430
<v Speaker 6>finding the God within and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelics do help people find the God</v>

624
00:34:17.941 --> 00:34:22.941
<v Speaker 6>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but some people take psychedelics for </v>

625
00:34:22.941 --> 00:34:24.480
<v Speaker 6>other purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to have fun,</v>

626
00:34:24.481 --> 00:34:28.710
<v Speaker 6>to enhance sex,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to explore a nature,</v>

627
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.550
<v Speaker 3>don't lose things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring the God within out as well.</v>

628
00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.610
<v Speaker 6>In my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they do.</v>

629
00:34:33.611 --> 00:34:34.870
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't argue with that.</v>

630
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

631
00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:41.980
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of dream telepathy in in </v>

632
00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:46.320
<v Speaker 3>mainstream science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be something that's very </v>

633
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:46.320
<v Speaker 3>heavily resisted.</v>

634
00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:48.920
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is resisted,</v>

635
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:54.010
<v Speaker 6>but I think that as the years go by,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're getting a much more intelligence </v>

636
00:34:57.141 --> 00:35:02.141
<v Speaker 6>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of my books is called debating </v>

637
00:35:02.141 --> 00:35:05.980
<v Speaker 6>psychic experiences and we have some of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the top pair of psychologists debating </v>

638
00:35:06.891 --> 00:35:11.891
<v Speaker 6>some of the top skeptics in a very </v>
<v Speaker 6>civilized intellectual way back and </v>

639
00:35:11.891 --> 00:35:14.510
<v Speaker 6>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We give the same number of pages to both</v>

640
00:35:14.511 --> 00:35:19.511
<v Speaker 6>the advocates and the counter advocates </v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is a level of discourse that </v>

641
00:35:19.791 --> 00:35:21.830
<v Speaker 6>never would have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he years ago,</v>

642
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:27.220
<v Speaker 6>the ultra skeptics never would have sat </v>
<v Speaker 6>down to help write a book with the </v>

643
00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:30.500
<v Speaker 6>proponents of dream telepathy and other </v>
<v Speaker 6>such things.</v>

644
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:35.920
<v Speaker 6>So at least the discourse is now a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little more civil and the possibility is</v>

645
00:35:36.111 --> 00:35:41.111
<v Speaker 6>now being taken little more seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the final outcome is </v>

646
00:35:41.111 --> 00:35:44.460
<v Speaker 6>going to be because I'm an agnostic on a</v>
<v Speaker 6>lot of these issues,</v>

647
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:49.790
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that this is a human experience </v>

648
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:53.990
<v Speaker 6>that needs to be explored.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So let's explore it with as many tools </v>

649
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.100
<v Speaker 6>at our disposal as possible.</v>

650
00:35:56.330 --> 00:36:01.330
<v Speaker 3>So do you believe that dream telepathy </v>
<v Speaker 3>is something that occurs occasionally </v>

651
00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:05.710
<v Speaker 3>but cannot be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't be reliably reproduced.</v>

652
00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:11.450
<v Speaker 6>I wish it could be reliably reproduced </v>
<v Speaker 6>because it could be put to practical use</v>

653
00:36:11.551 --> 00:36:12.180
<v Speaker 6>then.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But no.</v>

654
00:36:12.181 --> 00:36:17.181
<v Speaker 6>My belief is it is very unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Many things in life are unpredictable.</v>

655
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:23.030
<v Speaker 6>I sort of compare it to when people my </v>
<v Speaker 6>age have an erection during sex that's </v>

656
00:36:24.541 --> 00:36:28.980
<v Speaker 6>unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wish I could predict it well.</v>

657
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.040
<v Speaker 6>A lot of important things in life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like erections for older people like </v>

658
00:36:34.351 --> 00:36:37.590
<v Speaker 6>dream telepathy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like seeing into the future happen,</v>

659
00:36:37.591 --> 00:36:42.591
<v Speaker 6>but they're unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That doesn't mean we shouldn't explore </v>

660
00:36:42.591 --> 00:36:42.591
<v Speaker 6>them and study them.</v>

661
00:36:42.591 --> 00:36:45.700
<v Speaker 3>What do you believe are the components </v>
<v Speaker 3>of dream telepathy?</v>

662
00:36:45.701 --> 00:36:50.701
<v Speaker 3>Have you isolated it down to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>firing in the synopsis?</v>

663
00:36:50.831 --> 00:36:53.440
<v Speaker 3>Do you mean do you have any idea of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>causes it?</v>

664
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:58.440
<v Speaker 6>We have the equipment to do much more </v>
<v Speaker 6>with the brain now than we could.</v>

665
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.100
<v Speaker 6>You have to remember the Paris </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychologists don't have very much money</v>

666
00:37:02.101 --> 00:37:05.620
<v Speaker 6>and don't have the tools to a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

667
00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:10.830
<v Speaker 6>to utilize a lot of this equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But what we did on our studies was very,</v>

668
00:37:12.571 --> 00:37:17.571
<v Speaker 6>very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The nights that the dream telepathy </v>

669
00:37:17.571 --> 00:37:20.481
<v Speaker 6>seemed to be successful were the nights </v>
<v Speaker 6>that the geo magnetic fields of the </v>

670
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.280
<v Speaker 6>earth were very calm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very few sunspots,</v>

671
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:29.300
<v Speaker 6>very few electrical storms,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so one could hypothesize that there </v>

672
00:37:29.821 --> 00:37:34.821
<v Speaker 6>is a field of some sort of global field </v>
<v Speaker 6>were these barely detectable influences </v>

673
00:37:37.361 --> 00:37:40.300
<v Speaker 6>and very subtle means of communication </v>
<v Speaker 6>that can sneak through.</v>

674
00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.130
<v Speaker 6>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by and large,</v>

675
00:37:42.131 --> 00:37:47.131
<v Speaker 6>if there is an emotional connection </v>
<v Speaker 6>between the people who are in contact </v>

676
00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:52.081
<v Speaker 6>with each other over a distance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's more likely to happen than if </v>

677
00:37:52.081 --> 00:37:52.081
<v Speaker 6>they're complete strangers.</v>

678
00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:57.740
<v Speaker 3>Didn't you have some sort of a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychic vision of Kennedy being </v>

679
00:37:58.951 --> 00:37:59.790
<v Speaker 3>assassinated?</v>

680
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.480
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>actually idea the alphas drain.</v>

681
00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:08.481
<v Speaker 6>My very first psilocybin experience that</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had the courtesy of Timothy leary</v>

682
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:10.820
<v Speaker 7>who</v>

683
00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:16.900
<v Speaker 6>I went to Harvard to visit and who </v>
<v Speaker 6>invited me to an experiment with </v>

684
00:38:16.941 --> 00:38:21.941
<v Speaker 6>psilocybin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a beautiful and glorious </v>

685
00:38:21.941 --> 00:38:24.701
<v Speaker 6>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was done during the days when </v>

686
00:38:24.701 --> 00:38:28.570
<v Speaker 6>psilocybin was legal and factors,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of his last legal psilocybin </v>

687
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:32.381
<v Speaker 6>sessions and there was only one Downer </v>
<v Speaker 6>during that experience and that was when</v>

688
00:38:34.371 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 6>I had the actual</v>

689
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:41.460
<v Speaker 5>vision during psilocybin with my eyes </v>
<v Speaker 5>closed of President Lincoln being shot </v>

690
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:47.520
<v Speaker 5>and I saw the gun at the base of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>profile and somebody screamed out,</v>

691
00:38:48.641 --> 00:38:53.641
<v Speaker 5>the president has been shot and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>Lincoln space morphed into that of </v>

692
00:38:53.641 --> 00:38:58.111
<v Speaker 5>Kennedy and there was the rifle except </v>
<v Speaker 5>now it was not a pistol,</v>

693
00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:02.140
<v Speaker 5>a rifle and somebody who's screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The president has been shot.</v>

694
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.520
<v Speaker 5>I recorded all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had such an incredible experience.</v>

695
00:39:06.521 --> 00:39:11.521
<v Speaker 5>I made dozens of copies and sent it to </v>
<v Speaker 5>my close friends and of course in </v>

696
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:17.520
<v Speaker 5>several months the tragedy of Kennedy's </v>
<v Speaker 5>death actually happened and so my </v>

697
00:39:18.221 --> 00:39:23.221
<v Speaker 5>vision,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it was coincidental or </v>

698
00:39:23.221 --> 00:39:25.440
<v Speaker 5>pre-cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was on record and I considered myself a </v>

699
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:25.440
<v Speaker 5>highly psychic person.</v>

700
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't consider yourself know </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

701
00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Did that freak you out at all?</v>

702
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:32.950
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing freaks me out in this field.</v>

703
00:39:32.951 --> 00:39:37.951
<v Speaker 5>It's just a surprise that sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 5>leaves me as a sense of longer because </v>

704
00:39:37.951 --> 00:39:40.000
<v Speaker 5>there's more things going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world that we,</v>

705
00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:45.460
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't take seriously or that take us by </v>

706
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:45.460
<v Speaker 5>surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

707
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:50.500
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing that really freaks me out is </v>

708
00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.030
<v Speaker 5>when people do not take global warming </v>
<v Speaker 5>seriously,</v>

709
00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:57.180
<v Speaker 5>the thing that freaks me out as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mainstream religions in the world don't </v>

710
00:39:57.281 --> 00:40:00.630
<v Speaker 5>give women proper rights to control </v>
<v Speaker 5>their own bodies.</v>

711
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:05.080
<v Speaker 5>The thing that freaks me out is when </v>
<v Speaker 5>politicians fight each other,</v>

712
00:40:05.081 --> 00:40:10.081
<v Speaker 5>leaving the children of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in the Middle East with </v>

713
00:40:10.081 --> 00:40:10.720
<v Speaker 5>nightmares and posttraumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 5>disorder.</v>

714
00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.570
<v Speaker 5>Those are practical things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>written about.</v>

715
00:40:13.571 --> 00:40:15.310
<v Speaker 5>And those are the things that freaked me</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

716
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that freaks out anybody with a </v>

717
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:21.210
<v Speaker 1>conscience or anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's paying attention to the,</v>

718
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:22.250
<v Speaker 1>the evils of this world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live.</v>

719
00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.510
<v Speaker 1>We live in very strange times where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have so much information,</v>

720
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:28.180
<v Speaker 1>more access to information than any </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation ever,</v>

721
00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:33.210
<v Speaker 1>but yet things more or less are still </v>
<v Speaker 1>going along the same course as far as </v>

722
00:40:33.221 --> 00:40:34.920
<v Speaker 1>global events as far as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

723
00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:39.030
<v Speaker 1>the monopolization of natural resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as you know,</v>

724
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.790
<v Speaker 1>using the bore to monopolize those </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural resources.</v>

725
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:45.070
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be the same as it's ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>

726
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:50.880
<v Speaker 5>It's a little better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Back when I first became interested in </v>

727
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.841
<v Speaker 5>posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've written three books on that topic </v>

728
00:40:54.841 --> 00:40:56.230
<v Speaker 5>that your listeners can find on Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 5>calm.</v>

729
00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.770
<v Speaker 5>There were 30 wars going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

730
00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.580
<v Speaker 5>most of them civil wars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now there's 20 wars.</v>

731
00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.540
<v Speaker 5>That's an improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

732
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:11.550
<v Speaker 5>I guess there are still are a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 5>billion people who are displaced in the </v>

733
00:41:12.131 --> 00:41:17.131
<v Speaker 5>refugee camps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There still are children who have </v>

734
00:41:17.131 --> 00:41:20.161
<v Speaker 5>nightmares every night because they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>living in war zones or still are women </v>

735
00:41:20.161 --> 00:41:22.270
<v Speaker 5>being raped and brutalized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but things are a little better than they</v>

736
00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:23.260
<v Speaker 5>were 30 years ago.</v>

737
00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are a little better than there </v>

738
00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:28.850
<v Speaker 1>were thousands of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

739
00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:32.160
<v Speaker 1>I've had this conversation recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>where a friend were talking about how </v>

740
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if some people up from</v>

741
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:39.160
<v Speaker 3>another land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they were there to rape and </v>

742
00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:39.160
<v Speaker 3>pillage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when people show up,</v>

743
00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.210
<v Speaker 3>they're a part of the global economy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're tourists and you know,</v>

744
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:44.210
<v Speaker 3>we allow them in even if they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak the language and we sell books,</v>

745
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:46.670
<v Speaker 3>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell them where the restaurants are,</v>

746
00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:48.590
<v Speaker 3>try to speak English to them to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>their money.</v>

747
00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world has changed drastically in </v>

748
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 3>that respect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet,</v>

749
00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:59.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still a lot of really fucked up </v>

750
00:41:59.060 --> 00:41:59.450
<v Speaker 3>things about the way human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>behave.</v>

751
00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:04.770
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was my friend Buckminster Fuller's </v>

752
00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:07.920
<v Speaker 6>concept of the global village and </v>
<v Speaker 6>Buckminster Fuller had a plan,</v>

753
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:11.980
<v Speaker 6>a logistical plan to feed everybody in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the world.</v>

754
00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:16.990
<v Speaker 6>If the wars would stop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now that vision is still applicable,</v>

755
00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:22.020
<v Speaker 6>but it's not going to happen as long as </v>
<v Speaker 6>these 20 wars are going on and food is </v>

756
00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:26.560
<v Speaker 6>unable to go from areas of plenty to </v>
<v Speaker 6>areas of poverty.</v>

757
00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:32.490
<v Speaker 6>So the conflicts and the wars,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not only in the middle of the east but </v>

758
00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:36.331
<v Speaker 6>in Africa and even in our own country in</v>
<v Speaker 6>terms of the,</v>

759
00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:41.320
<v Speaker 6>in terms of the terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the home bread,</v>

760
00:42:41.321 --> 00:42:46.321
<v Speaker 6>terrorists who are victimizing people in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the United States as long as others </v>

761
00:42:46.321 --> 00:42:48.130
<v Speaker 6>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we still aren't going to have the global</v>

762
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.290
<v Speaker 6>village that Buckminster Fuller digital.</v>

763
00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:55.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Utopian concept is a really </v>

764
00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:55.660
<v Speaker 3>interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea of the global village,</v>

765
00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:59.890
<v Speaker 3>I've always felt like one way to make it</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen would be to take these people </v>

766
00:43:00.111 --> 00:43:03.870
<v Speaker 3>that are profiting off of rebuilding </v>
<v Speaker 3>these countries after we blow them up in</v>

767
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:07.430
<v Speaker 3>like and make it profitable to rebuild </v>
<v Speaker 3>ghettos,</v>

768
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:10.820
<v Speaker 3>make it profitable to go to companies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and educate kids,</v>

769
00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:15.821
<v Speaker 3>make it profitable to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fix their water systems and provide </v>

770
00:43:15.821 --> 00:43:19.130
<v Speaker 3>them with sewage and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and make sure that they can take care of</v>

771
00:43:19.131 --> 00:43:20.340
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring food and medicine.</v>

772
00:43:20.341 --> 00:43:22.130
<v Speaker 3>And it seems like there's money involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that.</v>

773
00:43:22.131 --> 00:43:27.131
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it's just a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 3>transferring the energy to instead of </v>

774
00:43:27.131 --> 00:43:31.310
<v Speaker 3>only doing it to come to countries where</v>
<v Speaker 3>we blow them up,</v>

775
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:33.650
<v Speaker 3>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The countries that need it,</v>

776
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:38.680
<v Speaker 3>like make it profitable for countries </v>
<v Speaker 3>like or companies like Halliburton to </v>

777
00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.000
<v Speaker 3>make money by building up third world </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>

778
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:46.240
<v Speaker 6>Halliburton made over $2,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>from the Iraq war and a lot of that was </v>

779
00:43:48.171 --> 00:43:53.171
<v Speaker 6>lost during graft and corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now while this Halliburton Dong to </v>

780
00:43:54.501 --> 00:43:57.560
<v Speaker 6>improve the infrastructure in the United</v>
<v Speaker 6>States,</v>

781
00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:02.210
<v Speaker 6>our country is literally falling apart,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially in terms of transportation,</v>

782
00:44:02.211 --> 00:44:06.740
<v Speaker 6>especially in terms of cleaning up the </v>
<v Speaker 6>pollution in our country.</v>

783
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:13.030
<v Speaker 6>Dwight Eisenhower was actually the last </v>
<v Speaker 6>precedent that paid attention to the </v>

784
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:15.260
<v Speaker 6>infrastructure with this interstate </v>
<v Speaker 6>highway system.</v>

785
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:19.520
<v Speaker 6>A Bama is trying to do something for the</v>
<v Speaker 6>infrastructure right now,</v>

786
00:44:19.521 --> 00:44:22.910
<v Speaker 6>but he's not having much success in </v>
<v Speaker 6>getting that through congress.</v>

787
00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:28.290
<v Speaker 6>You are absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If some subsidy could be given to big </v>

788
00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 6>companies to build up the infrastructure</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the low income parts</v>

789
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.980
<v Speaker 5>of our country to clean up the polluted </v>
<v Speaker 5>streams and waters and oceans and </v>

790
00:44:38.041 --> 00:44:41.130
<v Speaker 5>rivers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be money well spent.</v>

791
00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:43.110
<v Speaker 3>It just thinking about what we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with corn.</v>

792
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:48.500
<v Speaker 3>You know the amount of money in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of emphasis they put on on on </v>

793
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:54.021
<v Speaker 3>farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing corn and the subsidies that are </v>

794
00:44:54.021 --> 00:44:56.481
<v Speaker 3>involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty staggering and that's the </v>

795
00:44:56.481 --> 00:44:58.671
<v Speaker 3>reason why there's so much corn syrup </v>
<v Speaker 3>and corn and corn that corn is fucking </v>

796
00:44:58.671 --> 00:44:58.671
<v Speaker 3>terrible</v>

797
00:44:58.671 --> 00:45:03.550
<v Speaker 5>for you and that's why people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting obese because if they're taking </v>

798
00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:08.650
<v Speaker 5>all of the sweetening from the corn </v>
<v Speaker 5>syrup and look at all the subsidies that</v>

799
00:45:08.651 --> 00:45:13.651
<v Speaker 5>are going to correlate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are many natural sweeteners that </v>

800
00:45:13.651 --> 00:45:16.850
<v Speaker 5>do not add weight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of them come from China,</v>

801
00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.400
<v Speaker 5>some of them actually can come to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>United States.</v>

802
00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:24.820
<v Speaker 5>Why don't we have more money going into </v>
<v Speaker 5>those natural sweeteners rather than the</v>

803
00:45:25.881 --> 00:45:30.881
<v Speaker 5>sweeteners like aspartame for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Donald Rumsfeld made money off and </v>

804
00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:39.110
<v Speaker 5>which is worse for you than the sugar in</v>
<v Speaker 5>soft drinks</v>

805
00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:40.280
<v Speaker 3>supposedly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

806
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.370
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard anybody really get </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up from aspartame,</v>

807
00:45:43.371 --> 00:45:46.490
<v Speaker 3>but I've read terrible things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential side effects.</v>

808
00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.350
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's so delicious.</v>

809
00:45:48.351 --> 00:45:50.960
<v Speaker 3>And a diet coke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where it's problematic.</v>

810
00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like Stevia.</v>

811
00:45:52.491 --> 00:45:53.390
<v Speaker 3>Stevia is good stuff.</v>

812
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.020
<v Speaker 5>Steve was good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

813
00:45:55.021 --> 00:45:56.050
<v Speaker 5>So go along with that.</v>

814
00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although I have read recently some </v>

815
00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:01.640
<v Speaker 3>negative things on Stevia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but someone said that's propaganda and I</v>

816
00:46:01.641 --> 00:46:02.330
<v Speaker 3>haven't looked into it.</v>

817
00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:03.250
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>

818
00:46:03.251 --> 00:46:08.251
<v Speaker 5>because the competitors are going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>spread nasty things about something </v>

819
00:46:08.251 --> 00:46:08.251
<v Speaker 5>that's healthy.</v>

820
00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:09.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

821
00:46:09.251 --> 00:46:12.040
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that someone can come along and</v>

822
00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:15.700
<v Speaker 3>have some natural sweetener that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>put any calories into,</v>

823
00:46:15.701 --> 00:46:20.701
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into your food and it's actually </v>

824
00:46:20.701 --> 00:46:20.701
<v Speaker 3>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very dangerous for the,</v>

825
00:46:20.701 --> 00:46:21.700
<v Speaker 3>for the established elite.</v>

826
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:24.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go back to rolling thunder </v>
<v Speaker 5>because in our book,</v>

827
00:46:24.371 --> 00:46:29.371
<v Speaker 5>the Voice of Rolling Thunder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a long interview with him about </v>

828
00:46:29.371 --> 00:46:33.331
<v Speaker 5>how he did not pay attention to taking </v>
<v Speaker 5>sugar into his body and how he got </v>

829
00:46:33.331 --> 00:46:37.831
<v Speaker 5>diabetes and he goes on a long harangue </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to urge people to stay away from </v>

830
00:46:39.341 --> 00:46:41.710
<v Speaker 5>sugary drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sugary treats,</v>

831
00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:46.890
<v Speaker 5>or they'll end up getting diabetes like </v>
<v Speaker 5>he did and his diabetes was so bad that </v>

832
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:53.190
<v Speaker 5>Mickey Hart of the grateful dead and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>had to fly to his home in the data and </v>

833
00:46:53.531 --> 00:46:58.531
<v Speaker 5>get him into an airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bring him back to Mickey Hart's Doctor </v>

834
00:46:58.531 --> 00:47:03.120
<v Speaker 5>in the San Francisco area who had to </v>
<v Speaker 5>amputate his leg to save his life from </v>

835
00:47:04.691 --> 00:47:05.620
<v Speaker 5>diabetes.</v>

836
00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:10.280
<v Speaker 3>And this is all from just eating sugar </v>
<v Speaker 3>or is that there's some sort of,</v>

837
00:47:10.281 --> 00:47:11.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does he have a natural inclination?</v>

838
00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:16.980
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She'll know diabetes as something that </v>

839
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.460
<v Speaker 5>it's ordinary for people to gather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They reach a certain age,</v>

840
00:47:18.461 --> 00:47:22.210
<v Speaker 5>but there was a genetic proclivity along</v>
<v Speaker 5>with that.</v>

841
00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:27.510
<v Speaker 5>But he learned his lesson and toward the</v>
<v Speaker 5>end of his life he tried to warn people </v>

842
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:29.890
<v Speaker 5>about eating more healthy food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>less sugar.</v>

843
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:31.020
<v Speaker 6>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stan,</v>

844
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.850
<v Speaker 6>while you're talking about a rolling </v>
<v Speaker 6>thunders genetics,</v>

845
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:36.070
<v Speaker 6>you might mention your coauthor of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>book.</v>

846
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
<v Speaker 6>The coauthor of a book is shitty </v>
<v Speaker 6>enrolling city and Morning Star and city</v>

847
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:46.150
<v Speaker 6>and morning star is the ground son of </v>
<v Speaker 6>rolling thunder.</v>

848
00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:51.570
<v Speaker 6>And he and I got together and we </v>
<v Speaker 6>interviewed two dozen people who knew </v>

849
00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:55.381
<v Speaker 6>rolling thunder and told their stories </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the book that we called the Voice of </v>

850
00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.960
<v Speaker 6>Rolling Thunder because Mickey Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the drummer of the grateful dead,</v>

851
00:47:58.961 --> 00:48:03.730
<v Speaker 6>his recorded several dozen speeches of </v>
<v Speaker 6>rolling thunder over the years.</v>

852
00:48:03.731 --> 00:48:08.731
<v Speaker 6>And we got access to those tapes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so we actually have the first </v>

853
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:13.990
<v Speaker 6>original speeches laced through the </v>
<v Speaker 6>book.</v>

854
00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.390
<v Speaker 6>And so we actually do have the voiceover</v>
<v Speaker 6>length under,</v>

855
00:48:16.391 --> 00:48:18.850
<v Speaker 6>in the book is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no audio book though,</v>

856
00:48:18.851 --> 00:48:19.960
<v Speaker 6>is there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

857
00:48:19.961 --> 00:48:23.920
<v Speaker 6>we are hoping there will be an old.com.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's get on that.</v>

858
00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:27.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've got the original tapes there.</v>

859
00:48:27.191 --> 00:48:28.150
<v Speaker 6>That's fantastic.</v>

860
00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.180
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

861
00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:35.540
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were very fortunate enough to see </v>

862
00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:39.031
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a psychedelic hysteria of the sixties </v>

863
00:48:39.031 --> 00:48:42.310
<v Speaker 3>and see it manifested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in law in was in 1970.</v>

864
00:48:42.311 --> 00:48:46.180
<v Speaker 3>This sweeping it's schedule one </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic act that was passed.</v>

865
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:51.310
<v Speaker 3>What was the impact on culture?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always found it was one of the most</v>

866
00:48:51.311 --> 00:48:56.040
<v Speaker 3>fascinating areas for this country and </v>
<v Speaker 3>even humanity that we can study the,</v>

867
00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.990
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the distance between the fifties and the</v>

868
00:48:58.991 --> 00:49:03.991
<v Speaker 3>sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's never been a time that we </v>

869
00:49:03.991 --> 00:49:07.951
<v Speaker 3>could ever look at where there's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>such a gigantic radical change that you </v>

870
00:49:07.951 --> 00:49:10.630
<v Speaker 3>can really attribute a big part of it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics in this country.</v>

871
00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:13.900
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And also psychedelics of course,</v>

872
00:49:13.901 --> 00:49:16.940
<v Speaker 6>should be put down by the political </v>
<v Speaker 6>establishment today,</v>

873
00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:21.380
<v Speaker 6>but without the psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you would have had the,</v>

874
00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:26.850
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>smart investors who are responsible for </v>

875
00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:27.620
<v Speaker 6>the intranet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for the cell phone,</v>

876
00:49:27.621 --> 00:49:30.230
<v Speaker 6>for the smartphone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for computers,</v>

877
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.120
<v Speaker 6>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Etc.</v>

878
00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.050
<v Speaker 6>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dna replication.</v>

879
00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:36.320
<v Speaker 6>I mEt carrie mullis a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 6>ago at ted.</v>

880
00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:40.870
<v Speaker 6>He won the nobel prize in chemistry for </v>
<v Speaker 6>coming up with the pca.</v>

881
00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:41.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

882
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:46.950
<v Speaker 6>Kary mullis mollison.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He gives Due credit to his work with </v>

883
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:49.841
<v Speaker 6>lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I met fraNcis crick And he gives you </v>

884
00:49:49.841 --> 00:49:51.470
<v Speaker 6>credit for his lsd sessions for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>double helix.</v>

885
00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:56.510
<v Speaker 6>So there are many adventures outside of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the electronics that made changes,</v>

886
00:49:56.511 --> 00:50:00.620
<v Speaker 6>much less the difference in style,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the difference in music,</v>

887
00:50:00.621 --> 00:50:05.621
<v Speaker 6>the difference in sexual behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And historians when they write about </v>

888
00:50:06.261 --> 00:50:10.490
<v Speaker 6>that area,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do not really give enough credit to what</v>

889
00:50:10.491 --> 00:50:12.920
<v Speaker 6>the psychedelics did in the role that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they played.</v>

890
00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:14.190
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't do that.</v>

891
00:50:14.191 --> 00:50:15.360
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird thing.</v>

892
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:17.100
<v Speaker 3>So they try to avoid it.</v>

893
00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:22.320
<v Speaker 6>They try to avoid it because they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>afraid it will get censored.</v>

894
00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:27.920
<v Speaker 6>And often a musket censored.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know of cases where journalists </v>

895
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:32.330
<v Speaker 6>written about the role of lsd and other </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelics and social change in their </v>

896
00:50:32.671 --> 00:50:37.671
<v Speaker 6>editors.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have a whiteboard that out of the </v>

897
00:50:37.671 --> 00:50:42.090
<v Speaker 6>article and I'll put the article young </v>
<v Speaker 6>without due credit to lsd.</v>

898
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:47.300
<v Speaker 6>Now you don't get this at all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the alternative press and you certainly </v>

899
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.450
<v Speaker 6>don't get this in the show such as </v>
<v Speaker 6>yours,</v>

900
00:50:48.451 --> 00:50:52.050
<v Speaker 6>which are for a wheel and don't have </v>
<v Speaker 6>censorship involved with them,</v>

901
00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.990
<v Speaker 6>but of course I saw all of this </v>
<v Speaker 6>firsthand.</v>

902
00:50:54.991 --> 00:50:58.170
<v Speaker 6>I knew Albert Hoffman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was a very dear friend of mine.</v>

903
00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:03.560
<v Speaker 6>He should have won the nobel prize and </v>
<v Speaker 6>he would have if lsd had been allowed to</v>

904
00:51:03.631 --> 00:51:08.631
<v Speaker 6>take its aCtual course and help people </v>
<v Speaker 6>in psychotherapy and creativity of dying</v>

905
00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:15.210
<v Speaker 6>and dignified death,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but lsd fell into the wrong hands that </v>

906
00:51:15.301 --> 00:51:20.301
<v Speaker 6>was victiMized by the government and </v>
<v Speaker 6>poor Albert Hoffman was very grieved by </v>

907
00:51:21.781 --> 00:51:22.080
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

908
00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:25.350
<v Speaker 6>He wasn't grief for not getting enough </v>
<v Speaker 6>honor himself,</v>

909
00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:27.720
<v Speaker 6>but he had a tool here that could be </v>
<v Speaker 6>very,</v>

910
00:51:27.721 --> 00:51:31.260
<v Speaker 6>very helpful to people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you had the extremists.</v>

911
00:51:31.261 --> 00:51:34.200
<v Speaker 6>Like my old friend timothy leary,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who I liked very much,</v>

912
00:51:34.201 --> 00:51:39.201
<v Speaker 6>but who I disagreed with going to one </v>
<v Speaker 6>extreme and saying lsd for all.</v>

913
00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:44.420
<v Speaker 6>And then the government on the other </v>
<v Speaker 6>hand saying lsd for nobody.</v>

914
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:47.850
<v Speaker 6>It's a dangerous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And people like Richard Nixon,</v>

915
00:51:47.851 --> 00:51:50.520
<v Speaker 6>he's saying timothy leary is public </v>
<v Speaker 6>enemy number one,</v>

916
00:51:50.521 --> 00:51:54.630
<v Speaker 6>the most dangerous man in America.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And where was the middle ground?</v>

917
00:51:54.631 --> 00:51:57.060
<v Speaker 6>People like Jean Houston,</v>
<v Speaker 6>robert masters,</v>

918
00:51:57.061 --> 00:51:59.890
<v Speaker 6>sydney colon osher,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yannick [inaudible],</v>

919
00:51:59.891 --> 00:52:02.880
<v Speaker 6>some of the pioneers who I knew very </v>
<v Speaker 6>well of that era.</v>

920
00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:07.940
<v Speaker 6>There were cop completely eclipsed and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they were cut off from legit have the </v>

921
00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:07.940
<v Speaker 6>supplies of lsd.</v>

922
00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:13.060
<v Speaker 3>The work with lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The work that uh,</v>

923
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:15.440
<v Speaker 3>francis crick did with the double helix </v>
<v Speaker 3>dna.</v>

924
00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.720
<v Speaker 3>That's very controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't,</v>

925
00:52:17.721 --> 00:52:19.760
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't that on his deathbed that he said</v>

926
00:52:19.761 --> 00:52:21.060
<v Speaker 3>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

927
00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:24.240
<v Speaker 3>he come to these conclusions was very </v>
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

928
00:52:24.241 --> 00:52:25.940
<v Speaker 3>This is actually after I met him</v>

929
00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:30.940
<v Speaker 6>when he talked about lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And of course we don't know the role </v>

930
00:52:32.091 --> 00:52:37.091
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that actually played in something as </v>

931
00:52:37.091 --> 00:52:40.361
<v Speaker 6>complicated as The double helix.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember tHat his parked or watson </v>

932
00:52:40.361 --> 00:52:44.860
<v Speaker 6>deserves equal credit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We never know how much credit to give to</v>

933
00:52:45.741 --> 00:52:50.741
<v Speaker 6>somethiNg like that and it's a source.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a source of a creative person will </v>

934
00:52:51.021 --> 00:52:53.900
<v Speaker 6>try many things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

935
00:52:53.901 --> 00:52:58.901
<v Speaker 6>I interviewed track zappa for an article</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wrote about the influence of </v>

936
00:52:58.901 --> 00:53:00.080
<v Speaker 6>psychedelics on art and music and he </v>
<v Speaker 6>says,</v>

937
00:53:00.081 --> 00:53:05.081
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what role psychedelics </v>
<v Speaker 6>played with my music and artist and </v>

938
00:53:05.081 --> 00:53:09.581
<v Speaker 6>musician will go to many sources and </v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll pull from life experiences for </v>

939
00:53:09.581 --> 00:53:11.240
<v Speaker 6>many sources.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so no,</v>

940
00:53:11.241 --> 00:53:15.800
<v Speaker 6>you never know exactly all we can say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It didn't seem to do with any herb.</v>

941
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:20.470
<v Speaker 3>The harm francis crick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he tell you himself that he had.</v>

942
00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:22.360
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was after I met him.</v>

943
00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:25.930
<v Speaker 3>After he met him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had a full conversation,</v>

944
00:53:25.931 --> 00:53:26.080
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

945
00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:31.080
<v Speaker 1>this was years after I met him that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>made the statement about lsd because a </v>

946
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:35.430
<v Speaker 1>michio kaku wouldn't admit that I had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with him on the opiod </v>

947
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:38.420
<v Speaker 1>anthony show and I asked him about </v>
<v Speaker 1>francis crick and he completely poopooed</v>

948
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:43.490
<v Speaker 1>instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nonsense and he's of the belief </v>

949
00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:44.710
<v Speaker 1>that psychedelics are bad for the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and give you brain damage.</v>

950
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Really kind of a disappointing point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view when I,</v>

951
00:53:47.201 --> 00:53:52.201
<v Speaker 1>when I talked to him because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recognized right away that he had </v>

952
00:53:52.201 --> 00:53:52.830
<v Speaker 1>never had any experiences with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

953
00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:56.830
<v Speaker 1>It was just purely a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a standard sort of academic.</v>

954
00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't believe it at all.</v>

955
00:53:59.681 --> 00:54:02.860
<v Speaker 1>He said that it was not true in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper this morning.</v>

956
00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:06.790
<v Speaker 1>There was a statistic though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the within the last 12 months,</v>

957
00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:12.540
<v Speaker 1>170,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have died from prescription </v>

958
00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.180
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

959
00:54:13.181 --> 00:54:16.180
<v Speaker 1>How many people have died in the last 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>months from marijuana?</v>

960
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:19.780
<v Speaker 1>How many people have died in the last 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>months from an overdose of lsd?</v>

961
00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:25.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous because it's also when </v>

962
00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:27.900
<v Speaker 3>you are a mainstream academic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a guy like michio kaku,</v>

963
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:32.930
<v Speaker 3>you almost have to talk bad about </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana and illegal drugs and you </v>

964
00:54:33.481 --> 00:54:36.570
<v Speaker 3>almost have to ignore the dangers of </v>
<v Speaker 3>PresCription drugs.</v>

965
00:54:36.571 --> 00:54:39.750
<v Speaker 3>It's reAlly not something that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

966
00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:42.360
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no benefit in,</v>

967
00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:45.900
<v Speaker 3>in his career toward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for him taking a controversial.</v>

968
00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know that that's like </v>

969
00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:52.771
<v Speaker 2>halliburton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like some executive at </v>

970
00:54:52.771 --> 00:54:52.771
<v Speaker 2>halliburton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

971
00:54:52.771 --> 00:54:55.581
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you can stand up and say the </v>

972

<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially these days is you and I were </v>

<v Speaker 2>communication and the gatekeepers </v>

975
00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:02.920
<v Speaker 2>getting edged out of the picture.</v>

<v Speaker 3>as much.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but I've experienCed a lot of </v>

1013
00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:50.990
<v Speaker 3>frustration from various people from </v>
<v Speaker 3>agents and producers and executives were</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like what are you thinking that this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to hurt the big picture.</v>

1016
00:56:55.611 --> 00:57:00.611
<v Speaker 3>This is going to hurt the package is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to hurt the things that I'm </v>

1017
00:57:00.611 --> 00:57:00.611
<v Speaker 3>connected to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It never has.</v>

1018
00:57:00.611 --> 00:57:03.530
<v Speaker 3>It never has never got pressure from fox</v>
<v Speaker 3>or anybody don't know.</v>

1019
00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:04.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1020
00:57:04.281 --> 00:57:06.410
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Debate me,</v>

1021
00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:07.680
<v Speaker 3>sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sit down,</v>

1022
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:09.410
<v Speaker 3>sit down with me and let's discuss what </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1023
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:12.020
<v Speaker 3>what is the real issue that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem here.</v>

1024
00:57:12.021 --> 00:57:13.660
<v Speaker 3>Is it illegality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1025
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:15.530
<v Speaker 3>do you understand the roots of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegality?</v>

1026
00:57:15.531 --> 00:57:18.590
<v Speaker 3>Because it's not based on science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's based on hysteria.</v>

1027
00:57:18.591 --> 00:57:21.500
<v Speaker 3>It's based on worry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's based on fear is racism,</v>

1028
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:23.420
<v Speaker 3>but surely when you talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana,</v>

1029
00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:25.580
<v Speaker 3>it propaganda and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and really,</v>

1030
00:57:25.581 --> 00:57:26.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was uh,</v>

1031
00:57:26.211 --> 00:57:31.211
<v Speaker 3>based on the suppression of hemp as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>commodity really didn't even have </v>

1032
00:57:31.211 --> 00:57:32.870
<v Speaker 3>anything to do with marijuana as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive drug.</v>

1033
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:35.690
<v Speaker 3>So anybody who wants to sit down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate with me,</v>

1034
00:57:35.691 --> 00:57:39.800
<v Speaker 3>you're just gonna reinforce my point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about this and I've read too</v>

1035
00:57:39.801 --> 00:57:41.230
<v Speaker 3>much about this to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1036
00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.650
<v Speaker 3>to step back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1037
00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:48.330
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he will be able to speak on this </v>

1038
00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:52.241
<v Speaker 3>because you've seen this happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were there from the fifties and </v>

1039
00:57:52.241 --> 00:57:55.121
<v Speaker 3>sixties that the psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the change that psychedelics can impart </v>

1040
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:59.900
<v Speaker 3>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aLthough I think anything can be abuSeD.</v>

1041
00:57:59.901 --> 00:58:04.901
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think any humans have a propensity to </v>

1042
00:58:04.901 --> 00:58:07.640
<v Speaker 3>overindulge in almost any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior,</v>

1043
00:58:07.641 --> 00:58:10.160
<v Speaker 3>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ordinary people get addicted to love.</v>

1044
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:15.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can get obsessed with </v>

1045
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.430
<v Speaker 3>relationships that could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1046
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:16.890
<v Speaker 3>under the control of someone with </v>
<v Speaker 3>discipline or with the,</v>

1047
00:58:16.891 --> 00:58:18.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who has a grip on reality.</v>

1048
00:58:18.831 --> 00:58:20.720
<v Speaker 3>It could be a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

1049
00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:26.260
<v Speaker 3>we have this ability to fuck any out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but overall I think psychedelics have an</v>

1050
00:58:27.051 --> 00:58:32.051
<v Speaker 3>incredibly positive effect on people </v>
<v Speaker 3>overall.</v>

1051
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:37.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the broad spectrum of </v>

1052
00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:39.041
<v Speaker 3>users and talk about johns hopkins had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>recent paper that they published about </v>

1053
00:58:40.671 --> 00:58:43.310
<v Speaker 3>the longterm effects of suicide in use </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1054
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:44.500
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1055
00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:48.290
<v Speaker 3>these people that took it were enhanced </v>
<v Speaker 3>the personality 20 years later.</v>

1056
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:49.580
<v Speaker 3>One mushroom trip,</v>

1057
00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.610
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1058
00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:55.650
<v Speaker 6>This is one reason why I'm glad that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>am in mainstream academia.</v>

1059
00:58:55.651 --> 00:58:57.360
<v Speaker 6>I don't have to worry about these </v>
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

1060
00:58:57.361 --> 00:59:01.950
<v Speaker 6>I teach at saybrook university,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is very open minded,</v>

<v Speaker 6>members</v>

1073
00:59:38.771 --> 00:59:43.670
<v Speaker 3>should have left san francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>San francisco is the free capital of </v>

1074
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:44.580
<v Speaker 3>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always will be.</v>

1075
00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:45.100
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1076
00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:50.210
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it gets back to your point about </v>

1077
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:52.161
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the cultural effect of psychedelics in </v>

1078
00:59:52.161 --> 00:59:52.161
<v Speaker 6>the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

1079
00:59:52.161 --> 00:59:53.090
<v Speaker 6>It san francisco is the place that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>still vibrating a little bit</v>

1080
00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:54.700
<v Speaker 3>from this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still ringing.</v>

1081
00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:57.550
<v Speaker 3>The gong still has the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1082
00:59:57.551 --> 01:00:01.480
<v Speaker 3>I lived in san francisco from the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was 11 until I was 13,</v>

1083
01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:02.980
<v Speaker 3>or actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

1084
01:00:02.981 --> 01:00:04.650
<v Speaker 3>seven to 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1085
01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:08.140
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a fascinating time because it was</v>

1086
01:00:08.141 --> 01:00:13.141
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the Vietnam war was ending and a </v>

1087
01:00:13.141 --> 01:00:15.130
<v Speaker 3>san francisco was unlike any other place</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the country.</v>

1088
01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:16.810
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know it at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1089
01:00:16.811 --> 01:00:20.140
<v Speaker 3>because I was only seven years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we went from New Jersey,</v>

1090
01:00:20.141 --> 01:00:25.141
<v Speaker 3>which was this barbaric shithole to san </v>
<v Speaker 3>francisco and then went from san </v>

1091
01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:28.940
<v Speaker 3>francisco to Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was another barbaric shit.</v>

1092
01:00:28.941 --> 01:00:30.070
<v Speaker 3>All.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>

1093
01:00:30.071 --> 01:00:33.880
<v Speaker 3>it was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what the word nigger meant</v>

1094
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:36.400
<v Speaker 3>until I was 11 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

1095
01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:38.860
<v Speaker 3>I never heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard in san francisco.</v>

1096
01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean the people don't believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was,</v>

1097
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:42.660
<v Speaker 3>I didn't experience racism.</v>

1098
01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.770
<v Speaker 3>I went to school with black kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asian kids.</v>

1099
01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:46.510
<v Speaker 3>everybody was just a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1100
01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.850
<v Speaker 3>this is bobby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His family's from Korea.</v>

1101
01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.560
<v Speaker 3>This is mike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His family is black.</v>

1102
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:55.950
<v Speaker 3>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no a weirdness to it until I </v>

1103
01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:57.490
<v Speaker 3>went to Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then my mother didn't believe me.</v>

1104
01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.680
<v Speaker 3>I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said to my mother,</v>

1105
01:00:59.681 --> 01:01:00.530
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1106
01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:01.750
<v Speaker 3>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is nigger mean?</v>

1107
01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.760
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what it means?</v>

1108
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.540
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1109
01:01:04.541 --> 01:01:05.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1110
01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:06.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mother grew up in New Jersey,</v>

1111
01:01:06.991 --> 01:01:11.991
<v Speaker 3>she probably heard it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when we lived in Florida it was the </v>

1112
01:01:11.991 --> 01:01:12.820
<v Speaker 3>first time I'd heard it in school and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to come to her and that she's like,</v>

1113
01:01:12.821 --> 01:01:15.070
<v Speaker 3>it's a derogatory term for black people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1114
01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:20.071
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so shocked because from age seven </v>

1115
01:01:20.071 --> 01:01:22.780
<v Speaker 3>to 11,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in this really open minded,</v>

1116
01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:24.670
<v Speaker 3>intelligent environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1117
01:01:24.671 --> 01:01:27.250
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we lived near a lombard street.</v>

1118
01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:29.770
<v Speaker 3>We were like in the heart of san </v>
<v Speaker 3>francisco,</v>

1119
01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:32.920
<v Speaker 3>gay neighbors like gay to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was just a part of life.</v>

1123
01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.610
<v Speaker 3>San francisco is a just an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing spot.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's very strange,</v>

1133
01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:02.880
<v Speaker 3>but I'm the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the coolest things about the </v>

1134
01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:02.880
<v Speaker 3>story is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the podcast,</v>

1135
01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.750
<v Speaker 3>the ability to have a guy like you on </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a conversation for hours at a time.</v>

1136
01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.400
<v Speaker 3>What was it like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you.</v>

1137
01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.220
<v Speaker 3>Were you living in san francisco during </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sixties?</v>

1138
01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:13.220
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was doing the dream telepathy research</v>

1139
01:02:13.221 --> 01:02:18.221
<v Speaker 6>in New York city with my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these medical center during the 19 six </v>

1140
01:02:18.221 --> 01:02:19.420
<v Speaker 6>years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but once I met becky hart,</v>

1141
01:02:19.421 --> 01:02:22.570
<v Speaker 6>I would take a trip to san francisco a </v>
<v Speaker 6>couple of times.</v>

1142
01:02:22.571 --> 01:02:27.571
<v Speaker 6>You're in stay at his ranch and rolling </v>
<v Speaker 6>thunder as well as all other members of </v>

1143
01:02:28.541 --> 01:02:31.150
<v Speaker 6>the grateful dead and the other members </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the rock community.</v>

1144
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:35.380
<v Speaker 6>Now they got a tour of haight ashbury,</v>
<v Speaker 6>had friends in haight ashbury,</v>

1145
01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:40.770
<v Speaker 6>so every time I came to san francisco I </v>
<v Speaker 6>got myself immersed in the hippie </v>

1146
01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:43.150
<v Speaker 6>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The psychedelic culture.</v>

1147
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:45.850
<v Speaker 6>LeArned a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Came back to New York city,</v>

1148
01:02:45.851 --> 01:02:50.050
<v Speaker 6>put that knowledge to use in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>research that we were doing,</v>

1149
01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:55.680
<v Speaker 6>and then we actually ran out of money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't do the dream telepathy </v>

1150
01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:00.061
<v Speaker 6>research anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I got an offer to teach at saybrook </v>

1151
01:03:00.061 --> 01:03:01.960
<v Speaker 6>university and that's when I moved to </v>
<v Speaker 6>san francisco in the,</v>

1152
01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.840
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the early 19 seventies.</v>

1153
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:08.360
<v Speaker 3>So you moved there right after </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything became illegal?</v>

1154
01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.160
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is correct.</v>

1155
01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:12.710
<v Speaker 3>what was the effect on san francisco?</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1156
01:03:12.711 --> 01:03:13.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1157
01:03:13.211 --> 01:03:14.570
<v Speaker 3>the change from.</v>

1158
01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.150
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the effect was sort of negative.</v>

1159
01:03:17.151 --> 01:03:22.151
<v Speaker 6>I'll know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw a lot of people who had been </v>

1160
01:03:22.151 --> 01:03:24.950
<v Speaker 6>dabbling with psychedelics and then they</v>
<v Speaker 6>switched to cocaine.</v>

1161
01:03:24.951 --> 01:03:29.951
<v Speaker 6>Some of them switched to heroin and so </v>
<v Speaker 6>the illegality had some very negative </v>

1162
01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:38.960
<v Speaker 6>effect upon a lot of young people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

1163
01:03:38.961 --> 01:03:42.290
<v Speaker 6>not to say that they shouldn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 6>responsibility was there,</v>

1164
01:03:42.291 --> 01:03:45.140
<v Speaker 6>their decision to turn to these harder </v>
<v Speaker 6>drugs.</v>

1165
01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.830
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the beautiful summer of love didn't last</v>

1166
01:03:48.831 --> 01:03:49.430
<v Speaker 6>very long.</v>

1167
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:54.140
<v Speaker 3>if I don't want to screw up everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1168
01:03:54.141 --> 01:03:55.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as one of the.</v>

1169
01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.410
<v Speaker 3>Did you know terence mckenna at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1170
01:03:57.411 --> 01:04:02.411
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the other things that he said </v>

1171
01:04:02.411 --> 01:04:05.660
<v Speaker 3>that I found really fascinating was that</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we really learned from the,</v>

1172
01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:10.690
<v Speaker 3>the sweeping psychedelic act of 1970 </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they just made everything illegal </v>

1173
01:04:11.871 --> 01:04:16.871
<v Speaker 3>was how easy it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least at the time to throw water on </v>

1174
01:04:16.871 --> 01:04:19.730
<v Speaker 3>this revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this revolution from.</v>

1175
01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:23.120
<v Speaker 3>I always use buddy holly and jimi </v>
<v Speaker 3>hendrix as an example.</v>

1176
01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:28.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buddy holly was like a rebel in the </v>

1177
01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:28.480
<v Speaker 3>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1178
01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:28.480
<v Speaker 3>pig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pig,</v>

1179
01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.660
<v Speaker 3>cu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know why I feel blue.</v>

1180
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:35.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like so calm and then you go from </v>
<v Speaker 3>that to voodoo child,</v>

1181
01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:38.990
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean early beatles too late beetle.</v>

1183
01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:44.020
<v Speaker 3>on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Risk of.</v>

1184
01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1185
01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:44.180
<v Speaker 3>I have a daughter.</v>

1186
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:46.550
<v Speaker 3>One of my daughters is 16 and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1187
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:50.350
<v Speaker 3>she's really into the beatles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just sheer boyfriends.</v>

1188
01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.840
<v Speaker 3>Was that time to be dead?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm nice.</v>

1189
01:04:56.031 --> 01:04:57.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm easy.</v>

1190
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:58.500
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1191
01:04:58.550 --> 01:04:59.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1192
01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:04.630
<v Speaker 3>my feeling is boys like girls and girls </v>
<v Speaker 3>like boys and if you're nice to them to </v>

1193
01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.950
<v Speaker 3>seek out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind them.</v>

1194
01:05:06.951 --> 01:05:08.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>

1195
01:05:08.211 --> 01:05:13.211
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have an attitude that there's </v>

1196
01:05:13.211 --> 01:05:14.030
<v Speaker 3>something wrong with two kids making out</v>
<v Speaker 3>or doing whatever they do.</v>

1197
01:05:14.031 --> 01:05:16.070
<v Speaker 3>I guess I don't think there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong with it.</v>

1198
01:05:16.071 --> 01:05:18.120
<v Speaker 3>I liked it and remember when I was 16,</v>

1199
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>my girlfriend liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's normal.</v>

1200
01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly awkward and strange,</v>

1201
01:05:23.231 --> 01:05:27.190
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not a scary dad to me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very friendly.</v>

1202
01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.500
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a,</v>

1203
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:34.370
<v Speaker 1>she's an interesting kid and she's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>love with the beatles and I'm.</v>

1204
01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.050
<v Speaker 1>One of the things at her and I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about was the difference between</v>

1205
01:05:38.051 --> 01:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>the beatles early stuff and then like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the white album,</v>

1206
01:05:41.261 --> 01:05:46.261
<v Speaker 1>like what this radical transformation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that this came about a lot of it </v>

1207
01:05:46.661 --> 01:05:50.320
<v Speaker 1>because of their fascination with </v>
<v Speaker 1>altered states of consciousness and then</v>

1208
01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:53.620
<v Speaker 1>eastern religions which came directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of that.</v>

1209
01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem with the beatles </v>

1210
01:05:58.650 --> 01:05:58.650
<v Speaker 1>though is highlighted by my good friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill per,</v>

1211
01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:00.670
<v Speaker 1>and that's fucking yoko ono.</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did that.</v>

1212
01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:05.850
<v Speaker 1>She is like the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you wanted to say maybe acid is </v>

1213
01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:07.830
<v Speaker 1>bad for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck john?</v>

1214
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:09.550
<v Speaker 1>like what were you thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>

1215
01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:11.160
<v Speaker 1>I was just talking to my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1216
01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:14.970
<v Speaker 8>about this and I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like everyone hated yoko at time.</v>

1217
01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:17.210
<v Speaker 8>Like I always thought everyone liked </v>
<v Speaker 8>yoga,</v>

1218
01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:18.640
<v Speaker 8>you know back then,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but no,</v>

1219
01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:19.530
<v Speaker 8>everyone hated the back.</v>

1220
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the key to it because because he </v>

1221
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>was such an original thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that everyone was saying,</v>

1222
01:06:25.341 --> 01:06:26.390
<v Speaker 1>john,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

1223
01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Just makes him say fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to see something cool.</v>

1224
01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Pull up the video with bill burr on yoko</v>
<v Speaker 1>ono.</v>

1225
01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to bring my friend bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>burroughs on tuesday.</v>

1226
01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the funniest guys in the world.</v>

1227
01:06:39.051 --> 01:06:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hilarious comedian,</v>

1228
01:06:40.731 --> 01:06:45.731
<v Speaker 1>but he was also a huge beatles fan and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge chuck berry fan and one time john </v>

1229
01:06:46.491 --> 01:06:51.491
<v Speaker 1>lennon got to play with chuck berry on </v>
<v Speaker 1>television and John Lynn and brought </v>

1230
01:06:52.101 --> 01:06:57.101
<v Speaker 1>yoko ono with him to play as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she sabotaged the entire </v>

1231
01:06:58.041 --> 01:07:03.041
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started like screamiNg into the mic </v>

1232
01:07:03.041 --> 01:07:07.750
<v Speaker 1>and bill berg goes absolutely crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this and highlights and it's.</v>

1233
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:12.990
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of my favorite videos on the </v>

1234
01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:15.470
<v Speaker 1>internet when it comes to music and here</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will play it for you right now</v>

1235
01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:22.340
<v Speaker 8>as much as people talk about the beatles</v>
<v Speaker 8>and how great their music is was </v>

1236
01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:23.940
<v Speaker 8>whatever you want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I totally agree with them.</v>

1237
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:26.550
<v Speaker 8>I think that the greatest band of all </v>
<v Speaker 8>time,</v>

1238
01:07:26.551 --> 01:07:30.810
<v Speaker 8>but I have to be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>John lennon and paul mccartney redefined</v>

1239
01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:34.890
<v Speaker 8>pussy whipped.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You have to watch this fucking video.</v>

1240
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:38.160
<v Speaker 8>It's john lennon is singing with chuck </v>
<v Speaker 8>berry.</v>

1241
01:07:38.161 --> 01:07:41.640
<v Speaker 8>Chuck berry is probably one of the main </v>
<v Speaker 8>reasons why john lennon,</v>

1242
01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:44.640
<v Speaker 8>lennon ever picked up a guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so now he's on tv.</v>

1243
01:07:44.641 --> 01:07:49.641
<v Speaker 8>he gets to play with his idol.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're playIng a chuck berry's hit </v>

1244
01:07:49.641 --> 01:07:50.360
<v Speaker 8>memphis.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1245
01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:55.660
<v Speaker 8>John lennon's got yoko in his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 8>band there in the middle of singing this</v>

1246
01:07:56.021 --> 01:07:58.220
<v Speaker 8>song on television and they're killing </v>
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>

1247
01:07:58.250 --> 01:08:02.090
<v Speaker 8>It's going great.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yoko's playing some stupid fucking drunk</v>

1248
01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:06.020
<v Speaker 8>even though she has no talent </v>
<v Speaker 8>whatsoever.</v>

1249
01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.310
<v Speaker 8>He's putting her in the fucking band.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just she'll,</v>

1250
01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.480
<v Speaker 8>she'll shut the fuck up and stop nagging</v>
<v Speaker 8>me.</v>

1251
01:08:11.830 --> 01:08:14.900
<v Speaker 8>too much of a fucking pussy to tell her </v>
<v Speaker 8>that she has.</v>

1252
01:08:14.901 --> 01:08:16.230
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

1253
01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:21.810
<v Speaker 8>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the only reason why you're here yoko's </v>

1254
01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:22.190
<v Speaker 8>because you're sucking my dick.</v>
<v Speaker 8>All right.</v>

1255
01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:23.810
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can't play the bongos.</v>

1256
01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.600
<v Speaker 8>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she's up there playing the bongos,</v>

1257
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.130
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>John lennon,</v>

1258
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:33.250
<v Speaker 8>chuck berry,</v>
<v Speaker 8>two of the greats of all time </v>

1259
01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:33.770

<v Speaker 8>fifties.</v>

01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:38.980
<v Speaker 8>That's what this moment's above.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And yoko in the middle of it can handle </v>

1261
01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:38.980
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>She's not getting any shine.</v>

1262
01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:41.130

<v Speaker 8>head where he finally realizes that he's</v>

1272
01:09:13.101 --> 01:09:15.310

<v Speaker 8>he just keeps playing and then she does </v>
<v Speaker 8>it again later on in that song.</v>

1278
01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:40.860
<v Speaker 8>And then you look at all the other </v>
<v Speaker 8>musicians and they just keep playing the</v>

1279
01:09:40.861 --> 01:09:44.800
<v Speaker 8>song like yoko isn't even fucking there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>

1280
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:47.360
<v Speaker 8>I actually get infuriated when I watched</v>
<v Speaker 8>this video.</v>

1281
01:09:47.361 --> 01:09:52.361
<v Speaker 8>The fact that john didn't just stop </v>
<v Speaker 8>playing in that moment and what he </v>

1282
01:09:52.361 --> 01:09:54.320
<v Speaker 8>should have done was dressed or down </v>
<v Speaker 8>right there.</v>

1283
01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:59.330
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I find you want to have a fucking </v>

1284
01:09:59.330 --> 01:09:59.330
<v Speaker 8>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is your mom.</v>

1285
01:09:59.330 --> 01:09:59.330
<v Speaker 8>If you ever fucking do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was slacking.</v>

1286
01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:01.580
<v Speaker 8>So fucking heart and the head.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Your eyes are going to look like mine.</v>

1287
01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:03.960
<v Speaker 8>You understand me?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You play that fucking buying.</v>

1288
01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.010
<v Speaker 8>When you shut your face,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you bitch.</v>

1289
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:07.670
<v Speaker 8>You crawled out of the fucking well and </v>
<v Speaker 8>ring.</v>

1290
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:08.980
<v Speaker 8>You understand me?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't mean to.</v>

1291
01:10:08.981 --> 01:10:10.970
<v Speaker 8>Why I'm fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You are going to be fucking anybody.</v>

1292
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:15.170
<v Speaker 8>You can't play the punk bongos.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can't say shut your fucking face.</v>

1293
01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:17.120
<v Speaker 8>and then he just walks back up to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>mic.</v>

1294
01:10:17.121 --> 01:10:19.520
<v Speaker 8>And just counts the band back in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1295
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:21.320
<v Speaker 8>Is that what the fuck he should've done.</v>

1296
01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:29.590
<v Speaker 1>There's no perfect people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

1297
01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:32.140
<v Speaker 1>We have to accept that all of our idols </v>
<v Speaker 1>are flawed.</v>

1298
01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.400
<v Speaker 1>And even the great john lennon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful musician and powerful cultural</v>

1299
01:10:36.401 --> 01:10:38.920
<v Speaker 1>figure as he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had terrible tasting lemon.</v>

1300
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:42.880
<v Speaker 6>Well I happen to like yoko ono's are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How dare you.</v>

1301
01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.310
<v Speaker 6>How dare you sir?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hers of mom.</v>

1302
01:10:46.311 --> 01:10:51.311
<v Speaker 6>I and I thought it was extremely </v>
<v Speaker 6>original and very provocative.</v>

1303
01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:54.680
<v Speaker 6>now I don't like what she did with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>chuck berry.</v>

1304
01:10:54.681 --> 01:10:59.681
<v Speaker 6>John lennon do wet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was not completely without tell.</v>

1305
01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:06.560
<v Speaker 1>I went to see the yoko ono art exhibit </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I lived in boston and one of the </v>

1306
01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.131
<v Speaker 1>things that she had was a block of wood </v>
<v Speaker 1>with nails in it and a bag of nails and </v>

1307
01:11:10.681 --> 01:11:15.681
<v Speaker 1>a hammer and she encouraged to </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in her art and that's what </v>

1308
01:11:15.841 --> 01:11:19.050
<v Speaker 1>she wanted to do when you walk by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pick up a nail and and whack it in.</v>

1309
01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:24.290
<v Speaker 1>And that was art and what I had the joke</v>
<v Speaker 1>was if she really wanted to encourage </v>

1310
01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:28.431
<v Speaker 1>people to participate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she should take the nails and put them </v>

1311
01:11:28.431 --> 01:11:30.420
<v Speaker 1>in her forehead and there'll be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking line around the block.</v>

1312
01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:33.060
<v Speaker 1>It would be like that scene from </v>
<v Speaker 1>airplane with a nun,</v>

1313
01:11:33.061 --> 01:11:35.970
<v Speaker 1>with the guitar and boxing gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody will be winding up.</v>

1314
01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:38.880
<v Speaker 1>It take a slam and one of those dumb </v>
<v Speaker 1>nails.</v>

1315
01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:44.050
<v Speaker 5>But I should also mention that I had the</v>
<v Speaker 5>great fortune of hearing the beatles at </v>

1316
01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:46.550
<v Speaker 5>their shea stadium concerts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should say.</v>

1317
01:11:46.551 --> 01:11:51.551
<v Speaker 5>I saw the beatles because you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>hear a word they were saying there were </v>

1318
01:11:51.551 --> 01:11:51.551
<v Speaker 5>so much screaming from their fans.</v>

1319
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>

1320
01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:57.810
<v Speaker 5>And so I also use the beatles in some of</v>
<v Speaker 5>my articles about the influence of </v>

1321
01:11:59.471 --> 01:12:02.830
<v Speaker 5>psychedelics on art and music.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're absolutely rIght.</v>

1322
01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:08.250
<v Speaker 5>They did make a switch thanks to </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychedelics there work with the </v>

1323
01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:10.870
<v Speaker 5>maharishi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the influence of eastern religions.</v>

1324
01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:14.350
<v Speaker 5>George harrison taking up the guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1325
01:12:14.351 --> 01:12:16.630
<v Speaker 5>like musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They changed the.</v>

1326
01:12:16.631 --> 01:12:20.080
<v Speaker 5>Have they evolved sometimes for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>better sometimes for the worse.</v>

1327
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:25.470
<v Speaker 5>But I think in the beatles case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were venturing into new and </v>

1328
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:25.870
<v Speaker 5>unexplored territory.</v>

1329
01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.460
<v Speaker 1>They were two artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1330
01:12:27.461 --> 01:12:29.980
<v Speaker 1>they were really expanding and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't worried about,</v>

1331
01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:32.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sticking to their sound,</v>

1332
01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:37.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's their acdc sort of riff </v>

1333
01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:37.360
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1334
01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.040
<v Speaker 1>the signature rifts and acdc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love acdc,</v>

1335
01:12:39.041 --> 01:12:44.041
<v Speaker 1>but damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can hurt here an acdc sign a mile </v>

1336
01:12:44.041 --> 01:12:44.041
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you hear it,</v>

1337
01:12:44.041 --> 01:12:44.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an acdc song.</v>

1338
01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:49.230
<v Speaker 1>The beatles really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really went out there and they took a </v>

1339
01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:52.741
<v Speaker 1>lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really crazy chances with some of </v>

1340
01:12:52.741 --> 01:12:52.741
<v Speaker 1>their stuff.</v>

1341
01:12:52.741 --> 01:12:52.741
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>

1342
01:12:52.741 --> 01:12:57.460
<v Speaker 5>And I met rolling thunder through mickey</v>
<v Speaker 5>hart of the grateful dead because </v>

1343
01:12:58.691 --> 01:13:02.740
<v Speaker 5>rolling thunder song was living in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>haight ashbury and he nuts.</v>

1344
01:13:02.741 --> 01:13:06.880
<v Speaker 5>Some of the grateful dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when his father rolling thunder came</v>

1345
01:13:06.881 --> 01:13:09.100
<v Speaker 5>to town,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he made the connection.</v>

1346
01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:12.640
<v Speaker 5>This is all told about our book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the voice of rolling thunder.</v>

1347
01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:18.020
<v Speaker 5>And that is how rolling thunder got to </v>
<v Speaker 5>meet bob dylan and participated in the </v>

1348
01:13:20.471 --> 01:13:25.471
<v Speaker 5>rolling thunder review.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there's a lot of rock and roll </v>

1349
01:13:25.471 --> 01:13:26.170
<v Speaker 5>stuff that's part of the rolling thunder</v>
<v Speaker 5>legends</v>

1350
01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:31.250
<v Speaker 1>yesterday in the car in stanley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I were talking about some of the </v>

1351
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:34.521
<v Speaker 1>musicians he's known over the years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he mentioned that hendrix was opening </v>

1352
01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:37.680
<v Speaker 1>for the monkees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1353
01:13:37.710 --> 01:13:39.980
<v Speaker 1>you are talking about getting blown up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stage.</v>

1354
01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:47.460
<v Speaker 5>Take my stepchildren to hear the monkeys</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they loved the monkeys and jimi </v>

1355
01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:53.791
<v Speaker 5>hendrix opened for the monkeys and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>told them he is going to be a major rock</v>

1356
01:13:54.911 --> 01:13:57.520
<v Speaker 5>and roll star.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never forget that name.</v>

1357
01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:03.180
<v Speaker 5>And they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a few years later the monkeys were </v>

1358
01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:06.691
<v Speaker 5>forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And jimi hendrix was a classic poor </v>

1359
01:14:06.691 --> 01:14:06.691
<v Speaker 5>monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1360
01:14:06.691 --> 01:14:09.430
<v Speaker 5>They didn't do so badly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They each went onto their own career.</v>

1361
01:14:09.431 --> 01:14:10.650
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1362
01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.410
<v Speaker 5>found please.</v>

1363
01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.020
<v Speaker 1>No big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were fine.</v>

1364
01:14:15.021 --> 01:14:16.310
<v Speaker 1>They were cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the monkeys.</v>

1365
01:14:16.311 --> 01:14:18.320
<v Speaker 1>When I was a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first,</v>

1366
01:14:18.321 --> 01:14:22.820
<v Speaker 1>a fake bands.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Really essentially the manufactured boy </v>
<v Speaker 1>band.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Now when you see like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1369
01:14:27.681 --> 01:14:30.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's very odd.</v>

1378
01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in this really strange time of </v>

1379
01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:57.110
<v Speaker 1>almost like a suspended adolescent </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspended childhood.</v>

1380
01:14:57.410 --> 01:15:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Like they want to contain it and carry </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and he sort of the ideal spokesperson</v>

1381
01:15:02.301 --> 01:15:03.710
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder,</v>

1382
01:15:03.711 --> 01:15:08.711
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion and so on to know whether this </v>

1383
01:15:08.711 --> 01:15:12.401
<v Speaker 1>is true or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like since the late </v>

1384
01:15:12.401 --> 01:15:12.401
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>

1385
01:15:12.401 --> 01:15:16.160
<v Speaker 1>somewhere we started like circling in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of fashion,</v>

1386
01:15:16.161 --> 01:15:17.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like disco came back,</v>

1387
01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and very briefly,</v>

1388
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:21.100
<v Speaker 1>pat bell bottoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely.</v>

1389
01:15:21.101 --> 01:15:22.900
<v Speaker 1>They tried to come back to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1390
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:23.780
<v Speaker 1>But it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>

1391
01:15:23.781 --> 01:15:28.781
<v Speaker 1>it sort of feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we've come to the end of the line </v>

1392
01:15:28.791 --> 01:15:33.791
<v Speaker 1>in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now they're trying to circle around </v>

1393
01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:33.791
<v Speaker 1>and reduce stuff.</v>

1394
01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:33.830
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing new under the sun.</v>

1395
01:15:33.831 --> 01:15:38.831
<v Speaker 6>You know what's old today is new </v>
<v Speaker 6>tomorrow and this is just part of the </v>

1396
01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:42.590
<v Speaker 6>fashion cycle that's been happening for </v>
<v Speaker 6>centuries.</v>

1397
01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:48.100
<v Speaker 6>I think that what's most interesting and</v>
<v Speaker 6>even a little bit dangerous as the </v>

1398
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:52.010
<v Speaker 6>prolonging of adolescents with adults,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1399
01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:55.130
<v Speaker 6>Adults who are acting like they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>teenagers.</v>

1400
01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:59.150
<v Speaker 6>I don't Have any problem with justin </v>
<v Speaker 6>bieber or any of the teeny bopper,</v>

1401
01:15:59.330 --> 01:16:04.330
<v Speaker 6>favorites yellow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's their thing and they're welcome </v>

1402
01:16:04.330 --> 01:16:06.881
<v Speaker 6>to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when adults start to act like </v>

1403
01:16:06.881 --> 01:16:09.440
<v Speaker 6>teenagers and start acting out and start</v>
<v Speaker 6>to behave irresponsibly,</v>

1404
01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:12.830
<v Speaker 6>I think this is where people really have</v>
<v Speaker 6>to grow up,</v>

1405
01:16:12.831 --> 01:16:16.070
<v Speaker 6>especially with all of the crises in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>country and the crises in the world,</v>

1406
01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:21.090
<v Speaker 1>like what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What examples to use like adults acting </v>

1407
01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:21.090
<v Speaker 1>like teenagers</v>

1408
01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:25.420
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that there is a tendency for </v>

1409
01:16:25.791 --> 01:16:29.930
<v Speaker 6>some adults to look at theIr kids as </v>
<v Speaker 6>pals and say,</v>

1410
01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:33.020
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my daughter is my best friend.</v>

1411
01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:34.730
<v Speaker 6>I'm her best friend.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1412
01:16:34.731 --> 01:16:36.530
<v Speaker 6>this is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're the mother.</v>

1413
01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.900
<v Speaker 6>You're not the best friend of your </v>
<v Speaker 6>daughter.</v>

1414
01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.570
<v Speaker 6>You lay down the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you give them instructions.</v>

1415
01:16:41.571 --> 01:16:43.850
<v Speaker 6>You teach your daughter how to become an</v>
<v Speaker 6>adult.</v>

1416
01:16:43.851 --> 01:16:46.400
<v Speaker 6>You teach moral codes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You teach rules,</v>

1417
01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:48.890
<v Speaker 6>you teach regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you serve as a role model.</v>

1418
01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.320
<v Speaker 6>What's this best friends?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Crap,</v>

1419
01:16:51.321 --> 01:16:51.570
<v Speaker 6>all of them.</v>

1420
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:56.890
<v Speaker 1>You can't be both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be a best friend as well as a </v>

1421
01:16:56.890 --> 01:16:57.670
<v Speaker 1>role model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who lays down.</v>

1422
01:16:58.050 --> 01:17:03.050
<v Speaker 6>I would not say never.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All that I could say is that role </v>

1423
01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:04.090
<v Speaker 6>confusion is not really part of parents.</v>

1424
01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:07.460
<v Speaker 1>What about when you see like a man in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his thirties and he sagging his pants?</v>

1425
01:17:07.461 --> 01:17:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Have you witnessed that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1426
01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.390
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the weirdest thing ever?</v>

1427
01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:17.500
<v Speaker 1>You've seen some shit and your day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the sagging pants thing really </v>

1428
01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:18.170
<v Speaker 1>makes me worry about the future of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

1429
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Grown men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grown men that are probably going to </v>

1430
01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:23.200
<v Speaker 1>have babies of their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See this justin?</v>

1431
01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.851

1432
01:17:27.851 --> 01:17:29.660
<v Speaker 1>sagging and you understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burn,</v>

1433
01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.380
<v Speaker 1>that sagging.</v>

1434
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:31.700
<v Speaker 6>Is that what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>bieber having saggy pants.</v>

1436
01:17:36.681 --> 01:17:41.030
<v Speaker 6>I have troubLe with grown men having </v>
<v Speaker 6>Saggy pants trying to be teenagers.</v>

1437
01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:42.260
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck is that about?</v>

1438
01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.450
<v Speaker 1>I know a Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

1439
01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:46.030
<v Speaker 1>I love him to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wheN he was like 39,</v>

1440
01:17:46.031 --> 01:17:48.840
<v Speaker 1>he starts sagging his pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1441
01:17:48.850 --> 01:17:53.850
<v Speaker 1>come on son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's just when you need something </v>

1442
01:17:53.850 --> 01:17:53.850
<v Speaker 1>to hold your balls up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

1443
01:17:53.850 --> 01:17:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when they start going.</v>

1444
01:17:53.850 --> 01:17:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just didn't want the tickle.</v>

1445
01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:59.500
<v Speaker 1>The parents hitting the base of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>balls as his balls dropped.</v>

1446
01:17:59.501 --> 01:18:04.501
<v Speaker 1>He tried to compensate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a comb over with his pants </v>

1447
01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:08.310
<v Speaker 1>were silly and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1448
01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:13.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a prolonged silliness or from </v>

1449
01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:15.760
<v Speaker 1>the seventies to today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that what's going on today,</v>

1450
01:18:15.761 --> 01:18:20.110
<v Speaker 1>over the last decade or so as I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that even though there's still plenty of</v>

1451
01:18:20.111 --> 01:18:21.460
<v Speaker 1>silliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like justin bieber,</v>

1452
01:18:21.461 --> 01:18:23.310
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing against justin.</v>

1453
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:26.810
<v Speaker 1>He's a child and he makes music for </v>
<v Speaker 1>other children and you know,</v>

1454
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:31.830

<v Speaker 1>maybe one day from now we'll look back </v>

1455

<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1476
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:22.620

<v Speaker 1>I think that's another,</v>

1477
01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:24.060
<v Speaker 1>another beautiful thing that.</v>

1478
01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:29.240
<v Speaker 6>Well he's commanded for that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And lady gaga who I also like,</v>

1479
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:34.910
<v Speaker 6>she has born that wave that probably </v>
<v Speaker 6>saved the life of dozens of gay and </v>

1480
01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:36.330
<v Speaker 6>lesbian kids.</v>

1481
01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a sad,</v>

1482
01:19:37.991 --> 01:19:42.991
<v Speaker 1>sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sad thing about this world is that </v>

1483
01:19:42.991 --> 01:19:42.991
<v Speaker 1>that's still an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1484
01:19:42.991 --> 01:19:43.900
<v Speaker 1>in the wild is gay marriage debate is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

1485
01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:49.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what kind of creepy shit </v>

1486
01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:51.090
<v Speaker 1>getting passed through congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even getting public </v>

1487
01:19:51.090 --> 01:19:53.341
<v Speaker 1>recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's paying attention to whether </v>

1488
01:19:53.341 --> 01:19:55.951
<v Speaker 1>or not people should have the right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do whatever they want sexually with </v>

1489
01:19:55.951 --> 01:19:59.611
<v Speaker 1>someone who also wants to do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a strange thing that I always </v>

1490
01:19:59.611 --> 01:20:02.830
<v Speaker 1>sort of say it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a cultural beach ball.</v>

1491
01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:08.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a concert and someone </v>

1492
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:08.090
<v Speaker 1>throws a beach ball and it goes up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes down,</v>

1493
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:08.090
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1494
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:11.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like nothing ever fucking happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just kind of gets tossed around.</v>

1495
01:20:11.221 --> 01:20:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about gay marriage?</v>

1496
01:20:13.261 --> 01:20:14.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

1497
01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:19.100
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do affirmative action and nothing </v>

1498
01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:22.011
<v Speaker 1>ever gets fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they just get sort of tossed around </v>

1499
01:20:22.011 --> 01:20:22.011
<v Speaker 1>back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever this.</v>

1500
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:27.390
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to go back to sharmane because</v>
<v Speaker 6>in shamanic traditions around the world,</v>

1501
01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:32.890
<v Speaker 6>what we would call gay and lesbian </v>
<v Speaker 6>people were given a great deal of honor.</v>

1502
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:35.230
<v Speaker 6>Many of them became dancers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>singers,</v>

1503
01:20:35.231 --> 01:20:40.231
<v Speaker 6>even shamans and native americans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not 100 percent,</v>

1504
01:20:40.330 --> 01:20:42.790
<v Speaker 6>but most native americans said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1505
01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:47.940
<v Speaker 6>here's somebody who acts like a woman </v>
<v Speaker 6>likes members of his own gender or her </v>

1506
01:20:51.401 --> 01:20:56.401
<v Speaker 6>own gender.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Depending on which one you're talking </v>

1507
01:20:56.401 --> 01:20:58.501
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the great spirit must have devoted some </v>

1508
01:20:58.501 --> 01:20:59.230
<v Speaker 6>very special time to making them that </v>
<v Speaker 6>way,</v>

1509
01:20:59.470 --> 01:21:02.950
<v Speaker 6>so we have to give them special honor </v>
<v Speaker 6>and respect them.</v>

1510
01:21:03.490 --> 01:21:05.740
<v Speaker 6>Now the europeans came in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1511
01:21:05.741 --> 01:21:08.290
<v Speaker 6>that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's get the inquisition on them,</v>

1512
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:11.350
<v Speaker 6>and they killed what we would call gays </v>
<v Speaker 6>and lesbians.</v>

1513
01:21:11.351 --> 01:21:14.470
<v Speaker 6>They killed shamans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They killed them sometimes very,</v>

1514
01:21:14.471 --> 01:21:17.140
<v Speaker 6>very brutally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and at the same time,</v>

1515
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:22.350
<v Speaker 6>the europeans gave much less power to </v>
<v Speaker 6>women than the native americans did.</v>

1516
01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:27.460
<v Speaker 6>Native americans gave a lot of power to </v>
<v Speaker 6>women in their governing councils,</v>

1517
01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:31.120
<v Speaker 6>in their decision making and in their </v>
<v Speaker 6>families.</v>

1518
01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:32.270
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1519
01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Nowhere american came over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The europeans came over and storm the </v>

1520
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.010
<v Speaker 1>place because checks were running </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1521
01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:44.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the greatest genocide in the </v>

1522
01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:44.850
<v Speaker 6>history.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Probably a million native americans died</v>

1523
01:21:44.851 --> 01:21:47.460
<v Speaker 6>in north America.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ten millions died in south America.</v>

1524
01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:48.750
<v Speaker 6>Mainly through disease.</v>

1525
01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

1526
01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:55.171
<v Speaker 1>It's the weirdest story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you stop and think about how quickly </v>

1527
01:21:55.571 --> 01:22:00.571
<v Speaker 1>it changed here in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in north America from the time the </v>

1528
01:22:00.571 --> 01:22:03.950
<v Speaker 1>columbus and you know from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 14 hundreds to the,</v>

1529
01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nIneteen hundreds or whatever today,</v>

1530
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:10.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's an insane episode of </v>
<v Speaker 1>genocide</v>

1531
01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:18.150
<v Speaker 6>to be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's pretty good evidence that the </v>

1532
01:22:18.150 --> 01:22:20.520
<v Speaker 6>chinese came to the pacific coast and </v>
<v Speaker 6>even further down in maybe the early 14,</v>

1533
01:22:22.331 --> 01:22:27.331
<v Speaker 6>hundreds maybe earlier and they were </v>
<v Speaker 6>there to learn from the people to take </v>

1534
01:22:27.611 --> 01:22:31.420
<v Speaker 6>samples back to China.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They didn't and they didn't say,</v>

1535
01:22:31.421 --> 01:22:36.421
<v Speaker 6>this is going to be part of China.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to make these people under </v>

1536
01:22:36.421 --> 01:22:39.901
<v Speaker 6>good buddhists.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They respected what they did and they </v>

1537
01:22:39.901 --> 01:22:40.390
<v Speaker 6>got their information and they'd sell it</v>
<v Speaker 6>back to China.</v>

1538
01:22:41.050 --> 01:22:46.050
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the europeans who were there to brIng </v>

1539
01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:47.230
<v Speaker 6>people to the true religion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were there to trade,</v>

1540
01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:50.680
<v Speaker 6>to get gold,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to get mark,</v>

1541
01:22:50.710 --> 01:22:55.710
<v Speaker 6>to get first,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to enrich the old world At the expense </v>

1542
01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:55.710
<v Speaker 6>of the new work.</v>

1543
01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:57.790
<v Speaker 1>It is an amazing time though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look,</v>

1544
01:22:57.791 --> 01:23:02.791
<v Speaker 1>if you look at a timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an animated timeline of the world </v>

1545
01:23:02.791 --> 01:23:06.480
<v Speaker 1>and then showed north America and north </v>
<v Speaker 1>America from the of the first europeans</v>

1546
01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:11.580
<v Speaker 3>and then this massive change that takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>place over this continent over the </v>

1547
01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:13.090
<v Speaker 3>course of the next several hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1548
01:23:13.330 --> 01:23:18.330
<v Speaker 3>gigantic cities just to rub the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>cities in the world has ever known </v>

1549
01:23:18.330 --> 01:23:20.160
<v Speaker 3>military complex builds up in nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>bombs,</v>

1550
01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:21.640
<v Speaker 3>start getting developed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1551
01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:26.700
<v Speaker 3>tHe internet airplanes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this shit happens in this one </v>

1552
01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:28.450
<v Speaker 3>continent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's this one continent.</v>

1553
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:33.470
<v Speaker 3>Essentially the last big continent to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get established by human beings becomes </v>

1554
01:23:34.181 --> 01:23:36.760
<v Speaker 3>the craziest motherfucker have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Out of all.</v>

1555
01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:37.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1556
01:23:37.670 --> 01:23:40.990
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird if you look at it from</v>
<v Speaker 3>a historical timeline,</v>

1557
01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:46.230
<v Speaker 3>the massive amount of impact that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>immigrants have had coming over from </v>

1558
01:23:46.230 --> 01:23:48.100
<v Speaker 3>europe and other parts of the world to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this one spot.</v>

1559
01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:50.670
<v Speaker 6>YeaH.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It could have happened a different way.</v>

1560
01:23:50.970 --> 01:23:55.970
<v Speaker 6>What we call Mexico city,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what they called a kyoto or calm or turn</v>

1561
01:23:55.971 --> 01:24:00.971
<v Speaker 6>up slot and Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was a bigger city than london and </v>

1562
01:24:00.971 --> 01:24:03.420
<v Speaker 6>the sewers were clean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The spaniards came.</v>

1563
01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:06.330
<v Speaker 6>They couldn't believe how clean the city</v>
<v Speaker 6>was,</v>

1564
01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:07.870
<v Speaker 6>and then of course they ruined it at </v>
<v Speaker 6>all.</v>

1565
01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:13.020
<v Speaker 6>How they ruined it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they ruined it all because they wanted </v>

1566
01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:17.510
<v Speaker 6>gold and they took the spaniards ruined </v>
<v Speaker 6>it and they took botha zuma,</v>

1567
01:24:18.330 --> 01:24:23.330
<v Speaker 6>they a tortured him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They killed him even though he filled a </v>

1568
01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:27.831
<v Speaker 6>room full of gold with them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The same thing happened in Peru with </v>

1569
01:24:27.831 --> 01:24:27.831
<v Speaker 6>pizarro and whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa,</v>

1570
01:24:27.831 --> 01:24:28.130
<v Speaker 6>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

1571
01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:29.130
<v Speaker 6>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That,</v>

1572
01:24:29.131 --> 01:24:32.250
<v Speaker 6>there were these great empowers with </v>
<v Speaker 6>magnificent cities,</v>

1573
01:24:32.251 --> 01:24:37.251
<v Speaker 6>magnificent libraries.</v>
<v Speaker 6>THe mayan libraries were all burned to </v>

1574
01:24:37.251 --> 01:24:40.911
<v Speaker 6>the pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't know the mayan wisdom because </v>

1575
01:24:40.911 --> 01:24:40.911
<v Speaker 6>the preset,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all of that,</v>

1576
01:24:40.911 --> 01:24:41.970
<v Speaker 6>this pagan stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have to get rid of it.</v>

1577
01:24:42.330 --> 01:24:47.330
<v Speaker 6>So there was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very different mentality that as you </v>

1578
01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:51.081
<v Speaker 6>say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>completely changed things and then </v>

1579
01:24:51.081 --> 01:24:52.050
<v Speaker 6>things tend to start all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It took a much different routes.</v>

1580
01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.290
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1581
01:24:53.291 --> 01:24:58.291
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the aztecs did some fucking crazy shit </v>

1582
01:24:58.291 --> 01:24:58.291
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

1583
01:24:58.291 --> 01:24:59.910
<v Speaker 6>say sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but at the same time,</v>

1584
01:24:59.911 --> 01:25:04.911
<v Speaker 6>the iNquisition in Spain and in Germany </v>
<v Speaker 6>and in parts of France and Italy,</v>

1585
01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.740
<v Speaker 6>we're also killing people by burning </v>
<v Speaker 6>them at the stake.</v>

1586
01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:11.460
<v Speaker 6>I don't let the aztec soft for the human</v>
<v Speaker 6>sacrifice,</v>

1587
01:25:11.670 --> 01:25:13.110
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's be fair.</v>

1588
01:25:13.111 --> 01:25:15.690
<v Speaker 6>Let's look what happens with the other </v>
<v Speaker 6>part of the world.</v>

1589
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:17.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't they sacrifice like,</v>

1590
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:21.290
<v Speaker 3>I think over the course of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to look it up.</v>

1591
01:25:21.291 --> 01:25:26.291
<v Speaker 3>I think over the course of four days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sacrifice some insane number of </v>

1592
01:25:26.291 --> 01:25:27.680
<v Speaker 3>80,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1593
01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1594
01:25:29.061 --> 01:25:30.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pyramid of tea.</v>

1595
01:25:30.750 --> 01:25:35.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to ican after they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1596
01:25:35.690 --> 01:25:38.090
<v Speaker 3>in 14,</v>
<v Speaker 3>87 after the construction of it,</v>

1597
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:42.620
<v Speaker 3>they sacrificed all the prisoners that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they use to make it 80,000</v>

1598
01:25:42.621 --> 01:25:43.430
<v Speaker 3>people who.</v>

1599
01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:48.850
<v Speaker 6>And one reason that they did all of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>sacrifices is they thought that the gods</v>

1600
01:25:49.190 --> 01:25:54.190
<v Speaker 6>were angry at them by bringing in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>spaniards and bringing in all of the </v>

1601
01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:56.960
<v Speaker 6>diseases started to kill people off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like I say,</v>

1602
01:25:56.961 --> 01:26:01.961
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not listening to the aztecs offer </v>

1603
01:26:01.961 --> 01:26:04.000
<v Speaker 6>the sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was a flaw in their civilization </v>

1604
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.911
<v Speaker 6>that the very important for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But they did create clean and beautiful </v>

1605
01:26:06.911 --> 01:26:09.170
<v Speaker 6>cities and they did have a forum</v>

1606
01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:14.200
<v Speaker 2>of government that work and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the artwork and the streets where you </v>

1607
01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.500
<v Speaker 2>mentioned the sewage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had sewer systems.</v>

1608
01:26:15.501 --> 01:26:17.720
<v Speaker 2>And they also had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the streets lit at night,</v>

1609
01:26:17.721 --> 01:26:22.721
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three seats for the night and you're </v>

1610
01:26:22.721 --> 01:26:22.721
<v Speaker 2>going to lamps or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1611
01:26:22.721 --> 01:26:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Do you know they weren't gas lamps for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1612
01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Probably tortured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was built.</v>

1613
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:32.590
<v Speaker 2>It was an island in the middle of a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>lake and it only had like one or two </v>

1614
01:26:32.901 --> 01:26:35.510
<v Speaker 2>causeway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was perfectly defendable.</v>

1615
01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:39.550
<v Speaker 2>But they'd invited cortez and his guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1616
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:44.830
<v Speaker 2>It was such a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the theories that you might </v>

1617
01:26:44.830 --> 01:26:47.740
<v Speaker 2>know more about this than I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm the vikings came down to north </v>

1618
01:26:47.871 --> 01:26:51.170
<v Speaker 2>America much earLier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the 10th century or Something.</v>

1619
01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:56.410
<v Speaker 2>AnD one of the theories was that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had gotten this far south as Mexico </v>

1620
01:26:56.410 --> 01:27:00.890
<v Speaker 2>because there was a myth that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a white god that came from the</v>

1621
01:27:00.891 --> 01:27:04.250
<v Speaker 2>east and said he'd returned someday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when they found,</v>

1622
01:27:04.290 --> 01:27:05.810
<v Speaker 2>when the spanish showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1623
01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.470
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1624
01:27:06.471 --> 01:27:08.270
<v Speaker 2>it's the second coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1625
01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:12.680
<v Speaker 2>the viking is of course are now </v>
<v Speaker 2>memorialized by the current tv series,</v>

1626
01:27:12.681 --> 01:27:15.280
<v Speaker 2>which is not bad by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really.</v>

1627
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:18.950
<v Speaker 2>And they just start the advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

1628
01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:19.890
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the</v>

1629
01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:25.340
<v Speaker 6>kings had a very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very important impact on not only </v>

1630
01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:25.440
<v Speaker 6>europe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but yes,</v>

1631
01:27:25.441 --> 01:27:30.441
<v Speaker 6>they came and visited the north America.</v>
<v Speaker 6>they didn't kill off native american </v>

1632
01:27:30.441 --> 01:27:31.920
<v Speaker 6>indians.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They collaborated with them.</v>

1633
01:27:31.921 --> 01:27:34.650
<v Speaker 6>They learned from them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had their colonies.</v>

1634
01:27:34.651 --> 01:27:37.800
<v Speaker 6>Then things got a little too chilly and </v>
<v Speaker 6>cold and uncomfortable.</v>

1635
01:27:37.801 --> 01:27:42.801
<v Speaker 6>So they sailed back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they did not leave the legacy of </v>

1636
01:27:42.801 --> 01:27:46.611
<v Speaker 6>destruction and disease that the english</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the spaniards and the portuguese did</v>

1637
01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:52.640
<v Speaker 6>much later on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And one interesting thing about the </v>

1638
01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.400
<v Speaker 6>white god legend is that when the core </v>
<v Speaker 6>cast came,</v>

1639
01:27:56.820 --> 01:28:01.820
<v Speaker 6>he came at just the right time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The legend was the 30th day of the 30th </v>

1640
01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:04.680
<v Speaker 6>month,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the white god will come.</v>

1641
01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:10.070
<v Speaker 6>And so every time in that cycle that the</v>
<v Speaker 6>white god was supposed to come,</v>

1642
01:28:11.191 --> 01:28:14.510
<v Speaker 6>they had scouts on the gulf of Mexico </v>
<v Speaker 6>believable.</v>

1643
01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:19.520
<v Speaker 6>Not cortez came just when the prediction</v>
<v Speaker 6>was there and they welcomed him with </v>

1644
01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:24.231
<v Speaker 6>open arms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it was one of the cruelest </v>

1645
01:28:24.231 --> 01:28:27.591
<v Speaker 6>coincidences,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the history of humankind that became a </v>

1646
01:28:27.591 --> 01:28:28.320
<v Speaker 6>just the right time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he was welcomed.</v>

1647
01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:30.990
<v Speaker 2>You think that's a coincidence though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1648
01:28:32.110 --> 01:28:34.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not into mysticism,</v>

1649
01:28:34.261 --> 01:28:39.261
<v Speaker 2>so I would say that that was either a </v>
<v Speaker 2>coincidence or else they got their facts</v>

1650
01:28:39.811 --> 01:28:40.590
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1651
01:28:40.591 --> 01:28:42.010
<v Speaker 2>you're not in the mysticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1652
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:43.490
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are.</v>

1653
01:28:43.530 --> 01:28:46.170
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking about this psychic </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreaming,</v>

1654
01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:50.130
<v Speaker 2>that mystic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I considered that quantum physics.</v>

1655
01:28:50.131 --> 01:28:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I think this is something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately be.</v>

1656
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:55.800
<v Speaker 2>We'll be explainable in terms of enlarge</v>
<v Speaker 2>rural deal.</v>

1657
01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:59.490
<v Speaker 2>You don't think that there's a possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection that may be mean.</v>

1658
01:28:59.491 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 2>do you believe that there's a for the</v>

1659
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:06.980
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe that it's possible that </v>

1660
01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:07.920
<v Speaker 1>you know all these things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>foretold that come to be true?</v>

1661
01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:10.890
<v Speaker 5>absolute bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One hundred percent bullshit.</v>

1662
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:13.550
<v Speaker 5>I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

1663
01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.840
<v Speaker 5>I come from the point of view of </v>
<v Speaker 5>evolution,</v>

1664
01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:20.960
<v Speaker 5>watch adaptive watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Adaptive is not always for the best of </v>

1665
01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:25.941
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we were to have an atomic bomb blast </v>

1666
01:29:25.941 --> 01:29:27.300
<v Speaker 5>who would adapt?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be the young sex.</v>

1667
01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:32.660
<v Speaker 5>Humans would be gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>insects would be the ones who survive </v>

1668
01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:34.500
<v Speaker 5>because they could adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could withstand the atomic bomb.</v>

1669
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Key points and key three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point though is that as you saw the </v>

1670
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:41.900
<v Speaker 1>kennedy assassination in a in a psychic </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision,</v>

1671
01:29:41.901 --> 01:29:46.901
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that these people saw the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortez in a psychic vision or who was </v>

1672
01:29:49.401 --> 01:29:52.340
<v Speaker 1>often referred to as a white beard in </v>
<v Speaker 1>god?</v>

1673
01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:57.500
<v Speaker 5>It was counseled people who according to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the legends sailed off into the gulf of </v>

1674
01:29:57.721 --> 01:29:59.780
<v Speaker 5>Mexico and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will return around.</v>

1675
01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:04.820
<v Speaker 5>Just like douglas macarthur said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should've returned during the second </v>

1676
01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:08.010
<v Speaker 5>world war except capsule was a mythical </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure,</v>

1677
01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:13.580
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he he not only said that he would </v>

1678
01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:16.461
<v Speaker 5>return,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the Legend SpecifieD when in the </v>

1679
01:30:16.461 --> 01:30:19.200
<v Speaker 5>cycle he would return.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that has this incredible coincidence</v>

1680
01:30:19.201 --> 01:30:22.440
<v Speaker 5>that I'm not going to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to point it out.</v>

1681
01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1682
01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I would think though that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to consider the possibility that</v>

1683
01:30:27.631 --> 01:30:32.631
<v Speaker 1>you had this vision of kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might consider the possibility of </v>

1684
01:30:32.631 --> 01:30:34.050
<v Speaker 1>long range visions that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1685
01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:38.130
<v Speaker 1>these aztecs and mayans are sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>around taking mushrooms,</v>

1686
01:30:38.131 --> 01:30:42.300
<v Speaker 1>contemplating the future might have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision of these white men showing up.</v>

1687
01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:43.330
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why not?</v>

1688
01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:48.460
<v Speaker 5>Yellow time is a social construct and </v>
<v Speaker 5>native americans have the,</v>

1689
01:30:49.390 --> 01:30:54.390
<v Speaker 5>at least before the europeans arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had the concept of the long body </v>

1690
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:57.310
<v Speaker 5>that our physical body is the short </v>
<v Speaker 5>body,</v>

1691
01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:02.520
<v Speaker 5>but the body extends into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that long bodies can sometimes pick </v>

1692
01:31:03.281 --> 01:31:07.120
<v Speaker 5>up information from the future that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>brings back to the short body.</v>

1693
01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:12.480
<v Speaker 5>This is part of his metaphorical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but to them it would be no surprise when</v>

1694
01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:19.080
<v Speaker 5>rolling thunder talked about global </v>
<v Speaker 5>warming and when he talked about </v>

1695
01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:21.460
<v Speaker 5>desertification and the pollution of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>air,</v>

1696
01:31:21.970 --> 01:31:26.230
<v Speaker 5>he was basing this on his observation of</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was going on,</v>

1697
01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:29.530
<v Speaker 5>but also he was going back to native </v>
<v Speaker 5>american prophecy.</v>

1698
01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I love that term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Long body in short potty.</v>

1699
01:31:33.061 --> 01:31:34.460
<v Speaker 1>That's really fascinating.</v>

1700
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:39.790
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the native americans said all sorts of </v>

1701
01:31:39.790 --> 01:31:40.610
<v Speaker 5>concepts that are consistent with </v>
<v Speaker 5>quantum physics.</v>

1702
01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:45.620
<v Speaker 5>We devote a whole section of quantum </v>
<v Speaker 5>physics and our book about rolling </v>

1703
01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:49.511
<v Speaker 5>thunder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the voice of rolling thunder and there </v>

1704
01:31:49.511 --> 01:31:49.670
<v Speaker 5>is an entire book called blackfoot </v>
<v Speaker 5>physics,</v>

1705
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:54.910
<v Speaker 5>which takes the blackfoot indian tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shows how closely their philosophy of </v>

1706
01:31:55.371 --> 01:32:00.371
<v Speaker 5>the earth corresponds to modern day </v>
<v Speaker 5>quantum physics.</v>

1707
01:32:00.741 --> 01:32:03.760
<v Speaker 5>So book by david pete,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's a quantum physicist themselves,</v>

1708
01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:09.060
<v Speaker 3>what do they attribute the this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this information from like the black </v>

1709
01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:10.780
<v Speaker 3>feet say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do they learn these concepts</v>

1710
01:32:11.090 --> 01:32:16.090
<v Speaker 5>passed down over the generations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can see some of it and the rock </v>

1711
01:32:16.090 --> 01:32:20.231
<v Speaker 5>carvings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but mainly the myths and legends that </v>

1712
01:32:20.231 --> 01:32:22.980
<v Speaker 5>have been passed down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember that most of the native </v>

1713
01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:23.720
<v Speaker 5>americans did not have a written </v>
<v Speaker 5>language.</v>

1714
01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:26.180
<v Speaker 5>The mayans had the very good rep </v>
<v Speaker 5>language,</v>

1715
01:32:26.181 --> 01:32:31.181
<v Speaker 5>but it didn't do them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're good because the spaniards </v>

1716
01:32:31.181 --> 01:32:33.401
<v Speaker 5>berg,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of their books and so this was </v>

1717
01:32:33.401 --> 01:32:35.510
<v Speaker 5>passed down from tribe to tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from person to person from atlanta clan,</v>

1718
01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:40.840
<v Speaker 5>and you can see it today and the legends</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they talk about how the earth and </v>

1719
01:32:42.741 --> 01:32:47.741
<v Speaker 5>how the people in the earth are part of </v>
<v Speaker 5>a whole and how hard of a swerve a </v>

1720
01:32:48.771 --> 01:32:53.300
<v Speaker 5>change can have ripple effects that </v>
<v Speaker 5>affect the entire organism,</v>

1721
01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:56.630
<v Speaker 5>the entire family,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the entire clown,</v>

1722
01:32:56.631 --> 01:33:01.631
<v Speaker 5>the fire in the entire cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm also gonna talk about parallel </v>

1723
01:33:01.631 --> 01:33:04.250
<v Speaker 5>universes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was a quantum physics concept.</v>

1724
01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:07.040
<v Speaker 5>They talk about the upper world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the lower world,</v>

1725
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:08.000
<v Speaker 5>the middle earth.</v>

1726
01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:13.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to throw something out at you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and tell me if this makes any sense </v>

1727
01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:17.000
<v Speaker 3>because this is something that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>contemplating myself over the last few </v>

1728
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.270
<v Speaker 3>years and that that's the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>human behavior,</v>

1729
01:33:18.271 --> 01:33:23.271
<v Speaker 3>even the most complex and in self </v>
<v Speaker 3>destructive of all human behavior is </v>

1730
01:33:23.271 --> 01:33:27.411
<v Speaker 3>natural and that like we see complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>social communities in wolf tribes and </v>

1731
01:33:28.501 --> 01:33:30.480
<v Speaker 3>wolf packs and with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1732
01:33:30.481 --> 01:33:34.170
<v Speaker 3>with various animals and we see the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>they interact and we say,</v>

1733
01:33:34.171 --> 01:33:35.430
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just nature.</v>

1734
01:33:35.431 --> 01:33:39.480
<v Speaker 3>This is the way to sort things out on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>much more complex scale.</v>

1735
01:33:39.481 --> 01:33:41.570
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that all the self </v>
<v Speaker 3>destruction,</v>

1736
01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:46.580
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crazy battles for resources that </v>

1737
01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:50.361
<v Speaker 3>we've seen in the world today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that all of this is in fact just a </v>

1738
01:33:50.361 --> 01:33:53.751
<v Speaker 3>natural behavior pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's literally the only way that </v>

1739
01:33:53.751 --> 01:33:58.161
<v Speaker 3>human beings exist in that this strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a contrast between massive amounts of </v>

1740
01:34:00.541 --> 01:34:05.541
<v Speaker 3>information being available and being </v>
<v Speaker 3>spread rapidly back and forth between </v>

1741
01:34:05.541 --> 01:34:07.770
<v Speaker 3>people and all these horrible injustices</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are all going on.</v>

1742
01:34:07.771 --> 01:34:09.150
<v Speaker 3>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1743
01:34:09.151 --> 01:34:11.550
<v Speaker 3>that's the yin and the yang of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity.</v>

1744
01:34:11.850 --> 01:34:16.020
<v Speaker 5>That's a good way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the yin and the yang.</v>

1745
01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:19.530
<v Speaker 5>The balance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are neither good nor bAd.</v>

1746
01:34:19.531 --> 01:34:23.850
<v Speaker 5>They're both and the way that society </v>
<v Speaker 5>constructs their behavior,</v>

1747
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.400
<v Speaker 5>conserve them one way or the other,</v>

1748
01:34:26.690 --> 01:34:30.620
<v Speaker 3>and also that like while we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>battle with these evils,</v>

1749
01:34:30.621 --> 01:34:35.621
<v Speaker 3>this is what propels innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>THis is what sort of propels people to </v>

1750
01:34:35.621 --> 01:34:40.541
<v Speaker 3>move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That if we lived in some sort of a </v>

1751
01:34:40.541 --> 01:34:40.541
<v Speaker 3>utopian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1752
01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:45.640
<v Speaker 3>beautiful society of orgiastic love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that maybe we'd never get anything done </v>

1753
01:34:46.011 --> 01:34:49.580
<v Speaker 3>and maybe that's part of what the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals here for in the first place,</v>

1754
01:34:49.581 --> 01:34:53.120
<v Speaker 3>like the aunt makes the ant hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The b makes the honeycomb,</v>

1755
01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:57.170
<v Speaker 3>the human being creates this uber </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex society,</v>

1756
01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 3>one of the</v>

1757
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:03.160
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms to ensure that society keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving forth at this breakneck speed is </v>

1758
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:07.460
<v Speaker 1>this conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this constant conflict that's going on,</v>

1759
01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:10.950
<v Speaker 1>both social conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic conflict,</v>

1760
01:35:10.951 --> 01:35:15.951
<v Speaker 1>that all this is a part of this gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever complex natural behavior pattern.</v>

1761
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:22.630
<v Speaker 6>It certainly is natural,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but don't overlook the other side of it.</v>

1762
01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:27.130
<v Speaker 6>When you go to darwin and read what he </v>
<v Speaker 6>had to say,</v>

1763
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:32.550
<v Speaker 6>he uses terms like love cooperation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>collaboration much more often than he </v>

1764
01:35:35.021 --> 01:35:40.021
<v Speaker 6>uses conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He sees this cooperation is what </v>

1765
01:35:40.021 --> 01:35:44.490
<v Speaker 6>engineers evolution and social progress.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He never used the word the words a </v>

1766
01:35:46.630 --> 01:35:49.000
<v Speaker 6>survival of the fittest.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Somebody else use that.</v>

1767
01:35:49.001 --> 01:35:52.770
<v Speaker 6>He didn't like that term.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was more emphasis,</v>

1768
01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.540
<v Speaker 6>more empathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1769
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:59.590
<v Speaker 6>collaboration and even love.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are the words you find in his </v>

1770
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.590
<v Speaker 6>books.</v>

1771
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.590
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

1772
01:35:59.590 --> 01:36:01.010
<v Speaker 1>when I speak of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm,</v>

1773
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:05.480
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is almost like as if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was someone from another world,</v>

1774
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:08.390
<v Speaker 1>if I was looking at the human race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a completely objective,</v>

1775
01:36:08.391 --> 01:36:13.391
<v Speaker 1>lee and I'm looking at what one of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy things doing and what direction </v>

1776
01:36:13.391 --> 01:36:17.261
<v Speaker 1>and if we were trying to study them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what's causing all </v>

1777
01:36:17.261 --> 01:36:18.770
<v Speaker 1>this stuff to be taking place at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time,</v>

1778
01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:21.440
<v Speaker 1>I almost would would look at it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1779
01:36:21.441 --> 01:36:26.441
<v Speaker 1>Then it's like maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really complex natural behavior </v>

1780
01:36:26.441 --> 01:36:30.370
<v Speaker 1>that's moving towards some sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means seems to be some sort of </v>

1781
01:36:30.370 --> 01:36:33.160
<v Speaker 1>technological integration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems to be that that's what's</v>

1782
01:36:33.610 --> 01:36:36.490
<v Speaker 1>the number one push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look at where it,</v>

1783
01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:41.520
<v Speaker 1>what people are doing with innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with technology at all seems to be a </v>

1784
01:36:41.811 --> 01:36:44.810
<v Speaker 1>connection between humans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

1785
01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:46.550
<v Speaker 1>This symbiotic connection,</v>

1786
01:36:46.630 --> 01:36:51.630
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a soul called singularity that </v>

1787
01:36:51.630 --> 01:36:53.911
<v Speaker 6>you hear so much about where are the </v>
<v Speaker 6>humans and the technological innovations</v>

1788
01:36:54.221 --> 01:36:59.221
<v Speaker 6>are going to combine into a singular </v>
<v Speaker 6>society or even a singular organism who </v>

1789
01:37:00.881 --> 01:37:05.881
<v Speaker 6>knows and that might be adaptive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That might be a direction that humans </v>

1790
01:37:05.881 --> 01:37:09.361
<v Speaker 6>couldn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so I think you're on the right </v>

1791
01:37:09.361 --> 01:37:12.091
<v Speaker 6>track.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that this is a very innovative </v>

1792
01:37:12.091 --> 01:37:14.341
<v Speaker 6>way of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but let's talk about practicality and </v>

1793
01:37:14.341 --> 01:37:15.820
<v Speaker 6>the listeners of your show at quite have</v>
<v Speaker 6>to decide,</v>

1794
01:37:15.821 --> 01:37:20.821
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which side of history are you going to </v>

1795
01:37:20.821 --> 01:37:22.981
<v Speaker 6>be on?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are you going to be on the side that </v>

1796
01:37:22.981 --> 01:37:22.981
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1797
01:37:22.981 --> 01:37:27.500
<v Speaker 6>full mount suicide bombing and religious</v>
<v Speaker 6>bigotry or you're going beyond the side,</v>

1798
01:37:27.501 --> 01:37:32.501
<v Speaker 6>the facilitates love and human </v>
<v Speaker 6>cooperation and care for children and </v>

1799
01:37:32.501 --> 01:37:33.920
<v Speaker 6>women and men.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which side is better?</v>

1800
01:37:33.921 --> 01:37:34.370
<v Speaker 6>Strip club,</v>

1801
01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:40.600
<v Speaker 1>which side has better strip clubs as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of religious</v>

1802
01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:47.680
<v Speaker 6>collaboration.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have the better strip clubs up </v>

1803
01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:49.970
<v Speaker 6>there on the side of beauty there on the</v>
<v Speaker 6>side of love.</v>

1804
01:37:49.971 --> 01:37:50.900
<v Speaker 6>No doubt about it.</v>

1805
01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you want to leave.</v>

1806
01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:57.560
<v Speaker 1>What were you going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just gonna say when you're in </v>

1807
01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:57.560
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your point,</v>

1808
01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:57.560
<v Speaker 1>they're talking</v>

1809
01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:58.960
<v Speaker 2>about how to what extent this is natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>human behavior.</v>

1810
01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Keep in mind that anatomically modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are.</v>

1811
01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Most scientists would say about 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years on the planet.</v>

1812
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And until very until the last couple of </v>

1813
01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:11.140
<v Speaker 2>hundred or a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on how you want to look at it.</v>

1814
01:38:11.530 --> 01:38:15.040
<v Speaker 2>They were living the same way forever </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1815
01:38:15.041 --> 01:38:20.041
<v Speaker 2>like 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years you'd get boeing arrow instead of </v>

1816
01:38:20.041 --> 01:38:20.050
<v Speaker 2>spheres,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1817
01:38:20.051 --> 01:38:22.420
<v Speaker 2>that would be the one technological </v>
<v Speaker 2>advance,</v>

1818
01:38:22.421 --> 01:38:22.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1819
01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.660
<v Speaker 2>and so there's been a lot of debate like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened,</v>

1820
01:38:25.661 --> 01:38:29.890
<v Speaker 2>why wasn't there more movement and </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress and all this stuff.</v>

1821
01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:34.180
<v Speaker 2>And at the moment the best theory I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>of is that people were comfortable.</v>

1822
01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:37.510
<v Speaker 2>There wAsn't any need necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mother of invention.</v>

1823
01:38:37.511 --> 01:38:42.511
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like there's plenty of food around </v>

1824
01:38:42.511 --> 01:38:42.511
<v Speaker 2>blending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at,</v>

1825
01:38:42.511 --> 01:38:45.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many hours hunter gatherer people </v>

1826
01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.000
<v Speaker 2>spend working compared to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They work a lot less than we do.</v>

1827
01:38:46.690 --> 01:38:48.010
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1828
01:38:48.011 --> 01:38:50.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see your point and I agree with,</v>

1829
01:38:50.250 --> 01:38:52.030
<v Speaker 2>with what you're saying and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>singularity,</v>

1830
01:38:52.031 --> 01:38:53.860
<v Speaker 2>I think we're definitely going in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>

1831
01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:57.490
<v Speaker 2>but to say that it's a natural human </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

1832
01:38:57.491 --> 01:39:02.491
<v Speaker 2>we have to keep in mind that it's been a</v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum shift in the very last seconds </v>

1833
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:04.090
<v Speaker 2>of human existence.</v>

1834
01:39:04.670 --> 01:39:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that sort of like almost like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rosetta stone.</v>

1835
01:39:07.461 --> 01:39:12.461
<v Speaker 1>Like we figured out how to make metal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we figured out how to conduct </v>

1836
01:39:12.461 --> 01:39:13.490
<v Speaker 1>electricity and then we're off to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>races and we just like,</v>

1837
01:39:13.491 --> 01:39:18.491
<v Speaker 1>we put a couple of things together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the key pieces in the language of </v>

1838
01:39:18.491 --> 01:39:19.180
<v Speaker 1>technology and that set off this,</v>

1839
01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:21.170
<v Speaker 2>but there's intentionality there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1840
01:39:21.171 --> 01:39:25.040
<v Speaker 2>you're attributing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I think it's a happenstance.</v>

1841
01:39:25.041 --> 01:39:30.041
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a question of a population </v>
<v Speaker 2>densiTy that we didn't ever choose.</v>

1842
01:39:30.531 --> 01:39:32.420
<v Speaker 2>That's a quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get the question all the time,</v>

1843
01:39:32.421 --> 01:39:34.910
<v Speaker 2>like if agriculture sucks so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did we do it?</v>

1844
01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:36.490
<v Speaker 2>As if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1845
01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:37.520
<v Speaker 2>some guys were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1846
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:39.460
<v Speaker 2>why don't we start farming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1847
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:40.880
<v Speaker 2>they wiLl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will make a deal.</v>

1848
01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.760
<v Speaker 2>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm reminded of this guy.</v>

1849
01:39:43.761 --> 01:39:48.761
<v Speaker 2>This happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might have known about this in </v>

1850
01:39:48.761 --> 01:39:48.761
<v Speaker 2>sonoma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were some,</v>

1851
01:39:48.761 --> 01:39:49.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there at a winery and um,</v>

1852
01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:55.240
<v Speaker 2>there's some tourIsts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting ready to take balloon </v>

1853
01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:55.580
<v Speaker 2>rides over the winery and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>setting up one of the balloons,</v>

1854
01:39:55.581 --> 01:40:00.581
<v Speaker 2>hot air balloons and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it started to pull away and the </v>

1855
01:40:00.581 --> 01:40:01.550
<v Speaker 2>balloon guys were having trouble </v>
<v Speaker 2>managing it.</v>

1856
01:40:01.551 --> 01:40:05.540
<v Speaker 2>And a german tourist who was standing </v>
<v Speaker 2>there ran over to help them and grab the</v>

1857
01:40:05.541 --> 01:40:09.290
<v Speaker 2>basket of the balloon and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>balloon took off.</v>

1858
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:14.750
<v Speaker 2>It broke free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a professional working </v>

1859
01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:17.561
<v Speaker 2>with balloons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never let both your feet off the </v>

1860
01:40:17.561 --> 01:40:18.080
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the rule.</v>

1861
01:40:18.081 --> 01:40:20.840
<v Speaker 2>If you're working with balloons once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both feet leave the ground,</v>

1862
01:40:20.841 --> 01:40:22.490
<v Speaker 2>you let go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy didn't know that.</v>

1863
01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:26.420
<v Speaker 2>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went up,</v>

1864
01:40:26.421 --> 01:40:28.310
<v Speaker 2>he hung on as long as he could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he fell.</v>

1865
01:40:29.450 --> 01:40:34.450
<v Speaker 2>All his friends watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't pull himself up in the </v>

1866
01:40:34.450 --> 01:40:34.450
<v Speaker 2>parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck.</v>

1867
01:40:34.450 --> 01:40:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Can't fight mother nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't fight gravity,</v>

1868
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:42.430
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I see at the advent of </v>

1869
01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:42.430
<v Speaker 2>agriculture is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1870
01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:45.140
<v Speaker 2>it made sense at the time and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get tied into the loop.</v>

1871
01:40:45.141 --> 01:40:46.280
<v Speaker 2>You can't get out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1872
01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:51.280
<v Speaker 1>isn't that sort of the same pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity?</v>

1873
01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:54.390
<v Speaker 1>It's we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we figure</v>

1874
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:59.390
<v Speaker 3>out one thing that integrates us more </v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply wIth each other and then from </v>

1875
01:40:59.390 --> 01:41:03.581
<v Speaker 3>there that innovation leads to more </v>
<v Speaker 3>innovations which lead to bigger </v>

1876
01:41:03.581 --> 01:41:05.270
<v Speaker 3>buildings which lead to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1877
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:11.470
<v Speaker 3>different irrigation methods which lead </v>
<v Speaker 3>to larger supplies of food which leads </v>

1878
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:15.821
<v Speaker 3>to more people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which leads to more innovation because </v>

1879
01:41:15.821 --> 01:41:15.821
<v Speaker 3>there's more people which leads to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication issues,</v>

1880
01:41:15.821 --> 01:41:18.920
<v Speaker 3>which leads to the invention of phones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I mean it's,</v>

1881
01:41:18.921 --> 01:41:20.870
<v Speaker 3>it's this constant technological </v>
<v Speaker 3>progression.</v>

1882
01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:23.100
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>technical logical progression,</v>

1883
01:41:23.101 --> 01:41:26.630
<v Speaker 5>but along with that comes pollution </v>
<v Speaker 5>comes.</v>

1884
01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:30.150
<v Speaker 5>Desertification comes global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the dark side,</v>

1885
01:41:30.230 --> 01:41:35.230
<v Speaker 3>but is that necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that not more of the yin and yang </v>

1886
01:41:35.230 --> 01:41:39.800
<v Speaker 3>like the the solution needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>acquired,</v>

1887
01:41:39.801 --> 01:41:44.801
<v Speaker 3>like someone needs to figure out a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a sustainable sort of an urban </v>

1888
01:41:44.801 --> 01:41:49.241
<v Speaker 3>environment like instead of this idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>where we're constantly burning fossil </v>

1889
01:41:49.241 --> 01:41:49.970
<v Speaker 3>fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's other ways to extract energy.</v>

1890
01:41:49.971 --> 01:41:50.820
<v Speaker 3>Why do not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1891
01:41:51.110 --> 01:41:52.690
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we have solar cities?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have.</v>

1892
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:54.680
<v Speaker 3>Why don't?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't los angeles solar city?</v>

1893
01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.750
<v Speaker 3>You want to talk about the dumbest </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking thing ever.</v>

1894
01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:59.950
<v Speaker 3>Fly over downtown la.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's operating on coal,</v>

1895
01:41:59.951 --> 01:42:03.020
<v Speaker 3>power to electricity and this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>sunlight everywhere.</v>

1896
01:42:03.170 --> 01:42:07.190
<v Speaker 3>Three hundred and 60 days a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it it rains for days a year out here and</v>

1897
01:42:07.191 --> 01:42:09.500
<v Speaker 3>there's no solar panels anywhere in </v>
<v Speaker 3>downtown la.</v>

1898
01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:14.540
<v Speaker 5>When I was at the university of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Wisconsin back in the early 19 fifties </v>

1899
01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:18.910
<v Speaker 5>while of our chemistry professors was </v>
<v Speaker 5>preaching soLar power and nobody </v>

1900
01:42:20.731 --> 01:42:25.731
<v Speaker 5>believed him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they thought he waS off the wall anD he </v>

1901
01:42:25.731 --> 01:42:28.320
<v Speaker 5>even had invented solar panels,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which other people had founded.</v>

1902
01:42:28.321 --> 01:42:33.321
<v Speaker 5>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>solar panels and solar power had been </v>

1903
01:42:33.321 --> 01:42:36.951
<v Speaker 5>with us potentially since the late </v>
<v Speaker 5>forties or early 19 fifties,</v>

1904
01:42:37.470 --> 01:42:42.470
<v Speaker 5>but they were a threat to establishment </v>
<v Speaker 5>govern reliance on fossil fuels.</v>

1905
01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:47.580
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so only now Are we waking up,</v>

1906
01:42:47.581 --> 01:42:52.581
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'd better go in that direction if </v>

1907
01:42:52.581 --> 01:42:55.461
<v Speaker 5>we're going to avoid the destruction of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the earth and most people still don't </v>

1908
01:42:55.461 --> 01:42:58.380
<v Speaker 5>give that high priority,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the knowledge was there,</v>

1909
01:42:58.381 --> 01:43:00.210
<v Speaker 5>but they were bypassed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1910
01:43:00.211 --> 01:43:05.211
<v Speaker 5>like the electric car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what happened to the original </v>

1911
01:43:05.211 --> 01:43:08.130
<v Speaker 5>car?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just ran a foul of commercial </v>

1912
01:43:08.130 --> 01:43:09.450
<v Speaker 5>interests,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so a lot of these innovations that could</v>

1913
01:43:09.451 --> 01:43:14.451
<v Speaker 5>have led to sustainability long time ago</v>
<v Speaker 5>were bypassed and only now,</v>

1914
01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:20.120
<v Speaker 5>maybe before it's too late,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can we go back and bring those into </v>

1915
01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:20.120
<v Speaker 5>fruition.</v>

1916
01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:25.600
<v Speaker 3>That brings us back to what we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about earlier with the hemp and </v>

1917
01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:28.711
<v Speaker 3>the original issue with him being that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemp as a commodity where Henry Ford </v>

1918
01:43:28.711 --> 01:43:30.540
<v Speaker 3>made the first body panels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a car.</v>

1919
01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:35.560
<v Speaker 3>They were made out of hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His car also ran on hemp fuel and this </v>

1920
01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.180
<v Speaker 3>is the very first cars that Henry Ford </v>
<v Speaker 3>created,</v>

1921
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:42.510
<v Speaker 3>and that's very little known fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>camp in in a fiber form when they turn </v>

1922
01:43:43.841 --> 01:43:46.900
<v Speaker 3>it into body panels is actually stronger</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Lighter than Steel.</v>

1923
01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:48.140
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hampers wonDerful.</v>

1924
01:43:48.141 --> 01:43:51.530
<v Speaker 5>George Washington grew hemp by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and no,</v>

1925
01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:52.050
<v Speaker 5>you try</v>

1926
01:43:52.050 --> 01:43:57.050
<v Speaker 6>to get government subsidies for hamp.</v>
<v Speaker 6>you even tried to get legal permission </v>

1927
01:43:57.050 --> 01:43:59.790
<v Speaker 6>to grow hemp and you run up against a </v>
<v Speaker 6>brick wall.</v>

1928
01:43:59.910 --> 01:44:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we own a part of a supplement company </v>

1929
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:08.600
<v Speaker 1>and one of the thIngs that we sell is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemp protein powder and we have to buy </v>

1930
01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:10.620
<v Speaker 1>it from Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't grow it in the United States.</v>

1931
01:44:10.621 --> 01:44:15.621
<v Speaker 1>We have to buy it from Canada and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very popular and we can only get 50 </v>

1932
01:44:15.621 --> 01:44:18.150
<v Speaker 1>pounds a day from these people because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fact that it's so.</v>

1933
01:44:18.151 --> 01:44:22.110
<v Speaker 1>It's so much in demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to to keep keep up with</v>

1934
01:44:22.111 --> 01:44:27.111
<v Speaker 1>the demand and we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been laws passed and because </v>

1935
01:44:27.111 --> 01:44:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Colorado and Washington state both </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed laws legalizing marijuana,</v>

1936
01:44:30.511 --> 01:44:34.350
<v Speaker 1>they also are trying to legalize hemp </v>
<v Speaker 1>farming,</v>

1937
01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:37.140
<v Speaker 1>but even though hemp is non </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive,</v>

1938
01:44:37.141 --> 01:44:42.141
<v Speaker 1>they're still facing a massive backlash </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the federal government and people </v>

1939
01:44:42.141 --> 01:44:43.110
<v Speaker 1>are scared to pull the trigger and start</v>
<v Speaker 1>farming.</v>

1940
01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Even just hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just fArming him,</v>

1941
01:44:45.630 --> 01:44:47.310
<v Speaker 1>which is non psychoactive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1942
01:44:47.311 --> 01:44:49.710
<v Speaker 1>the cousin of the marijuana plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

1943
01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:54.760
<v Speaker 1>You'll go to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll lock you up in a cage for </v>

1944
01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:57.141
<v Speaker 1>growing a plant that's perhaps the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular plant available to human </v>

1945
01:44:57.541 --> 01:44:58.800
<v Speaker 1>beings on the planet earth today.</v>

1946
01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:01.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the plant with the longest,</v>

1947
01:45:01.490 --> 01:45:06.490
<v Speaker 6>a verified cultivation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the first thing humans ever </v>

1948
01:45:06.490 --> 01:45:06.710
<v Speaker 6>cultivated as far as we know.</v>

1949
01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that like the best sign that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy like that?</v>

1950
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:14.910
<v Speaker 1>That's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's one of the best signs that </v>

1951
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:14.910
<v Speaker 1>we've</v>

1952
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:15.210
<v Speaker 6>politically last script.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The rational.</v>

1953
01:45:15.211 --> 01:45:19.770
<v Speaker 6>I mean on top of everything the </v>
<v Speaker 6>government does is out of money.</v>

1954
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:24.830
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tours of the white house are being </v>

1955
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:26.841
<v Speaker 6>curtailed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A flowers for the tomb of the unknown </v>

1956
01:45:26.841 --> 01:45:30.930
<v Speaker 6>soldieR are not being placed and because</v>
<v Speaker 6>of these stupid little budget cuts,</v>

1957
01:45:31.450 --> 01:45:36.240
<v Speaker 6>why can't we grow hemp and tax it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why caN't we grow marijuana and tax it?</v>

1958
01:45:36.270 --> 01:45:38.670
<v Speaker 6>Just think of the tax revenues that </v>
<v Speaker 6>would come in.</v>

1959
01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:42.390
<v Speaker 6>You have all the money that wouldn't go </v>
<v Speaker 6>to the drug warriors.</v>

1960
01:45:42.650 --> 01:45:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Is it shocking for you to have lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>this long and seen us go from the </v>

1961
01:45:47.650 --> 01:45:50.030
<v Speaker 1>fifties to 2013 and see where we're at </v>
<v Speaker 1>today?</v>

1962
01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Did you think that we'd be much further </v>
<v Speaker 1>along by now?</v>

1963
01:45:53.210 --> 01:45:58.210
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have always been very much of a </v>

1964
01:45:58.210 --> 01:46:00.050
<v Speaker 6>realist and I have never been a utopian.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just sort of take what comes.</v>

1965
01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:05.140
<v Speaker 6>I have seen human folly in one form or </v>
<v Speaker 6>another and I've certainly come to some </v>

1966
01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:10.480
<v Speaker 6>human folly myself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I'm just made of course and I'm </v>

1967
01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:12.980
<v Speaker 6>disappointed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I wouldn't say I'm shocked.</v>

1968
01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:18.310
<v Speaker 1>If you could address the people of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and urge them to move in one </v>

1969
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.930
<v Speaker 1>direction or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What what,</v>

1970
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:23.450
<v Speaker 1>what do you think would be the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>method for change for this world?</v>

1971
01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:29.400
<v Speaker 6>Good heavens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would never reach that pinnacle of </v>

1972
01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:32.430
<v Speaker 6>publicity or success or egotism,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what comes to mind most quickly </v>

1973
01:46:33.221 --> 01:46:36.700
<v Speaker 6>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>be a little kinder to each other,</v>

1974
01:46:38.890 --> 01:46:40.300
<v Speaker 6>be a lot kinder to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1975
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:46.350
<v Speaker 6>If I were a little more enthusiastic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say it'd be a lot kinder,</v>

1976
01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:49.560
<v Speaker 1>less enthusiastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What holds you back?</v>

1977
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:55.160
<v Speaker 5>I would go one step at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Starting a liTtle kinder works and </v>

1978
01:46:57.300 --> 01:46:57.810
<v Speaker 5>viola.</v>

1979
01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a psychedelic state of mind,</v>

1980
01:47:02.531 --> 01:47:03.260
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1981
01:47:03.261 --> 01:47:05.440
<v Speaker 1>that's a psychedelic ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1982
01:47:05.570 --> 01:47:10.570
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing I've most certainly </v>

1983
01:47:10.570 --> 01:47:12.661
<v Speaker 1>Learned from my experiences is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some sort of a strange </v>

1984
01:47:12.661 --> 01:47:15.880
<v Speaker 1>connection between human beings and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we exercise that connection to,</v>

1985
01:47:15.881 --> 01:47:18.310
<v Speaker 1>or I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we respect that connection,</v>

1986
01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:23.320
<v Speaker 1>honor that connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It enhances the way you feel about life </v>

1987
01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:27.211
<v Speaker 1>and enhancers to being kind to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people has a positive effect on you as </v>

1988
01:47:27.211 --> 01:47:31.951
<v Speaker 1>an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the universe reinforcing that </v>

1989
01:47:31.951 --> 01:47:31.951
<v Speaker 1>sort of behavior.</v>

1990
01:47:31.951 --> 01:47:35.560
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this really ties together matraville </v>

1991
01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:37.840
<v Speaker 5>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about shamanism and our </v>

1992
01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:42.731
<v Speaker 5>book justifying shamans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shamans help the community be kind to </v>

1993
01:47:42.731 --> 01:47:46.190
<v Speaker 5>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>help the community work together.</v>

1994
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:51.790
<v Speaker 5>Shamans in terms like rolling thunder </v>
<v Speaker 5>saw the need for communities all over </v>

1995
01:47:53.181 --> 01:47:58.181
<v Speaker 5>the world who work together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Politicians haven't quite gotten that </v>

1996
01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:02.600
<v Speaker 5>message yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the psychedelic ethos,</v>

1997
01:48:02.601 --> 01:48:07.601
<v Speaker 5>if you want to call it that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is one of connectivity is one of </v>

1998
01:48:07.601 --> 01:48:11.561
<v Speaker 5>kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of seeing the hologram and </v>

1999
01:48:11.561 --> 01:48:11.750
<v Speaker 5>which we all live.</v>

2000
01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:15.170
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shamans and the,</v>

2001
01:48:15.171 --> 01:48:19.860
<v Speaker 1>the term shamanism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all of it comes from much smaller</v>

2002
01:48:19.861 --> 01:48:21.910
<v Speaker 1>populations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2003
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that may be a key to the issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we went in reaching like New </v>

2004
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:29.790
<v Speaker 1>York city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>los angeles,</v>

2005
01:48:29.791 --> 01:48:30.110
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2006
01:48:30.111 --> 01:48:33.900
<v Speaker 1>these 10 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 million city populations,</v>

2007
01:48:34.110 --> 01:48:39.110
<v Speaker 1>you almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's almost too many people to </v>

2008
01:48:39.110 --> 01:48:42.411
<v Speaker 1>manage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the term shaman or the idea of a </v>

2009
01:48:42.411 --> 01:48:45.471
<v Speaker 1>showman gets very weird when you're in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribe of a few hundred people and you </v>

2010
01:48:45.471 --> 01:48:47.700
<v Speaker 1>have one trusted man that you've known </v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole life.</v>

2011
01:48:47.701 --> 01:48:49.770
<v Speaker 1>You know his chAracter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what he's really all about.</v>

2012
01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:55.040
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not trying to run some jim jones </v>

2013
01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:55.790
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and start his own cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you,</v>

2014
01:48:55.810 --> 01:48:58.950
<v Speaker 1>when you have a million people and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have 10 million people,</v>

2015
01:48:58.951 --> 01:49:03.951
<v Speaker 1>whatever you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you start calling yourself a shaman </v>

2016
01:49:03.951 --> 01:49:05.820
<v Speaker 1>and you gather up a following and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from all around,</v>

2017
01:49:06.090 --> 01:49:07.530
<v Speaker 1>next thing you know you've got a cult.</v>

2018
01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:11.610
<v Speaker 5>This is why you don't cAll yourself a </v>
<v Speaker 5>shaman.</v>

2019
01:49:11.850 --> 01:49:15.870
<v Speaker 5>A community appoints you a shaman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you call yourself a shaman,</v>

2020
01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:21.140
<v Speaker 5>then you get into the whole cult </v>
<v Speaker 5>mentality and you know what happens to </v>

2021
01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:25.641
<v Speaker 5>cults?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Usually they get out of hand and they </v>

2022
01:49:25.641 --> 01:49:27.010
<v Speaker 5>elude to lead to the jim jones </v>
<v Speaker 5>phenomenon.</v>

2023
01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:28.020
<v Speaker 5>The mass suicide.</v>

2024
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible to avoid that?</v>

2025
01:49:30.111 --> 01:49:35.111
<v Speaker 1>Can you have a nice cold?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that something that people never </v>

2026
01:49:35.111 --> 01:49:35.111
<v Speaker 1>figured out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2027
01:49:35.111 --> 01:49:35.210
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even figure out the airplane</v>

2028
01:49:35.211 --> 01:49:36.380
<v Speaker 1>until the 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2029
01:49:36.710 --> 01:49:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible to figure out a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>colt?</v>

2030
01:49:40.710 --> 01:49:45.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you'd call it a cult </v>
<v Speaker 5>because the word called has taken on a </v>

2031
01:49:45.710 --> 01:49:47.020
<v Speaker 5>negative connotation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2032
01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:50.300
<v Speaker 5>But it doesn't have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you could have a nice cold.</v>

2033
01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:55.480
<v Speaker 5>I'd have to strange biomet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>straighten my imagination to think of </v>

2034
01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:55.480
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2035
01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.920
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would suppose a.</v>

2036
01:49:56.930 --> 01:49:59.570
<v Speaker 5>Theoretically it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2037
01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:04.620
<v Speaker 5>I caught the quakers were not really a </v>
<v Speaker 5>cult because they never had a primary </v>

2038
01:50:06.530 --> 01:50:07.190
<v Speaker 5>leader.</v>

2039
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:11.860
<v Speaker 1>A so called assumes that personality at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the center of it.</v>

2040
01:50:11.861 --> 01:50:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it have to?</v>

2041
01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:16.870
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the definition of cold focuses on</v>

2042
01:50:16.871 --> 01:50:18.310
<v Speaker 5>a person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could.</v>

2043
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:20.170
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2044
01:50:20.171 --> 01:50:25.171
<v Speaker 5>I hear a talk about the grateful dead </v>
<v Speaker 5>cult now that certainly has been very </v>

2045
01:50:25.171 --> 01:50:28.370
<v Speaker 5>beneficial during the era that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>grateful dead were wrong with all of the</v>

2046
01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:33.380
<v Speaker 5>deadheads and even though you had some </v>
<v Speaker 5>people going off the edge at grateful </v>

2047
01:50:34.281 --> 01:50:37.250
<v Speaker 5>dead concerts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bottled large was a loving,</v>

2048
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:39.800
<v Speaker 5>collaborative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cooperative group.</v>

2049
01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:45.280
<v Speaker 5>And the grateful dead singers themselves</v>
<v Speaker 5>certainly didn't preach violence and </v>

2050
01:50:45.771 --> 01:50:49.460
<v Speaker 5>terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They preached love and peace and joy and</v>

2051
01:50:49.461 --> 01:50:54.461
<v Speaker 5>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you hear in the music that's called </v>

2052
01:50:54.461 --> 01:50:56.600
<v Speaker 5>a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would not use that term myself,</v>

2053
01:50:56.930 --> 01:50:58.460
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that had a,</v>

2054
01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:01.460
<v Speaker 5>not one person but a group of people at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the head of it.</v>

2055
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:06.850
<v Speaker 5>And when the grateful dead ended,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you have the memories linger on and</v>

2056
01:51:07.071 --> 01:51:11.330
<v Speaker 5>the members of the great how all doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>useful and beautiful and artistic things</v>

2057
01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:13.460
<v Speaker 5>on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Burning man.</v>

2058
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sort of thing.</v>

2059
01:51:15.371 --> 01:51:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Have you been to</v>

2060
01:51:15.850 --> 01:51:17.500
<v Speaker 5>burning man?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2061
01:51:17.630 --> 01:51:18.340
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've been there.</v>

2062
01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:22.300
<v Speaker 5>I have bounced or something like </v>
<v Speaker 5>burningham burn burning man.</v>

2063
01:51:22.301 --> 01:51:24.280
<v Speaker 5>I've built a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the smaller venues,</v>

2064
01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:30.060
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think that you had called </v>
<v Speaker 5>out a cult because that doesn't focus </v>

2065
01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:32.470
<v Speaker 5>around a Particular person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would call that a social movement,</v>

2066
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:34.180
<v Speaker 5>a social phenomenon.</v>

2067
01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2068
01:51:35.970 --> 01:51:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I could get down with the whole grateful</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead thing set the music sucks.</v>

2069
01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:41.070
<v Speaker 1>A kiss cam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2070
01:51:41.071 --> 01:51:44.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a matter of taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only fucking around,</v>

2071
01:51:45.450 --> 01:51:47.680
<v Speaker 1>but I have a degree</v>

2072
01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:49.770
<v Speaker 5>filled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll have their own archive.</v>

2073
01:51:49.771 --> 01:51:52.950
<v Speaker 5>It was not their idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the university of California,</v>

2074
01:51:52.951 --> 01:51:57.951
<v Speaker 5>santa cruz opened up an archive now that</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was there for the ground debut of the,</v>

2075
01:52:01.250 --> 01:52:03.480
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the collection.</v>

2076
01:52:03.481 --> 01:52:08.481
<v Speaker 5>And they're doing a marvelous Job in </v>
<v Speaker 5>terms of showing the whole chronology of</v>

2077
01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:12.360
<v Speaker 5>what they called the grateful dead </v>
<v Speaker 5>phenomenon.</v>

2078
01:52:12.770 --> 01:52:16.860
<v Speaker 5>Add tHat the such a mosaic with knoll </v>
<v Speaker 5>denier movement at all.</v>

2079
01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:22.040
<v Speaker 5>It's a challenge to put that into what's</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be 24 rooms and they have </v>

2080
01:52:24.211 --> 01:52:29.211
<v Speaker 5>gotten donations literally from all over</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world and they've arranged it very,</v>

2081
01:52:29.731 --> 01:52:33.060
<v Speaker 5>veRy tastefully.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is open to the public and there you</v>

2082
01:52:33.061 --> 01:52:37.770
<v Speaker 5>can get a real taste of what a social </v>
<v Speaker 5>Movement can do,</v>

2083
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:42.830
<v Speaker 5>an artistic movement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Also the how it can start and what that </v>

2084
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.830
<v Speaker 5>lead to.</v>

2085
01:52:42.850 --> 01:52:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

2086
01:52:43.450 --> 01:52:48.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that in that it was a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive movement and the dad sort of </v>

2087
01:52:48.450 --> 01:52:51.050
<v Speaker 1>emphasized peace and love and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody would go around.</v>

2088
01:52:51.170 --> 01:52:56.170
<v Speaker 1>My cousin actually follow the debt </v>
<v Speaker 1>around for years and years and her and </v>

2089
01:52:56.170 --> 01:52:58.460
<v Speaker 1>her boyfriend used to sell eggs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bacon from the back of their car.</v>

2090
01:52:58.461 --> 01:53:03.461
<v Speaker 1>They had like a little grill and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would cook and the concerts and feed </v>

2091
01:53:03.461 --> 01:53:07.751
<v Speaker 1>people and make beads and shit and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird crafts and stuff and she was a </v>

2092
01:53:07.751 --> 01:53:12.011
<v Speaker 1>full on deadhead for several years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just followed them from venue to venue </v>

2093
01:53:12.011 --> 01:53:14.330
<v Speaker 1>and that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that happens.</v>

2094
01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:17.450
<v Speaker 1>How does a band like that that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>for them,</v>

2095
01:53:17.451 --> 01:53:18.920
<v Speaker 1>but it doeSn't happen for the rolling </v>
<v Speaker 1>stones.</v>

2096
01:53:18.921 --> 01:53:19.990
<v Speaker 1>It happens for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2097
01:53:19.991 --> 01:53:21.320
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange thing.</v>

2098
01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:23.620
<v Speaker 6>That's the merry pranksters,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2099
01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:27.510
<v Speaker 6>They were the house band for ken keyes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ease.</v>

2100
01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:30.020
<v Speaker 6>She had a great deal to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2101
01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:35.030
<v Speaker 6>And they used to go around in the bus </v>
<v Speaker 6>right onwards and uh,</v>

2102
01:53:36.630 --> 01:53:38.580
<v Speaker 6>they would go from town to town and do </v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2103
01:53:38.581 --> 01:53:39.480
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what they Call it,</v>

2104
01:53:39.481 --> 01:53:44.481
<v Speaker 6>the electric koolaid acid test,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they would have concerts where they </v>

2105
01:53:44.481 --> 01:53:49.131
<v Speaker 6>were alsO passing out acid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they'd like pull into some town in </v>

2106
01:53:49.131 --> 01:53:50.670
<v Speaker 6>Nebraska or something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2107
01:53:50.671 --> 01:53:53.760
<v Speaker 6>find a big field somewhere and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 6>would come out,</v>

2108
01:53:53.761 --> 01:53:56.400
<v Speaker 6>there'd be acid and the grateful dead </v>
<v Speaker 6>would play.</v>

2109
01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:58.800
<v Speaker 6>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from the very beginning,</v>

2110
01:53:58.801 --> 01:54:01.620
<v Speaker 6>the altered consciousness was part of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the musical experience.</v>

2111
01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:05.160
<v Speaker 6>Wolfe's book,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the electric koolaid acid test is really</v>

2112
01:54:05.161 --> 01:54:10.161
<v Speaker 6>a very good chronology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you didn't have other bands who had </v>

2113
01:54:10.830 --> 01:54:15.830
<v Speaker 6>a key sheet sort of adopt them as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>vehicle for his own creativity.</v>

2114
01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:18.260
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you ever meet ken keyes?</v>

2115
01:54:18.270 --> 01:54:19.050
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did.</v>

2116
01:54:19.710 --> 01:54:24.710
<v Speaker 6>I've met volunteered girl who was the </v>
<v Speaker 6>significant other of both Kentucky kishi</v>

2117
01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:30.920
<v Speaker 6>and of Jerry Garcia monitoring girl was </v>
<v Speaker 6>there for the debut of the archives.</v>

2118
01:54:31.531 --> 01:54:36.531
<v Speaker 6>And her daughter is the one who on jerry</v>
<v Speaker 6>garcia's dog or cut the ribbon to open </v>

2119
01:54:36.531 --> 01:54:36.840
<v Speaker 6>the archives.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2120
01:54:36.870 --> 01:54:38.640
<v Speaker 6>that's a very important part of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>history.</v>

2121
01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Mountain girl was Jerry Garcia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And ken keyes,</v>

2122
01:54:41.171 --> 01:54:42.750
<v Speaker 1>his girlfriend at the same time?</v>

2123
01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:44.310
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2124
01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:48.030
<v Speaker 6>A space between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a little bit of gap.</v>

2125
01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:53.060
<v Speaker 6>Who got her first?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that Jerry Garcia was Jerry </v>

2126
01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:58.280
<v Speaker 6>Garcia.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How many shifts have you been to </v>

2127
01:54:58.280 --> 01:54:58.280
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been to two,</v>

2128
01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:00.870
<v Speaker 6>but I'm sure you've been to hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 6>grateful dead shows.</v>

2129
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:02.200
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not hundreds.</v>

2130
01:55:02.290 --> 01:55:07.290
<v Speaker 6>You got to remember that I had a full </v>
<v Speaker 6>time job at the time and I had a family </v>

2131
01:55:07.290 --> 01:55:10.350
<v Speaker 6>to take care of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I estimate high to at least 50 years.</v>

2132
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 grateful dead shows and yet still can</v>

2133
01:55:14.221 --> 01:55:18.920
<v Speaker 1>hold a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say folks not propaganda has been</v>

2134
01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:23.630
<v Speaker 6>mainly at the shows,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he was onstage and finally yesterday</v>

2135
01:55:23.631 --> 01:55:26.830
<v Speaker 6>he was telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sitting behind the drum drummers,</v>

2136
01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:29.590
<v Speaker 6>looking out in one concert,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a guy comes,</v>

2137
01:55:29.591 --> 01:55:31.330
<v Speaker 6>sits down next to him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's david byrne.</v>

2138
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:33.340
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>FIrst day,</v>

2139
01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:35.560
<v Speaker 6>first time David Burnett ever been to a </v>
<v Speaker 6>dead show.</v>

2140
01:55:35.561 --> 01:55:39.640
<v Speaker 6>And you were his guy to educate david </v>
<v Speaker 6>byrne about the grateful dead so that he</v>

2141
01:55:39.641 --> 01:55:42.610
<v Speaker 6>could have an educated conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 6>them after the show.</v>

2142
01:55:43.930 --> 01:55:47.380
<v Speaker 6>Did you ever do any psychedelics with </v>
<v Speaker 6>dolphins or did you ever experiment with</v>

2143
01:55:47.381 --> 01:55:49.570
<v Speaker 6>that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Swim with dolphins,</v>

2144
01:55:49.571 --> 01:55:51.700
<v Speaker 6>but I've never done psychedelics with </v>
<v Speaker 6>dolphins.</v>

2145
01:55:51.710 --> 01:55:56.710
<v Speaker 6>Not not necessarily being with dolphins </v>
<v Speaker 6>as a high enough experience on </v>

2146
01:55:56.710 --> 01:55:57.130
<v Speaker 6>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you know john lilly?</v>

2147
01:55:57.640 --> 01:55:59.080
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I knew him very well.</v>

2148
01:55:59.140 --> 01:55:59.560
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2149
01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lily had some fascinating experiments </v>

2150
01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:06.020
<v Speaker 1>with dolphins and psychedelics acid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tanks.</v>

2151
01:56:06.610 --> 01:56:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Sensory deprivation tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>AbsoluTely.</v>

2152
01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Did you get involved in the tank at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sensory deprivation.</v>

2153
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:16.750
<v Speaker 6>Separate deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've done sensory deprivation tanks in </v>

2154
01:56:16.750 --> 01:56:19.911
<v Speaker 6>the lots of psychedelics because they </v>
<v Speaker 6>had experiences good enough in and of </v>

2155
01:56:19.911 --> 01:56:24.490
<v Speaker 6>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of the experiences that I like in </v>

2156
01:56:24.490 --> 01:56:27.791
<v Speaker 6>and of themselves and I don't need them </v>
<v Speaker 6>to be augmented by psychedelics.</v>

2157
01:56:28.350 --> 01:56:28.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2158
01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:31.790
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that with the sensory </v>
<v Speaker 1>deprivation tank,</v>

2159
01:56:31.970 --> 01:56:36.970
<v Speaker 1>but I think it takes a little while to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get get the hang of yes to relax and </v>

2160
01:56:36.970 --> 01:56:41.771
<v Speaker 1>learn how to let go in there and really </v>
<v Speaker 1>find those altered states of </v>

2161
01:56:41.771 --> 01:56:43.080
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had several people talk to me.</v>

2162
01:56:43.090 --> 01:56:43.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2163
01:56:43.491 --> 01:56:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I tried to tank a couple times that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really didn't trip my balls off.</v>

2164
01:56:46.401 --> 01:56:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2165
01:56:47.090 --> 01:56:48.020
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

2166
01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I've described this running.</v>

2167
01:56:52.570 --> 01:56:57.470
<v Speaker 6>I don't to be to town talented here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when I enter into these experiences,</v>

2168
01:56:57.820 --> 01:57:01.520
<v Speaker 6>I do it with what chris just called </v>
<v Speaker 6>intentionality on us.</v>

2169
01:57:01.521 --> 01:57:02.710
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2170
01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:04.910
<v Speaker 6>how am I going to learn from this </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience?</v>

2171
01:57:06.230 --> 01:57:11.090
<v Speaker 6>What am I going to take away from this </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience that is beneficial to me,</v>

2172
01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:16.070
<v Speaker 6>my friends and the world at large.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every time I've taken iowasca,</v>

2173
01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:20.690
<v Speaker 6>I've written the what I've learned and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>have gotten a very important lesson from</v>

2174
01:57:20.691 --> 01:57:25.691
<v Speaker 6>each of my town iowasca sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The last session was so powerful.</v>

2175
01:57:25.761 --> 01:57:30.761
<v Speaker 6>I'm still learning from him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>still trying to put louis lessons into </v>

2176
01:57:30.761 --> 01:57:30.980
<v Speaker 6>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How long ago was that?</v>

2177
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:32.750
<v Speaker 6>That was a year and a half ago.</v>

2178
01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Year and a half ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was so powerful.</v>

2179
01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:36.540
<v Speaker 1>You're still trying to</v>

2180
01:57:36.850 --> 01:57:38.480
<v Speaker 6>absorb it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Brazil.</v>

2181
01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:39.800
<v Speaker 6>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very powerful.</v>

2182
01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:43.170
<v Speaker 1>What is the most profound thing you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned from psychedelic experiences</v>

2183
01:57:44.930 --> 01:57:47.030
<v Speaker 6>if you had a most?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I.</v>

2184
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:49.820
<v Speaker 6>I try not to play favorites because I've</v>
<v Speaker 6>learned so much,</v>

2185
01:57:49.821 --> 01:57:54.821
<v Speaker 6>but if you put me on the spot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say that human beings are not a </v>

2186
01:57:55.861 --> 01:57:59.900
<v Speaker 6>part from nature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Human beings are part of nature,</v>

2187
01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:04.730
<v Speaker 6>and when human being separate themselves</v>
<v Speaker 6>from the rest of nature,</v>

2188
01:58:05.450 --> 01:58:07.580
<v Speaker 6>they run a mock,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they get into trouble,</v>

2189
01:58:08.090 --> 01:58:13.090
<v Speaker 6>so living a natural life with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>principles of nature of all of our </v>

2190
01:58:13.701 --> 01:58:18.080
<v Speaker 6>relations is the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not only to a happy life,</v>

2191
01:58:18.081 --> 01:58:20.240
<v Speaker 6>but a fulfilling life and the meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>

2192
01:58:20.650 --> 01:58:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that our current state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance,</v>

2193
01:58:22.751 --> 01:58:27.130
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just a byproduct of us expanding from</v>

2194
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:32.430
<v Speaker 1>the world of primitive hominids to </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

2195
01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:37.860
<v Speaker 1>to explaining feelings and thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eventually understanding the full </v>

2196
01:58:38.171 --> 01:58:40.150
<v Speaker 1>spectrum of our impact in the world.</v>

2197
01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:42.100
<v Speaker 6>You've put up very well and I'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 6>put</v>

2198
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:45.520
<v Speaker 1>that into the context of neuroscience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the brain.</v>

2199
01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:51.210
<v Speaker 1>We've gotten ourselves into a situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the western consciousness is </v>

2200
01:58:53.051 --> 01:58:58.051
<v Speaker 1>focused in the frontaL lobeS anD in part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the left hemisphere of the brain.</v>

2201
01:58:59.230 --> 01:59:03.760
<v Speaker 1>We ignore The reptilian brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medulla oblongata,</v>

2202
01:59:03.770 --> 01:59:07.590
<v Speaker 1>the spinal cord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ignore the penalty.</v>

2203
01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:12.660
<v Speaker 1>All mammalian brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the limbic system where the emotions </v>

2204
01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:12.760
<v Speaker 1>come in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've even,</v>

2205
01:59:12.761 --> 01:59:16.480
<v Speaker 1>if you ignore the right hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for lefthanded people,</v>

2206
01:59:16.481 --> 01:59:21.481
<v Speaker 1>the right hemisphere is the holistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere where we see things as a </v>

2207
01:59:21.481 --> 01:59:22.630
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a complete gestalt.</v>

2208
01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:27.250
<v Speaker 1>We are focused in the left hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which again,</v>

2209
01:59:27.251 --> 01:59:30.940
<v Speaker 1>for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the lefthanded people,</v>

2210
01:59:31.090 --> 01:59:33.340
<v Speaker 1>we can't leave them out there a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit different.</v>

2211
01:59:34.090 --> 01:59:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Focuses on linear thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on bits and parts and pieces,</v>

2212
01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:42.480
<v Speaker 1>on reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on down,</v>

2213
01:59:43.070 --> 01:59:47.740
<v Speaker 1>on rational approaches to stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we leave out imagination,</v>

2214
01:59:47.770 --> 01:59:49.600
<v Speaker 1>intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>

2215
01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:54.100
<v Speaker 1>all of the things that make a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuLly human.</v>

2216
01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'S a very,</v>

2217
01:59:57.041 --> 01:59:58.990
<v Speaker 1>very important point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2218
01:59:58.991 --> 01:59:59.650
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2219
01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I think that science is an amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of our worlD and our ability to </v>

2220
02:00:05.681 --> 02:00:10.681
<v Speaker 1>measure nature and understand the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>just the building blocks of,</v>

2221
02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:16.520
<v Speaker 1>of reality is really amazing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>BuT one of the things that science can </v>

2222
02:00:17.051 --> 02:00:22.051
<v Speaker 1>account for his love can account for </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciation of art can account for the </v>

2223
02:00:23.501 --> 02:00:25.900
<v Speaker 1>way you feel when a great song comes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The radio,</v>

2224
02:00:26.170 --> 02:00:27.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can account for the,</v>

2225
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2226
02:00:28.770 --> 02:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>the beauty of a person's personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So certain people that are just amazing </v>

2227
02:00:33.770 --> 02:00:35.200
<v Speaker 1>to be around that you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you smile.</v>

2228
02:00:35.201 --> 02:00:40.201
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's this immeasurable </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection to passion and love that that</v>

2229
02:00:40.871 --> 02:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>human being share that's again to </v>
<v Speaker 1>measurable,</v>

2230
02:00:44.170 --> 02:00:45.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't quantiFy,</v>

2231
02:00:45.761 --> 02:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>you can't write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

2232
02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:50.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of humanity.</v>

2233
02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:55.340
<v Speaker 6>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to put in a plug for saybrook </v>

2234
02:00:55.340 --> 02:00:58.101
<v Speaker 6>university beCause you are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 6>expand the boundaries of science and say</v>

2235
02:00:58.410 --> 02:01:03.410
<v Speaker 6>that there can be art based science,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there can be love based science where </v>

2236
02:01:04.261 --> 02:01:08.280
<v Speaker 6>people can use narratives to describe </v>
<v Speaker 6>their experience route,</v>

2237
02:01:08.290 --> 02:01:12.120
<v Speaker 6>can use neuroscience to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 6>what's going on in the brain,</v>

2238
02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:17.180
<v Speaker 6>the gut,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the heart and the body and that's not </v>

2239
02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:20.631
<v Speaker 6>going to completely explain all of this </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you have to depend upon </v>

2240
02:01:20.631 --> 02:01:25.290
<v Speaker 6>literature and the arts and poetry and </v>
<v Speaker 6>painting to do justice to it,</v>

2241
02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:30.830
<v Speaker 6>but at least we could do much more than </v>
<v Speaker 6>we've done in the past with very narrow </v>

2242
02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:32.310
<v Speaker 6>conceptions of science</v>

2243
02:01:32.650 --> 02:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>and in teaching in saybrook university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said that the courses were all </v>

2244
02:01:37.650 --> 02:01:41.551
<v Speaker 1>available online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people from anywhere in the world </v>

2245
02:01:41.551 --> 02:01:41.551
<v Speaker 1>listening to this</v>

2246
02:01:41.551 --> 02:01:45.040
<v Speaker 6>sign.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course they have to pay for the </v>

2247
02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:45.040
<v Speaker 6>courses and register with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2248
02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:49.061
<v Speaker 6>it depends upon the course.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say people can go to our </v>

2249
02:01:49.061 --> 02:01:49.610
<v Speaker 6>website,</v>
<v Speaker 6>saybrook.edu,</v>

2250
02:01:49.611 --> 02:01:51.680
<v Speaker 6>when they'll get the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do you spell saybrook?</v>

2251
02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:56.030
<v Speaker 6>S a y,</v>
<v Speaker 6>b r o o k saybrook.edu.</v>

2252
02:01:56.090 --> 02:01:58.190
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they can find on how much everything</v>

2253
02:01:58.191 --> 02:01:59.260
<v Speaker 6>costs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They can.</v>

2254
02:01:59.261 --> 02:02:04.261
<v Speaker 6>I handle a course on actually a </v>
<v Speaker 6>certificate course that anybody can take</v>

2255
02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:10.180
<v Speaker 6>on the psychology of dreams and dreaming</v>
<v Speaker 6>repeat after laurel how to work with </v>

2256
02:02:11.151 --> 02:02:14.420
<v Speaker 6>dreams and learn the brain science </v>
<v Speaker 6>behind dreams and dreaming.</v>

2257
02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:18.000
<v Speaker 6>So there you have both the cycle neuro </v>
<v Speaker 6>cycle,</v>

2258
02:02:18.050 --> 02:02:20.750
<v Speaker 6>neurology of dreams and the neuroscience</v>
<v Speaker 6>of dreams.</v>

2259
02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:25.280
<v Speaker 6>But you have the art of dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the interpretation of dreams,</v>

2260
02:02:25.290 --> 02:02:30.290
<v Speaker 6>the dreams make with the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>body and with the significant people </v>

2261
02:02:30.290 --> 02:02:32.690
<v Speaker 6>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What about the connection between dreams</v>

2262
02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:35.900
<v Speaker 6>and the body's endogenous production of </v>
<v Speaker 6>how senate,</v>

2263
02:02:36.730 --> 02:02:37.100
<v Speaker 6>like</v>

2264
02:02:37.310 --> 02:02:40.550
<v Speaker 3>dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like rick strassman's work on,</v>

2265
02:02:40.551 --> 02:02:41.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

2266
02:02:41.110 --> 02:02:42.140
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on dmt,</v>

2267
02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:43.760
<v Speaker 6>aware of us?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2268
02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:46.060
<v Speaker 6>Rick strauss would be great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Another great pie in your,</v>

2269
02:02:46.061 --> 02:02:47.640
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all the important people.</v>

2270
02:02:47.641 --> 02:02:48.750
<v Speaker 6>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very impressed.</v>

2271
02:02:48.810 --> 02:02:49.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's amazing.</v>

2272
02:02:49.661 --> 02:02:51.880
<v Speaker 3>He's a good friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that guy in his book,</v>

2273
02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:54.460
<v Speaker 3>dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The spirit molecule is one in one of the</v>

2274
02:02:54.461 --> 02:02:57.120
<v Speaker 3>most important books I've ever read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2275
02:02:57.130 --> 02:02:58.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain.</v>

2276
02:02:58.211 --> 02:02:59.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't really,</v>

2277
02:02:59.051 --> 02:03:04.051
<v Speaker 3>I mean the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone likes to say the pineal gland </v>

2278
02:03:04.051 --> 02:03:04.750
<v Speaker 3>produces dmt and there's some anecdotal </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence to that,</v>

2279
02:03:04.751 --> 02:03:07.390
<v Speaker 3>but we know bob just forget about where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's produced.</v>

2280
02:03:07.391 --> 02:03:12.391
<v Speaker 3>We know it's made in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know absolutely it exists in the </v>

2281
02:03:12.391 --> 02:03:14.230
<v Speaker 3>human boDy aNd thAt it's one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>transient substances known demand,</v>

2282
02:03:14.530 --> 02:03:19.210
<v Speaker 3>meaning that when you take dmt in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in a smokable form,</v>

2283
02:03:19.211 --> 02:03:21.910
<v Speaker 3>your body brings you back to baseline </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely quickly.</v>

2284
02:03:22.090 --> 02:03:27.090
<v Speaker 3>And one of The weird things about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dmt experiences that it has a very </v>

2285
02:03:27.090 --> 02:03:31.591
<v Speaker 3>similar effect to dream states in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very vivid immediately after the</v>

2286
02:03:31.601 --> 02:03:36.601
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then shortly after just like a </v>

2287
02:03:36.601 --> 02:03:36.601
<v Speaker 3>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2288
02:03:36.601 --> 02:03:36.601
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

2289
02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:41.350
<v Speaker 3>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's almost in my humble estimation,</v>

2290
02:03:41.351 --> 02:03:43.660
<v Speaker 3>like a protection mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your,</v>

2291
02:03:43.661 --> 02:03:45.730
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your reality,</v>

2292
02:03:45.810 --> 02:03:48.640
<v Speaker 3>the material world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocking on things,</v>

2293
02:03:48.641 --> 02:03:51.280
<v Speaker 3>weighing things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That reality is,</v>

2294
02:03:52.510 --> 02:03:57.510
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard to combine the two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hallucinogenic reality,</v>

2295
02:03:58.091 --> 02:04:01.930
<v Speaker 3>the dmt reality is so bizarre that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like the brands like,</v>

2296
02:04:01.931 --> 02:04:02.650
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

2297
02:04:02.651 --> 02:04:07.651
<v Speaker 3>you can't handle this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just going to erase that shit for </v>

2298
02:04:07.651 --> 02:04:07.651
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2299
02:04:07.651 --> 02:04:09.010
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can you have.</v>

2300
02:04:09.011 --> 02:04:14.011
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had many dmt trips in the most </v>

2301
02:04:14.011 --> 02:04:17.491
<v Speaker 3>vivid ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so incredibly powerful right </v>

2302
02:04:17.491 --> 02:04:20.050
<v Speaker 3>after it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're gone within five minutes.</v>

2303
02:04:20.290 --> 02:04:21.820
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't record it,</v>

2304
02:04:21.821 --> 02:04:25.340
<v Speaker 3>if you don't write it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like most of the experience somehow</v>

2305
02:04:25.341 --> 02:04:27.180
<v Speaker 3>or another slips out of your fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2306
02:04:27.181 --> 02:04:27.270
<v Speaker 3>of</v>

2307
02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:32.270
<v Speaker 6>course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shifting from one type of conscious to </v>

2308
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:33.120
<v Speaker 6>suit other type of consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 6>difficult.</v>

2309
02:04:33.121 --> 02:04:36.630
<v Speaker 6>You're going to forget what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is why when people wake up from the</v>

2310
02:04:36.631 --> 02:04:41.631
<v Speaker 6>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they don't try to found right away </v>

2311
02:04:41.631 --> 02:04:41.631
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to forget it,</v>

2312
02:04:41.631 --> 02:04:42.940
<v Speaker 6>and even though they don't remember the </v>
<v Speaker 6>entire dream.</v>

2313
02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:46.870
<v Speaker 6>One nice thing about dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This involves the whole brain.</v>

2314
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:51.970
<v Speaker 6>This is why shamanism is so closely </v>
<v Speaker 6>linked with dreams.</v>

2315
02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:54.910
<v Speaker 6>Shamanism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The shaman uses the whole brain,</v>

2316
02:04:54.911 --> 02:04:57.400
<v Speaker 6>the shaman through drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>through dreams,</v>

2317
02:04:57.401 --> 02:04:59.230
<v Speaker 6>through dancing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>through drumming,</v>

2318
02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:04.280
<v Speaker 6>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uses parts of the brain that other </v>

2319
02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:06.820
<v Speaker 6>people in the community do not use and </v>
<v Speaker 6>in dreams you've got the emotions,</v>

2320
02:05:06.821 --> 02:05:11.821
<v Speaker 6>you've got the reflexes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've got these survival mechanisms and</v>

2321
02:05:11.981 --> 02:05:16.981
<v Speaker 6>you've got the transcendent experiences </v>
<v Speaker 6>all in one neat little package and if </v>

2322
02:05:17.381 --> 02:05:20.950
<v Speaker 6>you don't write that stuff down and put </v>
<v Speaker 6>it to use,</v>

2323
02:05:21.370 --> 02:05:22.240
<v Speaker 6>you're going to forget it.</v>

2324
02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in bed and I have this </v>

2325
02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>hilarious idea and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2326
02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:32.331
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to forget that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wake up in the morning and justin </v>

2327
02:05:32.331 --> 02:05:34.970
<v Speaker 1>bieber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about justin bieber all the time,</v>

2328
02:05:34.971 --> 02:05:36.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It drives me nuts.</v>

2329
02:05:37.850 --> 02:05:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Since the nineties I've been carrying </v>
<v Speaker 1>these little recorders,</v>

2330
02:05:42.831 --> 02:05:45.230
<v Speaker 1>these digital voice recorders because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2331
02:05:45.250 --> 02:05:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's been the bed every night </v>

2332
02:05:50.250 --> 02:05:50.250
<v Speaker 1>under my pilloW sometimes because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just hit the button.</v>

2333
02:05:50.250 --> 02:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2334
02:05:52.060 --> 02:05:57.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to start doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I record everything on my </v>

2335
02:05:57.060 --> 02:05:57.060
<v Speaker 1>iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you got to open the iphone.</v>

2336
02:05:57.060 --> 02:06:01.100
<v Speaker 1>Going to apps and the digital recording </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

2337
02:06:01.101 --> 02:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Some of them you just plug it into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer and it transfers it into text,</v>

2338
02:06:04.581 --> 02:06:05.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2339
02:06:05.150 --> 02:06:07.610
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transfers it into text so you don't have</v>

2340
02:06:07.611 --> 02:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>to listen and decide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>

2341
02:06:09.651 --> 02:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just get a list.</v>

2342
02:06:11.211 --> 02:06:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a new thing.</v>

2343
02:06:12.801 --> 02:06:14.270
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

2344
02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful thing.</v>

2345
02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2346
02:06:17.930 --> 02:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen any of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A voice to text software?</v>

2347
02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:23.730
<v Speaker 6>I've seen that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to put it to use.</v>

2348
02:06:23.731 --> 02:06:25.110
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a great advance.</v>

2349
02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Want to see something called watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show it to you right now.</v>

2350
02:06:28.090 --> 02:06:32.090
<v Speaker 1>This is how amazing these things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just a regular iphone.</v>

2351
02:06:32.210 --> 02:06:37.210
<v Speaker 1>When you go into the notes application,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go into the notes application </v>

2352
02:06:37.210 --> 02:06:38.120
<v Speaker 1>and you want to make a note to get this </v>
<v Speaker 1>little thing right here,</v>

2353
02:06:38.121 --> 02:06:41.750
<v Speaker 1>that looks like a microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you press that and you go,</v>

2354
02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:46.960
<v Speaker 1>stanley kripner is a bad motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he'd be like that a butchered.</v>

2355
02:06:48.951 --> 02:06:53.951
<v Speaker 1>You said stanley crypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a bad motherfucker.</v>

2356
02:06:55.610 --> 02:06:56.690

<v Speaker 1>but that's pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I bet you would do it again.</v>

2360
02:07:06.850 --> 02:07:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Ryan is a bad motherfucker.</v>

2361
02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:13.010
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Proof is there in the notes.</v>

2364
02:07:19.650 --> 02:07:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must be an amazing thing to have </v>

2365
02:07:24.650 --> 02:07:27.100
<v Speaker 1>witnessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see people going from textbooks to </v>

2366
02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:29.891
<v Speaker 1>the internet to and to be able to hold a</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies and to hold classes online.</v>

2367
02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:35.040
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is why should you?</v>

2368
02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:38.290
<v Speaker 6>Morning star and I worked so well </v>
<v Speaker 6>together on their book,</v>

2369
02:07:38.291 --> 02:07:41.190
<v Speaker 6>the voice of rolling thunder because he </v>
<v Speaker 6>wants to round with his ipod,</v>

2370
02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:44.320
<v Speaker 6>interviewing people and he has his own </v>
<v Speaker 6>website,</v>

2371
02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:49.780
<v Speaker 6>open source religion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which you're williston should plug into </v>

2372
02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:54.230
<v Speaker 6>where people from different religious </v>
<v Speaker 6>persuasions can come to a website and </v>

2373
02:07:54.230 --> 02:07:59.130
<v Speaker 6>argue things out and discuss things on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the internet without even meeting each </v>

2374
02:07:59.130 --> 02:07:59.260
<v Speaker 6>other physically.</v>

2375
02:07:59.340 --> 02:08:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Some people from various ideologies can </v>
<v Speaker 1>compare noTes as to who's crazier.</v>

2376
02:08:04.170 --> 02:08:09.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a kind way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see like in them,</v>

2377
02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:14.480
<v Speaker 1>after all you've been through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see the shit that's going down </v>

2378
02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:14.480
<v Speaker 1>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2379
02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:14.480
<v Speaker 1>we have a new pope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2380
02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:17.460
<v Speaker 1>and everybody lines up and all the major</v>
<v Speaker 1>media and the news,</v>

2381
02:08:17.580 --> 02:08:21.960
<v Speaker 1>they treat it like it's a real event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really mind boggling.</v>

2382
02:08:21.961 --> 02:08:24.190
<v Speaker 1>You got a guy dressed up like a wizard </v>
<v Speaker 1>who runs a,</v>

2383
02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:28.260
<v Speaker 1>a whole clan of kid fuckers and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking it seriously.</v>

2384
02:08:28.350 --> 02:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>How come jerry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if jerry sandusky had been religiously </v>

2385
02:08:33.350 --> 02:08:34.040
<v Speaker 1>ordained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would he not be in prison now?</v>

2386
02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:39.060
<v Speaker 1>They would sneak them around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would move him somewhere with that </v>

2387
02:08:39.060 --> 02:08:42.111
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why they had to get </v>

2388
02:08:42.111 --> 02:08:42.960
<v Speaker 1>rId of the pope for folks who don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the pope is responsible.</v>

2389
02:08:42.961 --> 02:08:44.400
<v Speaker 1>The past pope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the new one.</v>

2390
02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:49.400
<v Speaker 1>The past pope was responsible for having</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man released who molested over 200 </v>

2391
02:08:49.770 --> 02:08:52.860
<v Speaker 1>deaf kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>200.</v>

2392
02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:58.100
<v Speaker 1>He took him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm shielded him from prosecution and </v>

2393
02:08:58.100 --> 02:08:59.520
<v Speaker 1>then moved to a new parish where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>molested more kids.</v>

2394
02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:01.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge,</v>

2395
02:09:01.951 --> 02:09:06.951
<v Speaker 1>huge scandal and you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If jerry sandusky hadn't been involved </v>

2396
02:09:06.951 --> 02:09:11.211
<v Speaker 1>in the religion of football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead was involved in religion of </v>

2397
02:09:11.211 --> 02:09:12.060
<v Speaker 1>catholicism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very right.</v>

2398
02:09:12.061 --> 02:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I bet he would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would be afraid.</v>

2399
02:09:14.070 --> 02:09:16.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are free </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2401
02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things they've done is they </v>

2402
02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:25.960
<v Speaker 1>take people and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say they're punishing them by </v>

2403
02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:26.370
<v Speaker 1>removing them from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from churches,</v>

2404
02:09:26.371 --> 02:09:29.130
<v Speaker 1>and they bring them to these gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious compounds when they have these</v>

2405
02:09:29.131 --> 02:09:32.700
<v Speaker 1>beautiful grounds and his place in North</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carolina where they took this,</v>

2406
02:09:32.701 --> 02:09:37.701
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy who was responsible for </v>

2407
02:09:37.701 --> 02:09:37.701
<v Speaker 1>molesting dozens of kids.</v>

2408
02:09:37.701 --> 02:09:37.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're criminAls.</v>

2409
02:09:37.701 --> 02:09:42.621
<v Speaker 1>These horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible criminals and somehow or </v>

2410
02:09:42.621 --> 02:09:44.631
<v Speaker 1>another we tolerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a weird aspect of our modern</v>

2411
02:09:45.331 --> 02:09:48.060
<v Speaker 1>culture and give them tax rate.</v>

2416

<v Speaker 1>That was a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy and a beautiful human </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just a really loving.</v>

2418
02:10:05.670 --> 02:10:10.670
<v Speaker 1>He was so funny we had on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime I'd say anything negative about </v>

2419
02:10:10.670 --> 02:10:10.670
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>

2421
02:10:11.340 --> 02:10:15.900
<v Speaker 1>He would always find the positive loving</v>
<v Speaker 1>side and not criticizing anyone.</v>

2422
02:10:15.901 --> 02:10:18.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a joke and I'm a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2423
02:10:18.301 --> 02:10:22.440

<v Speaker 1>we spent a lot of time on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about sex and it sadly to </v>

2428
02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:33.840
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:39.430
<v Speaker 6>and so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's so beautiful and I'm thinking </v>

2431
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:39.680
<v Speaker 6>stanley stanley things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everyone's beautiful.</v>

2432
02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:43.290
<v Speaker 6>It's a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2433
02:10:43.291 --> 02:10:44.870
<v Speaker 6>you take in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2434
02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:49.900
<v Speaker 6>beautiful in spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but alex great is a wonderful artist,</v>

2435
02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:53.240
<v Speaker 6>but one of the reasons he's such a </v>
<v Speaker 6>wonderful artist,</v>

2436
02:10:53.490 --> 02:10:58.490
<v Speaker 6>he does take a very positive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>optimistic view of people and of life </v>

2437
02:11:00.111 --> 02:11:05.111
<v Speaker 6>and that shows up in his art and I think</v>
<v Speaker 6>his art is spiritual.</v>

2438
02:11:05.450 --> 02:11:07.370
<v Speaker 6>It's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he's,</v>

2439
02:11:07.790 --> 02:11:12.790
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>historically very important and I've </v>

2440
02:11:12.790 --> 02:11:15.320
<v Speaker 6>been impressed with his art from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>beginning and his wife,</v>

2441
02:11:15.321 --> 02:11:18.030
<v Speaker 6>his wife is equally talented.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those wonderful work.</v>

2442
02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:18.830
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

2443
02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:21.740
<v Speaker 3>she was with him when he came in into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the podcast.</v>

2444
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:25.460
<v Speaker 3>He's a true visionary artists in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense that he,</v>

2445
02:11:25.461 --> 02:11:30.461
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he has the most accurate </v>

2446
02:11:30.461 --> 02:11:31.910
<v Speaker 3>representations of the tryptamine world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in painted form.</v>

2447
02:11:32.090 --> 02:11:33.590
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I look at his paintings,</v>

2448
02:11:33.591 --> 02:11:37.310
<v Speaker 3>I see like tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see like there's one of 'em,</v>

2449
02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:40.580
<v Speaker 3>it's a gold one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like to faroe heads,</v>

2450
02:11:40.581 --> 02:11:42.860
<v Speaker 3>like there are facing in opposite </v>
<v Speaker 3>directions.</v>

2451
02:11:42.861 --> 02:11:47.861
<v Speaker 3>Like I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like something that you would </v>

2452
02:11:47.861 --> 02:11:48.490
<v Speaker 3>see if you were a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were on dmt painting,</v>

2453
02:11:49.010 --> 02:11:50.550
<v Speaker 3>brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant artist.</v>

2454
02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:56.200
<v Speaker 3>He is actually achieved a tax exempt </v>
<v Speaker 3>status because this chapel,</v>

2455
02:11:58.450 --> 02:11:59.810
<v Speaker 3>the sacred mirrors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

2456
02:11:59.811 --> 02:12:04.811
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his religion is actually being </v>

2457
02:12:04.811 --> 02:12:04.811
<v Speaker 3>recognized as a true religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2458
02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:09.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting because he's in </v>

2459
02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:09.940
<v Speaker 3>sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like locally,</v>

2460
02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:14.351
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to recognize it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they want the tax money from him </v>

2461
02:12:14.351 --> 02:12:14.351
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well listen though,</v>

2462
02:12:14.351 --> 02:12:18.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm a religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I am tax exempt and if the </v>

2463
02:12:18.510 --> 02:12:19.690
<v Speaker 3>methodists are tax exempt and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>catholics at tasks,</v>

2464
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:21.350
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not the chapel,</v>

2465
02:12:21.351 --> 02:12:22.010
<v Speaker 3>the sacred marriage.</v>

2466
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:27.310
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like sort of duking it out with </v>

2467
02:12:27.310 --> 02:12:28.160
<v Speaker 3>these people in his area because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

2468
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:31.490
<v Speaker 3>they want the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to capture that in brooklyn.</v>

2469
02:12:31.730 --> 02:12:32.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he um,</v>

2470
02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:39.220
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was in manhattan for awhile and then </v>

2471
02:12:39.220 --> 02:12:39.220
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2472
02:12:39.220 --> 02:12:42.910
<v Speaker 3>he moved his place to upstate New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's constructing this incredible </v>

2473
02:12:42.910 --> 02:12:47.591
<v Speaker 3>compound where the balls and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>building of it are all his art,</v>

2474
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:53.350
<v Speaker 3>like his fractal sort of geometric </v>
<v Speaker 3>artwork is going to be what the entire </v>

2475
02:12:55.461 --> 02:12:58.660
<v Speaker 3>outside of the building looks like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He showed us some of the plans and it's,</v>

2476
02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:01.100
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing some of his art right </v>

<v Speaker 3>and in my opinion,</v>

2479
02:13:05.210 --> 02:13:10.210
<v Speaker 3>the most accurate in terms of capturing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2480
02:13:10.290 --> 02:13:15.290
<v Speaker 3>that those visionary experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those house and hallucinogen based </v>

2481
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:17.300
<v Speaker 3>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the most accurate in doing that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and talk to you.</v>

2516
02:14:40.671 --> 02:14:42.000
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I learned a lot from our discussion.</v>

2517
02:14:42.001 --> 02:14:43.050
<v Speaker 5>I learned a lot from you.</v>

2518
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything you'd like to say to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the young folks out there,</v>

2519
02:14:46.031 --> 02:14:49.810
<v Speaker 1>the people that are in charge of moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing to the next era,</v>

2520
02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:50.910
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

2521
02:14:50.911 --> 02:14:53.650
<v Speaker 1>You're getting to talk to more than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people right now.</v>

2522
02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:54.190
<v Speaker 1>What would you say that.</v>

2523
02:14:54.330 --> 02:14:56.660
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've been talking a lot about about,</v>

2524
02:14:57.030 --> 02:15:02.030
<v Speaker 5>about psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'd like to remind people that </v>

2525
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:04.920
<v Speaker 5>that's only one way to gain wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not necessary.</v>

2526
02:15:05.370 --> 02:15:10.370
<v Speaker 5>You can do just about the same thing by </v>
<v Speaker 5>immersing yourself in nature,</v>

2527
02:15:11.370 --> 02:15:14.370
<v Speaker 5>by having a loving relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody,</v>

2528
02:15:14.850 --> 02:15:19.110
<v Speaker 5>by meditating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by praying,</v>

2529
02:15:19.380 --> 02:15:22.260
<v Speaker 5>by immersing yourself in great </v>
<v Speaker 5>literature and great art.</v>

2530
02:15:22.710 --> 02:15:26.610
<v Speaker 5>Psychedelics are important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were important in human evolution,</v>

2531
02:15:27.030 --> 02:15:32.030
<v Speaker 5>but there's no one way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no one road that's best for </v>

2532
02:15:32.220 --> 02:15:32.850
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>

2533
02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation,</v>

2534
02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:38.740
<v Speaker 1>transcendental meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory deprivation tank use.</v>

2535
02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:43.780
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different methods to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of reset yourself and get an </v>

2536
02:15:43.780 --> 02:15:48.261
<v Speaker 1>objective look at the surroundings where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not caught up in the momentum of </v>

2537
02:15:48.261 --> 02:15:48.261
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

2538
02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:53.320
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The important thing is to do this with </v>

2539
02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:53.320
<v Speaker 5>intentionality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to know where you're going in,</v>

2540
02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:55.190
<v Speaker 5>to do it in a disciplined way and learn </v>
<v Speaker 5>something from it,</v>

2541
02:15:55.490 --> 02:16:00.490
<v Speaker 1>and one of the coolest things about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is that we get to meet and talk to </v>

2542
02:16:02.841 --> 02:16:07.841
<v Speaker 1>people that have lived longer and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>have had more experiences and it's </v>

2543
02:16:07.841 --> 02:16:12.161
<v Speaker 1>beautiful that a person like you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to share those experiences and </v>

2544
02:16:12.161 --> 02:16:15.191
<v Speaker 1>come on a show like this and express </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and give us the wisdom of your </v>

2545
02:16:15.590 --> 02:16:17.600
<v Speaker 1>years and give us the insight of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

<v Speaker 1>your contemplations on this world.</v>
