<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have headphones.</v>

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.843
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Alex Niles Gray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How are you guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great job.</v>

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.920
<v Speaker 1>I think you got to turn that sucker</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and see that one.</v>

6
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Joey Diaz.</v>

8
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.570
<v Speaker 1>And when Joey Diaz couldn't figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the headphones.</v>

9
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Welcome folks was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are in the middle of building ncn.</v>

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.570
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard the rumor,</v>

11
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.810
<v Speaker 2>the thing that you got us kicked off on</v>
<v Speaker 2>really the last time that we spoke to</v>

12
00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were doing a kickstarter campaign to</v>

13
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 2>build Antionne and it was like three</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago and we're in the middle of</v>

14
00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:55.121
<v Speaker 2>another one because we started building</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and we need a little more money to</v>

15
00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 2>finish the interior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we've got a three story,</v>

16
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:04.541
<v Speaker 2>12,000 square foot building with a new</v>
<v Speaker 2>roof and incredible spaces to exhibit</v>

17
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.850
<v Speaker 2>visionary art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

18
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.170
<v Speaker 2>it's there and I guess it's just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter of time,</v>

19
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about finishing it and more money</v>

20
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.800
<v Speaker 2>weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quicker we'll be able to finish it.</v>

21
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Are there images of it right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>currently in,</v>

22
00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:23.660
<v Speaker 1>in construction that people can view?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh look at that,</v>

23
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Jim said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

24
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:28.040
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did you get that?</v>

25
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Looks like really old brick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

26
00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Looking brick 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 two was built in.</v>

27
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:36.290
<v Speaker 1>It said we were saving the carriage</v>
<v Speaker 1>house from 1882.</v>

28
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.030
<v Speaker 1>So explain the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it started out as a carriage house.</v>

29
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you save part of it?</v>

30
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we surrounded it.</v>

31
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.671
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

32
00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:50.950
<v Speaker 1>so we surrounded it with art side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The building low.</v>

33
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scroll back up.</v>

34
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't go anywhere.</v>

35
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Get back up to the top one that you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

36
00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:56.450
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

37
00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:59.200
<v Speaker 1>That's just one room on the third floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the sake.</v>

38
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to be three floors.</v>

39
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to put criss cross kind of</v>

40
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 2>scaffold a lattice across the angels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

41
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On my instagram,</v>

42
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 2>I suppose there's a more recent feed of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interior now.</v>

43
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 2>We've gone a couple of the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>angels.</v>

44
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 2>They were 10 angels in the previous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

45
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 2>chapel installation there in New York</v>
<v Speaker 2>City.</v>

46
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 2>And I always wanted to,</v>

47
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.920
<v Speaker 1>he went to the wrong Alex Grey went to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some way.</v>

48
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

49
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.180
<v Speaker 2>that's relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

50
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.310
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It as well.</v>

51
00:02:39.311 --> 00:02:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's the space,</v>

52
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.790
<v Speaker 2>there's one of the angels over there</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a uh,</v>

53
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this,</v>

54
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 2>this is the plan to corner one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>angels or the four corners that,</v>

55
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the direction of the building that we're</v>

56
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:04.801
<v Speaker 2>kind of recycling the carriage house has</v>
<v Speaker 2>the corners of the buildings pointing in</v>

57
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 2>the cardinal directions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought that a feature of them</v>

58
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 2>there will be angels or the North South,</v>
<v Speaker 2>east,</v>

59
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 2>west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of the whole thing is getting</v>

60
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 2>the four quadrants together on top of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the building.</v>

61
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 2>There's a steeple head that is basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>a four faced being that,</v>

62
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 2>that is the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the four directions coming together.</v>

63
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Envisionary oneness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's as a building,</v>

64
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a big basically godhead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

65
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 1>is that a real image of the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the building with the angel</v>

66
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:39.300
<v Speaker 1>on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

67
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.133
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>

68
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the computer a model that was</v>

69
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:50.101
<v Speaker 2>made by one of the Disney animators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ryan toddle.</v>

70
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 2>He's a guy that is responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>running the,</v>

71
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the digital animation teams that</v>

72
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:03.121
<v Speaker 2>did Zootopia and frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's an amazing a modeler.</v>

73
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.653
<v Speaker 2>Go back to that.</v>

74
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Look at this outside of this building</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be the coolest looking</v>

75
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 1>building on the planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go up a little,</v>

76
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.400
<v Speaker 2>but you'll see a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the coolest things about the</v>

77
00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 2>video that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

78
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 2>is in there is that it shows that kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of spin around of the building itself</v>

79
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.340
<v Speaker 2>that was done by these amazing nurse</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's from the front.</v>

80
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.200
<v Speaker 2>So you've got a kind of evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing going on on the side.</v>

81
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it gets to the,</v>

82
00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:36.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the front door,</v>

83
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 2>which is Adam and eve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

84
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.710
<v Speaker 2>creating a better world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it kind of brings together those</v>

85
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.770
<v Speaker 2>mythologies of those narratives of</v>
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>

86
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you zoom in on the Adam and eve?</v>

87
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a zoom as it is guys?</v>

88
00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Is that a caduceus in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

89
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Not See,</v>

90
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.660
<v Speaker 2>actually down below a way down below.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

91
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

92
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.890
<v Speaker 2>there you get to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

93
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.290
<v Speaker 1>So you really did the caduceus and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of replicated the DNA,</v>

94
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of people believe was what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the caduceus was based on the first</v>

95
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

96
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.630
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all growing out of some mushrooms</v>

97
00:05:17.631 --> 00:05:21.200
<v Speaker 1>there at the base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex did the drawing and then it was</v>

98
00:05:21.201 --> 00:05:24.680
<v Speaker 1>sculpted in teak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

99
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Full size four by eight foot doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two of them.</v>

100
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.780
<v Speaker 1>And then we had it scanned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got a grant to have it scanned and</v>

101
00:05:32.781 --> 00:05:36.560
<v Speaker 1>then it'll be on the door in metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it will be cast in metal.</v>

102
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.700
<v Speaker 1>The originals will be on view inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're made of teak</v>

103
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.730
<v Speaker 1>friendships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's what kind of metals are going to</v>

104
00:05:43.731 --> 00:05:47.120
<v Speaker 1>be cast in bronze site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

105
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.760
<v Speaker 1>That is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

106
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.990
<v Speaker 1>And so what is going on with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution thing?</v>

107
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>So the evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the lower hominids they become</v>

108
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 2>homo erectus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what does that child like thing</v>

109
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 2>with arms up in the air?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

110
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to add,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks for noticing that.</v>

111
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the end of this paint brush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of flying up and</v>

112
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.010
<v Speaker 2>indicating a kind of upward trajectory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a drip coming off of it and that</v>

113
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 2>drip also act like an eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The center of the eyeball is the earth.</v>

114
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a skeleton,</v>

115
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.090
<v Speaker 2>a child and the person who is fully</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground woman and man on either side and</v>

116
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 2>they each are reaching for the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that question is,</v>

117
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 2>who's going to get the ball?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically the skeleton or the human?</v>

118
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a will that,</v>

119
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 2>will we be handing this to the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>generation or are we just going to blow</v>

120
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the skeleton sorta represents death</v>

121
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 2>yet represents the end of the line for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human species,</v>

122
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.370
<v Speaker 2>for anybody is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't even introduce your page.</v>

123
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 2>The instagram page is what does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it Alex?</v>

124
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Column C O s m [inaudible].</v>

125
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.690
<v Speaker 2>This is a build [inaudible] dot com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the,</v>

126
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm a kickstarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then how long has it been going on for</v>

127
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say about 20 days</v>

128
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.290
<v Speaker 3>were there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a 40 day campaign.</v>

129
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.810
<v Speaker 3>We're about three times where we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>less.</v>

130
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.960
<v Speaker 3>We did this a campaign the same length,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same days,</v>

131
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.040
<v Speaker 3>three years ago in 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're three times ahead of where we</v>

132
00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wait,</v>

133
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.930
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually,</v>

134
00:07:34.931 --> 00:07:39.820
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we did 160 percent of our goal the</v>

135
00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:41.050
<v Speaker 3>last time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're,</v>

136
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.370
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

137
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.980
<v Speaker 3>we're challenging ourselves to even</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher.</v>

138
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.120
<v Speaker 2>What I meant was how long has it been</v>
<v Speaker 2>under construction?</v>

139
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.800
<v Speaker 2>How long it's been since September of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty</v>

140
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.830
<v Speaker 2>15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

141
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

142
00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.090
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an obit.</v>

143
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what is the ultimate end date where</v>

144
00:08:02.881 --> 00:08:05.730
<v Speaker 2>you believe this all be constructed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

145
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.680
<v Speaker 2>it really depends on the money that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>raised to do the exterior.</v>

146
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 2>The interior we're going to have done by</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 and we're aiming at the winter of</v>

147
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.350
<v Speaker 2>2017.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be doable,</v>

148
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's telling us</v>

149
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.960
<v Speaker 3>this is the interior will open the</v>
<v Speaker 3>exhibition and then we'll see,</v>

150
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:29.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows.</v>

151
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:31.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's indications that,</v>

152
00:08:31.391 --> 00:08:33.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you don't know how much money's</v>

153
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.070
<v Speaker 3>going to come in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This campaign is only to finish the</v>

154
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:39.130
<v Speaker 3>exhibition interiorly and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

155
00:08:39.131 --> 00:08:42.100
<v Speaker 3>if we still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think we will need to raise</v>

156
00:08:42.101 --> 00:08:47.101
<v Speaker 3>another at one point $5,000,000 to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sculpture or exterior,</v>

157
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:52.410
<v Speaker 3>which is done by a three d print out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a three d print out 20 feet high by</v>

158
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.760
<v Speaker 3>eight by eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is the substance?</v>

159
00:08:56.761 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 3>It's manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

160
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 3>it'll be finished in a glass reinforced</v>
<v Speaker 3>cast concrete,</v>

161
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:06.150
<v Speaker 3>but you print out the foam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you make the mold,</v>

162
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 3>you make a fiberglass mold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's about a couple of dozen molds</v>

163
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.700
<v Speaker 3>that will be needed to do the sculptures</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a place right across the</v>

164
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 3>river from us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirty minutes away that does this.</v>

165
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 3>So that's convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

166
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 3>We were thinking coming to California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are places that do it out here,</v>

167
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we found a place so close and they're</v>

168
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.880
<v Speaker 3>doing the Brooklyn Academy of Music and</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the big buildings in the city.</v>

169
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.590
<v Speaker 4>Has anybody done anything even remotely</v>

170
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.460
<v Speaker 3>like this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

171
00:09:34.461 --> 00:09:39.461
<v Speaker 3>you'll see theme parks where things are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the glass reinforced cast concrete</v>

172
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.830
<v Speaker 3>will make it enduring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

173
00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:45.230
<v Speaker 3>like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be if they don't knock it down</v>

174
00:09:45.231 --> 00:09:48.560
<v Speaker 3>with a wrecking ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be there in a thousand years.</v>

175
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.220
<v Speaker 3>That's the building itself is a tomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

176
00:09:52.221 --> 00:09:52.740
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

177
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.030
<v Speaker 3>it's made to be a enduring.</v>

178
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.920
<v Speaker 4>That's our mission.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the mission is to have this thing</v>

179
00:09:59.921 --> 00:10:03.190
<v Speaker 4>survive you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The mission is to build an enduring</v>

180
00:10:03.191 --> 00:10:06.400
<v Speaker 4>sanctuary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>visionary art,</v>

181
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.490
<v Speaker 4>to uplift a global community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's our actual mission.</v>

182
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.940
<v Speaker 4>Do you guys have a caretaker when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>pass?</v>

183
00:10:12.941 --> 00:10:15.820
<v Speaker 4>Have you already thought of like when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you move on to the next dimension,</v>

184
00:10:15.821 --> 00:10:18.310
<v Speaker 4>who's going to take over this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a church</v>

185
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 3>is that it became a church in 2008 and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the church churches generally a run</v>

186
00:10:25.001 --> 00:10:29.020
<v Speaker 3>by the it's board and the staff that</v>
<v Speaker 3>works there,</v>

187
00:10:29.021 --> 00:10:31.150
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the board of directors are the people</v>

188
00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:34.960
<v Speaker 3>that owned the church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We actually lived there,</v>

189
00:10:34.961 --> 00:10:38.560
<v Speaker 3>but our house that we built there will</v>
<v Speaker 3>be long to the church.</v>

190
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.450
<v Speaker 3>Everything we're doing there will belong</v>
<v Speaker 3>to them.</v>

191
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:45.010
<v Speaker 4>It's a 40 acre compound basically in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hudson valley seed.</v>

192
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.400
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

193
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.090
<v Speaker 4>that's where it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's 21 people working there now.</v>

194
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.600
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I trust you guys with a church.</v>

195
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.260
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't trust a whole lot of people.</v>

196
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.810
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

197
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.400
<v Speaker 4>they're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to get crazy.</v>

198
00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:02.750
<v Speaker 4>But what I would worry about if I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>establishing a church is not me.</v>

199
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:07.990
<v Speaker 4>I would worry about what people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to distort the message afterwards.</v>

200
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's always the real issue.</v>

201
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.610
<v Speaker 4>The real issue is whenever you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that you're going to call a</v>

202
00:11:13.611 --> 00:11:18.380
<v Speaker 4>church or religion or have a sacred area</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you take it very,</v>

203
00:11:18.381 --> 00:11:21.500
<v Speaker 4>very seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have at least one person</v>

204
00:11:21.501 --> 00:11:26.060
<v Speaker 4>who has an elevated</v>
<v Speaker 4>profile.</v>

205
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:31.010
<v Speaker 4>You know there's going to be one person</v>
<v Speaker 4>or people who run this thing that other</v>

206
00:11:31.011 --> 00:11:33.980
<v Speaker 4>people are going to look at like they</v>
<v Speaker 4>are different than us.</v>

207
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.350
<v Speaker 4>They are elevated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are the people that are in charge</v>

208
00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:38.720
<v Speaker 4>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when people have that feeling that</v>

209
00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:40.820
<v Speaker 4>they feel like they're the elevated one</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>

210
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:42.860
<v Speaker 4>that gets tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so slippery.</v>

211
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.120
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard for people to manage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's one of the ways that we try to</v>

212
00:11:47.121 --> 00:11:50.240
<v Speaker 4>avoid it because we never claimed to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightened ourselves.</v>

213
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.590
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're aren't as well.</v>

214
00:11:51.591 --> 00:11:52.424
<v Speaker 4>I trust you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

215
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.363
<v Speaker 4>Where</v>

216
00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:58.210
<v Speaker 2>we're creative artists and like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>artists,</v>

217
00:11:58.211 --> 00:12:03.211
<v Speaker 2>we feel like when we're really doing our</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that there's a spiritual element</v>

218
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:08.200
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that your creativity and spirituality</v>

219
00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 2>somehow seem like they're very strongly</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected.</v>

220
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 2>There isn't any mythology about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

221
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:19.230
<v Speaker 2>if we're basically emanations of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmos that's creative than we're little</v>

222
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.240
<v Speaker 2>embodiments of creative energy and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative energy can be used for the</v>

223
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:33.331
<v Speaker 2>positive or the negative in how you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it comes from the way that you view</v>

224
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.800
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you're going to take that.</v>

225
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.460
<v Speaker 2>And so as an emanation of creative</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy and artists is just a,</v>

226
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an obvious symbol of that.</v>

227
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we see that throughout history that</v>

228
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.670
<v Speaker 2>all the religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they agreed or disagreed,</v>

229
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.330
<v Speaker 2>all used creative expression to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>their message out.</v>

230
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:03.850
<v Speaker 2>And so it's one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>unites all the different wisdom</v>

231
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:08.350
<v Speaker 2>traditions and unites a lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that's out that would consider</v>

232
00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 2>itself outside of religion as well.</v>

233
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.200
<v Speaker 2>I feel that creativity itself is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>original kind of religious impulse that</v>

234
00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:24.370
<v Speaker 2>it's the way of knowing oneself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way of knowing God.</v>

235
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a means of worship.</v>

236
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look at the,</v>

237
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.470
<v Speaker 2>the cave art and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

238
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:36.570
<v Speaker 2>they weren't talking about sex or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something or disagreeing necessarily as</v>

239
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.720
<v Speaker 2>religious kind of ideas and things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

240
00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:45.721
<v Speaker 2>They were making a mark of meaning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>left behind something that was</v>

241
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:51.541
<v Speaker 2>meaningful to their tribe and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's still what we're trying to</v>

242
00:13:52.301 --> 00:13:53.910
<v Speaker 2>do and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

243
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I think religion because it scares the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit out of really intelligent people</v>

244
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:05.610
<v Speaker 2>for good reason because it's such a mess</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world and created such a mess and</v>

245
00:14:08.261 --> 00:14:11.530
<v Speaker 2>so much divisiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that's supposed to be about</v>

246
00:14:11.531 --> 00:14:16.531
<v Speaker 2>love that's caused so much heartache and</v>
<v Speaker 2>damage and so,</v>

247
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:23.500
<v Speaker 2>and what I think is that when I told my</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend Robert Jesse,</v>

248
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm from the council on spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 2>practices.</v>

249
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm spiritual,</v>

250
00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:31.900
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not religious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

251
00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:34.990
<v Speaker 2>you saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Alex,</v>

252
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.370
<v Speaker 2>we can't let the fundamentalists own the</v>
<v Speaker 2>word religion.</v>

253
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Russians too important a word and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need are courageous experiments in</v>

254
00:14:48.161 --> 00:14:53.161
<v Speaker 2>religion that could help us to get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

255
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.890
<v Speaker 2>other side of the bell curve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evolutionary edge.</v>

256
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Is there an evolving edge for religion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could we get posts secular in the world?</v>

257
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:05.720
<v Speaker 2>Can we imagine a world where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

258
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Most of the people of the world have</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken a sacrament of one kind or another</v>

259
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.840
<v Speaker 2>and have realized that there's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite intelligence at the basis of</v>

260
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:21.180
<v Speaker 2>the cosmos that they are a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

261
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:26.300
<v Speaker 2>an expression of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that ended life is a divine,</v>

262
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>display spectacle,</v>

263
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

264
00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.110
<v Speaker 2>that God's gone to a lot of trouble to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create.</v>

265
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.633
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

266
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

267
00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:45.290
<v Speaker 2>from the perspective of today what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

268
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.330
<v Speaker 2>because toynbee when he was writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>about civilizations,</v>

269
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.770
<v Speaker 2>talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

270
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.130
<v Speaker 2>every civilization needs a spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 2>core.</v>

271
00:15:56.030 --> 00:16:00.830
<v Speaker 2>And as it planetary civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't have one religion dominate.</v>

272
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.530
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not.</v>

273
00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:05.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not possible.</v>

274
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:11.090
<v Speaker 2>And so how do you unite a world</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritually?</v>

275
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my candidate is create the creative</v>

276
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:17.710
<v Speaker 2>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

277
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:22.720
<v Speaker 2>that all of world cultures have some</v>
<v Speaker 2>means of creative expression.</v>

278
00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:26.960
<v Speaker 2>We get to know that culture through</v>
<v Speaker 2>their music,</v>

279
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.420
<v Speaker 2>through their know painting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sculpture,</v>

280
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.990
<v Speaker 2>various kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that how we,</v>

281
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to know each other and see our</v>

282
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:40.040
<v Speaker 2>connections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

283
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.790
<v Speaker 2>and so as a potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

284
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.460
<v Speaker 2>something that's been used by all world</v>
<v Speaker 2>religions,</v>

285
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in something that has a defacto for the</v>

286
00:16:50.331 --> 00:16:55.331
<v Speaker 2>people who don't believe in God anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of them still believe that artists</v>

287
00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:59.090
<v Speaker 2>are trying to do something authentic and</v>
<v Speaker 2>truthful to their,</v>

288
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.760
<v Speaker 2>to their inner being.</v>

289
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.120
<v Speaker 4>Isn't the word religion fairly loaded</v>
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>

290
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.010
<v Speaker 4>and what isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's important?</v>

291
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.290
<v Speaker 4>The idea behind what you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

292
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.300
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea is that you're trying to make</v>

293
00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:13.820
<v Speaker 4>this sacred place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to make this amazing place</v>

294
00:17:13.821 --> 00:17:17.420
<v Speaker 4>where people can go and see expression</v>
<v Speaker 4>and see,</v>

295
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the purity of your creative vision.</v>

296
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:21.020
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>

297
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.210
<v Speaker 4>why connect that to a loaded word?</v>

298
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as Jesse said in my book,</v>

299
00:17:29.261 --> 00:17:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too easy</v>

300
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:37.240
<v Speaker 2>to run away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

301
00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

302
00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how a bad neighborhood gets,</v>

303
00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just like,</v>

304
00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.190
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only criminal.</v>

305
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:52.350
<v Speaker 2>So live here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some artists show up,</v>

306
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they start having their studios and</v>

307
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.690
<v Speaker 2>various things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sooner or later,</v>

308
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.320
<v Speaker 2>a really beat up neighborhood will start</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have some vitality because creative</v>

309
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:11.970
<v Speaker 2>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative energy starts to infiltrate</v>

310
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:16.920
<v Speaker 2>into destructive energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is if the artists would</v>

311
00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 2>move back into the world of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might clean up the neighborhood a</v>

312
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:22.380
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

313
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:27.500
<v Speaker 2>and make it a more habitable for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to want to look at their relationship</v>

314
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.960
<v Speaker 2>with spirit through even the lens of</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

315
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.270
<v Speaker 2>But why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why religion though?</v>

316
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.970
<v Speaker 2>Because religion is associated in most</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's minds,</v>

317
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.810
<v Speaker 2>the deities realia religions associated</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people's minds with aiden and</v>

318
00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:45.690
<v Speaker 2>traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient traditions that oftentimes</v>

319
00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:48.690
<v Speaker 2>stifle your behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you what to do,</v>

320
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:53.750
<v Speaker 2>control you and offer horrendous</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences for not complying.</v>

321
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.510
<v Speaker 2>That's what a lot of people think of</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they think of the word religion.</v>

322
00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.380
<v Speaker 2>So here's this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you hope,</v>

323
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.640
<v Speaker 2>but let me get to this real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have this thing,</v>

324
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:05.490
<v Speaker 2>this beautiful thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why even put a name to it?</v>

325
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why label it?</v>

326
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.840
<v Speaker 2>And when you're labeling it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're connecting it with all these</v>

327
00:19:09.841 --> 00:19:13.470
<v Speaker 2>other religions that are so problematic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to have to explain your</v>

328
00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:16.770
<v Speaker 2>way out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do that instead of just have this</v>

329
00:19:16.771 --> 00:19:20.040
<v Speaker 2>amazing center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

330
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:25.490
<v Speaker 2>because I feel that we're a maintenance</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead connected with whatever that</v>

331
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:28.980
<v Speaker 2>religious impulse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at the,</v>

332
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:34.460
<v Speaker 2>what is the primary religious experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a mystical experience</v>

333
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:42.380
<v Speaker 2>regularly geo to reconnect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to connect up,</v>

334
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.600
<v Speaker 2>to link back because that was the word</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

335
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:49.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to really link to reconnect to what the</v>

336
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:53.880
<v Speaker 2>self to God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Self and God so that that's the</v>

337
00:19:53.881 --> 00:19:55.080
<v Speaker 2>actual origin of the word.</v>

338
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Religion says it a Latin word and</v>

339
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.050
<v Speaker 2>French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>French and it's to reconnect.</v>

340
00:20:01.051 --> 00:20:04.710
<v Speaker 2>So the idea being that the religion or</v>
<v Speaker 2>these churches were set up so that</v>

341
00:20:04.711 --> 00:20:07.350
<v Speaker 2>people could reconnect with God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they go about their day.</v>

342
00:20:07.351 --> 00:20:11.160
<v Speaker 2>They were filled with troubles and</v>
<v Speaker 2>strife and all sorts of stress and they</v>

343
00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:14.610
<v Speaker 2>can go back to the church and they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>reconnect with God through religion,</v>

344
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:19.720
<v Speaker 2>through if you go to Egypt or you go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

345
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:25.150
<v Speaker 2>You just came back from Venice and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to some of these religious cathedrals</v>

346
00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:30.180
<v Speaker 2>that are a thousand years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to these pilgrimage places and</v>

347
00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:35.181
<v Speaker 2>there is tremendous power because a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people invested a lot of love and</v>

348
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:42.350
<v Speaker 2>energy into a center and they built a</v>
<v Speaker 2>shrine to whatever they believed that</v>

349
00:20:44.521 --> 00:20:49.521
<v Speaker 2>spirit to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is part of a long tradition of</v>

350
00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:51.840
<v Speaker 2>a connectedness with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

351
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:56.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their lens into the infinite.</v>

352
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Whatever religion you're looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

353
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.400
<v Speaker 2>iconic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an iconic,</v>

354
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.380
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a hell of lot of trouble when</v>

355
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:08.200
<v Speaker 2>you get to the secondary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

356
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.390
<v Speaker 2>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

357
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

358
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.820
<v Speaker 2>which is everything else that you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about religion,</v>

359
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:20.260
<v Speaker 2>the primary religious experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every religion started with a mystical</v>

360
00:21:20.261 --> 00:21:25.261
<v Speaker 2>experience and people are having those</v>
<v Speaker 2>on acid every day now,</v>

361
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.380
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what he,</v>

362
00:21:29.381 --> 00:21:33.460
<v Speaker 2>a disconnect from that whole tradition</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people were connecting to the</v>

363
00:21:33.461 --> 00:21:36.760
<v Speaker 2>infinite before and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has nothing to do with that,</v>

364
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or do you say,</v>

365
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.110
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religions fucked up.</v>

366
00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:45.580
<v Speaker 2>But what if we reimagine it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if we reimagined God,</v>

367
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and can't,</v>

368
00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 2>can't we do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And say,</v>

369
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.920
<v Speaker 2>this has a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot going for it.</v>

370
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:57.940
<v Speaker 2>This quest for the infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute mystery.</v>

371
00:21:57.941 --> 00:22:01.330
<v Speaker 2>That's at the core of our being and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>core of the cosmos.</v>

372
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.440
<v Speaker 2>This quest to know that it leads to</v>
<v Speaker 2>science that leads aren't.</v>

373
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.130
<v Speaker 2>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the quest to know the truth about</v>

374
00:22:09.131 --> 00:22:14.131
<v Speaker 2>the nature of reality and so that quest</v>
<v Speaker 2>is another reason why I think that if</v>

375
00:22:17.201 --> 00:22:20.860
<v Speaker 2>you harness that to creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just artists,</v>

376
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.520
<v Speaker 2>artists hate dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

377
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:29.730
<v Speaker 2>you can't have a dogmatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean our artists always disagree and</v>

378
00:22:31.361 --> 00:22:33.640
<v Speaker 2>you're always going to have new vantage</v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

379
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.990
<v Speaker 2>You're always gonna have one evolving a</v>
<v Speaker 2>point of view.</v>

380
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.320
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the trouble of religion</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they get,</v>

381
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the right way and it's only like</v>

382
00:22:44.231 --> 00:22:46.730
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to look beyond our</v>

383
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.120
<v Speaker 2>boundaries of what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

384
00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:53.740
<v Speaker 2>people made up long ago as the way it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be in another century when</v>

385
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't know any of the stuff that we</v>

386
00:22:56.651 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 2>know now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that does make sense.</v>

387
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.640
<v Speaker 2>So any good religion ought to their view</v>
<v Speaker 2>of reality,</v>

388
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.420
<v Speaker 2>at least science ought to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>incorporated into it.</v>

389
00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.010
<v Speaker 2>So you couldn't have a truthful religion</v>
<v Speaker 2>without science.</v>

390
00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Are you planning on writing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>out like the tenants of this religion,</v>

391
00:23:17.271 --> 00:23:20.990
<v Speaker 1>the ethics of this religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually have liturgy.</v>

392
00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:26.020
<v Speaker 1>In order to become a church you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>submit liturgy to the irs and the state</v>

393
00:23:26.661 --> 00:23:31.661
<v Speaker 1>attorney general and then we had to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm familiar with what's our word,</v>

394
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:33.530
<v Speaker 1>liturgy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liturgy,</v>

395
00:23:33.531 --> 00:23:34.850
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a document,</v>

396
00:23:34.851 --> 00:23:35.661
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

397
00:23:35.661 --> 00:23:38.290
<v Speaker 1>like stuff that you use on a regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis in,</v>

398
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:42.620
<v Speaker 1>in your ceremonies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have that in order to be</v>

399
00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 1>recognized for it don't have to do,</v>

400
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:50.490
<v Speaker 3>but it's part of the irs a requirement</v>
<v Speaker 3>and estate attorney.</v>

401
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.000
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a liturgy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Liturgy?</v>

402
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.140
<v Speaker 3>You can say no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

403
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:58.580
<v Speaker 3>you probably could probably apply and</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you know,</v>

404
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:03.800
<v Speaker 3>it's all in your head relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a guy has to look over what</v>

405
00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:07.280
<v Speaker 3>you're doing and really question it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if you've thought it out and stuff</v>

406
00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:09.350
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex published art psalms,</v>

407
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:14.320
<v Speaker 3>which was a poetry book and you've seen</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was really submitted.</v>

408
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.510
<v Speaker 3>That was submitted as our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as cosmic liturgy.</v>

409
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.120
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

410
00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.310
<v Speaker 3>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's work is really fascinating is the</v>

411
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:27.311
<v Speaker 3>tax exempt status of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Religion is so odd in that way,</v>

412
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:32.120
<v Speaker 3>that worshiping and being in a place</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you worship,</v>

413
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:34.820
<v Speaker 3>even if it's very clear that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of profit being made,</v>

414
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.980
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to pay taxes on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to tell you this little,</v>

415
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.470
<v Speaker 3>just a touch of the history of why we</v>
<v Speaker 3>became a church because it wasn't really</v>

416
00:24:42.471 --> 00:24:46.760
<v Speaker 3>ever our intention to become a church</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the way from the beginning when we</v>

417
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.670
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>85 and we visioned the temple</v>

418
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:54.260
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex and I on our first Mtma a journey</v>

419
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.080
<v Speaker 3>lying on the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We both came out of it having vision.</v>

420
00:24:57.081 --> 00:25:01.730
<v Speaker 3>This circular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a building in 1985.</v>

421
00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:06.790
<v Speaker 3>We had recently moved to New York</v>
<v Speaker 3>together doing mdm back in 1985.</v>

422
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:15.530
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we both saw this temple and we knew</v>

423
00:25:15.531 --> 00:25:18.170
<v Speaker 3>that this was sort of like our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our joint mission.</v>

424
00:25:18.171 --> 00:25:20.030
<v Speaker 3>This was the thing we were going to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

425
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.250
<v Speaker 3>You know Alex always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We met in art school,</v>

426
00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:25.880
<v Speaker 3>so Alex always had his art and I had my</v>
<v Speaker 3>art and we shared a studio,</v>

427
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.340
<v Speaker 3>but this was something we were going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do together.</v>

428
00:25:28.341 --> 00:25:32.820
<v Speaker 3>So we never thought we would become a</v>
<v Speaker 3>church to know,</v>

429
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:36.680
<v Speaker 3>but here we were building the sacred</v>
<v Speaker 3>site and then all through our life</v>

430
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.790
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

431
00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.910
<v Speaker 3>we uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started visiting sacred sites like we</v>

432
00:25:40.911 --> 00:25:45.390
<v Speaker 3>just came from St Mark's and Venice and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we see sharp cathedral and you know,</v>

433
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.250
<v Speaker 3>we go there with groups of people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

434
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:50.010
<v Speaker 3>like go on pilgrimage to these sacred</v>
<v Speaker 3>beauty,</v>

435
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:53.390
<v Speaker 3>beautiful art places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

436
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way we became a church was um,</v>

437
00:25:56.030 --> 00:26:00.740
<v Speaker 3>a friend of ours who started Sirius</v>
<v Speaker 3>satellite network.</v>

438
00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's Martine Rothblatt,</v>

439
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:07.220
<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she loves the work that a actual lives.</v>

440
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.600
<v Speaker 3>Alex's work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a collector,</v>

441
00:26:08.601 --> 00:26:11.660
<v Speaker 3>she loves the work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're doing awesome with the community</v>

442
00:26:11.661 --> 00:26:13.070
<v Speaker 3>and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>

443
00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:15.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing everything that churches</v>

444
00:26:15.431 --> 00:26:16.850
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're doing weddings,</v>

445
00:26:16.851 --> 00:26:19.280
<v Speaker 3>baby blessings and morals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>

446
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.320
<v Speaker 3>you have a prayer book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

447
00:26:21.321 --> 00:26:24.710
<v Speaker 3>basically arts and you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that churches do and you're</v>

448
00:26:24.711 --> 00:26:28.690
<v Speaker 3>not getting any of the benefits of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>churches get business thinking.</v>

449
00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's so smart.</v>

450
00:26:30.381 --> 00:26:32.420
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she paid a lawyer.</v>

451
00:26:32.421 --> 00:26:35.840
<v Speaker 3>She is the one that funded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>granted us,</v>

452
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting together with our,</v>

453
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.460
<v Speaker 3>with our guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who when we went through the process</v>

454
00:26:40.461 --> 00:26:43.010
<v Speaker 3>with us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took a good long time.</v>

455
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:47.070
<v Speaker 3>You have to basically write a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>essays and then they give you more</v>

456
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:51.630
<v Speaker 3>essays and it was maybe three times</v>
<v Speaker 3>through essays and you write them all</v>

457
00:26:51.631 --> 00:26:56.100
<v Speaker 3>and then you submit the liturgy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually just at the moment we were</v>

458
00:26:56.101 --> 00:26:57.060
<v Speaker 3>moving to the country.</v>

459
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:01.500
<v Speaker 3>It was like the same minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The church status just magically came in</v>

460
00:27:01.501 --> 00:27:04.440
<v Speaker 3>after four years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like all like coming together,</v>

461
00:27:04.441 --> 00:27:06.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so as it is though,</v>

462
00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:10.440
<v Speaker 3>we have 40 acres and then we had to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight with our town over,</v>

463
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every church in our town and there's</v>

464
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:17.760
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's mosques and Buddhist stupas and</v>

465
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:19.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of Catholic and every kind of</v>

466
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.770
<v Speaker 3>Protestant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were not paying real estate tax</v>

467
00:27:22.771 --> 00:27:26.970
<v Speaker 3>and we have this 40 acres and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>raising our taxes 15 percent every year.</v>

468
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.040
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile we're not making any money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex and I are volunteers that caused</v>

469
00:27:31.041 --> 00:27:33.480
<v Speaker 3>them by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we'd make nothing.</v>

470
00:27:33.481 --> 00:27:38.160
<v Speaker 3>We just give it away and the whole place</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're giving away it belongs to the</v>

471
00:27:38.161 --> 00:27:43.161
<v Speaker 3>community and the community is everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>whose spiritual and creative,</v>

472
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:48.000
<v Speaker 3>but it tends to have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelia files.</v>

473
00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:52.680
<v Speaker 3>People who feel like they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've experienced the divine and they</v>

474
00:27:52.681 --> 00:27:54.840
<v Speaker 3>want a place to go ahead and talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

475
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:58.410
<v Speaker 3>They wanted this in the city when we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were in Manhattan for five years.</v>

476
00:27:58.411 --> 00:28:03.030
<v Speaker 3>It was just a place where you could go</v>
<v Speaker 3>and talk about this because it's legal</v>

477
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.720
<v Speaker 3>to talk about it and we would always</v>
<v Speaker 3>have security and make sure there wasn't</v>

478
00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.170
<v Speaker 3>anything being passed around because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't get into trouble because we were</v>

479
00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:14.010
<v Speaker 3>like a really legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're doing this in legitimate way.</v>

480
00:28:14.011 --> 00:28:17.550
<v Speaker 3>We have to took us four years to get our</v>
<v Speaker 3>permits to do this building.</v>

481
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:21.060
<v Speaker 3>You add security to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people didn't pass drugs around.</v>

482
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't have anything visible.</v>

483
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.050
<v Speaker 3>What you do that is private is your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

484
00:28:28.051 --> 00:28:29.850
<v Speaker 3>If you can behave yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't.</v>

485
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.900
<v Speaker 3>We watch out for you and we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that,</v>

486
00:28:33.901 --> 00:28:37.890
<v Speaker 3>but you had a bunch of people actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching people to make sure we always</v>

487
00:28:37.891 --> 00:28:38.580
<v Speaker 3>have security.</v>

488
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.890
<v Speaker 3>They're gentle giants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We call them gentle giants.</v>

489
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.690
<v Speaker 3>You have to have security when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>having.</v>

490
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:46.040
<v Speaker 3>We have hundreds of thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

491
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:49.380
<v Speaker 3>some of our full moons are from hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a thousand people.</v>

492
00:28:49.381 --> 00:28:53.930
<v Speaker 3>We have large groups of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

493
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.480
<v Speaker 3>what happened was a sham and told us</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

494
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:58.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

495
00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.840
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had this whole idea of this temple we</v>

496
00:29:00.841 --> 00:29:02.700
<v Speaker 3>wanted to build,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but where's your community?</v>

497
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:04.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>building a temple is the work of a</v>

498
00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:05.760
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

499
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.080
<v Speaker 3>so we're going to start full moon</v>
<v Speaker 3>ceremonies in your home in Brooklyn.</v>

500
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:15.030
<v Speaker 3>So we did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We started in January of 2,364</v>

501
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.250
<v Speaker 3>consecutive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>full moons ago.</v>

502
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:20.970
<v Speaker 3>We started them in our loft in Brooklyn</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we went to,</v>

503
00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.300
<v Speaker 3>we got a place in Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12,000 square feet.</v>

504
00:29:24.301 --> 00:29:29.301
<v Speaker 3>We did it for five years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we found this permanent location in</v>

505
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:32.010
<v Speaker 3>a whopping journey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>York,</v>

506
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.550
<v Speaker 3>it's in the Hudson Valley.</v>

507
00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:37.140
<v Speaker 3>We were like 65 miles from the city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get there on the train,</v>

508
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:42.230
<v Speaker 3>but we found this lovely old retreat</v>
<v Speaker 3>center all kind of imploding and you</v>

509
00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.190
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've been working on at one</v>

510
00:29:45.191 --> 00:29:47.380
<v Speaker 3>building at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the carriage house,</v>

511
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:51.310
<v Speaker 3>which is turning into an theone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first temple of visionary art that</v>

512
00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:54.760
<v Speaker 3>we really came there to build his</v>
<v Speaker 3>building for.</v>

513
00:29:55.060 --> 00:30:00.060
<v Speaker 3>Actually we have a 10 bedroom Victorian</v>
<v Speaker 3>guesthouse and a office in our studio.</v>

514
00:30:01.211 --> 00:30:02.210
<v Speaker 3>So we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

515
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:05.680
<v Speaker 3>we have six buildings to work on and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're on building for.</v>

516
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:06.910
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

517
00:30:06.911 --> 00:30:08.860
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like a little retreat center</v>

518
00:30:08.861 --> 00:30:12.400
<v Speaker 3>that we're leaving to our community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our spiritual,</v>

519
00:30:12.401 --> 00:30:14.920
<v Speaker 3>creative cosmonaut community.</v>

520
00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:18.810
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating that Martin was</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in it because she's also</v>

521
00:30:18.811 --> 00:30:22.620
<v Speaker 1>involved in artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed her for the Scifi show</v>

522
00:30:22.621 --> 00:30:24.230
<v Speaker 1>that I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

523
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:29.230
<v Speaker 1>And she has this robot version of her</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife Bina four,</v>

524
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.810
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>48 or whatever.</v>

525
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

526
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.680
<v Speaker 1>she started a church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She being a started a church called the</v>

527
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.320
<v Speaker 1>terrorism movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to start a church.</v>

528
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:44.010
<v Speaker 1>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz already has a church,</v>

529
00:30:45.061 --> 00:30:49.080
<v Speaker 1>which he just joined his</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz as the Church of what's</v>

530
00:30:49.081 --> 00:30:52.950
<v Speaker 1>happening now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some great churches out there.</v>

531
00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I really just think it's why should</v>
<v Speaker 1>these Catholics get it all?</v>

532
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:58.110
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't get it all.</v>

533
00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.100
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think after you involved in like the</v>

534
00:31:02.101 --> 00:31:05.980
<v Speaker 1>100th child molestation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably should take.</v>

535
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.020
<v Speaker 1>You're probably take it away and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like super conservative number.</v>

536
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.380
<v Speaker 1>That's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That crazy religion.</v>

537
00:31:13.381 --> 00:31:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Religion doesn't uphold that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just awful people.</v>

538
00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:17.843
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

539
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.290
<v Speaker 4>awful people all throughout that one</v>
<v Speaker 4>religion.</v>

540
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:23.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's gotta be some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>connection with suppression,</v>

541
00:31:23.351 --> 00:31:27.100
<v Speaker 4>suppression of Sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suppression of ideology,</v>

542
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:32.280
<v Speaker 4>forcing people to behave in a certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>way and these blow backs and the also</v>

543
00:31:32.351 --> 00:31:35.500
<v Speaker 4>the fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was raised Catholic and I went</v>

544
00:31:35.501 --> 00:31:38.740
<v Speaker 4>to Catholic school when I was a young</v>
<v Speaker 4>kid and I remember I didn't go to</v>

545
00:31:38.741 --> 00:31:40.480
<v Speaker 4>kindergarten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just went right into first grade and I</v>

546
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:44.290
<v Speaker 4>remember the fear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the constant fear that they injected in</v>

547
00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:46.810
<v Speaker 4>you this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this idea of what religion is.</v>

548
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:51.580
<v Speaker 4>It was great for me because it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just queered me off religion so</v>

549
00:31:51.581 --> 00:31:53.590
<v Speaker 4>young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So early off I was like,</v>

550
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:54.191
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

551
00:31:54.191 --> 00:31:57.220
<v Speaker 4>well this is all nonsense was before</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

552
00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.490
<v Speaker 4>When I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my parents were getting divorced and my</v>

553
00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.250
<v Speaker 4>parents are splitting up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was really scared.</v>

554
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:06.790
<v Speaker 4>I was really nervous and I was young and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of violence going</v>

555
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:07.250
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

556
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:12.250
<v Speaker 4>There was a lot of yelling and screaming</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I needed something and so I remember</v>

557
00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:16.270
<v Speaker 4>when I was little I was always talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about God and it was just like,</v>

558
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.230
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's got to be.</v>

559
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:21.010
<v Speaker 4>If all these people around me are out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>their mind and everyone's crazy,</v>

560
00:32:21.011 --> 00:32:24.250
<v Speaker 4>there's got to be God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was actually excited to go to</v>

561
00:32:24.251 --> 00:32:26.110
<v Speaker 4>Catholic school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was excited to go to church.</v>

562
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.350
<v Speaker 4>I thought of it as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

563
00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:33.130
<v Speaker 4>maybe these people that these relatives</v>
<v Speaker 4>in these family members that I live with</v>

564
00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:35.320
<v Speaker 4>are all crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's going to be a place that I</v>

565
00:32:35.321 --> 00:32:39.280
<v Speaker 4>can go where I'm going to be able to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>loved and it's going to be calm.</v>

566
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.120
<v Speaker 4>God has rules and everyone's gonna</v>
<v Speaker 4>follow them,</v>

567
00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.610
<v Speaker 4>and then I went there and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

568
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.040
<v Speaker 4>good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Pun intended.</v>

569
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.030
<v Speaker 4>This fucking places worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

570
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.340
<v Speaker 4>these people out of their minds and my.</v>

571
00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.400
<v Speaker 4>My parents were going to put me in there</v>
<v Speaker 4>for second grade and I literally told</v>

572
00:32:55.401 --> 00:32:57.650
<v Speaker 4>him I'd run away from home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

573
00:32:57.651 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to find my way out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

574
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:01.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was seven,</v>

575
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:02.361
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

576
00:33:02.361 --> 00:33:04.150
<v Speaker 4>this is not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

577
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.580
<v Speaker 4>you have already become rational.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's seven.</v>

578
00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:13.280
<v Speaker 4>You knew</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had a bullshit detector that was</v>

579
00:33:13.581 --> 00:33:17.120
<v Speaker 4>always acutely attuned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

580
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:22.121
<v Speaker 4>that's one good thing about growing up</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a really fucked up household is that</v>

581
00:33:22.611 --> 00:33:23.600
<v Speaker 4>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

582
00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:24.410
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

583
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:27.920
<v Speaker 4>you have a constant sense of danger</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're around danger all the</v>

584
00:33:27.921 --> 00:33:30.230
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you don't get to sleep cuddly.</v>

585
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.120
<v Speaker 4>You don't get to like rest calm and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

586
00:33:33.121 --> 00:33:37.250
<v Speaker 4>you have an acute awareness of all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>possibilities.</v>

587
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.910
<v Speaker 4>So I mean ultimately that was a great</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing for me.</v>

588
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.450
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can really see how that it heightened</v>

589
00:33:44.451 --> 00:33:49.451
<v Speaker 4>your ability to also to always maintain</v>
<v Speaker 4>that mindfulness,</v>

590
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.090
<v Speaker 4>that over everything.</v>

591
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:55.730
<v Speaker 4>It's what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it probably allows you to do so many</v>

592
00:33:55.731 --> 00:33:56.840
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also,</v>

593
00:33:56.841 --> 00:33:57.341
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

594
00:33:57.341 --> 00:34:00.710
<v Speaker 4>there's always a balance between</v>
<v Speaker 4>mindfulness and paranoia.</v>

595
00:34:00.711 --> 00:34:02.930
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to be that guy that</v>
<v Speaker 4>carries a gun to the bathroom.</v>

596
00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:03.741
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

597
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:07.030
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of people that have</v>
<v Speaker 4>surpassed this,</v>

598
00:34:07.031 --> 00:34:10.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>awareness and gone into this like acute</v>

599
00:34:10.011 --> 00:34:12.620
<v Speaker 4>paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have this statement that I've been</v>

600
00:34:12.621 --> 00:34:15.080
<v Speaker 4>saying a lot lately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's important to bring up.</v>

601
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:20.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't think human beings are designed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take in the bad news of 7 billion</v>

602
00:34:20.931 --> 00:34:22.640
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think.</v>

603
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:26.780
<v Speaker 4>I think the numbers that we deal with on</v>
<v Speaker 4>a daily basis with all the different</v>

604
00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:30.080
<v Speaker 4>stories of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are too much for us to handle.</v>

605
00:34:30.081 --> 00:34:34.340
<v Speaker 4>It's not how you're supposed to deal</v>
<v Speaker 4>with what's going on in your community</v>

606
00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:37.250
<v Speaker 4>with a watchful eye on the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

607
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:42.110
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't be deeply engrossed in all</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the most disgusting aspects of the</v>

608
00:34:42.111 --> 00:34:43.880
<v Speaker 4>rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty four hours a day.</v>

609
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:47.630
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's one of the real</v>
<v Speaker 4>problematic issues of our time with</v>

610
00:34:47.631 --> 00:34:52.631
<v Speaker 4>social media and with the news that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have this distorted sense of what</v>

611
00:34:53.781 --> 00:34:56.750
<v Speaker 4>the world is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think this world is just filled</v>

612
00:34:56.751 --> 00:34:58.760
<v Speaker 4>with violence and horror.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

613
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.480
<v Speaker 4>the world is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just occasionally has violence and</v>

614
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.410
<v Speaker 4>horror.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just so many people and the</v>

615
00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:11.411
<v Speaker 4>world is so big that if you look at all</v>
<v Speaker 4>those people and this giant globe that</v>

616
00:35:12.681 --> 00:35:15.530
<v Speaker 4>we're on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can kind of get a sense that</v>

617
00:35:15.531 --> 00:35:17.470
<v Speaker 4>the sky is falling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

618
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:19.880
<v Speaker 4>but if you go outside right now in</v>
<v Speaker 4>woodland hills,</v>

619
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:23.060
<v Speaker 4>it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nice.</v>

620
00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.820
<v Speaker 4>It's always the worst thing happening in</v>
<v Speaker 4>every area.</v>

621
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:28.340
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's so rare.</v>

622
00:35:28.341 --> 00:35:31.280
<v Speaker 4>It's like occasionally they give you</v>
<v Speaker 4>some good food with her feet and your</v>

623
00:35:31.281 --> 00:35:32.600
<v Speaker 4>poison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're about to die.</v>

624
00:35:32.601 --> 00:35:34.910
<v Speaker 4>They slip you a piece of fruit.</v>

625
00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.570
<v Speaker 4>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think it's good for us.</v>

626
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it is and I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same thing with someone who grows up</v>

627
00:35:43.081 --> 00:35:44.580
<v Speaker 4>in a bad environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you could.</v>

628
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.630
<v Speaker 4>You could get a distorted perception of</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the world is and think that that</v>

629
00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:52.200
<v Speaker 4>the bad environment that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>currently in is the entire world and it</v>

630
00:35:52.201 --> 00:35:56.730
<v Speaker 4>can shape your perceptions and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>interactions and therefore shape how you</v>

631
00:35:56.731 --> 00:35:59.970
<v Speaker 4>react to other people and shape your</v>
<v Speaker 4>actual reality.</v>

632
00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.740
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the things that have truly</v>

633
00:36:01.741 --> 00:36:06.540
<v Speaker 4>tried to impart upon people that I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>learned and I believe that how you treat</v>

634
00:36:06.541 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 4>people and your interactions with people</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally change your reality,</v>

635
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:14.220
<v Speaker 4>and this is from mistakes that I've made</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is from positive</v>

636
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.900
<v Speaker 4>decisions that I've made because I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>that when you look at life in a positive</v>

637
00:36:21.031 --> 00:36:24.940
<v Speaker 4>way and you try to treat people kind and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you try to be nice to people and you try</v>

638
00:36:24.941 --> 00:36:28.560
<v Speaker 4>to move forward with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that you interact with,</v>

639
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:32.550
<v Speaker 4>they will get that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will most likely respond more</v>

640
00:36:32.551 --> 00:36:36.570
<v Speaker 4>kindly to you and the world changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The world literally changes in front of</v>

641
00:36:36.571 --> 00:36:37.890
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's billiard balls.</v>

642
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

643
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:43.690
<v Speaker 2>have have kind act that could be sending</v>
<v Speaker 2>waves.</v>

644
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:49.510
<v Speaker 2>A smile could actually prevent somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>from committing suicide.</v>

645
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:52.850
<v Speaker 2>That's all it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you should just go ahead and end</v>

646
00:36:52.851 --> 00:36:53.684
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

647
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard from some from some kids who are</v>

648
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.230
<v Speaker 1>really desperate and I going to jump or</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I</v>

649
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:07.350
<v Speaker 2>not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some stranger looked at me and smiled.</v>

650
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:10.620
<v Speaker 2>That's and that stopped me from doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

651
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what still have meat?</v>

652
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Acid stopped me from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from killing myself</v>

653
00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:22.830
<v Speaker 2>because for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wondered whether God exists.</v>

654
00:37:22.831 --> 00:37:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Just like your question when you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

655
00:37:25.501 --> 00:37:30.501
<v Speaker 2>you were hoping that there was something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was not a it,</v>

656
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:34.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was a center of peace</v>

657
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.550
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess now I don't know that I would</v>

658
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.760
<v Speaker 2>ever call God at center of peace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

659
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.940
<v Speaker 2>I would say that that's one aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire,</v>

660
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet storm of being alive.</v>

661
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.100
<v Speaker 2>I love that word,</v>

662
00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:54.610
<v Speaker 1>but what I read express,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet storm.</v>

663
00:37:54.611 --> 00:37:59.611
<v Speaker 1>You should make a t shirt</v>
<v Speaker 1>says meets dorm.</v>

664
00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:04.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a great band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Radical band.</v>

665
00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Hudson Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meet Storm.</v>

666
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.460
<v Speaker 1>We have a grinder attached to industrial</v>
<v Speaker 1>fan folks.</v>

667
00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't think about it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about a bunch of people</v>

668
00:38:14.921 --> 00:38:16.480
<v Speaker 1>just jumping around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting crazy.</v>

669
00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:17.373
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

670
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

671
00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.400
<v Speaker 2>I thought of that when I saw the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>judgment,</v>

672
00:38:27.401 --> 00:38:28.450
<v Speaker 2>but I make glands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

673
00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:32.920
<v Speaker 2>speaking of Catholics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you gotta look at the good things</v>

674
00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:38.520
<v Speaker 2>like even probably some really terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff happened in those Howard halls in</v>

675
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.800
<v Speaker 2>the Vatican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

676
00:38:41.801 --> 00:38:43.060
<v Speaker 2>really awesome art.</v>

677
00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

678
00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:48.630
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen the Sistine Chapel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

679
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:52.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually going there this summer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We spent an entire day from nine until</v>

680
00:38:52.671 --> 00:38:53.720
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got there,</v>

681
00:38:53.721 --> 00:38:58.721
<v Speaker 3>the front of the line and got in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way all the way there.</v>

682
00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.110
<v Speaker 3>You got to run all the way through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vatican.</v>

683
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.940
<v Speaker 3>Well to know you don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

684
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:06.050
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you want to run?</v>

685
00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went to Chapel Sistine Chapel.</v>

686
00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you got to take it and then get there</v>

687
00:39:12.141 --> 00:39:16.640
<v Speaker 3>in time when it kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were there all day from nine to five</v>

688
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:17.960
<v Speaker 3>drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just sat.</v>

689
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:22.010
<v Speaker 3>We got a seat and we were just drawing</v>
<v Speaker 3>all day and our focus,</v>

690
00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:26.330
<v Speaker 3>it was just unbelievable and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>drawings came out really amazing too.</v>

691
00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.080
<v Speaker 3>And so we had been to Vatican before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to say.</v>

692
00:39:30.081 --> 00:39:31.700
<v Speaker 3>So when you go to the Vatican for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first time,</v>

693
00:39:31.701 --> 00:39:35.200
<v Speaker 3>you have to walk through so you can see</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the amazingness of the way there</v>

694
00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.450
<v Speaker 3>because the sistine chapel is at the end</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the tour,</v>

695
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd go out there and then afterwards</v>

696
00:39:40.641 --> 00:39:42.080
<v Speaker 3>you come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

697
00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:42.921
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

698
00:39:42.921 --> 00:39:46.220
<v Speaker 3>on the way you want to take a look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we had already done that so we were</v>

699
00:39:46.221 --> 00:39:51.221
<v Speaker 3>like made the decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was our day to draw man,</v>

700
00:39:51.321 --> 00:39:52.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I got it.</v>

701
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.330
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was all I wanted to see.</v>

702
00:39:55.331 --> 00:39:56.164
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

703
00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:01.260
<v Speaker 2>everything else is just a blur and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to the Sistine Chapel is quite</v>

704
00:40:01.751 --> 00:40:06.010
<v Speaker 2>fascinating that you're looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>work of someone who lived hundreds of</v>

705
00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:07.270
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>500 years ago.</v>

706
00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

707
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:11.800
<v Speaker 3>And he didn't like everything that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Castle Catholics did by the way.</v>

708
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.570
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he didn't,</v>

709
00:40:13.571 --> 00:40:16.000
<v Speaker 3>but he did like being Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

710
00:40:16.001 --> 00:40:17.770
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he really did.</v>

711
00:40:17.771 --> 00:40:21.020
<v Speaker 3>He wrote about it and was very eloquent</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he loved being healthy,</v>

712
00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:25.510
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't like the pope telling him</v>
<v Speaker 3>to paint the Sistine Chapel for</v>

713
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:26.460
<v Speaker 3>instance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that,</v>

714
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.260
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long did it take for him to do that?</v>

715
00:40:29.261 --> 00:40:29.320
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

716
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.130
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Years and years.</v>

717
00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:36.160
<v Speaker 2>They last judgment is the one that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I've always called my favorite</v>

718
00:40:36.171 --> 00:40:38.490
<v Speaker 2>painting of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the meat storm.</v>

719
00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:41.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

720
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:46.450
<v Speaker 2>and there were no clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a figures on that.</v>

721
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:51.050
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michelangelo was still alive when they</v>

722
00:40:51.051 --> 00:40:51.940
<v Speaker 2>got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

723
00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.030
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

724
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.340
<v Speaker 2>what they called it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

725
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:56.120
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

726
00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:01.120
<v Speaker 2>he was a good fresco painter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he became basically Michelangelo's</v>

727
00:41:01.581 --> 00:41:03.500
<v Speaker 2>breaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>painter,</v>

728
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:06.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was always thought of as the one who</v>

729
00:41:06.321 --> 00:41:07.850
<v Speaker 2>added,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

730
00:41:07.851 --> 00:41:12.851
<v Speaker 2>clothing and drapery over the genitalia</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Michelangelo had painted.</v>

731
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:15.900
<v Speaker 2>He loved the body and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

732
00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:22.030
<v Speaker 2>made one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would call an anthropocosm out of it,</v>

733
00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:27.590
<v Speaker 2>want a kind of a temple of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was very much about the nobility</v>

734
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:34.990
<v Speaker 2>and connected with the Greek idealist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Greek idealist tradition is a</v>

735
00:41:37.071 --> 00:41:41.450
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic tradition from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>neoplatonic in the platonic,</v>

736
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:43.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socrates and all the rest.</v>

737
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:49.010
<v Speaker 2>So that wave was just getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

738
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:51.050
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was there when they dug up.</v>

739
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:52.310
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lao coon,</v>

740
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Greek sculpture with the snakes and</v>

741
00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:59.870
<v Speaker 2>the crazy stuff that it really deeply</v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced him.</v>

742
00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.620
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to say that the purity of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the religion place where it,</v>

743
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.200
<v Speaker 3>it's really true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

744
00:42:06.201 --> 00:42:07.810
<v Speaker 3>like that beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

745
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:10.460
<v Speaker 3>what would it actually means at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the core,</v>

746
00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:14.390
<v Speaker 3>at the heart core of any religion is</v>
<v Speaker 3>expressed through the art of that</v>

747
00:42:14.391 --> 00:42:15.980
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

748
00:42:15.981 --> 00:42:18.770
<v Speaker 3>the other stuff is crap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean with the way people</v>

749
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:23.690
<v Speaker 3>act towards each other and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's their own deficits and their own</v>

750
00:42:23.691 --> 00:42:25.110
<v Speaker 3>obstacles coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

751
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.070
<v Speaker 3>all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the pope's that have been horrible</v>

752
00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:29.450
<v Speaker 3>and allowed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

753
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:30.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

754
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:35.560
<v Speaker 3>child molestation to perpetrate those</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are sick people that has nothing.</v>

755
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:39.110
<v Speaker 3>They don't represent the purity of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>

756
00:42:39.111 --> 00:42:41.000
<v Speaker 3>which is the representative and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

757
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.670
<v Speaker 3>But what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the purity of the religion and</v>

758
00:42:43.671 --> 00:42:46.370
<v Speaker 3>doesn't vary depending upon the</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>

759
00:42:46.371 --> 00:42:48.250
<v Speaker 3>And why does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does that?</v>

760
00:42:48.251 --> 00:42:51.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every religion that what we're seeing is</v>

761
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 3>the purity of one man's expression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>

762
00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:57.440
<v Speaker 3>his view is beautiful view of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That we're so fortunate to be able to</v>

763
00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:58.290
<v Speaker 3>still look at</v>

764
00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:01.660
<v Speaker 2>true 500 years later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that have to do with</v>

765
00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Catholicism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that because he was part of that</v>

766
00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:11.700
<v Speaker 2>tradition and he was marrying the ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Greek ideal and the ended</v>

767
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.500
<v Speaker 2>neoplatonic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

768
00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:21.580
<v Speaker 2>which was all about universality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

769
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:25.240
<v Speaker 2>it was really more about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

770
00:43:25.241 --> 00:43:27.310
<v Speaker 2>as much as we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

771
00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.600
<v Speaker 2>all religions are connected and are</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically talking about the,</v>

772
00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.510
<v Speaker 2>the one spirit that moves through all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

773
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:38.590
<v Speaker 2>You can call it creative spirit and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>prefer to call it something like that</v>

774
00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:40.420
<v Speaker 2>rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

775
00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:44.530
<v Speaker 2>some of the names that get so heavily</v>
<v Speaker 2>weighted.</v>

776
00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:48.100
<v Speaker 2>But I'm comfortable with the word God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

777
00:43:48.101 --> 00:43:51.480
<v Speaker 2>God means just ultimate mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

778
00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:54.950
<v Speaker 2>We discussed this a couple times on</v>
<v Speaker 2>previous podcasts though.</v>

779
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.770
<v Speaker 2>How weighted that word is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

780
00:43:56.771 --> 00:43:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I think is</v>

781
00:43:58.001 --> 00:44:02.290
<v Speaker 2>amazing about the Sistine Chapel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're looking at the two fingers</v>

782
00:44:02.291 --> 00:44:03.700
<v Speaker 2>touching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're looking at all these</v>

783
00:44:03.701 --> 00:44:05.770
<v Speaker 2>beautiful images,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those images,</v>

784
00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:11.430
<v Speaker 2>they become what people think of when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think of God and they think of</v>

785
00:44:13.001 --> 00:44:14.590
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those images,</v>

786
00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:20.250
<v Speaker 2>they almost like it takes a form on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in taking on that form,</v>

787
00:44:20.801 --> 00:44:25.801
<v Speaker 2>it gives you a structure to house the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and the ideals of these religions.</v>

788
00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Like in seeing something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a visual representation,</v>

789
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

790
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.160
<v Speaker 4>becomes a real thing in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an idea that's an idea that becomes</v>

791
00:44:37.801 --> 00:44:39.360
<v Speaker 4>embodied by that art.</v>

792
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:44.240
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in the Jewish tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a non iconic tradition and you</v>

793
00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:46.650
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the Christian tradition really</v>

794
00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:49.200
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a story of a person.</v>

795
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:51.480
<v Speaker 3>They were born,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they taught,</v>

796
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:52.440
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they healed,</v>

797
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:53.880
<v Speaker 3>they died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they rose.</v>

798
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:58.140
<v Speaker 3>And in the Jewish tradition there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an non embodied.</v>

799
00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.250
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

800
00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:04.610
<v Speaker 3>I resonated with that when I first saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>God in Lsd and it was really not a</v>

801
00:45:05.761 --> 00:45:08.910
<v Speaker 3>person's face at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I recognize that this is what people</v>

802
00:45:08.911 --> 00:45:10.440
<v Speaker 3>are talking about when they're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about God,</v>

803
00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:13.240
<v Speaker 3>which is this energy that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

804
00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:14.880
<v Speaker 3>interconnects everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

805
00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:18.780
<v Speaker 3>it's like the force more than a face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

806
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.990
<v Speaker 3>but that was my experience of God and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

807
00:45:21.991 --> 00:45:24.120
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in that experience when I was 20,</v>

808
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:28.170
<v Speaker 3>I recognize this is what people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about when they say God,</v>

809
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:30.150
<v Speaker 3>it's not physical.</v>

810
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Energetic.</v>

811
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:36.540
<v Speaker 4>What I'm just saying is that in this guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>creating these iconic works,</v>

812
00:45:36.541 --> 00:45:38.220
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gives it a structure.</v>

813
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.760
<v Speaker 4>It gives it like a scaffolding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in that scaffolding of these</v>

814
00:45:41.761 --> 00:45:45.840
<v Speaker 4>beautiful paintings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can kind of like form your own</v>

815
00:45:45.841 --> 00:45:50.841
<v Speaker 4>categories and have your own like</v>
<v Speaker 4>chapters in your mind that exists that</v>

816
00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.340
<v Speaker 4>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like makes those things</v>

817
00:45:53.341 --> 00:45:55.470
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether or not they ever were real,</v>

818
00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:57.450
<v Speaker 4>whether or not they're ever angels on</v>
<v Speaker 4>clouds,</v>

819
00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:02.990
<v Speaker 4>it's almost inconsequential because the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the result of it is kind of the same.</v>

820
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:05.850
<v Speaker 4>If you believe that it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you believe,</v>

821
00:46:05.851 --> 00:46:10.851
<v Speaker 4>and this is where religion gets so</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking squirrely because are you saying</v>

822
00:46:10.951 --> 00:46:13.740
<v Speaker 4>that Adam and eve were the only two</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in the world and everybody came</v>

823
00:46:13.741 --> 00:46:14.551
<v Speaker 4>from them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

824
00:46:14.551 --> 00:46:17.340
<v Speaker 4>absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you saying that there was a snake</v>

825
00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:18.730
<v Speaker 4>and he told eve?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

826
00:46:18.731 --> 00:46:18.980
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

827
00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:19.211
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

828
00:46:19.211 --> 00:46:19.620
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

829
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:20.010
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

830
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:25.010
<v Speaker 4>But if you operate your life as if those</v>
<v Speaker 4>things were reality,</v>

831
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:30.480
<v Speaker 4>and if you operate your life under the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideals that are transcribed and</v>

832
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:35.510
<v Speaker 4>described in these beautiful paintings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will become a real past in the sense</v>

833
00:46:36.481 --> 00:46:40.410
<v Speaker 4>that it will have a real meaning to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets real weird in that way.</v>

834
00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:43.710
<v Speaker 4>And that's where I create weird art in</v>
<v Speaker 4>general.</v>

835
00:46:43.711 --> 00:46:48.711
<v Speaker 4>And your art is particularly important</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the things that you paint,</v>

836
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:53.700
<v Speaker 4>you can actually see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen a lot of the things that you</v>

837
00:46:53.701 --> 00:46:56.490
<v Speaker 4>paint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not specifically,</v>

838
00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:00.960
<v Speaker 4>but one of the things that I remember</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was first introduced to some of</v>

839
00:47:00.961 --> 00:47:02.970
<v Speaker 4>your art,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am,</v>

840
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:05.700
<v Speaker 4>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget which one it was.</v>

841
00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:07.800
<v Speaker 4>I forget what you have seen so many of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your pieces,</v>

842
00:47:07.801 --> 00:47:09.180
<v Speaker 4>but I remember going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

843
00:47:09.181 --> 00:47:12.570
<v Speaker 4>this guy's seen it like 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've been there.</v>

844
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:16.380
<v Speaker 4>Like when I thought of tryptamine</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences and I saw your art,</v>

845
00:47:16.381 --> 00:47:16.921
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

846
00:47:16.921 --> 00:47:17.650
<v Speaker 4>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a.</v>

847
00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:18.900
<v Speaker 4>He nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

848
00:47:18.901 --> 00:47:22.160
<v Speaker 4>some people have come kind of close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've kind of.</v>

849
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:27.530
<v Speaker 4>But even though what you're showing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't exist in a static form,</v>

850
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.560
<v Speaker 4>in the tryptamine dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's no way you can take a,</v>

851
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you take your phone and you take a</v>

852
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:35.290
<v Speaker 4>screenshot and you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to,</v>

853
00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:38.110
<v Speaker 4>when you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you went to press that button and say,</v>

854
00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:39.400
<v Speaker 4>God is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say that now.</v>

855
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:42.160
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now can I just press the movie?</v>

856
00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:43.780
<v Speaker 4>How can I capture this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

857
00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:46.870
<v Speaker 4>the problem also is it changes every</v>
<v Speaker 4>fraction of a second.</v>

858
00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:48.100
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

859
00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:52.270
<v Speaker 4>the beautiful thing about the tryptamine</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences is that whatever visual</v>

860
00:47:52.271 --> 00:47:55.630
<v Speaker 4>you're experiencing right now will morph</v>
<v Speaker 4>into something else.</v>

861
00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:00.430
<v Speaker 4>And it was one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 4>lessons that I ever learned while</v>

862
00:48:00.431 --> 00:48:04.060
<v Speaker 4>tripping was um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a dmt experience.</v>

863
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.060
<v Speaker 4>I had a bunch of negative thoughts.</v>

864
00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what they were about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but our member,</v>

865
00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:14.730
<v Speaker 4>the visions that I was having turned</v>
<v Speaker 4>dark and like do like a dark green and</v>

866
00:48:16.361 --> 00:48:19.450
<v Speaker 4>black and twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there were contorted and</v>

867
00:48:19.451 --> 00:48:22.960
<v Speaker 4>compressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a visual representation of negative</v>

868
00:48:22.961 --> 00:48:26.500
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I realized that these,</v>

869
00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:29.500
<v Speaker 4>whatever these things are with entities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts,</v>

870
00:48:29.501 --> 00:48:34.501
<v Speaker 4>whatever they were trying to express to</v>
<v Speaker 4>me the actual negative consequences of</v>

871
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 4>thinking like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it showed me in a visual form,</v>

872
00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:44.370
<v Speaker 4>and then I relaxed and thought positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eddie literally bloomed in front of me</v>

873
00:48:44.801 --> 00:48:49.801
<v Speaker 4>like a flower and then change into this</v>
<v Speaker 4>wildly beautiful geometric pattern that</v>

874
00:48:51.341 --> 00:48:55.450
<v Speaker 4>was like dancing in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I realized at that moment like I'm,</v>

875
00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:56.950
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I realized to myself,</v>

876
00:48:56.951 --> 00:48:58.450
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to remember this,</v>

877
00:48:58.451 --> 00:49:01.450
<v Speaker 4>I have to remember this and I have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out how to express this because</v>

878
00:49:01.451 --> 00:49:05.680
<v Speaker 4>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an incredible realization that it's not</v>

879
00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:08.800
<v Speaker 4>this like abstract idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

880
00:49:08.801 --> 00:49:10.750
<v Speaker 4>you think negative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>negative things happen.</v>

881
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:11.730
<v Speaker 4>Think positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

882
00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:16.180
<v Speaker 4>you're literally manifesting energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're manifesting a certain kind of</v>

883
00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:18.880
<v Speaker 4>energy with negative thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or it's one of the reasons why we like</v>

884
00:49:18.881 --> 00:49:22.180
<v Speaker 4>getting away from negative people when</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's like really negative and</v>

885
00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:23.840
<v Speaker 4>complaining and whining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just like,</v>

886
00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.510
<v Speaker 4>oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to get outta here.</v>

887
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:27.490
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really feel like they're going to</v>

888
00:49:27.491 --> 00:49:30.490
<v Speaker 4>suck me in other vortex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've gotta I've gotta escape.</v>

889
00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:32.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

890
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.410
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

891
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:37.630
<v Speaker 2>don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could think of it like an Amoeba</v>

892
00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:41.840
<v Speaker 2>around your physical body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cloud of</v>

893
00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:49.020
<v Speaker 2>pulsating thought forms and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you're imagining a,</v>

894
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:51.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

895
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.040
<v Speaker 2>the beautiful elements of life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

896
00:49:57.041 --> 00:50:00.460
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be in a kind of order and</v>

897
00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:05.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe kind of wafting upward it.</v>

898
00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:07.100
<v Speaker 2>These are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

899
00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:10.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spiritual positive,</v>

900
00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:11.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of frameworks.</v>

901
00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you are seeing life through</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're tripping,</v>

902
00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and seeing the connections between</v>

903
00:50:17.081 --> 00:50:19.450
<v Speaker 2>things lines forming and things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

904
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:23.530
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more kind of organic geometries</v>

905
00:50:23.531 --> 00:50:24.640
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that show up,</v>

906
00:50:24.641 --> 00:50:27.950
<v Speaker 2>you see this intelligence of life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

907
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:29.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

908
00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.470
<v Speaker 2>the light of divine intelligence that</v>
<v Speaker 2>came through for allison,</v>

909
00:50:33.471 --> 00:50:38.471
<v Speaker 2>like in the language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be weaving things together.</v>

910
00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:43.920
<v Speaker 2>And when you're in touch with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite light that seems to be the</v>

911
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:49.181
<v Speaker 2>source,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that is you can keep it upwardly</v>

912
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:55.270
<v Speaker 2>moving and very evolutionarily caught</v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmically consciously moving forward.</v>

913
00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:02.530
<v Speaker 2>And when then you're thinking regretful</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts or thinking negative thoughts</v>

914
00:51:03.741 --> 00:51:08.300
<v Speaker 2>and anger and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a constriction that goes on in</v>

915
00:51:08.301 --> 00:51:12.140
<v Speaker 2>your heart I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of shuts things down and that</v>

916
00:51:12.141 --> 00:51:13.460
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you were saying,</v>

917
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:15.750
<v Speaker 2>twisting in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>curling in and,</v>

918
00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.990
<v Speaker 2>and darkening and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and things are,</v>

919
00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:23.080
<v Speaker 2>are all things that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>journeying,</v>

920
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:27.470
<v Speaker 2>you see them manifest literally in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>flow of your,</v>

921
00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.520
<v Speaker 2>the theater of your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think you really beautifully</v>

922
00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:34.010
<v Speaker 2>described that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

923
00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.170
<v Speaker 2>just in that I was totally there.</v>

924
00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:41.610
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a disease of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very similar to catching a</v>

925
00:51:41.611 --> 00:51:43.440
<v Speaker 4>cold that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

926
00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:45.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't see the cold,</v>

927
00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.370
<v Speaker 4>you don't see a disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't see it,</v>

928
00:51:47.371 --> 00:51:50.970
<v Speaker 4>but it affects you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think there's an analogy to be</v>

929
00:51:50.971 --> 00:51:55.470
<v Speaker 4>made about diseases of consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can get locked into these</v>

930
00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:59.340
<v Speaker 4>terrible ways of looking at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's one of the most</v>

931
00:51:59.341 --> 00:52:02.340
<v Speaker 4>important things about what you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to do in terms of building a</v>

932
00:52:02.341 --> 00:52:05.610
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That if you can build a community and</v>

933
00:52:05.611 --> 00:52:10.611
<v Speaker 4>build a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a conscious ideology that that is</v>

934
00:52:10.921 --> 00:52:15.921
<v Speaker 4>sort of a prescribed to people and</v>
<v Speaker 4>establish a very positive and loving</v>

935
00:52:18.181 --> 00:52:20.580
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can spread that.</v>

936
00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:23.160
<v Speaker 4>Like you can spread a disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

937
00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:28.050
<v Speaker 4>or for no better word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of seeds of love or whatever,</v>

938
00:52:28.051 --> 00:52:30.780
<v Speaker 4>whatever you would call it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you could do it the wrong way,</v>

939
00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could do it what the Nazis did and</v>

940
00:52:33.811 --> 00:52:35.670
<v Speaker 4>do what gang is Khan did and do it.</v>

941
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:39.690
<v Speaker 4>Some horrible people throughout history</v>
<v Speaker 4>have done similar things and a lot of</v>

942
00:52:39.691 --> 00:52:42.750
<v Speaker 4>ways because there are diseases of</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>

943
00:52:42.751 --> 00:52:47.430
<v Speaker 4>They're diseases of consciousness or you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could do it the right way or a good way</v>

944
00:52:47.431 --> 00:52:51.810
<v Speaker 4>or a beneficial way or positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it seems like throughout history we</v>

945
00:52:51.811 --> 00:52:56.811
<v Speaker 4>almost have to see those negative ones</v>
<v Speaker 4>to learn the consequences of,</v>

946
00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:01.380
<v Speaker 4>of letting these things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

947
00:53:01.381 --> 00:53:04.680
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the reasons why Germany</v>
<v Speaker 4>won't let in the scientologists that</v>

948
00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:05.280
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

949
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.370
<v Speaker 4>we've seen what happens when cults</v>
<v Speaker 4>takeover,</v>

950
00:53:08.371 --> 00:53:10.920
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got a deep history with fucked up</v>

951
00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:14.310
<v Speaker 4>group thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's just not let you guys in.</v>

952
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:17.280
<v Speaker 4>And it's what we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>before the podcast.</v>

953
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:21.120
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about trump and what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on in this country right now.</v>

954
00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:26.420
<v Speaker 4>And I was saying that I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably a good idea to have this moment</v>

955
00:53:27.001 --> 00:53:28.350
<v Speaker 4>where we realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

956
00:53:28.351 --> 00:53:30.840
<v Speaker 4>we really have to pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we,</v>

957
00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:34.560
<v Speaker 4>we can't just sit back and not</v>
<v Speaker 4>participate anymore because liquids</v>

958
00:53:34.561 --> 00:53:39.561
<v Speaker 4>happened when it's a mockery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The hold system is like been exposed by</v>

959
00:53:40.171 --> 00:53:44.220
<v Speaker 4>this one guy as being a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's always been a joke.</v>

960
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:46.230
<v Speaker 4>It's just been a joke that we've</v>
<v Speaker 4>accepted,</v>

961
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:48.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we were talking about Hillary and</v>

962
00:53:48.481 --> 00:53:50.890
<v Speaker 4>all the criminal investigations that</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's under.</v>

963
00:53:50.891 --> 00:53:54.810
<v Speaker 4>And that somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this one person who we know is insincere</v>

964
00:53:54.811 --> 00:53:58.860
<v Speaker 4>is a better option than this other</v>
<v Speaker 4>person who we know is a jerk off.</v>

965
00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:00.130
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

966
00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:01.450
<v Speaker 4>Where's the right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And where's the.</v>

967
00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:04.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't barely been an election where</v>
<v Speaker 3>that isn't true.</v>

968
00:54:04.101 --> 00:54:07.070
<v Speaker 3>I thought Obama was a pretty clear</v>
<v Speaker 3>choice and there was a lot of</v>

969
00:54:07.071 --> 00:54:10.310
<v Speaker 3>celebrating afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But of course then he disappointed</v>

970
00:54:10.311 --> 00:54:14.210
<v Speaker 3>people like he's predicted he would at</v>
<v Speaker 3>his inauguration.</v>

971
00:54:14.211 --> 00:54:16.640
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to make everybody happy</v>

972
00:54:16.641 --> 00:54:18.440
<v Speaker 3>and you're not going to always be happy</v>
<v Speaker 3>with me.</v>

973
00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:19.360
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

974
00:54:19.361 --> 00:54:21.950
<v Speaker 3>he predicted that and he came through</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>

975
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:24.650
<v Speaker 3>But I remember all the elections of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

976
00:54:24.651 --> 00:54:26.900
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

977
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:31.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always voted for the least worst</v>

978
00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.360
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

979
00:54:32.361 --> 00:54:33.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Al Gore was,</v>

980
00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:34.940
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was up there.</v>

981
00:54:34.941 --> 00:54:36.470
<v Speaker 3>He was really good and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

982
00:54:36.471 --> 00:54:41.471
<v Speaker 3>and I actually won and he actually won</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the,</v>

983
00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:44.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coup took place.</v>

984
00:54:44.841 --> 00:54:45.220
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

985
00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:48.160
<v Speaker 4>There were corporate America took over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

986
00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:49.380
<v Speaker 4>it really did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's.</v>

987
00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:51.700
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also where the system that we're</v>

988
00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:55.990
<v Speaker 4>voting under is exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're still using pieces of paper.</v>

989
00:54:55.991 --> 00:54:57.020
<v Speaker 4>And then also the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

990
00:54:57.130 --> 00:55:02.130
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see hacking democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Hbo Hbo Documentary on the Diebold</v>

991
00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:02.630
<v Speaker 4>Systems?</v>

992
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

993
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.280
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his brother was a vice president there,</v>

994
00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:10.120
<v Speaker 3>work there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there before</v>

995
00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:11.243
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

996
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:13.980
<v Speaker 4>before they were making voting machines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

997
00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:15.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They actually changed their name after</v>

998
00:55:15.841 --> 00:55:19.860
<v Speaker 4>that documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that they establish a voting machine</v>

999
00:55:19.861 --> 00:55:23.010
<v Speaker 4>where you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I recommend everybody watch hacking</v>

1000
00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:24.450
<v Speaker 4>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was from,</v>

1001
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:27.540
<v Speaker 4>I want to say 2007 or something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1002
00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:29.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was a documentary where they</v>

1003
00:55:29.881 --> 00:55:34.140
<v Speaker 4>exposed that these voting machines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only can they be manipulated,</v>

1004
00:55:34.141 --> 00:55:38.700
<v Speaker 4>they were designed to be manipulated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were designed to have a third party</v>

1005
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.720
<v Speaker 4>entrance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a third party could enter in data</v>

1006
00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:48.140
<v Speaker 4>and it's just madness that those</v>
<v Speaker 4>machines are how our election got</v>

1007
00:55:49.711 --> 00:55:54.060
<v Speaker 4>decided and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've since then cleaned it up and in</v>

1008
00:55:54.061 --> 00:55:55.980
<v Speaker 4>some way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but still it's a dirty system.</v>

1009
00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:01.760
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't it seem like we could actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>have some encryption that each voter</v>

1010
00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:04.930
<v Speaker 4>could vote online?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1011
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:07.290
<v Speaker 4>And do it in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1012
00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.390
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we'd know.</v>

1013
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.580
<v Speaker 4>Here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Banking.</v>

1014
00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:13.750
<v Speaker 4>Everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Banks online who,</v>

1015
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.320
<v Speaker 4>who doesn't bank online who doesn't buy</v>
<v Speaker 4>things online,</v>

1016
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.270
<v Speaker 4>trade credit card transactions with</v>
<v Speaker 4>people like,</v>

1017
00:56:18.271 --> 00:56:19.290
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we gets hacked.</v>

1018
00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.210
<v Speaker 4>How often?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How often?</v>

1019
00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.380
<v Speaker 4>How many people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how?</v>

1020
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:25.360
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What percentage of it is it enough to</v>

1021
00:56:25.361 --> 00:56:27.160
<v Speaker 4>shift an election?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say it's probably not.</v>

1022
00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:31.090
<v Speaker 4>I would say it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say if you could make banking</v>

1023
00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:34.750
<v Speaker 4>secure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can make voting secure phone.</v>

1024
00:56:34.751 --> 00:56:36.610
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't even get into that guy's</v>
<v Speaker 4>phone.</v>

1025
00:56:36.611 --> 00:56:37.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1026
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:39.300
<v Speaker 4>you can do this and so they should do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1027
00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.110
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Representative government is not</v>

1028
00:56:41.111 --> 00:56:43.540
<v Speaker 4>necessary anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can communicate instantaneously with</v>

1029
00:56:43.541 --> 00:56:46.360
<v Speaker 4>people all throughout the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not talking about sending a raven,</v>

1030
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:49.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this isn't the 13 hundreds.</v>

1031
00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:52.210
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is an interesting time and we're</v>

1032
00:56:52.211 --> 00:56:55.180
<v Speaker 4>not taking advantage of the resources</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are available to us,</v>

1033
00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:58.150
<v Speaker 4>but as far as representing the actual</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1034
00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:01.210
<v Speaker 4>but I think there's also a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 4>that too is there's a lot of people that</v>

1035
00:57:01.211 --> 00:57:04.090
<v Speaker 4>are just completely uneducated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uninterested,</v>

1036
00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:07.000
<v Speaker 4>Slovenly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lazy people and we have to energize</v>

1037
00:57:07.001 --> 00:57:07.780
<v Speaker 4>those people.</v>

1038
00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:11.950
<v Speaker 4>We have to reinvigorate their ideas of</v>
<v Speaker 4>participation.</v>

1039
00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:14.050
<v Speaker 4>Enough community and you have to say</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1040
00:57:14.051 --> 00:57:16.150
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't just sit on your couch and eat</v>

1041
00:57:16.151 --> 00:57:18.520
<v Speaker 4>twinkies and watch beverly hills</v>
<v Speaker 4>housewives.</v>

1042
00:57:18.521 --> 00:57:20.980
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that anymore because if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

1043
00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:24.100
<v Speaker 4>you're not allowed to complain about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world being fucked up because you're a</v>

1044
00:57:24.101 --> 00:57:29.101
<v Speaker 4>part of the world being fucked up and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think in two weeks weaken energize</v>

1045
00:57:29.351 --> 00:57:34.150
<v Speaker 4>people until we can give people the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense that they actually can participate</v>

1046
00:57:34.151 --> 00:57:37.870
<v Speaker 4>in and it is just a bunch of human</v>
<v Speaker 4>beings that are trying to figure out the</v>

1047
00:57:37.871 --> 00:57:40.900
<v Speaker 4>right and the wrong way to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of that going on</v>

1048
00:57:40.901 --> 00:57:43.390
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's this ebb and flow of</v>

1049
00:57:43.391 --> 00:57:47.890
<v Speaker 4>social media and positive aspects of it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and negative aspects of it,</v>

1050
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:51.910
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately I think a lot of that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>just us learning to navigate the</v>

1051
00:57:51.911 --> 00:57:52.570
<v Speaker 4>landscape.</v>

1052
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:56.440
<v Speaker 4>This new landscape is digital,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interconnected landscape that's</v>

1053
00:57:56.441 --> 00:57:59.050
<v Speaker 4>unprecedented in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't.</v>

1054
00:57:59.051 --> 00:58:01.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we can understand it</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we're a part of it.</v>

1055
00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:03.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we can sort of.</v>

1056
00:58:03.011 --> 00:58:04.240
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1057
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:08.860
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think if we look back in</v>
<v Speaker 4>history and they a thousand years from</v>

1058
00:58:08.861 --> 00:58:09.940
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at this day,</v>

1059
00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:14.190
<v Speaker 4>the way we're looking at Michelangelo or</v>
<v Speaker 4>Leonardo Da Vinci or gang,</v>

1060
00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:16.570
<v Speaker 4>this con or anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look back and you go,</v>

1061
00:58:16.571 --> 00:58:18.250
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a crazy time.</v>

1062
00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:22.720
<v Speaker 4>That's nothing compared to today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Today is the craziest time ever.</v>

1063
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:25.000
<v Speaker 4>The emergence of artificial</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence,</v>

1064
00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:29.950
<v Speaker 4>the emergence of a very bizarre method</v>
<v Speaker 4>of communication where you can</v>

1065
00:58:29.951 --> 00:58:34.951
<v Speaker 4>instantaneously reach people on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>entire planet where data is shared like</v>

1066
00:58:35.261 --> 00:58:39.160
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well amongst hundreds of millions of</v>

1067
00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:42.520
<v Speaker 4>people instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a new world.</v>

1068
00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:45.850
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking crazy new world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a birth.</v>

1069
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:49.780
<v Speaker 4>It is literally like a birth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like an organism coming out of an</v>

1070
00:58:49.781 --> 00:58:54.280
<v Speaker 4>egg and poking his head out and right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now the shells being chipped and the</v>

1071
00:58:54.281 --> 00:58:56.740
<v Speaker 4>heads popping up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this fucking thing's going to merge</v>

1072
00:58:56.741 --> 00:59:01.690
<v Speaker 4>and it's gonna fly will turn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr Dan talked about the noosphere,</v>

1073
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:05.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the thinking layer of the earth,</v>

1074
00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's really what enabled,</v>

1075
00:59:09.370 --> 00:59:10.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you talked about it in the mid,</v>

1076
00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:16.180
<v Speaker 4>Mid 20th century and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this thinking layer,</v>

1077
00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:21.840
<v Speaker 4>a thinking atmosphere that's around the</v>
<v Speaker 4>earth now through satellites,</v>

1078
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 4>through</v>

1079
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:23.340
<v Speaker 2>all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1080
00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:27.530
<v Speaker 2>interactive technology that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>currently speaking on,</v>

1081
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:32.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a new body for the soul of humanity.</v>

1082
00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is now,</v>

1083
00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:38.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're,</v>

1084
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.820
<v Speaker 2>what we're working on now is the theo</v>
<v Speaker 2>sphere.</v>

1085
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:45.560
<v Speaker 2>That's what we've got to tap and access.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1086
00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:50.740
<v Speaker 2>We have a connectedness with each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>now as a symbol that shouldn't really</v>

1087
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:57.910
<v Speaker 2>clue us into something important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we look at other nature systems like</v>

1088
00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:03.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my celio intelligence weaves the woods</v>

1089
01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:08.000
<v Speaker 2>together and that we have our entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>soil and makes it alive.</v>

1090
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.950
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1091
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:15.160
<v Speaker 2>these are spores a connected by fibers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we are.</v>

1092
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can explain what what's going on</v>

1093
01:00:18.111 --> 01:00:20.210
<v Speaker 4>in the Pacific northwest in regards to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1094
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:25.390
<v Speaker 4>like how enormous the actual individual</v>
<v Speaker 4>organism of my sealy connection is.</v>

1095
01:00:25.701 --> 01:00:29.750
<v Speaker 4>And the Pacific northwest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's essentially like someone described</v>

1096
01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:32.870
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might've been Mckenna as like a</v>

1097
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:35.720
<v Speaker 4>thousand gray whales.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how big this organism is.</v>

1098
01:00:35.721 --> 01:00:39.110
<v Speaker 4>And it's essentially one interconnected</v>
<v Speaker 4>mushroom.</v>

1099
01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.060
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

1100
01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:45.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The biggest thing on earth being on</v>

1101
01:00:45.171 --> 01:00:46.730
<v Speaker 4>earth is a mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1102
01:00:46.731 --> 01:00:49.040
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the oldest being as well.</v>

1103
01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:52.370
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're more like mushrooms than any other</v>

1104
01:00:52.371 --> 01:00:53.450
<v Speaker 4>plant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1105
01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.011
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1106
01:00:54.011 --> 01:00:58.160
<v Speaker 4>they actually breathe in oxygen and</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathe out carbon dioxide like people.</v>

1107
01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:02.330
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been incredibly fascinated over the</v>

1108
01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:06.080
<v Speaker 4>last few months with plant intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 4>and with plant communication and</v>

1109
01:01:06.081 --> 01:01:11.081
<v Speaker 4>calculations and this idea that plants</v>
<v Speaker 4>have some sort of a consciousness.</v>

1110
01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.900
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 4>tripping out about is acacia trees,</v>

1111
01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:20.140
<v Speaker 4>where if an animal eats them and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>wind carries the scent of the Acacia</v>

1112
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:27.280
<v Speaker 4>tree being consumed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bushes and trees downwind smell it</v>

1113
01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:31.850
<v Speaker 4>and become bitter so that it discourages</v>
<v Speaker 4>predation.</v>

1114
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:36.350
<v Speaker 4>And animals were starving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The downwind animals were starving</v>

1115
01:01:36.351 --> 01:01:40.760
<v Speaker 4>because they wouldn't eat the bushes</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the trees that had taken the scent</v>

1116
01:01:40.761 --> 01:01:42.620
<v Speaker 4>of the trees that were up north.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1117
01:01:42.621 --> 01:01:47.621
<v Speaker 4>it's madness and they were literally</v>
<v Speaker 4>sending out a signal to the other</v>

1118
01:01:47.781 --> 01:01:48.591
<v Speaker 4>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1119
01:01:48.591 --> 01:01:50.540
<v Speaker 4>hit the alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're getting eaten.</v>

1120
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.150
<v Speaker 4>And they're communicating with each</v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

1121
01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the underground and overground a</v>

1122
01:01:56.380 --> 01:02:01.380
<v Speaker 2>network of plant intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think of basically the festival</v>

1123
01:02:02.861 --> 01:02:07.720
<v Speaker 2>culture as being mushrooms that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing out of the underground</v>

1124
01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:12.820
<v Speaker 2>intelligence graves and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the little fruiting bodies.</v>

1125
01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:18.060
<v Speaker 4>Coachella though right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what kind of a is southwest</v>

1126
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:23.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie man this summer.</v>

1127
01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I just want to tell everybody out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come and be part of the Dr Bronner Foam</v>

1128
01:02:27.431 --> 01:02:32.431
<v Speaker 1>Dome Camp and get yourself sprayed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>foam and see us do paint our mural.</v>

1129
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>So Dr. Bronner's soap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to be in the maps.</v>

1130
01:02:36.751 --> 01:02:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Brawner camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The maps is the multidisciplinary</v>

1131
01:02:39.841 --> 01:02:44.250
<v Speaker 1>association for Psychedelic Studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of us know and they have the Zendo</v>

1132
01:02:44.251 --> 01:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>where people go when they need some help</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's also a.</v>

1133
01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that mean though?</v>

1134
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>That's where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the rangers,</v>

1135
01:02:51.361 --> 01:02:53.600
<v Speaker 1>when they go around and they find people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are triple,</v>

1136
01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a bad time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go to the Zendo and they take care</v>

1137
01:02:56.671 --> 01:02:57.171
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

1138
01:02:57.171 --> 01:03:00.060
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're helped the Zendo.</v>

1139
01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1140
01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:03.090
<v Speaker 1>we have a Zendo at cosmo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1141
01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a place for meditating and chill</v>

1142
01:03:07.961 --> 01:03:12.961
<v Speaker 1>out to get away from the frenetic energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just have a place of peace</v>

1143
01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.150
<v Speaker 1>from that smells like feet.</v>

1144
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.710
<v Speaker 1>It's really beautiful and it sounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange,</v>

1145
01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:26.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's made out of wood and bamboo and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardboard.</v>

1146
01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>So how do they construct that out in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the bringing in pieces and</v>

1147
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:33.180
<v Speaker 1>ended up like they do everything else</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1148
01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long does it take to put that</v>

1149
01:03:34.831 --> 01:03:36.660
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People come over like a week or two</v>

1150
01:03:36.661 --> 01:03:39.450
<v Speaker 1>ahead of time depending on how complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could put together.</v>

1151
01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>But we did a dome in 2006 with maps and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Matt Atwood who did the</v>

1152
01:03:46.261 --> 01:03:50.580
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was called the n theone village and</v>

1153
01:03:50.581 --> 01:03:51.960
<v Speaker 1>it was deadly [inaudible] village for</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1154
01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Alex named it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we have empty on growing and</v>

1155
01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.700
<v Speaker 1>causing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it used to be,</v>

1156
01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

1157
01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.800
<v Speaker 1>at burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

1158
01:03:58.801 --> 01:04:00.420
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you go?</v>

1159
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:03.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't go be around that many hippies.</v>

1160
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:08.880
<v Speaker 1>It's all kinds of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is the freest place on earth.</v>

1161
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Certainly infested with hippies though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest with ourselves.</v>

1162
01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Well now the people who are using</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sacramento I to take objection for a</v>

1163
01:04:18.241 --> 01:04:21.420
<v Speaker 1>moment and speak for the hippies</v>
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

1164
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that this is like one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last places where it's okay,</v>

1165
01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's no longer okay to say nigger</v>

1166
01:04:29.161 --> 01:04:30.320
<v Speaker 1>or queer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1167
01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Got or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have that,</v>

1168
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.770
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a Hippie,</v>

1169
01:04:37.771 --> 01:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could call another hippy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dirty hippy kind of a hippie.</v>

1170
01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:50.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm essentially a weird version of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippie.</v>

1171
01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:54.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't fit into the mold because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>also a cage fighting commentator.</v>

1172
01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:57.690
<v Speaker 1>The diversity and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1173
01:04:57.691 --> 01:05:02.691
<v Speaker 1>the burning man used to have the genital</v>
<v Speaker 1>portraits studio and the portrait</v>

1174
01:05:03.481 --> 01:05:07.280
<v Speaker 1>studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you punderdome you would love was</v>

1175
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:08.700
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should know.</v>

1176
01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Range guns.</v>

1177
01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have open bars</v>

1178
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.100
<v Speaker 3>there and they're giving it all away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing about burning man is it's a</v>

1179
01:05:21.101 --> 01:05:24.220
<v Speaker 3>gift economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's an experiment in gift economy.</v>

1180
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.480
<v Speaker 3>You not once you get in and it caused</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to get in of course,</v>

1181
01:05:28.481 --> 01:05:31.000
<v Speaker 3>but once you get in it's like you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>take your wallet out,</v>

1182
01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:33.310
<v Speaker 3>you can't pay for anything and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>no bartering.</v>

1183
01:05:33.311 --> 01:05:35.950
<v Speaker 3>It's only gifting and people give it</v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

1184
01:05:36.810 --> 01:05:38.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the thunder.</v>

1185
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:42.070
<v Speaker 3>They're like nerf sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It don't really hurt each other,</v>

1186
01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:44.110
<v Speaker 3>but they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they knocked them to try to knock</v>

1187
01:05:44.111 --> 01:05:48.940
<v Speaker 3>them off of their perch there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although they're swinging on those ropes</v>

1188
01:05:48.941 --> 01:05:50.710
<v Speaker 3>in that dome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dome frame.</v>

1189
01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.540
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all kinds.</v>

1190
01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:54.790
<v Speaker 3>There's 80,000 people there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the best,</v>

1191
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:58.120
<v Speaker 3>biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most amazing environment.</v>

1192
01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like being on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like not like being nowhere else on</v>

1193
01:06:01.601 --> 01:06:04.050
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to always carry your ma,</v>

1194
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:08.400
<v Speaker 3>your dust mask and your goggles and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>hair covering and your camelback.</v>

1195
01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:13.480
<v Speaker 3>It's so drawing that you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking like a couple of gallons a day,</v>

1196
01:06:13.481 --> 01:06:14.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to,</v>

1197
01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:16.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no insects there.</v>

1198
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:20.050
<v Speaker 3>There is not a blade of any kind of life</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1199
01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:24.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like walking on the moon seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except you can breathe,</v>

1200
01:06:24.431 --> 01:06:28.630
<v Speaker 3>but you have to have a face man because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dust storms just come up at any</v>

1201
01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:30.700
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's anyone done a documentary on it</v>

1202
01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.280
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many over the years.</v>

1203
01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:35.350
<v Speaker 3>So when you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's dudes taking cameras in your</v>

1204
01:06:35.351 --> 01:06:36.360
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that sort of.</v>

1205
01:06:36.361 --> 01:06:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to have permission?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is very regulated now and I</v>

1206
01:06:39.971 --> 01:06:43.590
<v Speaker 3>understand they're behind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm hoping they'll have some good</v>

1207
01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.960
<v Speaker 3>because they'd been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1208
01:06:44.970 --> 01:06:48.250
<v Speaker 3>That was an infrastructure where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>said that like somebody offered you a a</v>

1209
01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:52.780
<v Speaker 3>beautiful cake and buying land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Land is good for our community.</v>

1210
01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:57.781
<v Speaker 3>We should own our own places of of</v>
<v Speaker 3>attraction because that is the way you</v>

1211
01:06:59.771 --> 01:07:04.540
<v Speaker 3>gain transformational power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>power to transform.</v>

1212
01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:09.540
<v Speaker 3>You basically have land in place and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>build that infrastructure,</v>

1213
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:13.990
<v Speaker 3>this culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way it's structured.</v>

1214
01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:15.760
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that beautiful?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really cool.</v>

1215
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.050
<v Speaker 3>It really is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The center part is called the Playa and</v>

1216
01:07:20.051 --> 01:07:22.930
<v Speaker 3>it's about nine feet across from from</v>
<v Speaker 3>end to end.</v>

1217
01:07:22.931 --> 01:07:26.030
<v Speaker 3>Like big circle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest nine miles,</v>

1218
01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.213
<v Speaker 3>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine feet,</v>

1219
01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:30.160
<v Speaker 3>nine miles across,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can walk the whole way.</v>

1220
01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:32.620
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people have art cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles,</v>

1221
01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.600
<v Speaker 3>well from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from edge to edge,</v>

1222
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:36.070
<v Speaker 3>that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outer Edge.</v>

1223
01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:39.650
<v Speaker 3>It's managing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

1224
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:45.150
<v Speaker 3>Sixty to 80 and it's payable and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody takes care of each other.</v>

1225
01:07:45.581 --> 01:07:46.950
<v Speaker 3>You have to have your own food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

1226
01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:50.380
<v Speaker 3>You got to come in there with water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>food and everything and you're not</v>

1227
01:07:50.381 --> 01:07:53.980
<v Speaker 3>allowed to pull her or drop anything on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>

1228
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:57.400
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have and they have full showers.</v>

1229
01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:58.770
<v Speaker 3>Broader camp is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1230
01:07:58.780 --> 01:07:59.440
<v Speaker 3>you get foam.</v>

1231
01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.930
<v Speaker 3>Do you know they have a big foam dome</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

1232
01:08:01.931 --> 01:08:06.610
<v Speaker 3>But you got to collect all that water</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they collect them in these great big</v>

1233
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:10.780
<v Speaker 3>gray water tankers and take them away</v>
<v Speaker 3>and bring in fresh water.</v>

1234
01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:14.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're practicing setting up</v>
<v Speaker 3>a village in,</v>

1235
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:18.530
<v Speaker 3>in light of the apocalypse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you this is the practice</v>

1236
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:19.910
<v Speaker 3>ready?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1237
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:22.150
<v Speaker 3>These people can go in and in a week or</v>
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>

1238
01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:25.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the army went in there to study</v>

1239
01:08:25.491 --> 01:08:28.100
<v Speaker 3>this because they could do this in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of weeks.</v>

1240
01:08:28.101 --> 01:08:32.450
<v Speaker 3>They put it all together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's very much apocalyptic</v>

1241
01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:33.740
<v Speaker 3>preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1242
01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:38.760
<v Speaker 3>you would think you would get great</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit from seeing it and get material</v>

1243
01:08:39.131 --> 01:08:42.650
<v Speaker 3>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should come be with our camp,</v>

1244
01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.530
<v Speaker 3>you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1245
01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:49.100
<v Speaker 3>it is the week that leads to Labor Day</v>
<v Speaker 3>weekend.</v>

1246
01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:54.140
<v Speaker 3>So that's like the first weekend of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the first Monday of the first Monday</v>

1247
01:08:54.141 --> 01:08:55.280
<v Speaker 3>of September is Labor.</v>

1248
01:08:55.790 --> 01:09:00.790
<v Speaker 3>So it's the weekend before the Monday of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Labor Day and they have the temple burn</v>

1249
01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:06.340
<v Speaker 3>is on Saturday night and Sunday night</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the man is burned on Saturday night.</v>

1250
01:09:06.771 --> 01:09:09.080
<v Speaker 3>So when the man is burned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1251
01:09:09.081 --> 01:09:10.580
<v Speaker 3>100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>800,000,</v>

1252
01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:15.020
<v Speaker 3>80,000 people come together to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like everybody comes in a big</v>

1253
01:09:15.021 --> 01:09:17.360
<v Speaker 3>circle around the man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the man?</v>

1254
01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:19.060
<v Speaker 3>There he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be like you're gonna get</v>

1255
01:09:19.061 --> 01:09:20.090
<v Speaker 3>the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what?</v>

1256
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:23.990
<v Speaker 3>They have a thousand fire spinners</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the man.</v>

1257
01:09:23.991 --> 01:09:27.100
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to audition to be a fire spin</v>

1258
01:09:27.101 --> 01:09:29.180
<v Speaker 3>around the man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have about a thousand of them</v>

1259
01:09:29.181 --> 01:09:32.330
<v Speaker 3>and they're spinning whips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Joe,</v>

1260
01:09:32.331 --> 01:09:37.331
<v Speaker 3>they're spinning swords and poor boy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all kinds of Hula hoops are are on</v>

1261
01:09:39.111 --> 01:09:42.020
<v Speaker 3>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most amazing thing and you go</v>

1262
01:09:42.021 --> 01:09:44.870
<v Speaker 3>there on your art car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed to go in,</v>

1263
01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.860
<v Speaker 3>apply at all unless your car is approved</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an art car.</v>

1264
01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:51.380
<v Speaker 3>That means it has to be show some art</v>
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>

1265
01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:55.880
<v Speaker 3>Our cars are incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got big ships like rolling along</v>

1266
01:09:55.881 --> 01:09:58.250
<v Speaker 3>the Playa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know they have gigantic three</v>

1267
01:09:58.251 --> 01:10:02.930
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Structures that move to kind of be</v>

1268
01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:07.220
<v Speaker 3>enhancing the environment they do and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to be all they have to be art.</v>

1269
01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:12.250
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why they even do them at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all in one big way is so that you can</v>

1270
01:10:12.261 --> 01:10:16.220
<v Speaker 3>get on the top of them so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>see over everybody else.</v>

1271
01:10:16.221 --> 01:10:19.940
<v Speaker 3>When you go to see the man and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>see all these fire spinners that are all</v>

1272
01:10:19.941 --> 01:10:22.040
<v Speaker 3>around this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to be up high,</v>

1273
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:24.590
<v Speaker 3>so you're part of dinosaur,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your party,</v>

1274
01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:27.830
<v Speaker 3>your parties up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all you got your own Dj.</v>

1275
01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1276
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:32.930
<v Speaker 3>this car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got its own Dj mine where Alex</v>

1277
01:10:32.931 --> 01:10:36.050
<v Speaker 3>painted it and we're going to be on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mayan Warrior this year.</v>

1278
01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.440
<v Speaker 3>Check out the line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does that work?</v>

1279
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:44.120
<v Speaker 3>People pay year round to park these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things in,</v>

1280
01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:48.650
<v Speaker 3>in girl latch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know an outsider is the non town.</v>

1281
01:10:48.651 --> 01:10:50.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like this town that grew up around</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie man.</v>

1282
01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:52.880
<v Speaker 3>They have like one store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1283
01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:55.760
<v Speaker 3>it's like you drive into this moon like</v>
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>

1284
01:10:56.190 --> 01:11:00.050
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this place is where wallboard is made.</v>

1285
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:02.810
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you peeled off the paper,</v>

1286
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:06.530
<v Speaker 3>that's what the Playa is like in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a skin.</v>

1287
01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:10.850
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to drop peanut shells</v>
<v Speaker 3>or anything on the ground and you have</v>

1288
01:11:10.851 --> 01:11:12.920
<v Speaker 3>to collect everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's extremely.</v>

1289
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1290
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.020
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn about saving water,</v>

1291
01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:18.540
<v Speaker 1>you can't believe how much you try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1292
01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:20.270
<v Speaker 1>save water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love the mine.</v>

1293
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:22.830
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1294
01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:25.320
<v Speaker 1>You?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you use to eliminate it with</v>

1295
01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:28.060
<v Speaker 1>all the painting is our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just click,</v>

1296
01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.010
<v Speaker 1>click on one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck on it,</v>

1297
01:11:29.011 --> 01:11:31.900
<v Speaker 1>stop flipping around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go to that show.</v>

1298
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.920
<v Speaker 1>The mask painting area that me on all</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the course,</v>

1299
01:11:37.261 --> 01:11:38.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you power that thing?</v>

1300
01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:41.410
<v Speaker 1>They do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay do it.</v>

1301
01:11:41.411 --> 01:11:43.620
<v Speaker 1>They all do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all have to have light on it.</v>

1302
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.390
<v Speaker 1>You can't even have a bicycle on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>plier without leds.</v>

1303
01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:50.610
<v Speaker 1>But what is what is illuminating this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is for people,</v>

1304
01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:56.520
<v Speaker 1>for people listening alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing is filled with beautiful</v>

1305
01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:01.580
<v Speaker 1>lights and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flower of life is in one of them.</v>

1306
01:12:01.891 --> 01:12:04.770
<v Speaker 1>And what are the other ones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The blue ones above the flower of life.</v>

1307
01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:06.350
<v Speaker 1>There's more flower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flower of life.</v>

1308
01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:10.680
<v Speaker 1>But also notice that there's a second</v>
<v Speaker 1>story and if you scroll down a little</v>

1309
01:12:10.681 --> 01:12:12.330
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see there's a third story.</v>

1310
01:12:12.331 --> 01:12:14.310
<v Speaker 1>See those people up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's loyalty.</v>

1311
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Those are the DJ's and the royalty</v>
<v Speaker 1>royalty.</v>

1312
01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm just joking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really it's like,</v>

1313
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:22.050
<v Speaker 1>you know the people who own the Mayan</v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior up there and they're best</v>

1314
01:12:22.051 --> 01:12:22.960
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1315
01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.540
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1316
01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:24.941
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1317
01:12:24.941 --> 01:12:26.700
<v Speaker 1>It's painted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a commission.</v>

1318
01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:33.240
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought it from Mexico City on its</v>

1319
01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:37.110
<v Speaker 1>own trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They drove it from Mexico City to cause</v>

1320
01:12:37.111 --> 01:12:38.730
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've thought that it was a Trojan</v>

1321
01:12:38.731 --> 01:12:42.170
<v Speaker 1>horse field</v>
<v Speaker 1>border.</v>

01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:45.500
<v Speaker 1>The border patrol have everybody out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>

1325
01:12:51.541 --> 01:12:53.730
<v Speaker 1>We looked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no Mexicans in here sneaking</v>

1326
01:12:53.731 --> 01:12:57.300
<v Speaker 1>across the border and will ask for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trojan horse.</v>

1327
01:12:57.450 --> 01:13:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Alex's collectors are probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most well meaning,</v>

1328
01:13:03.151 --> 01:13:05.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the most means of all Mexicans</v>

1329
01:13:05.551 --> 01:13:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are those stacks?</v>

1330
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.410
<v Speaker 1>The stack things is two stacks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>in the middle of a gypsum forest.</v>

1361
01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Sounds so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

1362
01:14:52.450 --> 01:14:56.170
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these people are extremely</v>

1363
01:14:56.171 --> 01:14:57.210
<v Speaker 1>wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking broader.</v>

<v Speaker 1>ever been to.</v>

1366

<v Speaker 1>That guy's definitely broke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guaranteed.</v>

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.640
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the alien that they found</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the movie alien.</v>

1369
01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:20.670
<v Speaker 1>The guy that's a guy from Google comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this guy from Google.</v>

1370
01:15:21.930 --> 01:15:26.930
<v Speaker 1>The children of the inventors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sound like a spokesperson for now.</v>

1371

<v Speaker 1>The blue light one.</v>

1375
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.960
<v Speaker 1>That seems like some industrial</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength.</v>

1376
01:15:37.961 --> 01:15:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Gas Mask type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like particle mask.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What about dust?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have goggles.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it,</v>

1379
01:15:51.491 --> 01:15:56.491
<v Speaker 1>but fuck that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was 14,</v>

1380
01:15:59.850 --> 01:16:01.540
<v Speaker 1>it was the first time we went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were invited.</v>

1381
01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Every time we've gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's brought us our daughters,</v>

1382
01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:10.180
<v Speaker 1>our daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was 14 and we were there,</v>

1383
01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:15.480
<v Speaker 1>will smith goes to burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of freaks should use it like a</v>

1384
01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.950
<v Speaker 1>mecca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go watch.</v>

1385
01:16:18.010 --> 01:16:23.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a freak show every year,</v>

1386
01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:27.160
<v Speaker 1>five times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like this is a great idea in a</v>

1387
01:16:27.161 --> 01:16:30.040
<v Speaker 1>shitty spot and this can be recreated</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere habitable.</v>

1388
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:32.030
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

1389
01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:35.690
<v Speaker 1>In so many barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason these are,</v>

1390
01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:40.840
<v Speaker 1>it's an art festival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make a sculpture it and they put it</v>

1391
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:44.140
<v Speaker 1>on the bare ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like going into a white gallery,</v>

1392
01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:47.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like going into like a white out</v>

1393
01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:51.400
<v Speaker 1>and then you put an object there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly you've got a lot of space around</v>

1394
01:16:51.401 --> 01:16:54.610
<v Speaker 1>it so you can really look at any man's</v>
<v Speaker 1>sculpture,</v>

1395
01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:56.380
<v Speaker 1>sculpture.</v>

1396
01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:01.380
<v Speaker 1>It's about seeing the art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not for everybody.</v>

1397
01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's an extraordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a outgrowth of visionary culture.</v>

1398
01:17:10.431 --> 01:17:13.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally joking around obviously when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm mocking it,</v>

1399
01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:18.760
<v Speaker 1>but that's my nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fire fire before know we.</v>

1400
01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:22.040
<v Speaker 1>We were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a sculpture at cars and that was</v>

1401
01:17:22.041 --> 01:17:26.390
<v Speaker 1>on the plier to two stories sculpture at</v>
<v Speaker 1>at and we're getting another one.</v>

1402
01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:30.560
<v Speaker 1>People with them afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went someplace to put them.</v>

1403
01:17:30.561 --> 01:17:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Will cause them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has 40 acres,</v>

1404
01:17:31.941 --> 01:17:35.660
<v Speaker 1>so we're gonna end up with probably more</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're going to ship burning man</v>

1405
01:17:35.670 --> 01:17:36.950
<v Speaker 1>sculptures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do that.</v>

1406
01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you going to ship it to us?</v>

1407
01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.180
<v Speaker 1>We pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

1408
01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:44.600
<v Speaker 1>That and it that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

1409
01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.000
<v Speaker 1>And you go out there and you just visit</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these sculptures.</v>

1410
01:17:47.001 --> 01:17:50.420
<v Speaker 1>It's nine miles of sculpture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just go ride your bike from</v>

1411
01:17:50.421 --> 01:17:52.070
<v Speaker 1>sculpture to sculpture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them,</v>

1412
01:17:52.071 --> 01:17:55.310
<v Speaker 1>most of them are interactive so you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>go inside of them.</v>

1413
01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:58.430
<v Speaker 1>You can climb up in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sometimes they have swings and a</v>

1414
01:17:58.490 --> 01:18:01.300
<v Speaker 1>lot of them have fire coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible because you can.</v>

1415
01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:05.890
<v Speaker 1>You can light things on fire there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes it so exciting to us.</v>

1416
01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:08.880
<v Speaker 1>This is the Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Belgian waffles,</v>

1417
01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Kate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kate,</v>

1418
01:18:10.690 --> 01:18:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Kate Rod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sculptured cause what?</v>

1419
01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Cade Rod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she does a laser cut cold rolled</v>

1420
01:18:16.851 --> 01:18:20.570
<v Speaker 1>steel sculptures that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are interacting with their pods.</v>

1421
01:18:20.571 --> 01:18:22.740
<v Speaker 1>You sit in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're real comfy there.</v>

1422
01:18:23.050 --> 01:18:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>

1423
01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.720
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people that are listening,</v>

1424
01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:27.890
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1425
01:18:27.891 --> 01:18:29.150
<v Speaker 1>look at verse one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sculpture.</v>

1426
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:34.040
<v Speaker 1>For people that are listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at this geometric object</v>

1427
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:37.790
<v Speaker 1>that's circular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's got squared edges.</v>

1428
01:18:37.791 --> 01:18:39.290
<v Speaker 1>What would you call that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

1429
01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:45.560
<v Speaker 1>what does that a sacred geometric form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these guys are.</v>

1430
01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:52.430
<v Speaker 1>They're from San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know these guys.</v>

1431
01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this,</v>

1432
01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:57.420
<v Speaker 1>whatever this geometric form is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's making my chandelier?</v>

1433
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:58.260
<v Speaker 1>This?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1434
01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:01.060
<v Speaker 1>they're making my chandelier's for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Ian.</v>

1435
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have chandelier's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1436
01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:07.910
<v Speaker 1>that were light where they turn and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>light falls on people.</v>

1437
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.540
<v Speaker 1>It's environmental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called Jamie a fest.</v>

1438
01:19:11.541 --> 01:19:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred a sneak peek at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coolest art coming to burning man.</v>

1439
01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:19.400
<v Speaker 1>So you could see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1440
01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.050
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go google it,</v>

1441
01:19:21.051 --> 01:19:23.480
<v Speaker 1>it's really stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This image.</v>

1442
01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a magazine that has a bunch</v>

1443
01:19:26.001 --> 01:19:27.350
<v Speaker 1>of these images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

1444
01:19:27.351 --> 01:19:29.270
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1445
01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:30.650
<v Speaker 1>Almost worth going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1446
01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you bring a big tour bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring an Rv,</v>

1447
01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:37.940
<v Speaker 1>you little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to come,</v>

1448
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:38.833
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that.</v>

1449
01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.850
<v Speaker 1>You want to come with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you</v>

1450
01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:43.960
<v Speaker 1>kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1451
01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.910
<v Speaker 1>we don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long does it take to get out there?</v>

1452
01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Where is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1453
01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Tens of thousands of people do come</v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

1454
01:19:49.730 --> 01:19:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Where is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a black rock city out in about an</v>

1455
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:55.810
<v Speaker 1>hour from Reno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevada.</v>

1456
01:19:57.690 --> 01:19:59.570
<v Speaker 1>It's probably got a lot of nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy out there,</v>

1457
01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will do those tests you ever see that?</v>

1458
01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animated Gif.</v>

1459
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like a little movie of all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear tests</v>

1460
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:13.100
<v Speaker 2>that they've done in Nevada</v>
<v Speaker 2>might explain a lot about what's going</v>

1461
01:20:13.771 --> 01:20:15.440
<v Speaker 2>on out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done hundreds of them just to,</v>

1462
01:20:15.441 --> 01:20:19.530
<v Speaker 2>to digital digital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did this thing from like 1940,</v>

1463
01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:22.980
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was the time when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>detonated the first atomic bomb to</v>

1464
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:28.070
<v Speaker 2>present at the bottom of a see that once</v>
<v Speaker 2>was made of crushed shell and you know,</v>

1465
01:20:30.991 --> 01:20:33.270
<v Speaker 2>it feels like sand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you walk on it,</v>

1466
01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:36.600
<v Speaker 2>he won't be able to use your feet in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the winter.</v>

1467
01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:41.700
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying is if you're out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your feet,</v>

1468
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.000
<v Speaker 2>you won't be able to use your feet in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle of the winter.</v>

1469
01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:47.010
<v Speaker 2>Tracking the cracking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in the middle of winter.</v>

1470
01:20:47.011 --> 01:20:49.250
<v Speaker 2>I did it once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just telling you it,</v>

1471
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.890
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1472
01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:52.980
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to walk back from the man to our</v>

1473
01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:57.930
<v Speaker 2>camp without any shoes because I lost my</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoes and I walked back through and it</v>

1474
01:20:57.931 --> 01:21:02.931
<v Speaker 2>feels like sand at first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it's like knives.</v>

1475
01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:05.340
<v Speaker 2>He likes little tiny little knives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like shells.</v>

1476
01:21:05.341 --> 01:21:07.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like crushed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crushed shells and it messed up your</v>

1477
01:21:07.711 --> 01:21:10.650
<v Speaker 2>feet and all winter I was dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>cracked feet,</v>

1478
01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:15.150
<v Speaker 2>happy feet burning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See you have to wear boots and really</v>

1479
01:21:15.151 --> 01:21:20.151
<v Speaker 2>cover and it gets to be like 110 degrees</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the day and 40 degrees at night.</v>

1480
01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like you're trying to keep me off</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to keep me off the thing.</v>

1481
01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:30.260
<v Speaker 2>We're building a place at caution that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to how some of the sculptures</v>

1482
01:21:31.021 --> 01:21:36.021
<v Speaker 2>and have little sculptural areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have these small gatherings by</v>

1483
01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:40.290
<v Speaker 2>comparison to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll never be huge like that though,</v>

1484
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:45.390
<v Speaker 2>but hundreds of people will gather so it</v>
<v Speaker 2>can still feel kind of tribal and</v>

1485
01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:49.650
<v Speaker 2>community oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of the same music is enjoyed.</v>

1486
01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.620
<v Speaker 2>We always have fire circle and we always</v>
<v Speaker 2>have fire spinning.</v>

1487
01:21:52.650 --> 01:21:55.720
<v Speaker 2>We actually teach fire spinning it cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>of getting,</v>

1488
01:21:56.290 --> 01:21:57.690
<v Speaker 2>not of hand like fire.</v>

1489
01:21:57.750 --> 01:22:02.160
<v Speaker 2>All that fire spinning around there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people are the most cautious.</v>

1490
01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:05.040
<v Speaker 2>And we also have a relationship with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire department.</v>

1491
01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:08.280
<v Speaker 2>They're in our town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a sheriff on property,</v>

1492
01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

1493
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:14.760
<v Speaker 2>at each event where there are large</v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers of people.</v>

1494
01:22:15.150 --> 01:22:16.250
<v Speaker 2>And so we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1495
01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:19.380
<v Speaker 2>safety first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's ways of doing it.</v>

1496
01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:24.510
<v Speaker 2>So when do you anticipate this entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>

1497
01:22:24.511 --> 01:22:26.520
<v Speaker 2>The entire cause of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should tell everybody.</v>

1498
01:22:26.521 --> 01:22:30.240
<v Speaker 2>That means chapel of sacred mirrors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what caused them stands for.</v>

1499
01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:34.830
<v Speaker 2>And when do you anticipate that being</v>
<v Speaker 2>fully operational and</v>

1500
01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:38.190
<v Speaker 2>inaction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1501
01:22:38.670 --> 01:22:43.050
<v Speaker 2>right now it is open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're open like four days a week so that</v>

1502
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:46.860
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an ongoing stream of people who</v>

1503
01:22:46.861 --> 01:22:51.861
<v Speaker 2>just are visitors and there are a small</v>
<v Speaker 2>art exhibits that are on display now.</v>

1504
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:56.670
<v Speaker 2>We're working on anthon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the grand exhibit will be</v>

1505
01:22:56.671 --> 01:23:01.671
<v Speaker 2>housed and they exhibit that we had on</v>
<v Speaker 2>display for five years in the city that</v>

1506
01:23:02.161 --> 01:23:03.660
<v Speaker 2>is not currently on display.</v>

1507
01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:07.300
<v Speaker 2>The sacred marriage are not there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they will be in the new space.</v>

1508
01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:10.060
<v Speaker 2>And so the new space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we said,</v>

1509
01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:15.160
<v Speaker 2>we're thinking we'll open sometime in</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 probably toward the end of the year</v>

1510
01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:17.130
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1511
01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.000
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we can,</v>

1512
01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:21.170
<v Speaker 2>we will build the outside of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1513
01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:24.340
<v Speaker 2>the sculpture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a matter of how many years</v>

1514
01:23:24.341 --> 01:23:27.660
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna probably take a few years ago</v>

1515
01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:29.650
<v Speaker 2>when the power go lotto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1516
01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you were able to do.</v>

1517
01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Donations can come in all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get donations.</v>

1518
01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:36.880
<v Speaker 2>I think all these things can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1519
01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:38.860
<v Speaker 2>the kickstarter thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look Joe,</v>

1520
01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:43.890
<v Speaker 2>you were really helpful to us when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last time we did the podcast,</v>

1521
01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:49.860
<v Speaker 2>there was definitely a Rogan bump that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to the kickstarter that took us</v>

1522
01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:55.960
<v Speaker 2>to a new level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say good news is that there's probably</v>

1523
01:23:55.961 --> 01:23:56.794
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1524
01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:00.270
<v Speaker 1>how many more million people listening</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1525
01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:02.940
<v Speaker 1>like how many years ago was it that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys came on last three years?</v>

1526
01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:08.010
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting pilot 4 million downloads</v>

1527
01:24:08.011 --> 01:24:09.650
<v Speaker 1>a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably tripled that night,</v>

1528
01:24:09.651 --> 01:24:13.820
<v Speaker 1>I'd say three years ago at least triple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then with the youtube.</v>

1529
01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1530
01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:18.870
<v Speaker 1>So let's say we're in the neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 30 million downloads a month.</v>

1531
01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Joining us and being a temple builder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joining us,</v>

1532
01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:30.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's going to be a lot</v>

1533
01:24:30.961 --> 01:24:33.900
<v Speaker 1>of people that are excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what the idea behind it is</v>

1534
01:24:33.901 --> 01:24:36.150
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you guys are leaving it</v>

1535
01:24:36.151 --> 01:24:37.940
<v Speaker 1>for the community and building it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the community.</v>

1536
01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1537
01:24:39.601 --> 01:24:44.190
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the best arguments for</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion that I've ever heard and best</v>

1538
01:24:44.191 --> 01:24:47.580
<v Speaker 1>arguments for having a religion be tax</v>
<v Speaker 1>exempt that I've ever heard.</v>

1539
01:24:47.610 --> 01:24:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are literally doing it for</v>

1540
01:24:49.231 --> 01:24:50.760
<v Speaker 1>other people and you're doing it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

1541
01:24:51.210 --> 01:24:52.320
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1542
01:24:52.321 --> 01:24:55.260
<v Speaker 1>your artwork is just a huge fan of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

1543
01:24:55.261 --> 01:24:58.710
<v Speaker 1>And I just think that the design itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>is literally,</v>

1544
01:24:58.711 --> 01:25:00.570
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the coolest building on the</v>

1545
01:25:00.571 --> 01:25:02.260
<v Speaker 1>planet and it's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1546
01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:06.840
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is essentially an</v>
<v Speaker 1>extension of the great works of all</v>

1547
01:25:06.841 --> 01:25:07.674
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1548
01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:10.650
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about the sistine</v>
<v Speaker 1>chapel or if you're talking about the</v>

1549
01:25:10.710 --> 01:25:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian pyramids or any of these sacred</v>
<v Speaker 1>sites that exist all throughout the</v>

1550
01:25:15.091 --> 01:25:17.550
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing a modern version of that</v>

1551
01:25:17.551 --> 01:25:18.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

1552
01:25:18.631 --> 01:25:19.590
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really cool.</v>

1553
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:25.350
<v Speaker 1>50 greatest works I think will be on</v>
<v Speaker 1>view there in their original form,</v>

1554
01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:31.860
<v Speaker 1>but the actual paintings that alex roped</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his own hand and some of them have</v>

1555
01:25:31.861 --> 01:25:34.980
<v Speaker 1>become really iconic to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of people out there that</v>

1556
01:25:34.981 --> 01:25:37.170
<v Speaker 1>have Alex's posters and tee shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1557
01:25:37.171 --> 01:25:41.060
<v Speaker 1>I have a bunch of plays and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to see the originals,</v>

1558
01:25:41.061 --> 01:25:43.870
<v Speaker 1>that's a study for other artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clay,</v>

1559
01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:47.850
<v Speaker 1>the prints that a lot of people have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the limited edition prints that they</v>

1560
01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:52.880
<v Speaker 1>have of paintings that wonderful labor</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensive artists is made.</v>

1561
01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard that word or that word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>limited edition prints that I've read</v>

1562
01:25:57.031 --> 01:25:58.980
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought that was like leaky or</v>

1563
01:25:59.230 --> 01:26:00.063
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1564
01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing about anthem</v>

1565
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:08.660
<v Speaker 4>is that it's going to display the work</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the International Visionary Art</v>

1566
01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:09.940
<v Speaker 4>Movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1567
01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:11.960
<v Speaker 4>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1568
01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.950
<v Speaker 4>if you liked my stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should see some of the young people</v>

1569
01:26:15.951 --> 01:26:18.800
<v Speaker 4>that are making art out of their</v>
<v Speaker 4>journeys.</v>

1570
01:26:18.801 --> 01:26:20.230
<v Speaker 4>Now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1571
01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:22.250
<v Speaker 4>they're evolving beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1572
01:26:22.251 --> 01:26:23.810
<v Speaker 4>my work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1573
01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:29.200
<v Speaker 4>also I think they're building an</v>
<v Speaker 4>encyclopedia of these dimensions of</v>

1574
01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:34.640
<v Speaker 4>altered states that people can say it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was something like that,</v>

1575
01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:39.860
<v Speaker 4>but it's very specific in that if you go</v>
<v Speaker 4>back before the 19 sixties and you look</v>

1576
01:26:39.951 --> 01:26:42.260
<v Speaker 4>at the art really didn't represent the</v>
<v Speaker 4>trips.</v>

1577
01:26:42.570 --> 01:26:43.490
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just didn't.</v>

1578
01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:44.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you look at it now,</v>

1579
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:49.990
<v Speaker 4>there's a giant body of art that</v>
<v Speaker 4>represents these psychedelic trips that</v>

1580
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:55.510
<v Speaker 4>really didn't exist before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in a lot of ways it is a quiet new</v>

1581
01:26:55.611 --> 01:27:00.350
<v Speaker 4>chapter in the world of art that one day</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people are gonna look back on.</v>

1582
01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:05.410
<v Speaker 4>And once we realize the ridiculousness</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the prohibition on drugs,</v>

1583
01:27:05.541 --> 01:27:08.390
<v Speaker 4>especially on psychedelic drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nontoxic,</v>

1584
01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:12.290
<v Speaker 4>non-problematic as far as like health</v>
<v Speaker 4>repercussions.</v>

1585
01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:15.800
<v Speaker 4>And you wonder like what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was it about our restrictive</v>

1586
01:27:15.801 --> 01:27:20.510
<v Speaker 4>society that put this sweeping</v>
<v Speaker 4>comprehensive ban on psychedelic</v>

1587
01:27:20.511 --> 01:27:23.210
<v Speaker 4>substances in 1970 and what were the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ramifications?</v>

1588
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:26.220
<v Speaker 4>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what were the consequences on society?</v>

1589
01:27:26.290 --> 01:27:31.290
<v Speaker 4>So there was no organic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no eco eco careers,</v>

1590
01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:33.260
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no,</v>

1591
01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:36.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>save the planet,</v>

1592
01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:39.530
<v Speaker 4>talk climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We never heard about that.</v>

1593
01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.780
<v Speaker 4>Growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was,</v>

1594
01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:42.800
<v Speaker 4>there was people that were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and they were circling,</v>

1595
01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:46.400
<v Speaker 4>certainly people that we're recycling</v>
<v Speaker 4>and composting and doing things along</v>

1596
01:27:46.401 --> 01:27:50.150
<v Speaker 4>those lines and trying to leave a</v>
<v Speaker 4>smaller footprint back then aware of it,</v>

1597
01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:55.300
<v Speaker 4>but as far as a gigantic global</v>
<v Speaker 4>conscious movement and also the urgency</v>

1598
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:59.510
<v Speaker 4>that's attached to it today where people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are stepping back and they're looking at</v>

1599
01:27:59.511 --> 01:28:03.350
<v Speaker 4>islands disappearing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're looking at the rising sea levels</v>

1600
01:28:03.351 --> 01:28:04.071
<v Speaker 4>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well blah blah blah,</v>

1601
01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:04.370
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

1602
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:07.100
<v Speaker 4>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is actually happening inside of our</v>

1603
01:28:07.101 --> 01:28:11.660
<v Speaker 4>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot going on that I think</v>

1604
01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:13.770
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1605
01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:17.720
<v Speaker 4>we're in the middle of and I think this</v>
<v Speaker 4>visionary art that,</v>

1606
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:20.450
<v Speaker 4>that is going on right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're sort of in the middle of that.</v>

1607
01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:23.690
<v Speaker 4>I think as we look back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or as people passed us,</v>

1608
01:28:23.691 --> 01:28:25.130
<v Speaker 4>look back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to say,</v>

1609
01:28:25.131 --> 01:28:28.100
<v Speaker 4>this is a very specific era.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was an era.</v>

1610
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:33.370
<v Speaker 4>Like if you go back and look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>religious history and you look at the,</v>

1611
01:28:33.650 --> 01:28:36.040
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the enlightenment and you look at the</v>

1612
01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:41.000
<v Speaker 4>various styles of art that's connected</v>
<v Speaker 4>to religion or cultural change,</v>

1613
01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:42.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see these big shifts.</v>

1614
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:46.400
<v Speaker 4>I think the visionary art of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Psychedelics is a big shift.</v>

1615
01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:47.790
<v Speaker 4>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1616
01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:53.340
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's showing that the big news today is</v>

1617
01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:56.620
<v Speaker 4>the Sacramento,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1618
01:28:57.770 --> 01:28:59.810
<v Speaker 4>sort of reformation.</v>

1619
01:28:59.870 --> 01:29:03.990
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's a return of the sacrament</v>

1620
01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:07.920
<v Speaker 4>to the West.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been demonized and hidden for</v>

1621
01:29:07.921 --> 01:29:11.940
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's back and you're not going to</v>

1622
01:29:11.941 --> 01:29:15.510
<v Speaker 4>get rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's here because we need it.</v>

1623
01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:20.610
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing that's going to turn</v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness around toward a sacred</v>

1624
01:29:20.611 --> 01:29:25.611
<v Speaker 4>planet that wants to save itself from</v>
<v Speaker 4>self destruction like psychedelics.</v>

1625
01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:30.120
<v Speaker 4>There is no greater prescription,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1626
01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:34.590
<v Speaker 4>for soul medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then this is the stuff that is curing</v>

1627
01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.580
<v Speaker 4>all of the traumatic stress of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the vets,</v>

1628
01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:41.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana is part a,</v>

1629
01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:46.970
<v Speaker 4>is leading the way in the medicinals and</v>
<v Speaker 4>opening the door literally for the</v>

1630
01:29:47.341 --> 01:29:50.310
<v Speaker 4>sacred drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the return of the sacred drugs.</v>

1631
01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:55.320
<v Speaker 4>Now we don't even have a context a</v>
<v Speaker 4>established in America,</v>

1632
01:29:55.321 --> 01:29:57.160
<v Speaker 4>but it's beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1633
01:29:57.270 --> 01:30:00.570
<v Speaker 4>the UDV church one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their right to use the sacrament.</v>

1634
01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:06.020
<v Speaker 4>The native American church has pod.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is legal precedent for religious</v>

1635
01:30:08.041 --> 01:30:08.970
<v Speaker 4>use already.</v>

1636
01:30:09.810 --> 01:30:14.810
<v Speaker 4>The best there has been throughout</v>
<v Speaker 4>history except for the last couple</v>

1637
01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:15.950
<v Speaker 4>thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well in,</v>

1638
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:17.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this country,</v>

1639
01:30:17.071 --> 01:30:18.840
<v Speaker 4>as you were talking about with Mtma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1640
01:30:18.841 --> 01:30:20.990
<v Speaker 4>just a really the last few decades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1641
01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:25.770
<v Speaker 4>And I'm five methoxy dimethyltryptamine</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I bought that stuff online,</v>

1642
01:30:26.170 --> 01:30:31.170
<v Speaker 4>like in the 2001 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can just order it from some chemical</v>

1643
01:30:31.471 --> 01:30:33.180
<v Speaker 4>company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sent you a bottle of it and get the</v>

1644
01:30:33.181 --> 01:30:34.920
<v Speaker 4>whole world hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>

1645
01:30:34.921 --> 01:30:36.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was great times it.</v>

1646
01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.170
<v Speaker 4>Yes it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1647
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:43.310
<v Speaker 4>somehow we've got to find a way to</v>
<v Speaker 4>incorporate these sacraments.</v>

1648
01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.680
<v Speaker 4>I think they're being incorporated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think one of the things that you</v>

1649
01:30:46.681 --> 01:30:49.380
<v Speaker 4>said that you just sort of glossed over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's incredibly important is that</v>

1650
01:30:49.381 --> 01:30:51.470
<v Speaker 4>marijuana is the door opener.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1651
01:30:51.570 --> 01:30:54.810
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana is the guy that you let into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the party that has the magic dust and</v>

1652
01:30:54.811 --> 01:30:59.811
<v Speaker 4>they went and he blew it on everybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>because once that gets in and especially</v>

1653
01:31:00.210 --> 01:31:04.260
<v Speaker 4>edible marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>edible marijuana is a psychedelic drug</v>

1654
01:31:04.290 --> 01:31:05.940
<v Speaker 4>and many people don't know it.</v>

1655
01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:09.060
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the reasons why when</v>
<v Speaker 4>people eat brownies or something,</v>

1656
01:31:09.061 --> 01:31:09.841
<v Speaker 4>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1657
01:31:09.841 --> 01:31:11.760
<v Speaker 4>someone laced the Brownie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1658
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:13.020
<v Speaker 4>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

1659
01:31:13.021 --> 01:31:16.020
<v Speaker 4>that is the most potent form of</v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana is the editable form of</v>

1660
01:31:16.021 --> 01:31:19.110
<v Speaker 4>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it is very visionary and especially</v>

1661
01:31:19.111 --> 01:31:21.930
<v Speaker 4>in high doses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's incredibly introspective acid,</v>

1662
01:31:21.931 --> 01:31:24.170
<v Speaker 4>like in a lot of ways you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1663
01:31:24.190 --> 01:31:29.190
<v Speaker 4>you get a perspective that is life</v>
<v Speaker 4>changing and shifting and it's one of</v>

1664
01:31:29.911 --> 01:31:34.911
<v Speaker 4>those directional shifts where even if</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a small degree of change over the</v>

1665
01:31:35.281 --> 01:31:38.820
<v Speaker 4>course of the rest of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that small degree of change could equal</v>

1666
01:31:38.821 --> 01:31:42.960
<v Speaker 4>a very large shift in the direction that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going as you continue down your</v>

1667
01:31:42.961 --> 01:31:45.540
<v Speaker 4>path.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That slight turn to the right will make</v>

1668
01:31:45.541 --> 01:31:48.420
<v Speaker 4>a huge difference five years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 years from now,</v>

1669
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:53.870
<v Speaker 4>I think marijuana becoming legal in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Colorado and we are seeing not just the</v>

1670
01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:59.540
<v Speaker 4>positive benefits in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>community you're looking at that are</v>

1671
01:32:00.311 --> 01:32:03.520
<v Speaker 4>making way more money than they've ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>made before.</v>

1672
01:32:03.670 --> 01:32:07.390
<v Speaker 4>You're looking at housing prices,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real estate prices going up.</v>

1673
01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:11.290
<v Speaker 4>People having a new sense of community</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they like,</v>

1674
01:32:11.291 --> 01:32:12.640
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's others like us.</v>

1675
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:17.260
<v Speaker 4>It's like a magnet for freaks and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've all flown into Colorado and set</v>

1676
01:32:17.261 --> 01:32:19.060
<v Speaker 4>up shop there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating.</v>

1677
01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:24.300
<v Speaker 4>I did a show there a couple months ago</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the Belko theater and it was amazing.</v>

1678
01:32:24.851 --> 01:32:27.340
<v Speaker 4>It was like this place has changed in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

1679
01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:31.840
<v Speaker 4>I recorded my last comedy special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm about two years ago,</v>

1680
01:32:31.841 --> 01:32:36.010
<v Speaker 4>two years in August in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I did the most recent one about</v>

1681
01:32:36.011 --> 01:32:39.700
<v Speaker 4>six months ago in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The most recent show that I did there,</v>

1682
01:32:39.970 --> 01:32:43.210
<v Speaker 4>and I could feel the shift when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>driving down the street,</v>

1683
01:32:43.211 --> 01:32:45.940
<v Speaker 4>you see the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's pot everywhere.</v>

1684
01:32:45.941 --> 01:32:49.750
<v Speaker 4>There's people are smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lowest incidence of drunk driving.</v>

1685
01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:53.320
<v Speaker 4>They've ever recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lowest incidents of violent crime.</v>

1686
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:57.110
<v Speaker 4>Everything is dropping suicide rates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1687
01:32:57.130 --> 01:32:58.210
<v Speaker 4>and money.</v>

1688
01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:01.090
<v Speaker 4>Money that the state is making isn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>insane.</v>

1689
01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:03.310
<v Speaker 4>They literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a surplus of taxes.</v>

1690
01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:06.760
<v Speaker 4>It's an attractor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've made more money from taxes from</v>

1691
01:33:06.761 --> 01:33:10.060
<v Speaker 4>marijuana than they did from alcohol for</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time ever.</v>

1692
01:33:10.210 --> 01:33:13.750
<v Speaker 4>No one's ever done that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you've got this happy community and</v>

1693
01:33:13.751 --> 01:33:17.140
<v Speaker 4>now Seattle is entered into the mix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now Washington DC's enter into the</v>

1694
01:33:17.141 --> 01:33:19.500
<v Speaker 4>Mexican November.</v>
<v Speaker 4>California's going to vote on it.</v>

1695
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:22.360
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee it's going to go through it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes,</v>

1696
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:26.290
<v Speaker 4>of course it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Try to extend a little blessing New York</v>

1697
01:33:26.291 --> 01:33:26.921
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1698
01:33:26.921 --> 01:33:30.310
<v Speaker 4>Because New York is so far behind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so ashamed of us.</v>

1699
01:33:30.311 --> 01:33:33.490
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to move into action and our</v>

1700
01:33:33.491 --> 01:33:37.030
<v Speaker 4>people little happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just love it so much.</v>

1701
01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:41.890
<v Speaker 4>I think that just the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ideologies that are were in place</v>

1702
01:33:41.891 --> 01:33:44.010
<v Speaker 4>that stopped it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There roading.</v>

1703
01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:46.540
<v Speaker 4>Those people are too old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're too out of touch.</v>

1704
01:33:46.541 --> 01:33:51.190
<v Speaker 4>They don't understand the mindset of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>young people and they've really</v>

1705
01:33:51.191 --> 01:33:53.710
<v Speaker 4>underestimated the power of this</v>
<v Speaker 4>movement.</v>

1706
01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:56.710
<v Speaker 4>They.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a wave and you can't suppress it</v>

1707
01:33:56.711 --> 01:33:58.660
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't lose of people that are</v>

1708
01:33:58.661 --> 01:34:00.210
<v Speaker 4>upwardly spiraling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1709
01:34:00.211 --> 01:34:04.570
<v Speaker 4>The people that are healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all positive ecological,</v>

1710
01:34:04.571 --> 01:34:09.571
<v Speaker 4>save the planet educated more thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such an attractor and so everybody</v>

1711
01:34:10.931 --> 01:34:12.480
<v Speaker 4>wants to be part of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wonder what's.</v>

1712
01:34:12.530 --> 01:34:14.650
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll have a power.</v>

1713
01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:17.320
<v Speaker 4>It's what we were talking about earlier</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we're talking about plant</v>

1714
01:34:17.321 --> 01:34:20.410
<v Speaker 4>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is an intelligence in marijuana</v>

1715
01:34:20.411 --> 01:34:24.790
<v Speaker 4>and absolute undoubted intelligence when</v>
<v Speaker 4>it exists.</v>

1716
01:34:24.791 --> 01:34:28.130
<v Speaker 4>I think in all plants that exists in</v>
<v Speaker 4>funguses as not that</v>

1717
01:34:28.290 --> 01:34:33.290
<v Speaker 2>not all plants are mirroring systems</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of the human body like cannabis,</v>

1718
01:34:35.730 --> 01:34:40.320
<v Speaker 2>since it was the probably the original</v>
<v Speaker 2>or one of the original culture</v>

1719
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:45.150
<v Speaker 2>cultivated plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that humanity over the millennia</v>

1720
01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:49.740
<v Speaker 2>worked out a symbiotic relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this plant and so we have the</v>

1721
01:34:49.741 --> 01:34:53.420
<v Speaker 2>endocannabinoid system and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1722
01:34:53.970 --> 01:34:58.970
<v Speaker 2>and I would say that probably many of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our health deficiencies are because</v>

1723
01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:04.210
<v Speaker 2>we're not getting our cannabis thc</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficiencies and uh,</v>

1724
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:05.140
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1725
01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:10.140
<v Speaker 2>let's try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Ama in the thirties went to Congress</v>

1726
01:35:10.941 --> 01:35:14.180
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't make cannabis illegal.</v>

1727
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:17.450
<v Speaker 2>It's in half of our Madison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1728
01:35:17.451 --> 01:35:20.090
<v Speaker 2>for 87 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been part of the American</v>

1729
01:35:20.091 --> 01:35:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Pharmacopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please allow us to continue to use it.</v>

1730
01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:27.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was struck down and so it's been</v>

1731
01:35:27.531 --> 01:35:31.160
<v Speaker 2>repressed a sense then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of it has just been pure</v>

1732
01:35:31.161 --> 01:35:33.920
<v Speaker 2>racism actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the cause of it.</v>

1733
01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was what those recent papers were</v>

1734
01:35:36.021 --> 01:35:39.890
<v Speaker 4>released about the Nixon administration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the ways they demonize the</v>

1735
01:35:39.891 --> 01:35:42.380
<v Speaker 4>black rights movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>civil rights movement,</v>

1736
01:35:42.381 --> 01:35:47.090
<v Speaker 4>and also the antiwar movement is they</v>
<v Speaker 4>attack marijuana and they attacked</v>

1737
01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:51.020
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic drugs and that was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason why they pass that sweeping</v>

1738
01:35:51.021 --> 01:35:54.770
<v Speaker 4>legislation in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was just to be able to have a reason to</v>

1739
01:35:54.771 --> 01:35:56.540
<v Speaker 4>arrest those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They knew they could attack the</v>

1740
01:35:56.541 --> 01:35:58.850
<v Speaker 4>communities and attacking those</v>
<v Speaker 4>communities.</v>

1741
01:35:59.150 --> 01:36:02.780
<v Speaker 4>The best way to do it was to go after</v>
<v Speaker 4>the drugs next and hated them.</v>

1742
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:07.870
<v Speaker 4>And Nixon was a traitor to America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nixon was probably with Bush,</v>

1743
01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:16.960
<v Speaker 4>one of the worst we've ever experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And through his hatred and venom,</v>

1744
01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:22.100
<v Speaker 4>we have the drug war that now for over</v>
<v Speaker 4>40 years,</v>

1745
01:36:22.101 --> 01:36:27.101
<v Speaker 4>we've just been laboring under the boot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a fascist trader that want resigned</v>

1746
01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:28.963
<v Speaker 4>from office.</v>

1747
01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:29.860
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

1748
01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:32.710
<v Speaker 3>he was impeached really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that I wanted to say,</v>

1749
01:36:32.711 --> 01:36:34.750
<v Speaker 3>go back to what you were saying about</v>
<v Speaker 3>fungus,</v>

1750
01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:37.680
<v Speaker 3>because people sometimes ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does l,</v>

1751
01:36:37.810 --> 01:36:39.340
<v Speaker 3>what is Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it,</v>

1752
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:40.990
<v Speaker 3>what does it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

1753
01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:44.110
<v Speaker 3>And I wanted to mentioned that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1754
01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:48.850
<v Speaker 3>recently there's microscopic images of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is,</v>

1755
01:36:48.851 --> 01:36:53.470
<v Speaker 3>is it's fungus growing on Rye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's these microscopic images that</v>

1756
01:36:53.471 --> 01:36:57.340
<v Speaker 3>you can call up and look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the LSD.</v>

1757
01:36:57.850 --> 01:37:00.940
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a field of little tiny</v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms.</v>

1758
01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:03.070
<v Speaker 3>That's all just microscopic.</v>

1759
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:04.730
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you remember the,</v>

1760
01:37:04.731 --> 01:37:08.330
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the revelation that they had the few,</v>

1761
01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:11.720
<v Speaker 4>few years back when they were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out what caused the Salem witch</v>

1762
01:37:11.721 --> 01:37:16.721
<v Speaker 4>trials and one of the leading theories</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that they had had a late frost and</v>

1763
01:37:18.230 --> 01:37:23.180
<v Speaker 4>the late frost had caused these funguses</v>
<v Speaker 4>to bread,</v>

1764
01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:26.810
<v Speaker 4>herbal or God to grow on bread and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>when that happened,</v>

1765
01:37:26.811 --> 01:37:31.370
<v Speaker 4>these people were experiencing very acid</v>
<v Speaker 4>like effects from eating bread.</v>

1766
01:37:31.570 --> 01:37:34.580
<v Speaker 4>And then they started freaking out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>blaming people for it and thinking that</v>

1767
01:37:34.581 --> 01:37:38.150
<v Speaker 4>they were being possessed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was a whole wave of paranoia that</v>

1768
01:37:38.151 --> 01:37:42.110
<v Speaker 4>came from that unbelievably fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you think about it that way,</v>

1769
01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:45.200
<v Speaker 4>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually the,</v>

1770
01:37:45.201 --> 01:37:47.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be cured from ergotism.</v>

1771
01:37:48.190 --> 01:37:49.490
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1772
01:37:49.491 --> 01:37:50.324
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1773
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:51.490
<v Speaker 4>Bishop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1774
01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 4>Flo bear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was responsible for sharp cathedral</v>

1775
01:37:56.270 --> 01:38:00.810
<v Speaker 2>a thousand years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically prayed to Mary and said,</v>

1776
01:38:01.290 --> 01:38:04.240
<v Speaker 2>if you'll cure me of this ergotism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1777
01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:08.160
<v Speaker 2>which is very dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it leaves so many visions,</v>

1778
01:38:08.161 --> 01:38:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I will build you the most beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 2>tempo ever built,</v>

1779
01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:14.580
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he was cured and he did found a</v>

1780
01:38:14.581 --> 01:38:16.320
<v Speaker 2>sharp cathedral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1781
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:17.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a result.</v>

1782
01:38:17.461 --> 01:38:21.300
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the core things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>ergotism Ergot,</v>

1783
01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:26.360
<v Speaker 2>but the coolest thing is definitely lsd</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Hoffman's ability to stabilize that.</v>

1784
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:29.383
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1785
01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

1786
01:38:30.810 --> 01:38:35.220
<v Speaker 2>so basically the coolest thing about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics to me is that they,</v>

1787
01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the end,</v>

1788
01:38:36.691 --> 01:38:40.980
<v Speaker 2>the science that has been done as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good Friday experiment and Roland</v>

1789
01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Griffiths work and that has basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>given us the best evidence for the</v>

1790
01:38:45.721 --> 01:38:50.721
<v Speaker 2>existence of God because 65 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who take psilocybin in it safe,</v>

1791
01:38:53.041 --> 01:38:55.110
<v Speaker 2>set and setting in there spiritually</v>
<v Speaker 2>inclined,</v>

1792
01:38:55.410 --> 01:38:59.130
<v Speaker 2>we'll have a full blown mystical</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that's now science.</v>

1793
01:38:59.131 --> 01:39:03.020
<v Speaker 2>It's proven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a majority of people who take a</v>

1794
01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:07.730
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic basically in a positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>setting and they don't know,</v>

1795
01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:10.800
<v Speaker 2>they're not a priest gets sold</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

1796
01:39:10.801 --> 01:39:12.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a borderline personality.</v>

1797
01:39:12.691 --> 01:39:13.650
<v Speaker 2>If you're stable,</v>

1798
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:15.290
<v Speaker 4>priest gets zone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1799
01:39:15.291 --> 01:39:16.750
<v Speaker 4>That's important to put out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1800
01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:19.610
<v Speaker 4>because I think that a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>think that psychedelics are for</v>

1801
01:39:19.611 --> 01:39:20.830
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not.</v>

1802
01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:23.420
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some folks amongst us that have</v>

1803
01:39:23.421 --> 01:39:28.421
<v Speaker 4>a very difficult time with just regular</v>
<v Speaker 4>stable sobriety and mental issues.</v>

1804
01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:30.960
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think in the end they're going to,</v>

1805
01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:33.630
<v Speaker 3>with science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with medicine and science,</v>

1806
01:39:33.631 --> 01:39:35.760
<v Speaker 3>I think what's going to be found out is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1807
01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:38.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these psychedelics are going to cure</v>

1808
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:40.680
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think that when they,</v>

1809
01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:44.370
<v Speaker 3>when they use it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's what the science is doing</v>

1810
01:39:44.371 --> 01:39:46.830
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're experimenting with all kinds of,</v>

1811
01:39:46.831 --> 01:39:50.430
<v Speaker 3>with schizophrenia what science is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's any studies with</v>

1812
01:39:50.431 --> 01:39:51.840
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

1813
01:39:51.930 --> 01:39:54.810
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it mirrors schizophrenia,</v>

1814
01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:57.120
<v Speaker 3>it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1815
01:39:57.930 --> 01:40:00.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that research will be done</v>

1816
01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:05.510
<v Speaker 3>related to all kinds of psychological</v>
<v Speaker 3>illness and um,</v>

1817
01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:08.580
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's curing so many things that can cure</v>

1818
01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:11.700
<v Speaker 3>a cluster headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the studies are,</v>

1819
01:40:11.701 --> 01:40:12.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Harvard,</v>

1820
01:40:12.631 --> 01:40:14.220
<v Speaker 3>Yale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Johns Hopkins,</v>

1821
01:40:14.221 --> 01:40:16.270
<v Speaker 3>all that big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the big universities that can,</v>

1822
01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:19.350
<v Speaker 3>that maps can get funding for their</v>
<v Speaker 3>funding.</v>

1823
01:40:19.351 --> 01:40:20.184
<v Speaker 3>All that</v>

1824
01:40:20.530 --> 01:40:25.530
<v Speaker 4>maps is really fascinating and amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what they've done is just add a,</v>

1825
01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:29.000
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an actual intellectual perspective on</v>

1826
01:40:29.001 --> 01:40:34.001
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic drugs and undeniably</v>
<v Speaker 4>researched really well documented</v>

1827
01:40:34.701 --> 01:40:36.350
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so important.</v>

1828
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:38.110
<v Speaker 4>When I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1829
01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:41.710
<v Speaker 4>my first experiences with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1830
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:43.970
<v Speaker 4>with maps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember thinking like,</v>

1831
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.160
<v Speaker 4>thank God there's someone like this out</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1832
01:40:46.190 --> 01:40:48.380
<v Speaker 4>Some someone like Doblin out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rick Doblin,</v>

1833
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:53.410
<v Speaker 4>who has taken the super intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 4>approach to recognizing what</v>

1834
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.950
<v Speaker 2>these substances are and what are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive benefits are and how can you</v>

1835
01:40:56.951 --> 01:41:00.520
<v Speaker 2>get these things slowly but surely</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the legal system and that's what</v>

1836
01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:04.160
<v Speaker 2>they're doing now with Mtma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're doing now with the</v>

1837
01:41:04.161 --> 01:41:08.770
<v Speaker 2>studies that they're doing on a soldiers</v>
<v Speaker 2>with posttraumatic stress disorder and</v>

1838
01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.840
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of other people to police</v>
<v Speaker 2>officers.</v>

1839
01:41:10.841 --> 01:41:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Anybody rape victims?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1840
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:16.050
<v Speaker 2>Violence victims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>

1841
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:18.310
<v Speaker 2>it's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the,</v>

1842
01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:22.960
<v Speaker 2>these are really beneficial things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were being denied and were being denied</v>

1843
01:41:22.961 --> 01:41:26.110
<v Speaker 2>by people who haven't experienced them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the most ironic aspect of it.</v>

1844
01:41:26.290 --> 01:41:28.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like something having penicillin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they won't let you try it.</v>

1845
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

1846
01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:32.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't use it themselves and we know</v>

1847
01:41:32.591 --> 01:41:37.591
<v Speaker 2>that such things as Ibogaine exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a way to interrupt opioid,</v>

1848
01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:42.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction and the addiction process.</v>

1849
01:41:43.150 --> 01:41:46.830
<v Speaker 2>This is a potential cure for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1850
01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:52.020
<v Speaker 2>the many millions of people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>currently opiate addicted.</v>

1851
01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Ibogaine therapy has been working out</v>
<v Speaker 2>miraculous results for people.</v>

1852
01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:01.330
<v Speaker 2>It helps them turn around their lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1853
01:42:01.410 --> 01:42:02.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>

1854
01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:06.010
<v Speaker 2>stop needing the chunk two to three</v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

1855
01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1856
01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.110
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a treatment.</v>

1857
01:42:08.170 --> 01:42:11.590
<v Speaker 2>It's literally miraculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know it exists.</v>

1858
01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:13.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1859
01:42:13.151 --> 01:42:17.170
<v Speaker 2>the Department of Defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how to be using it for our poor fats</v>

1860
01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:20.020
<v Speaker 2>that have returned from an unrighteous</v>
<v Speaker 2>battle.</v>

1861
01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:23.320
<v Speaker 2>The whole cause of their suicidal</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

1862
01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:28.620
<v Speaker 2>I believe is because they were told to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go buy into an unrighteous battle.</v>

1863
01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:35.880
<v Speaker 2>It was a war waged on lies and only to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create basically to kick a kick the</v>

1864
01:42:37.931 --> 01:42:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Hornet's nest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1865
01:42:39.911 --> 01:42:44.310
<v Speaker 2>to keep an endless war going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's working pretty good.</v>

1866
01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:47.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>

1867
01:42:47.201 --> 01:42:52.201
<v Speaker 2>What's really fascinating about it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's this reaction to stress too</v>

1868
01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:58.210
<v Speaker 2>intense stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>traumatic situations and that your body</v>

1869
01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:02.920
<v Speaker 2>has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is almost this intense anticipation</v>

1870
01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:08.010
<v Speaker 2>of a constant battle of constant stress</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that can be interrupted and</v>

1871
01:43:08.231 --> 01:43:10.140
<v Speaker 2>that this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's really no other method.</v>

1872
01:43:10.141 --> 01:43:11.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go to therapy all your life and</v>

1873
01:43:11.771 --> 01:43:16.210
<v Speaker 2>slowly perhaps slowly erode the memories</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this and give yourself some</v>

1874
01:43:16.211 --> 01:43:18.940
<v Speaker 2>psychological tools to manage these</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>

1875
01:43:18.941 --> 01:43:22.840
<v Speaker 2>But as far as like something that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of stop it in its tracks,</v>

1876
01:43:22.841 --> 01:43:25.300
<v Speaker 2>there's never been anything that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrated that has the power of</v>

1877
01:43:25.301 --> 01:43:27.300
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Post traumatic</v>

1878
01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:32.300
<v Speaker 3>stress disorder studies are showing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>85 percent of vets that have at and are</v>

1879
01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:39.060
<v Speaker 3>otherwise untreatable are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are having success after one treatment</v>

1880
01:43:39.330 --> 01:43:44.190
<v Speaker 3>and maps got a grant to do a second and</v>
<v Speaker 3>third trial.</v>

1881
01:43:44.191 --> 01:43:46.980
<v Speaker 3>That means that people 15 percent who</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>

1882
01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:48.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1883
01:43:48.421 --> 01:43:51.590
<v Speaker 3>really feel relief from posttraumatic</v>
<v Speaker 3>stress disorder,</v>

1884
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:55.180
<v Speaker 4>get a second turn and a third term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

1885
01:43:55.181 --> 01:43:56.360
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1886
01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:57.573
<v Speaker 4>many</v>

1887
01:43:58.730 --> 01:44:02.420
<v Speaker 2>the substance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the psychological therapy</v>

1888
01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:03.530
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

1889
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:04.680
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also the reset,</v>

1890
01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.150
<v Speaker 4>the reset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the control,</v>

1891
01:44:06.151 --> 01:44:09.720
<v Speaker 4>alt delete for the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the resetting of the consciousness that</v>

1892
01:44:09.721 --> 01:44:11.940
<v Speaker 4>I think so many of us operate on</v>
<v Speaker 4>momentum.</v>

1893
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.150
<v Speaker 4>We operate on the momentum of our past</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's all we know.</v>

1894
01:44:15.151 --> 01:44:16.110
<v Speaker 4>And that's sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1895
01:44:16.590 --> 01:44:18.150
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1896
01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:20.400
<v Speaker 4>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>were connected to that momentum,</v>

1897
01:44:20.430 --> 01:44:22.140
<v Speaker 4>like a safety blanket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we,</v>

1898
01:44:22.141 --> 01:44:25.170
<v Speaker 4>we believe that this momentum equals the</v>
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>

1899
01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:28.800
<v Speaker 4>And then it's very difficult to get out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of those grooves that are so deeply</v>

1900
01:44:28.801 --> 01:44:30.780
<v Speaker 4>carved in our consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1901
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:33.120
<v Speaker 4>And almost nothing does it,</v>

1902
01:44:33.150 --> 01:44:38.150
<v Speaker 2>but MTMA will allow you to get that</v>
<v Speaker 2>distance and a for you.</v>

1903
01:44:38.731 --> 01:44:41.930
<v Speaker 2>And in order for you to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1904
01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:45.690
<v Speaker 2>transform out of a phase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1905
01:44:45.691 --> 01:44:49.410
<v Speaker 2>the psychologist basically say that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be able to look at your</v>

1906
01:44:49.411 --> 01:44:52.880
<v Speaker 2>subjective state from an ob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1907
01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:57.870
<v Speaker 2>another objective observation on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>subjective state.</v>

1908
01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:01.350
<v Speaker 2>And so that's literally what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

1909
01:45:01.610 --> 01:45:05.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mtma your distanced from it.</v>

1910
01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:08.810
<v Speaker 2>You can look at your behavior or your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1911
01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:12.420
<v Speaker 2>what happened to you in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with more dispassion.</v>

1912
01:45:12.690 --> 01:45:16.530
<v Speaker 2>You can have compassion on yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1913
01:45:16.770 --> 01:45:17.580
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1914
01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:21.480
<v Speaker 2>start to forgive everyone involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1915
01:45:21.570 --> 01:45:23.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a miraculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1916
01:45:23.370 --> 01:45:27.090
<v Speaker 2>and life changing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which then leads to new neuro growth,</v>

1917
01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:30.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in both suicide and a MDM May.</v>

1918
01:45:30.630 --> 01:45:33.960
<v Speaker 2>They've been charting that there is new</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuropathways.</v>

1919
01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only does it just feel it that way,</v>

1920
01:45:38.281 --> 01:45:41.790
<v Speaker 2>but it literally is that way is changing</v>
<v Speaker 2>your minds,</v>

1921
01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:46.170
<v Speaker 2>changing your brain and your mind.</v>
