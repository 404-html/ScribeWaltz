1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.500
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing I was reading a lot of</v>

2
00:00:03.501 --> 00:00:04.190
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.520
<v Speaker 1>that we're sort of deriding the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're calling him crazy and they're</v>

4
00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:08.300
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.133
<v Speaker 1>basically when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.973
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.400
<v Speaker 1>a Muslim person blow kills a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

8
00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:16.190
<v Speaker 1>we start talking about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the calling them terrorists.</v>

9
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:16.730
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.330
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.960
<v Speaker 1>a black dude kills a bunch of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we start calling them thugs.</v>

13
00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:23.390
<v Speaker 1>But when a young white guy starts</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing people,</v>

14
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:26.360
<v Speaker 1>we call the mentally ill and somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>bats,</v>

15
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.530
<v Speaker 1>there's some inherent hypocrisy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I kind of just think like,</v>

16
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.140
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about this last night,</v>

17
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's levels of human evil that are so</v>

18
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>intense that will we get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we approached them,</v>

19
00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:39.920
<v Speaker 1>we just kind of like shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

20
00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:41.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the matrix when they would do</v>

21
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>like the electronic pulse and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>machinery would just shut down.</v>

22
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like there are levels of human evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we get to that are so intense that</v>

23
00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:52.130
<v Speaker 1>when we start approaching them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thought just drops out and pee and</v>

24
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:55.820
<v Speaker 1>it's all emotion that's left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can look at somebody like</v>

25
00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:57.590
<v Speaker 1>that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a hypocritical to call that guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally ill or you're fighting against</v>

27
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.650
<v Speaker 1>a feminist cause by not recognizing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inherent misogyny and his attack.</v>

28
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.370
<v Speaker 1>But really what's happening is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much sadder and deeper than either of</v>

29
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:12.260
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like we're living in this</v>

30
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>insane fucking world where human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>have some tick in this country more than</v>

31
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:20.510
<v Speaker 1>another countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one can figure out why were they</v>

32
00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:23.600
<v Speaker 1>sometimes once in a while we'll go into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place and shoot a bunch of people and</v>

33
00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 1>no one knows why it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people say it's because it's</v>

34
00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:29.090
<v Speaker 1>mental illness and some people say it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of bad parenting.</v>

35
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>And some people say it's because of gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

36
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.020
<v Speaker 1>And some people say it's because of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:38.021
<v Speaker 1>violent video games and violent and MMA</v>
<v Speaker 1>and movies and music and nobody fucking</v>

38
00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>knows why it's really happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so terrifying that we just</v>

39
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.310
<v Speaker 1>start slinging mud at one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to,</v>

40
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.390
<v Speaker 1>trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's this,</v>

41
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:46.220
<v Speaker 1>it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're part of the problem by</v>

42
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:48.980
<v Speaker 1>perpetuating this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reality is,</v>

43
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>is existence is terrifying and humans</v>
<v Speaker 1>are fucking weird.</v>

44
00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:57.170
<v Speaker 1>And once in a while there's this</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary blip that somebody pops out</v>

45
00:01:57.171 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 1>of their mother with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.800
<v Speaker 1>sort of genetic code ready to murder</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

47
00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:03.800
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think it's because of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoiled and maybe it is,</v>

48
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think it's because of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.220
<v Speaker 1>chemical imbalances or maybe it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the reality is that's what's</v>

50
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:15.221
<v Speaker 1>happening is jack the ripper exists in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some 0.001% of human beings.</v>

51
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the audio book and my book and I</v>

52
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>wrote an article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chapter about Patrice,</v>

53
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>and I had to decide in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I do patrice has voice or do I just</v>

54
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>do a regular voice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the,</v>

55
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>so in when you buy the audio book of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

56
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:33.370
<v Speaker 1>you hear me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn</v>

57
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

58
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.060
<v Speaker 1>do I do that with all black people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I,</v>

59
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>when will smith talks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I make him like I did it,</v>

60
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.653
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's done.</v>

61
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patrice is just so big with it.</v>

62
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>He's so is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his voice was so big and he was kind of</v>

64
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>almost have to do it because you heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was telling it on opiate anthony,</v>

65
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>but the whole thing was that I did a</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl with cerebral palsy,</v>

66
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 1>didn't know she had cerebral palsy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was drinking so much and patrice</v>

67
00:02:57.931 --> 00:02:59.250
<v Speaker 1>thought that was fucking hilarious.</v>

68
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.840
<v Speaker 1>And he kept saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you alcoholic,</v>

69
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>you can't even say if someone disabled</v>
<v Speaker 1>disabled.</v>

70
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.300
<v Speaker 1>That is the worst version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like if we did do a Joey Diaz</v>

71
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 1>impression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do it right.</v>

72
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to say something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey said,</v>

73
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does.</v>

74
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they say something as Joey,</v>

75
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't just say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Ari has a joke,</v>

76
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I might say it like as me,</v>

77
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>I might tell you all are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got this great new joke,</v>

78
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about blah,</v>

79

80
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

81
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Except if you're describing already mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll do the</v>

82
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>mumble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

83
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.950
<v Speaker 1>What was your will smith voice though?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was as white people saying it.</v>

88
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize it because I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking really pay much attention to the</v>

89
00:03:51.211 --> 00:03:54.030
<v Speaker 1>editing of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wrote them and then if,</v>

90
00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:57.030
<v Speaker 1>if the publisher liked them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in and I was like,</v>

91
00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.200
<v Speaker 1>I read it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
