00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.750
Shazamm would talk in discounts.
My friends.

5
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.760
All right.
With that said,
are we should fear is in the motherfucking house.

6
00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:26.220
I could dig.
Quit
talking discounts.

7
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.460
We have to do this music for some reason.

8
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:32.923
We're married

9
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.050
<v 1>it [inaudible]</v>

10
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.650
<v 0>it's like us.
It's not perfect.
It's obnoxious.</v>

11
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.770
He lets you know there's a lot of shit in there.
You would change.
Who made that?

12
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.160
Who made that song got really mentally really quick?
I think Brian made it right,

13
00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:51.550
didn't you make it and actually made it for the old crackle show that we were

14
00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.560
doing.
Just do it in Garageband.

15
00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:58.561
It's a mix of the garage band and real instruments affects some amazing you can

16
00:00:59.621 --> 00:01:03.130
do that,
isn't it?
Yeah.
Fuck man.
It's so easy to do stuff to them.

17
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:06.510
I'll train music.
Do you play any instruments?
Do you play any instruments?
No.

18
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.060
That.
I mean I played instruments my whole life.

19
00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:15.060
Like I played bassoon trumpet fucking got a bassoon.
I pay it.

20
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.270
It almost looks like a tube.
I'd like this big mother fucking crazy,

21
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.630
crazy thing deployed.
I know.
Why did you play that?

22
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.740
Because I wanted to play an instrument bad,
but the problem hate pussy as well.

23
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.880
Perfect combination.
It was.
It was like,
I think you had to do it.

24
00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:33.490
You had to pick an instrument growing up and I would,

25
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.110
I liked the trumpet but after awhile I just,
you know what's the hardest one?

26
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.390
I thought the trumpets.
The coolest one.
No Trump.
This.
Trump.

27
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:45.490
That wasn't that hard though that we just made that distinction and we both

28
00:01:45.491 --> 00:01:48.940
agreed that the bassoon is like fucking stupid instrument is a bassoon.

29
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.160
While the trumpet is like,
yeah,
that's pretty dope.

30
00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:52.580
Like to learn to play the trumpet.
That's cool.

31
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.700
People like you would stand outside a woman's like window with a trust.

32
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.850
Isn't that weird?
That's a weird distinction.

33
00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:02.920
And it's a one week kind of all agree on,

34
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.040
I mean I'm sure there's some bassoon aficionados out there,
right?

35
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.160
But if you had to ask the average person,
you play a bassoon,
they're like,

36
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.280
get the fuck out of here.
But he's like,
yeah,
I played trumpet.
Dams is cool.

37
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:14.650
Jazz guy who gets laid for a trumpet.

38
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.780
It's here are the best bassoonist trumpets I think of like Denzel Washington and

39
00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:20.960
Mo better blues where I like,

40
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.190
I remember watching it and he's like cleaning his trumpet and Shit.
I was like,

41
00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:26.830
this motherfucker loves that thing.
You know?

42
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.270
He's toning it up and polishing it and girls want to fuck him.
He's like,

43
00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:33.750
I got to practice baby.
I got a practice.
I'm always cracked skin.

44
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.930
It's like you've inspired me and that the trumpet was actually the easiest to

45
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:41.830
learn really quick.
Not the easiest to master probably,
but I,

46
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.710
that was easy that the secret,
the trumpet is just knowing how to blow it.

47
00:02:44.711 --> 00:02:48.290
It's like using your map going that,
oh,
just learning.

48
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.810
Give me just learn how to actually play something.

49
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.340
It is fucking amazing when you see a dude who really knows how to play.
Though.

50
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.550
I saw dizzy Gillespie when I was a little kid.
Yeah.

51
00:02:57.551 --> 00:03:00.070
When I was living in San Francisco,
they had a,
um,

52
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.530
<v 2>one of the kind to go into a cool school man,</v>

53
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.540
public school in San Francisco was a seventies.
It was pretty good.
Fast.
Cool.

54
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.840
Yeah.
And uh,

55
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.900
they took us all to see a dizzy Gillespie and he was a crazy one because the,

56
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.840
the,
you're not supposed to go and blow your,
your cheeks out like a fish.

57
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.100
That's not like the proper technique.
But that's how he did it.
And his,
his,

58
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.960
his cheeks were crazy.
They were blocked like a frog.
So like he got,

59
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.190
I guess he is like really powerful lungs and flexible skin and because his

60
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:34.060
fucking lungs are so powerful because he's been playing trumpet for so long when

61
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:38.230
he blows it when he wouldn't,
he's dead now.
But when he would,
yeah,
it was crazy.

62
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.150
And I went to see him and I was amazed that this guy can do all this with this

63
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:47.170
and make all this noise out of this one little instrument just because he knows

64
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:50.570
it,
you know,
he knows like if he pulls it back just this much,

65
00:03:50.571 --> 00:03:52.030
it'll make that much of a difference.

66
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:55.880
And if he hits this key and blows a little extra hard,

67
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.850
it'll hit that special note that he wants.

68
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:02.400
And there's so much variation in the notes,
you know,
it's amazing.
It's an a,

69
00:04:02.401 --> 00:04:04.660
it's an amazing instrument.
The bassoon,

70
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.260
<v 3>which you'd think it's Sun.
Yuma is growth.
It's the bassoon.
Uh,</v>

71
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.610
when you were a poor kid the day they had ones that you can rent from the
school,

72
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:16.790
what kind of like a library?
As soon that I had looked like,

73
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.530
it looked like something from the black hole.

74
00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:21.260
Like when those old robots and here something like it was just as beat up,

75
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.280
rusted looking gross thing and like a spit valve was rusted.

76
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.110
Like,
you know,

77
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.710
like the pipe where you opened up the spit and you blow up the spit that that

78
00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:33.230
was just all rusted.
I remember that being so gross.

79
00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:35.300
That was other people spit roads.
Yeah.

80
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.770
<v 2>Dude,
that's disgusting.
You're stuck with that.
That I used bassoon.</v>

81
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.790
<v 3>Yeah.
I didn't play that as long as the trumpet.</v>

82
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:43.800
I play trumpet Pro League for two years or so.

83
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.130
<v 2>Yeah,
because this is not just a bassoon.
Right.</v>

84
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.930
It's the bassoons and right now if you choose to some dudes,
yeah.

85
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.760
<v 3>I wouldn't know what I could play.
I could play,
I could play,
but I,</v>

86
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.380
I wouldn't know anything to play.
You know what I mean?

87
00:04:57.381 --> 00:05:00.890
I could blow it and it would sound like right.
You know,
we could play Beverly.

88
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.890
What's that?
What's that?
It's when they wake up in the morning.

89
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.030
I used to be able to play.
Right?
Yeah.
Can you still remember it now or no?
No.

90
00:05:08.031 --> 00:05:10.370
You have to mark now it's like,
I can't even remember Spanish.

91
00:05:10.371 --> 00:05:15.300
I took Spanish for four years.
I don't,
I remember old La Multa.
What's motel?

92
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.760
Weed.
Weed.
Yeah.
See you don't see tall is alto.

93
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.850
Gordo is fat.
I know all the things people would call me.

94
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.250
People were talking shit about you.
That's what you got good at.

95
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.280
It was all body parts,
drugs and just passwords it,
yeah,

96
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.140
that's what everybody does.
Whenever you had a new kid that came from Russia,

97
00:05:39.141 --> 00:05:41.930
like,
dude,
okay,
how do you say bitch?
Yeah,
she's telling me the keys.

98
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.200
Verday Green Roho right.

99
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.250
So Ari,
how was crackers?
You were in Indiana or ended up it.

100
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.220
I want to skeet shooting.
It was totally cool.
What's that?
Where they shoot that?

101
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.370
Well you go yo pull and the this fucking despise

102
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.020
<v 4>and you shoot it with a real shotgun.
Yeah.
You fucking blow it up twice.</v>

103
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.550
<v 5>Was that your first time shooting anything?
No,
I've shot stuff before.</v>

104
00:06:05.551 --> 00:06:08.550
When I was in Israel,
we used to go to the,
um,
the frightful range of bunch.

105
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.950
They let it take us out there.
We,
you lie on your stomach there.

106
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.360
I think it was the first time standing up with a,
with a shotgun,
but it blows up.

107
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.730
It's so cool.
You just have to track it and fucking shoot it.

108
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.510
Was it really trippy?
Uh,
no.
I wouldn't describe it as trippy.

109
00:06:21.511 --> 00:06:24.930
It off ain't feeling any aftereffects of the Salvia trip that you had recently,

110
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.560
you know,
I miss that place.
Have you been any afterthoughts?
What have you,

111
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.970
do you have any afterthoughts and now that you've got to stay with you that long

112
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.170
because you had,
it kind of goes away for the listener.

113
00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:38.790
And so he had a pretty much a breakdown on Saudia where you're,
yeah.

114
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.160
You started flailing your legs.
You started,

115
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.910
<v 4>yeah.
Yeah.
I thought you were a,
I thought you were fucking with me.</v>

116
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.430
<v 5>Right?
Did you realize looking back now,</v>

117
00:06:47.431 --> 00:06:49.380
do you realize that Sam Tripoli was fucking,

118
00:06:49.381 --> 00:06:53.640
you buy sangs saying shit like I think he's dead.
Oh No,
I looked at it again.

119
00:06:53.641 --> 00:06:55.280
It's just,
I mean,
completely not trusting you.

120
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.930
Nobody has any idea what the fuck you're talking about.

121
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.700
This is the most ridiculous conversation.

122
00:07:02.701 --> 00:07:05.250
Arrows to what happens when let you talk.
You were typing away.

123
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.120
<v 4>Well,
I was trying to find this thing cause I wanted to ask you about,</v>

124
00:07:09.121 --> 00:07:14.100
there's a story in a,
on CNN today.
Uh,
I know that for those who don't know,
a,

125
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.590
he spent a good deal of his life studying,
uh,

126
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.430
Judaism in the Talmud and you know,

127
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.750
you were explaining your whole situation for people.
That was,

128
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.260
you need to Shiva in Israel for two years.
I was super religious.

129
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.460
It's like a dormitory.
Just spend morning tonight,
uh,
studying,
uh,

130
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.100
you can live around Israel too.
You know,
you've seen this,
the country,

131
00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:34.830
but you know,
most of your day,
nine to five,

132
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.030
it's really like eight to fucking 10:00 PM just studying all day long with a

133
00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:43.500
break for lunch,
break for dinner and the services.
Wow.
Yeah,

134
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.300
it was super cool.
Super rewarding.
I was good at,

135
00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:47.910
and then I came home and lost my religion.
That's why I'm a comedian.

136
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.470
And w w you know,
how do you go from that to a is extreme as you are now.

137
00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:54.300
How do you,
how do you make that leap?
What was it,

138
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.360
what was it that made you lose your religion?
I just really thought about it.

139
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.380
I really honestly thought inside do I believe in God and it just wasn't there.

140
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.100
It just wasn't there.
I look for the first time I thought about it and I'm like,

141
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:08.880
I don't like when I think about,
you know,
you're here,

142
00:08:08.881 --> 00:08:10.830
you don't have this core beliefs and your system,
you know,

143
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.160
summer's warm or whatever it is.
Like you just believe these things.

144
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.070
That's about example,
but it just wasn't in there cause it's not in there.

145
00:08:17.071 --> 00:08:18.270
I don't know if you believe in God or not,

146
00:08:18.271 --> 00:08:20.520
but it's like you either believe or you don't believe.

147
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.090
Especially when it comes to a leap of faith where it's like there's don't

148
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.650
believe or not believe.
I think it's a,
I don't know.
That's my,

149
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.770
my answer to all that shit.
I don't know.

150
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.240
But if it was an argument about anything else except for religion using the same

151
00:08:36.241 --> 00:08:38.310
proofs and he'd be like,
what the fuck you talking about?

152
00:08:38.311 --> 00:08:41.260
There's no performance fucked.
It's no,
it's,

153
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:45.160
people have a weird desire to think that there's an answer to all of this.
Yeah.

154
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.780
It's a,
it's,
it's,
and if you like challenged their,
their,

155
00:08:48.781 --> 00:08:51.930
their thought that they believe in,
they'll get so angry.

156
00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:53.440
They want to fight you and kill you.
Yeah.

157
00:08:53.441 --> 00:08:56.790
But I thought it's supposed to be a leap of,
so you've taken that leap.
What?

158
00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:59.430
So why?
And they're mad if you don't.
Yeah.
Or they're mad.

159
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:02.670
If you question why they did well,
look,
believe it over the fuck.

160
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:05.860
You want to believe folks,
we're not,
we're not telling them,
this is why I bonded.

161
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.730
Bring this up to you.
So for some people it helps,
man.

162
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.290
I know people that need religion,
they need God.
They need some,
some idea,

163
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.950
some fucking fiber that there's some path that they can follow something

164
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:20.820
tangible,
you know,
in the,
in the Bible to them it does it,
I dunno,
whatever,

165
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.220
do whatever the fuck you want.
If that's what you need,
good for you.

166
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.930
Some people need PROZAC.
You know what I'm saying?
I mean it's okay,
no worries.

167
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.540
But here's the key.
Here's the question.

168
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.750
I know you studied ancient Hebrew and you studied,

169
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:36.800
did you study a lot of the Old Testament?
Oh yeah.
Well,

170
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.070
there's a research group in Canada that support this according to CNN that has

171
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:45.240
just proved,
and this is this the story that they published,
that the,
uh,

172
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:50.130
the old testament has been massively mistranslated and falls three years of

173
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:50.581
research,

174
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:54.750
which is uncovered that the actual system for translating ancient Hebrew is the

175
00:09:54.751 --> 00:09:59.220
group discovered that each letter is not a letter at all,
but a full word.

176
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.760
And what was believed to be a word is actually a sentence,

177
00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:07.090
like a description which supplies the definition of the word.
I said,

178
00:10:07.091 --> 00:10:10.290
what's a sentence?
A fucking paragraph.
I don't know.
That's a good question.

179
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:11.940
I don't understand this.

180
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.310
This is one of the reasons why I wanted to bring this up to you because I know

181
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:19.020
you have a lot of,
a lot of knowledge about this shit about ancient Hebrew each.

182
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.900
So it was what they're saying,
making any sense to you.

183
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.600
What they're saying basically is that sort of get it like they used to think as

184
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:30.180
far as I know,
um,
my limited understanding,

185
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:33.090
they used to believe that every letter is also a number.
Yeah.

186
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.280
They still believe that they believe that.
So there's no,

187
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.920
there's no numbers in ancient Hebrew,
right?

188
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.370
It's all letters and numbers are all the same thing.
Yeah.

189
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.370
If you want to show that it was high,
it's just a,
it's a,
it's a,

190
00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.880
it's time for life,
but it's cut.

191
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:49.140
It's eight and your admins 10 18 so people usually give gifts.

192
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:53.460
The gift of life is the greatest gift.
So they can get some units at 18 wow.

193
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:56.850
That's so really bad ass thing.
A language that's like that.

194
00:10:56.851 --> 00:10:58.310
When you think about it,
I will,

195
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.430
I'll language that where it's all like numbers and letters are all intertwined.

196
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.830
Like words have numerical value to them.
Right.

197
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.470
So it's like you can figure shit out that way.

198
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.830
So really any soda translation of that into something else you're losing.

199
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.520
Remember Fuck,
you must be losing almost all of it,
right?
Yeah.
You could still,

200
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.170
if you don't know that language,
you won't get the meeting.
Right.

201
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.870
So you have to translate it.
You have to read just what they're saying.

202
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.810
Make any sense to you.
It makes sense.
But I don't see how that could be.

203
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.850
I mean they know what the,
a lot of those words are.
It makes sense.
The sentences.

204
00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:34.530
Yeah.
They still exist today.
And the same,
the same word.
So waba you know,

205
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.590
so how could they be saying this then?
And that sounds like they're full of shit.

206
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.720
Sounds like not,
don't understand that.
I'd have to really see what the,

207
00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:41.400
what they were talking about.
Exactly what I would think.

208
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:46.410
It's when some shit gets on CNN that they've done some filtering of it and they

209
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:50.130
know that they're right.
CNN might not be reporting exactly right or something.

210
00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:51.360
I'm just not sure.
I don't know what that word.

211
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.160
Well and all they have to do is really say a research

212
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.970
<v 2>group in Canada.
Look,
it's interesting shit.
You know,
even if it's not correct.</v>

213
00:11:57.971 --> 00:11:58.960
It's interesting shit.

214
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:02.440
And CNN is in the business of getting people to pay attention to interesting

215
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:05.800
shit.
You know when I go to cnn.com one of the reasons why it goes,

216
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:08.560
cause every now and then they'll have some weird ass fucking story like this.

217
00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.140
We had,
CNN has some good stories,
man.
You know,

218
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:16.141
you think of CNN has being like to a mainstream website for news and it is,

219
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:19.240
but there's,
you know,
there's some fucking fascinating shit on there.

220
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.850
Whenever I go to those sites or just go to the Wacky,

221
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.120
wacky section as wacky section,
there's always a wacky section.
You know what?

222
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:29.500
Let me look for that man arrested himself after too many bananas,

223
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:35.320
you know?
Yeah.
I used to have a friend that would scour those jokes.

224
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.450
Whenever I write the hackers.

225
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.210
You've ever read packets for like a late night talk show or something?

226
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.090
That's all I look for.
You'll give me a fun.

227
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.560
What story am I going to do about speaker of the house not coming to the puck

228
00:12:47.561 --> 00:12:51.860
and vote today?
I have nothing to say about any of that stuff anymore.
Yeah,

229
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.440
I don't want to talk about it,

230
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.370
but if somebody tried to shoot over a cockroach with a speed boat,

231
00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.090
I want to fucking know.

232
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:03.120
It's so sad to be in that state of mistrust of the government and just not,

233
00:13:03.531 --> 00:13:06.610
and thinking that the system is so completely fuck that you just don't want to

234
00:13:06.611 --> 00:13:08.560
like stop it.
Don't even talk about it to me.

235
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.500
Did you hear what the Democrats did in the floor today?
Shut up.

236
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.860
Shut up world of Warcraft.
There's my new deal.
Talk to me about your wizard.

237
00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:19.840
So it's the same shit when people say like all Republicans are just fucking

238
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.530
idiots.
Midwestern morons.
It's ridiculous.
Just so silly to write that off.

239
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:26.860
Half the country.
Without that,
they can't,
can't have any point at all.

240
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.950
I agree with Republicans on a lot of shit.
A lot of shit.

241
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.730
A lot of it's just uncontrolled shit.
Separation of tastes,
different tastes.

242
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.340
If everybody would be like old school,
Conservative,

243
00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:39.970
Republican the way it was supposed to be,
it would be smaller business,

244
00:13:39.971 --> 00:13:43.540
smaller or smaller.
Government get the fuck out of our lives.
You live people,

245
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.360
live people alone.
Lead people have purpose,
personal freedom.

246
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.290
But somewhere along the line,
conservative didn't become that.
You know,

247
00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:53.830
being a republican wasn't about.
It was,
it wasn't about limited government.

248
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.700
It's just like all things they become.
What is the most profitable?

249
00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.120
What's the best way to do this?

250
00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.530
The best way to do this is be completely intertwined with business.

251
00:14:02.531 --> 00:14:06.340
So they're fucking robbing the world and uh,
bribing us all the time.

252
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.400
Well that's how we do it.
Let's just do it that way.
And so that's where it is,

253
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.460
you know,
so republican or Democrat or whatever the fuck it is,

254
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:17.461
it's all just some shell game that involves people making absurd amounts of

255
00:14:18.311 --> 00:14:22.690
money doing shit that most people wouldn't want them doing,
you know?
Yeah.

256
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.400
So it doesn't matter what offshore drilling sorts of creepy fucking shit that

257
00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:27.940
goes on.

258
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.420
Everybody said they want to get rid of nuclear power plants as is Sweden.

259
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:32.470
Sweden is powering off there.

260
00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:34.980
She took do they want to be completely off the fucking smart man?

261
00:14:34.981 --> 00:14:36.930
I've got to figure out how to make it like renewal,

262
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.030
not how to use those are newer ones and how to make up like store at the energy.

263
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:41.950
It's the scariest thing in the world.

264
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:45.910
The idea that they've created some area that you cannot go to for the next,

265
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.780
who knows how many fucking thousand years.
But that spot,

266
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.940
that one spot will fuck you up a thousand years from now.

267
00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.210
If you do and that's fine.

268
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.540
You couldn't eat vegetables for like six months or a year and he said there's

269
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:57.291
still some barriers.

270
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:00.800
25 years later you still can't eat because they store it in a certain way.

271
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.820
<v 5>Are they researching like a thing to stop that or to fix that?</v>

272
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.860
They could spray the hair.
You know what I mean?
I'm sure they are,

273
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.120
but that would be worth some research.

274
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.870
<v 2>Pretty elemental problem.
I mean,</v>

275
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.690
what you've done is created nuclear fission or fusion.
Which one is it?

276
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.930
Sounds good.
It's one of those vision or fusion.

277
00:15:22.931 --> 00:15:25.780
One of them is a bomb and one or one of them is the sun.

278
00:15:25.781 --> 00:15:28.840
One of them is a nuclear power plant.
Somebody reminded me of this on Twitter,

279
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.700
which ones in [inaudible] when I was joking around,

280
00:15:30.701 --> 00:15:33.730
because I always joke around that like these guys have Japan have made a son in

281
00:15:33.731 --> 00:15:35.650
the middle of the field and now they can't shut it off.

282
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.720
I mean it really is kind of when it's like,

283
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.940
I mean I know it's not exactly the same thing,

284
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:44.650
but it is something posthumously powerful that you can't even fucking go near

285
00:15:44.651 --> 00:15:45.484
and we created.

286
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:50.080
<v 5>Why don't we just use that as where to put all the world's garbage.
Uh,</v>

287
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.040
that's not a bad idea.
Right?

288
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:59.100
So this story is just going to be a tetris of nasty flyover and just dump it.

289
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.910
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's actually a wonderful idea.
I know.
I like it a lot.

290
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.870
Or prison cells.
No,
that's not,
you're pushing it too.

291
00:16:06.871 --> 00:16:11.340
Did you have and make it a reality show?
Did you watch some more morph?

292
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.080
<v 2>The latest thing on this,
uh,</v>

293
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:20.080
large Hadron collider situation is that the large Hadron collider thinking

294
00:16:20.081 --> 00:16:22.390
about,
you know,
talking about shit that you can never get away from.

295
00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:27.280
The large Hadron collider has created a glue on Cork,
uh,

296
00:16:27.281 --> 00:16:30.460
cork glue on plasma and it's many,

297
00:16:30.461 --> 00:16:33.280
many times more dense than a neutron star.

298
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:37.660
This shit is so dense that if a,
you'd have a sugar cube size of it.

299
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:42.360
It's like 40 billion pounds.
Okay.

300
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.410
That's what are they going to do with that?
How does it,
yeah.

301
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.070
Hey was around,

302
00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.970
they made that on their way to blowing up the fucking world is how they made it.

303
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:53.890
If I was in that hot,
loud Heidrick or ladder,

304
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.120
I'd figured out a way to do jousting in it.
It's the densest matter available.

305
00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.031
It's,
it's,

306
00:16:59.031 --> 00:17:03.340
it's like impossible to us for us even wrap our heads around how dense this shit

307
00:17:03.341 --> 00:17:04.090
is.

308
00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:07.600
That's what's really crazy about that is it's nothing compared to the density of

309
00:17:07.601 --> 00:17:09.970
the original universe according to the Big Bang theory,

310
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.600
the Big Bang theory states that the entire universe was smaller than the head of

311
00:17:13.601 --> 00:17:14.434
a pin.

312
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:19.570
Somehow or another just one point of infinite density popped open and it just

313
00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:23.260
exploded and created everything.
I mean it's a very controversial theory.

314
00:17:23.261 --> 00:17:27.370
There's a bunch of other ones that other people believe in like brains,

315
00:17:27.371 --> 00:17:31.000
like membranes,
theories that there's like every universe is like a membrane.

316
00:17:31.001 --> 00:17:34.230
Sometimes they collide with each other and it's a never ending cycle and then

317
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.500
then there's another,

318
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:39.550
this is a bunch of different theories of constant expansion and contraction.

319
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.650
That's what the universe does incidentally,

320
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.840
just constantly expands and contracts forever.

321
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.770
<v 5>That's a few sessions to me.
When I was in sixth grade,</v>

322
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:48.150
that's where I was super into that.

323
00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:50.030
When I found out the university and closed and they're

324
00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:53.070
<v 2>just sort of stopped.
He just got tired.
I was like,</v>

325
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.240
I know there's a lot of shit on her so

326
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.990
it doesn't affect you so you don't think about it.
Stop thinking about it.

327
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.140
And I'm obsessed with all that shit.
I'm obsessed with anything.
He liked this,

328
00:18:05.141 --> 00:18:06.870
that I don't think anybody's paying attention to,

329
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:11.580
especially this cork glue on plasma,
whatever the fuck it is that just,

330
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.630
if you had your choice,

331
00:18:12.631 --> 00:18:14.850
would you have them shut down the large Hadron collider so you could look into

332
00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:19.320
it further?
No,
no.
I think it's natural.
I think what people are doing,

333
00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:20.490
I don't want to be anywhere near it,

334
00:18:20.491 --> 00:18:24.000
but I think what people are doing is a natural thing.

335
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.220
I think that we have a,
uh,

336
00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:30.180
a builtin tendency towards accelerating technology.

337
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.300
We cannot stop.
We can't help ourselves.
We need to know.

338
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.150
We need to know what happens when I do this.
What happens when I do that?
I mean,

339
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:38.160
look what,
what they're doing there.
They're spending,

340
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.670
there's 10,000 scientists from a hundred different countries.

341
00:18:41.671 --> 00:18:46.110
They have spent billions and billions of dollars and none of what they're doing

342
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:51.111
is going to help pull oil out of the ocean or fix our food problem or fix are

343
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.261
either trying to do,

344
00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:54.560
are they just trying to see what they're trying to do is create it?

345
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.360
They were trying to create a God particle and crying.

346
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.320
There's the theoretical particle called the Higgs Boson particle and this is a

347
00:19:01.321 --> 00:19:05.430
particle that existed in milliseconds after the big bang and it's this

348
00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:08.190
theoretical particle.
If they can prove its existence it,

349
00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:12.570
it puts a lot of the pieces together of like some sort of a unified theory of

350
00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:15.420
what you know,
what creates the universe,
what the universe is made of,

351
00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:17.390
what sort of,
how to make enough of these particles and put them together.

352
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.360
I don't even know if it's real.

353
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.660
They're trying to make it and on their way to ramping up to make it.

354
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:26.100
They're making shit like this cork glue on whatever.
It is critical.

355
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.920
Then what do they get?
Well,
if they do,

356
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:33.300
they also get little black holes.
That's one of the things they get.

357
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.890
This is a,
a real issue that,
uh,
some people are concerned with.

358
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.380
Some scientists say you don't have to worry about it because it's just going to

359
00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:45.210
disappear because they can't,
their mass can't,
uh,
can't exist.

360
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.340
You know,
like there's a there,
they're too small,

361
00:19:47.341 --> 00:19:49.080
they don't have enough gravity and then disappear.

362
00:19:49.081 --> 00:19:51.090
But like fucking how do you know,
man,

363
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.090
nobody's ever made a black hole before shithead.

364
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.730
You're running and you're just out there pressing buttons and,

365
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.320
and I'm not saying they shouldn't be doing it.

366
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.540
I'm not saying they shouldn't be doing it.
Don't get me wrong.

367
00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:05.430
There's people you want to,
you stifling science as if you know science at the,

368
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.300
you have to look at it all objectively,
man sciences and get a free pass.

369
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.070
You have to look at it objectively.

370
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.620
You have to look at what the fuck they're doing.
What are they doing?

371
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:18.540
You're smashing atoms together and you,
you guys are playing with rocks.
You guys,

372
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.080
you guys are crazy egg head genius.
Motherfuckers know that.

373
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.820
Talk some people into letting you break,
break,

374
00:20:26.821 --> 00:20:29.490
break a fucking hole through this dimension.
That's what you're doing.

375
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:32.070
This is like,
you know what?
This is like,
this is like half life.

376
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.900
This is like that God damn video game.

377
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.650
Remember that they blew a hole through another dimension.

378
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.390
Giant crabs came out in Florida.

379
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.890
A picture of you sitting in front of a computer at three 30 in the morning just

380
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.650
going,
I can't,
I'm like,
no,

381
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.290
you cannot miss the crazy

382
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.730
<v 5>but crazy.</v>

383
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.880
Can you imagine the reviews of the courtyard of the mirror across the street

384
00:20:51.881 --> 00:20:54.700
from the collider?
Cons,
uh,

385
00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:58.690
across the street from this large Heidi on collider.

386
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.250
There's nothing anywhere near Howard Johnson's across the street.

387
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.780
I hop in there complaining free breakfast,
but across street from black hole.

388
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.350
I wonder what it sounds like when Adam's collide at lightspeed.
How about,

389
00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:14.440
it sounds like,
what is that like gay porn?
Yeah.

390
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:18.650
I wonder if it sounds like anything,
right?
It's probably just,
it

391
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.360
won't go away the rest of our life.
We have to hear that.
And my art,

392
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.030
my thoughts were all of a sudden nobody hears anything for one second.
Right.

393
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:33.070
The whole world just skips a beat and then once it comes right back.
Yeah.
Well,
I,

394
00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:36.760
you know,
my,
my worry about this is not this necessarily,

395
00:21:36.761 --> 00:21:39.030
it's about what is this spawn,
you know,
the,

396
00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:43.610
the atomic weapons that were first created in 1940 whatever,
you know,

397
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:47.380
they eventually spawned much more as much smaller,
compact,

398
00:21:47.381 --> 00:21:50.290
much more dangerous topic,
much more powerful atomic weapons.

399
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.360
What is this kind of spawn?
You know,

400
00:21:52.361 --> 00:21:55.150
they're not going to stop at the large Hadron collider a hundred years from now.

401
00:21:55.151 --> 00:21:56.890
They're not going to be sitting around going,
well,

402
00:21:56.891 --> 00:22:00.520
I'll just no need to keep fucking around with naming a search for more
knowledge.

403
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:04.240
They never even searched for more knowledge and fucking with things,

404
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.580
pressing buttons,
seeing what happens,
making God particle.

405
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.510
You remember the movie black hole?
No.
What was that?

406
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.570
It's where it's a Disney movie.
It's like the first r rated Disney movie.

407
00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:19.660
It was about a black hole going into a black hole.
Whoa.

408
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:24.690
What happened in 1980 80 to almost give it awesome.

409
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:31.650
Oh,
it's bad ass.
It was a complete rip off of like,
well,

410
00:22:31.651 --> 00:22:35.540
it was not a rip off,
but trying to get on the bandwagon a star wars.
Oh,

411
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.800
states fiction.
What they have robots like r two d two is,

412
00:22:38.801 --> 00:22:41.860
but they had that like paint them and make these big eyes on them and stuff like

413
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:44.130
that.
But they're pretty much floating.
R Two d two is,

414
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:49.270
it's pretty bad ass I would recommend.
But for being terrible bad ass.

415
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:54.100
Yeah.
For being
in though,
I don't wanna give it away.
The end,

416
00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.250
the end is the worry about spoilers.
The printers will be happy to do different.

417
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.920
Mentioned nine nine at the end.
Just really fucked up.

418
00:23:02.921 --> 00:23:07.230
And I would not ruin the end,
but the guy that did,
no,
it's fucked up.

419
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.610
You guys want to see this?
What?
You guys want to smoke a shitload of weed?

420
00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.530
Didn't see the black hole.
I really don't.
I really don't.
You really will want it.

421
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.560
I gotta be in the right mood.
Clarify through.
I still got to it.

422
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.090
But the guy that did tron,
the neutron remake,
he's now redoing black hole.
Oh,

423
00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:27.880
okay.
And so it's kind of kind of cool.
It wasn't John,
the neutron wasn't bad,

424
00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:32.560
it wasn't great,
but it wasn't bad fun.
Or You watch the old one and I was like,

425
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.040
oh,
I don't have an interest in Washington was new thing.
Oh,
it's good.

426
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.360
Especially in three d three d was cool.

427
00:23:37.361 --> 00:23:40.320
I saw a priest last night in three D I was,
I was priests.
Yeah,

428
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.380
it was priest who was a vampire killer dude.
Oh yeah.
That looks pretty.
Yeah,

429
00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:46.340
it's fun.
It's fun.
It's stupid fun.

430
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:51.550
[inaudible] 17 Prajna to see it.
It's like a comic book movie.
You know?

431
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.600
I would say the hangover two.
Right?

432
00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:58.610
Why Americarna why they have a thing there where you can get 130 different types

433
00:23:59.091 --> 00:24:03.710
of sodas.

435
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.990

437
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:18.380

Oh,
I thought that for like 15 minutes.
Oh my God.

438
00:24:18.381 --> 00:24:20.240
Girl I was with was like already people are wearing and I'm like,

439
00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:23.660
you're gonna let them wait longer.
I haven't seen everything yet.
Wow.
Wow.

440
00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:27.590
All right.
Heel up the line.
I couldn't help it.
Horrible to be behind.
I know Ari,

441
00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:30.350
he would dissect every single flavor got lost in it.
Yep.

442
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.860
Sorry you shouldn't put up that many if you don't expect people to look or how

443
00:24:33.861 --> 00:24:36.890
about you let us send early.
I asked the lady specifically can I get in?
I'm high.

444
00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:37.910
It's going to take me a long time.

445
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.920
And she said not until 20 minutes before the movie.

446
00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:43.630
Have you seen the flashbacks sodas?
You told me you were hi.
Yeah,

447
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.390
I was like it's gonna take me a really long time to,
so what I want,

448
00:24:47.391 --> 00:24:50.370
I'm really high.
Can I just go in now?
Have you seen the flashback?

449
00:24:50.371 --> 00:24:53.520
So this they've taken like Pepsi and Mountain Dew and you can get rid of have

450
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.440
the old cans and then they have real cane sugar back.
Going back to,

451
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.260
do you think they should let stone people in movie theaters early?

452
00:25:00.261 --> 00:25:03.750
SORTA like how they like babies on board pair plains early.
Yes.
Deal with it.

453
00:25:03.751 --> 00:25:06.920
Cause you don't want me to Tuck in line behind me.
Wheelchairs and babies,
right?

454
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:11.600
Yeah.
With small children on quicker.
It's an impediment at certain point.

455
00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:15.680
It's not a bad idea.
Are Do you think you overmedicate on marijuana?
Oh yeah.
No,

456
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:17.570
I mean,
I don't know what's overmedication.
What does that mean?

457
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.700
You wake up the second you wake up,

458
00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:22.940
you smoke weed all day to the second email to slip.
You don't think he did that?

459
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.750
No,
I don't do that.
We don't do that.

460
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.760
What do you mean you don't think he does that?
I do,

461
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:31.310
but I don't to smoke a shit load of weed.
Every time I talk to you,
you're like,

462
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:35.990
I've already had,
well,
I just wonder,
call me a liar.
Yeah.
I'll tell you what I do.

463
00:25:35.991 --> 00:25:39.800
I don't care if it's anything,
but I don't wake up and start smoking pot.

464
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:43.130
I usually take care of all my errands the way so I couldn't go to the bank.

465
00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:46.280
The way you asked him was a tad on the Douchey side.
No,
no.

466
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:49.980
It's true fact that that Joey d is,
it does the same.
You know,

467
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.640
he wakes up and smokes weed all day and stuff like that.
I,

468
00:25:52.641 --> 00:25:53.960
every time I hang out with Ari,

469
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:57.500
Ari is already completely baked out of his mind and it's like noon and I'm on

470
00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.290
every time I hang out with Ari,
well maybe,

471
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.240
maybe he knows he's going to hang out with you.

472
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.950
He wants to get high and I to my pocket,

473
00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.320
so let's just do it like I don't like to do it right before I go on it.

474
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.300
That's a legitimate question though.

475
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:13.560
But you said a Douchey overmedicate no,
no,
no.
Till later when he's,

476
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:14.970
you want me to do anything?
We've said,

477
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.170
I mean you wake up the first thing in the morning and I was like,
no,

478
00:26:18.171 --> 00:26:19.130
I don't do that and just go,
okay.

479
00:26:19.131 --> 00:26:21.400
You don't think you wake up first thing in the morning and smoke?
Yeah.

480
00:26:21.401 --> 00:26:25.840
You said a clear use the word douchey question.
The truth of what I,

481
00:26:25.841 --> 00:26:28.930
that's what I write.
The better way to do it.

482
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.770
Would it be too came across QC.

483
00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:36.650
That's not what I was going to do,
but the important thing is,

484
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.770
the real question is how often are you getting high all day?

485
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.650
Like how many days I get high every day.
Every day.
Yeah.

486
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.670
Shazamm you don't take no days off.
Um,
very.
If I take a day off,

487
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.660
you'll probably hear about it.
It's a note worthy moments.

488
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:56.910
Yeah.
Well,
you know there's is,
and then I'm completely fine.

489
00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.330
Right.
You know,
unless I get some honey butter like I got last night,

490
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:04.420
he'd been everyday.
Unless you get like a cookie.
Yeah.
Cookies in all day.
Look,

491
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:04.981
let's have some fun.

492
00:27:04.981 --> 00:27:09.240
I went to six flags a couple of weeks ago or last week with Eric Abrams,
Xena,

493
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:14.241
and I'm a sickler sickler and we all hide some of those stuff from LCC,

494
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:15.263
the banana breads.

495
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.640
We were all friends did not rollercoasters.
It was so good.

496
00:27:20.641 --> 00:27:25.390
I had about three quarters of one.
It was like,
oh,
choose us.

497
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.030
Oh my God.
I couldn't even imagine being that begged on a roller.
So,
so great.

498
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.270
Especially six flags.
Those are your hard codes are so extreme.

499
00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:36.750
They have one where you strap in and they lift your legs up.
So you just flying,

500
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.300
only looked down into,

501
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:42.930
what is that one called x something that they have a job at x two.

502
00:27:42.931 --> 00:27:46.680
I don't know if that was that one.
It might've been to the viper.
It was so fun.

503
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.310
It's so fun.
Season Pass,
you have to take everything out of your pockets.

504
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:53.490
You can't have nothing in your pockets,
man,
because that shit will go flying.

505
00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:56.760
This is what I did this time around.
I said,
fuck it.
I'm gonna risk my glasses.

506
00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:00.470
But yeah,
I had a Hoodie on.
I tied my glasses to the,
uh,

507
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.600
to the strings of my hoodie and they'd never fell off though.

508
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:06.540
They almost got flows,
but they never,
but I was like,
if they fall off,
fuck it.

509
00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:10.750
I got to hold on,
I'm going to die.
Wow.
So it's like,
yeah,
but they never saw us.

510
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.410
They got close and then I managed to push him back.
Dude.

511
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:18.500
Deaths in amusement parks or like whenever you see that final destination,

512
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.670
you know those movies where people are dying,

513
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.380
it's always like a bunch of different,
I never saw one of them,
but I have seen,

514
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.600
I mean I think they must have done like five of them.
Yeah.

515
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.740
I always see the fucking,
the preview Marshall's a train hit somebody,

516
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.130
a bus flips over on someone.

517
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.250
There's not many deaths on roller coasters and stuff like that really,

518
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:42.490
but there is a lot of getting stuck and you don't see that much here.

519
00:28:42.491 --> 00:28:45.330
Have you ever seen the video of like the people stuck upside down on a coaster

520
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:47.230
for four hour?
Oh my God,

521
00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.610
that's worse than the fucking final destination flying off the track.

522
00:28:50.611 --> 00:28:54.100
Can you imagine being upside down?
Oh,

523
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.410
happens all the fucking time.
Really?
Are you sure

524
00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.990
you don't even have to report the dancer,
but no one dies on that.

525
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.110
Just worked.
No one got hurt.
Oh my gosh.
It's terrifying.

526
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.780
Cyclo was saying somebody's lost their cowboy hat on the ride and so jumped the

527
00:29:12.781 --> 00:29:16.200
fence to get it.
Oh No.
And as he like got it.
He picked his head up,

528
00:29:16.201 --> 00:29:18.860
decapitated and obliterated his head.

529
00:29:18.861 --> 00:29:20.940
Somebody hit it with a foot like it was coming through.

530
00:29:20.941 --> 00:29:24.840
One of those standing thing,
their foot got shattered.
I was like,
oh,

531
00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.650
he just died instantly cause like leave your hat.

532
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.830
Oh my God,
I am the fence.
It are,

533
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.910
those things go like like three feet from the ground.

534
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:37.230
So people make some fucking terrible decisions.
Man.

535
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:42.040
People make some terrible goddamn decisions.
But yeah,
those are good

536
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.940
<v 4>days for edibles.</v>

537
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.690
You imagine the thought that went to that guy's mind right before that chick's

538
00:29:46.691 --> 00:29:49.490
foot went through his mind,
back on my heart.

539
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.360
But death.
Do you even see it coming?
I say,
Oh my God,
I can't get outta here.

540
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.550
Oh my God,
this is too close to the ground.
If you look right out as you,

541
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.750
as you pick up and they're just coming around where yeah,

542
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.150
it's and they go so fast.

543
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.030
Well I know the fastest one was in Abu Dhabi.

544
00:30:07.031 --> 00:30:09.460
They just installed it and it was a,
a,

545
00:30:09.461 --> 00:30:13.330
a Ferrari themed one because we did,
we did a UFC,

546
00:30:13.331 --> 00:30:15.230
their Ferrari world.
And it's a big,

547
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:19.420
big crazy fucking rollercoaster with like,
you know what does that,

548
00:30:19.421 --> 00:30:24.130
it sounds like your 400 miles an hour.
I think that's this one.
This one.
This one.

549
00:30:24.131 --> 00:30:28.180
Maybe it wasn't.
This is the fastest one.
This is the newest,
newest and fastest.

550
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.420
There was one at six flags.
I said that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

551
00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.060
This is probably as fast as the one you're talking about.

552
00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.970
I think this one is new.
The one in Ferrari world.
I think it's like this year.

553
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.930
I'm pretty sure it's the fastest one out.

554
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:42.160
If somebody hits your head with a foot a hundred miles an hour,

555
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:47.430
lots of really fast and such for your foot to fucking God,

556
00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:52.160
her leg shatter.
Cause she had to pick up his hat.
He's cowboy hat.
Yeah.

557
00:30:52.161 --> 00:30:55.790
It just couldn't happen.
Nobody.
Hey my cats there is any way I can get it.

558
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.640
What a crazy story she'll have though.

559
00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.430
<v 3>No,
it freaks me out.
It said it was like those,</v>

560
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:03.180
those traveling amusement parks that are in parking lots where out of nowhere

561
00:31:03.181 --> 00:31:04.800
there's like this like roller coaster in the,

562
00:31:04.801 --> 00:31:08.160
in the parking lot of a Costco circus already.
Yeah,
that's fake.

563
00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.350
There's Mexican is the role of the store?
What's,

564
00:31:10.351 --> 00:31:13.890
what's it got up mushrooms and went to watch it,
uh,
last week or the week before.

565
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.540
That shit scary man.

566
00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:19.500
I remember my mom taking me to one of those as a kid and I'm thinking,
Mike,
mom,

567
00:31:19.501 --> 00:31:23.440
that's like bad parents.
Somebody set that up.
You shouldn't be,
have control.

568
00:31:23.441 --> 00:31:27.880
Like you should not be able to choose that for me.
Like I,
that's murder.

569
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:32.670
There was always those down I guess like in New Hampshire I got,

570
00:31:32.671 --> 00:31:35.520
I'm trying to figure out where it would go and we'd go to one of the beaches,

571
00:31:35.521 --> 00:31:39.060
one of the beach towns and there was like those little fucking carnival things

572
00:31:39.061 --> 00:31:42.850
there and just really wonky roller coasters and shit where you're like,

573
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:45.450
really shouldn't be on it.
And it's just a rector sets.

574
00:31:45.451 --> 00:31:48.330
They're not even real metal.
It's just erector set,
tons of work.

575
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.480
And they used to have like haunted houses and Shit and going through the shitty

576
00:31:51.481 --> 00:31:55.740
haunted house.
I'm just terrible.
It's like a skeleton,
like a light bulb on it,

577
00:31:56.910 --> 00:32:01.490
you know,
it pops up and I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,
he's scared of me.

578
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.760
You fuck,
it's better than doing nothing.
We'll go there.
Exactly.
God,

579
00:32:05.761 --> 00:32:08.250
I wish I could remember exactly what beach all this shit was on,

580
00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.910
but there were just the one,
one whack ass ride after another.

581
00:32:11.911 --> 00:32:16.860
They were all really awful just movements and they were all just waiting to go

582
00:32:16.861 --> 00:32:20.960
flying off the tracks and in the stands and all the sleep with their big ideas

583
00:32:20.961 --> 00:32:23.760
that work there would just disappear.
All the people that owned it.

584
00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.360
You know what was really cool that I just thought of is that I don't,

585
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.980
I don't know how it was where you guys live by in haunted houses back in the day

586
00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:34.620
and Columbus,
Ohio.
It used to be like,

587
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.800
oh that you remember that old house in the corner?
They're about to tear it down,

588
00:32:37.801 --> 00:32:39.950
but they're going to make it a haunted house was still here.

589
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.780
And so like you go in this house and knowing how,
seeing it every day as a child,

590
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.201
what you know,

591
00:32:45.201 --> 00:32:48.890
driving by that one old crazy house and then knowing it's going to get torn down

592
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:50.480
right after this haunted house.

593
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:55.340
It's feels like that house is just like even a thousand times more scarier.

594
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.430
I remember just going through these old houses,
like looking around going,
wow,

595
00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.610
this is an old creepy house that needs to be torn down.
You know?

596
00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.890
That's a cool idea.
Yeah,
fucking use it.

597
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.050
<v 4>What's up with those dudes who do that shit on there on their front lawn on</v>

598
00:33:07.051 --> 00:33:09.750
Halloween,
like turned their front lawn until I got child molesters,

599
00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.780
child molesters,
head of it.

600
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.800
There was one we went trick or treating and they had amaze.

601
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.090
This guy had built amaze.
I'm like,

602
00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:23.130
this is a real trap built amazing amazes front lawn.

603
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:26.100
Have you ever been done at the Venice canals before?
Like Halloween?
No.

604
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.060
I'll do up their yard.
It was really awesome.
Really?
That and Christmas lights.

605
00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.800
The Venice canals are supposed to be really nice,

606
00:33:31.801 --> 00:33:35.080
but I know two people that live there that got robbed.
Really?
Yeah.

607
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.120
It's ever heard.
Houses got broken into that I could say.
Yeah.

608
00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.980
Say it seems like right there.
Yeah.
It's like,

609
00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.320
you know when you walked in the boardwalk in San Diego,
wherever and you're like,

610
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:46.560
oh,
there,
I can see into your living room right through this glass thing,

611
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.920
this living room that you're here only on weekends in the summer.
Yeah.

612
00:33:49.921 --> 00:33:53.820
Well not only that,
there's a lot of 'em are celebrities and they say

613
00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.920
f canal,
you know,

614
00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.460
they want everybody to know where they live because I think it's like a hip spot

615
00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:02.610
and then like Jesus stupid.
There's not that many houses there,

616
00:34:02.611 --> 00:34:04.480
so people just go wandering around,
hey look at that.

617
00:34:04.481 --> 00:34:07.700
That's that check from that fucking TV show.
Let's break in there.
Why not?

618
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:11.160
They know when you're working,
you're working all day.
You got a 16 hour day job.

619
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:15.870
Back cover onset.
Oh Great.
Awesome.
Will Rob your house?
Thanks for the heads up.

620
00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.270
I can check off on your pillows.
Jewelry.

621
00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:20.770
How many people did that turn off from their pillow?

622
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.510
If you are who you are and Megan Fox,
his house,
he would,

623
00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:28.050
I would definitely at least go to the pillow and just go smell her underwear if

624
00:34:28.051 --> 00:34:31.950
it was on the ground.
If you said it like that,

625
00:34:31.951 --> 00:34:36.480
as you pointed to what underwear
do on my own,
you wouldn't take do on your own.

626
00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:41.010
Is that something all guys do is smell?
I don't,
I'm not into it.

627
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.900
Pussy.
Yeah,
he's done it.
You've done it.
Of course.
I've done a lot of times.
Yes,

628
00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.760
I've masturbated while it was shitting TB.
Never done that.
See if I could

629
00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:55.590
teach scientific theory.
Proven

630
00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:59.770
<v 3>what Jason keeps his girlfriend's panties in a Ziploc bag when she goes out of</v>

631
00:34:59.771 --> 00:35:03.580
town just to keep the smell so she,
he can pull it out weird.

632
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.760
And I gave her a good tip and he like,
he was like,
thanks a lot for that tip.

633
00:35:06.761 --> 00:35:09.670
He uh,
that before the girl leaves or Straw friend leaves,

634
00:35:09.671 --> 00:35:13.510
Danielle needs to take her underwear and stuff at inside of her and it's so much

635
00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:14.440
better for the smell.

636
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:19.480
<v 4>Why don't you just go over there and blow him?
That's what you want to do.</v>

637
00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:24.640
Giving them tips.
Hey,
I know you're really fucked up and creepy.
What?

638
00:35:24.641 --> 00:35:28.330
Underwear,
Daniel.
Here's a way to get a little more fucked up and creepy.

639
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:32.260
No bit more snake them and put them in a zippy.
Put them in a little Ziploc bag,

640
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.950
maybe like a little detail,
a little paper towel and moisten it.

641
00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:39.630
Sort of like you would do you carry it home cigars?
Yeah.

642
00:35:39.631 --> 00:35:42.340
You should do tire sheets.
Something that really holds the smell.
Yeah.

643
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.200
Holds the smell and

644
00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:49.050
fucking lot's important because the smell of good pussy is delicious thing,

645
00:35:49.051 --> 00:35:53.490
but the smell bad pussy is probably the worst smell you can smell next to like

646
00:35:53.491 --> 00:35:57.270
some horrible chemical shit that's going to kill you.
Yeah,
the smell bat.

647
00:35:57.271 --> 00:36:01.200
When you smell a girl and has a yeast infection,
that is easily the most repo.

648
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:04.440
It's worse than Shit.
It's a,
it's the worst thing to have to ignore.

649
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.920
It's a smell that smells worse than shit.
It really does,
right?

650
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:12.750
Wouldn't you agree?
It's like a worst smell and shit.
It's like it's nature's way.

651
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.140
Nature's way of telling you you don't want those kids.

652
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.380
It's like trying to scare you off.
Nature's trying to scare off.

653
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:23.390
The worst is when you look at what happens with those things,
right?
You get the,

654
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:26.120
first of all,
you get that shit on you.
You can get a yeast infection.

655
00:36:26.121 --> 00:36:28.740
A man can get one as well.
You can get,
you can get it.

656
00:36:28.741 --> 00:36:31.530
I mean realize what she's got down happens where I get to the yeast infection.

657
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.340
It smells,
it gets crazy.
It's going to get Dick is,

658
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.810
I think that's what they choose is what does that mean?
I think it's like some,

659
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.240
some stuff that's not supposed to be there.

660
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.660
Some sort of like creation excretion.

661
00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.780
It's an itchy excretion.
Yeah.

662
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.180
It comes out of your Dick could be from all sorts of porn,

663
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:53.950
sex with a girl with cheeses upon them.
You can get,
Oh,

664
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.420
it's pretty easy for a girl to get a yeast infection too.

665
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.220
You know like when you see girls like putting chocolate syrup on them and like

666
00:36:59.221 --> 00:37:02.820
porn videos and stuff.
That's sugar.
Sugar makes you that.
That gives you,

667
00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:07.830
I can easily give you any eastern factor is the king of information on how to

668
00:37:08.071 --> 00:37:11.740
fuck up.
I was like,
ah,
so obviously a,

669
00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:14.790
that's how I got is about when you're doing those scenes,

670
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:19.740
which do come up in everyone's life,
you know,
lesbians,
bags of sugar or whatever,

671
00:37:19.741 --> 00:37:24.420
whatever the afternoons stuff,
you're the king of that Thursday.

672
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:27.480
It's a weird thing.
Mandate.
Their bodies are like,
you know,

673
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:31.200
I mean we're all of our bodies,
we just don't think about it or you know,
housing,

674
00:37:31.201 --> 00:37:34.890
all sorts of different healthy and non healthy friendly bacteria,

675
00:37:34.891 --> 00:37:38.310
unfriendly bacteria,
you know,
all sorts of shut that shit on your skin.

676
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.640
And when you have any sort of an imbalance like that,
some sort of,
uh,
you know,

677
00:37:41.641 --> 00:37:45.180
it could be for women,
it's like,
could be their diet,
it could be stuff they eat,

678
00:37:45.181 --> 00:37:46.440
make some have yeast infection.

679
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:49.320
It could be the black shit underneath your fingernail and you just shove it into

680
00:37:49.321 --> 00:37:53.210
that girl's pussy and next thing.
Yeah,
she's got wd 40 and poop inside place.

681
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:56.490
He exactly.
Or You could have a dog and she's allergic to dogs.

682
00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:59.900
And you started finger banging around the inside of her pussy swells up in

683
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:04.790
itches.
You ate shrimp at fucking red lobster and she's allergic def.

684
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.700
Definitely allergic to red lobster.
Right,

685
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.790
and your red lobster comes out of your Dick.
Yeah,

686
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.290
it's still potent son tentacle porn if you like eight months.

687
00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:16.770
Yeah.
It sounds like they're always going to get it no matter what.

688
00:38:16.771 --> 00:38:19.800
But I'm wondering if you ate mushrooms and the chick blue you,

689
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.940
if she could get some of the frat.
Ooh,
I wonder.
I wonder if he could,

690
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.550
because I know that you could drink piss and the pis actually contained

691
00:38:27.551 --> 00:38:31.490
siliciden and it actually takes a trip to the next level,
the sham,

692
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:33.780
and you're supposed to do it when you're full on tripping.

693
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.980
When you don't think you can get any higher.
You're

694
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.230
<v 2>supposed to drink,
you're pissed.
When you drink,
you're pissed.</v>

695
00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:40.660
It's all that silicide when that's gone through your system,

696
00:38:40.661 --> 00:38:44.110
that gas passes through into your urine and urine is basically sterile.

697
00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:47.530
It's people worry about drinking it,
but it's,
it's disgusting in thought,

698
00:38:47.531 --> 00:38:49.420
but in reality it's really not that big a deal.

699
00:38:49.421 --> 00:38:52.450
People drink it all the time to stay alive and they get stuck on boats and shit.

700
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.240
You know,
I mean you'd see the drink,
you're pissing live or dunk drink,

701
00:38:55.241 --> 00:38:59.530
you're pissed and diet,
dehydration,
stupid.
[inaudible] sure it's gross.

702
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:03.510
But when you're high as fuck and you drink your past apparently the,

703
00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:07.390
the mushrooms you into like another door,

704
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.840
you know like you know you went through the,
Brian had a breakthrough,

705
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:15.110
a mushroom trip that we talked about yesterday where he had like seven grams and

706
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.710
he,
wow,
really?
Seven grand.

707
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.840
The world dissolved and he became a part of some other world.
What,

708
00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:21.820
how much that cost you

709
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.920
<v 3>anything?
Those are the ones you got last minute,
Huh?</v>

710
00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:27.480
Those are the ones who got last minute kind of an inside conversation.

711
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:30.850
We're talking about a very important thing to have.
You know,

712
00:39:30.851 --> 00:39:34.720
I was thinking about,
I saw the story of Pixar the other day.
She got it from Bob.

713
00:39:34.721 --> 00:39:36.820
No.
Do you it from John.
What about Timmy?
I said,
I started,

714
00:39:36.821 --> 00:39:40.360
started at Pixar the other day and he was talking about how creation a CGI is

715
00:39:40.361 --> 00:39:41.470
all like triangles.

716
00:39:41.471 --> 00:39:44.300
And when I was having that breakthrough on mushrooms the other day,
I,

717
00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.150
that's what I was looking at my hand,

718
00:39:46.151 --> 00:39:50.650
that everything was triangles and so animation,
like a person's face and stuff,

719
00:39:50.651 --> 00:39:53.740
it's just tons and tons of triangles.
So I'm thinking,
wow,

720
00:39:53.741 --> 00:39:57.760
what if I broke through and found out that I am a program and that's what I was

721
00:39:57.761 --> 00:39:59.700
seeing my hand that was triangles.
Like I found,

722
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.260
I saw like the inner programming of my hand.
Well,
you know,

723
00:40:02.261 --> 00:40:06.820
that's how that's lucky.
Huge scientific theory.
Believe it or not,

724
00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:07.900
that the world,

725
00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:12.440
the world is some sort of a computer recreation that our reality is not in

726
00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:15.370
<v 2>fact reality.
It's some sort of an artificial reality that sir,</v>

727
00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.760
it's all the major it's been created.
No,
it's not.

728
00:40:17.761 --> 00:40:22.530
Even the Matrix is the matrix idea was that we were using like the human body,

729
00:40:22.531 --> 00:40:22.741
you know,

730
00:40:22.741 --> 00:40:26.850
they had to make it dark and discussing the human body had gotten stuck to this

731
00:40:26.851 --> 00:40:31.851
machine and it was like there was sucking off by the all the biological program.

732
00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.260
Yeah.
Well,
sort of,

733
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.300
but it was also sort of like a devious one that was like plotted to keep people

734
00:40:39.301 --> 00:40:39.781
down.

735
00:40:39.781 --> 00:40:44.410
And the idea is that the whole life that we're living,

736
00:40:44.411 --> 00:40:47.270
like there is no real world,
is that every,

737
00:40:47.271 --> 00:40:52.271
everything that you see and encounter is all just a part of your imagination.

738
00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:56.390
All of it is.
And this world that you live in,
this world,
the,
the,

739
00:40:56.391 --> 00:41:00.930
the people that you interact with are all people that you've created in your

740
00:41:00.931 --> 00:41:03.090
mind.
It just helps with the world.
And he would say,
well,

741
00:41:03.091 --> 00:41:05.940
that's bullshit because I have my own world and I have my own juice.

742
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:09.240
So you're saying that I can do,
yes.
Yes.
That's the theory.

743
00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.470
Theory is you have your own,
you're saying,

744
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:15.450
of course it's our universities interact with each other and we can change each

745
00:41:15.451 --> 00:41:20.040
other.
Yeah.
Well there's,
there's a lot of wonky fucking ideas when it comes to,

746
00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:24.000
you know,
what is reality and what is,
what is consciousness?
What is our place?

747
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.210
If you've built that university head that everyone else is just a part of your

748
00:41:27.211 --> 00:41:30.850
head.
So they don't really exist.
They're just telling you no like no,

749
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:32.700
like in your world,
I'm just saying this,

750
00:41:32.701 --> 00:41:35.840
but I don't really have any idea would be that there would be more than one

751
00:41:35.841 --> 00:41:39.970
universe.
The idea would be that everyone would have their own,
like they're,

752
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.420
well you could call it a universe,

753
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:46.430
but we sort of have we some how or another coexist inside each other's universes

754
00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:53.340
and that almost,
they're almost completely independent of each other.
But in when,

755
00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:55.700
when they interact with each other they can change each other back and forth.

756
00:41:55.701 --> 00:41:58.830
It sounds like total ridiculous hippy talk.
But if you,
you know,

757
00:41:58.831 --> 00:42:02.960
if you look at like scientific interpretations of what a,
um,

758
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.400
some sort of a,
a,

759
00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:09.410
a computer program of life would be and how detailed it could cat.
Well,

760
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:13.730
with the exponential increase in technology can get absolutely unrecognizable.

761
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.180
The computer simulation one day we'll end [inaudible].

762
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.950
It will be impossible to stop it from being as real as real life impossible.

763
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:24.680
So to say that we are absolutely not in that.

764
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:26.690
When we know what human beings are capable of.

765
00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.960
We already talked about this cork glue on thing where they're,
you know,

766
00:42:29.961 --> 00:42:33.500
this insanely dense battle.
We know structure.

767
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:35.360
That's possible.
Yeah.

768
00:42:35.361 --> 00:42:38.690
We're just think it looks everything people fighting you and that's possible.

769
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:41.950
Oh that shit is possible with this.
We,
this might not be real.
It's,

770
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:47.080
it's possible that it sounds completely ridiculous and I'm absolutely agreeing

771
00:42:47.301 --> 00:42:51.260
with anyone right now who's going,
this is what a total stoner talk.
Yes it is.

772
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:53.750
Yes it is.
But it's also possible.

773
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.860
It's possible that reality is some sort of a computer simulation.
Okay.

774
00:42:57.861 --> 00:42:58.680
So then what,

775
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.210
<v 3>when I came out of it,
and it's a big question,</v>

776
00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.080
when I came out of being sick and puking and going through this phases of the

777
00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:08.070
beat,
just being just like body was ill,
like out of nowhere,

778
00:43:08.071 --> 00:43:11.430
I just became better and like,
like,
and I remember laying in bed,

779
00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:14.700
we talked about this yesterday and I remember laying in bed going,
you know what?

780
00:43:14.701 --> 00:43:16.200
I think I just died back there.

781
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:20.100
And then that in some other world and you and some other world you are just
like,

782
00:43:20.101 --> 00:43:23.220
you know going,
oh my God you're dead and this is like a whole different,

783
00:43:23.221 --> 00:43:27.000
like I was re I froze up and I was reset as my program was reset.

784
00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.130
It might be because I felt like I was like,
wait a second,

785
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.960
why do I feel 100% right now?

786
00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.600
And just a couple of minutes ago I was cause we bought our food out to the

787
00:43:33.601 --> 00:43:35.720
person out there to this cap took to the cynic.

788
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.860
The people that this work you're doing,

789
00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:42.840
you're jacking your brain with chem what goals and your five senses are being

790
00:43:42.841 --> 00:43:45.950
overloaded at four limited

791
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:50.950
<v 2>understanding of this reality and whatever the fuck else is possible out there.</v>

792
00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.630
Just relax on that.
I know what you're saying.

793
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:58.250
I'm with you 100% of course you're taking drugs in some wacky shit happens when

794
00:43:58.251 --> 00:44:01.310
you take the drugs and you think it's real.
Hoe hippie.

795
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:06.460
What is death?
What is life?
What is,
what is the energy that takes us here?

796
00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:08.600
What's really takes us into another place.
It's just the same thing.

797
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:10.850
It was like liquor where it's like you're just barfed and you feel better.

798
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:12.110
What is mushrooms?

799
00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.800
It's something on which makes you think that that's what's interesting though,

800
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:20.660
right?
To worry about and
I know what,
what,
what,

801
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:25.340
what I'm saying here is what everyone's worrying about is what sounds ridiculous

802
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.640
but they're not worrying about is how ridiculous our mushrooms in the first

803
00:44:28.641 --> 00:44:32.670
place.
Right?
I mean you're talking about,
well it can't be the your ea,

804
00:44:32.671 --> 00:44:37.170
you re reacting to a higher consciousness.
It's just chemicals and listen,

805
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:38.940
how crazy is it?

806
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:43.941
There's a fucking little plant that you can eat that can fuck your mind up so

807
00:44:45.361 --> 00:44:49.320
deep.
How crazy is it?
Visits a little thing that's like that.

808
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:54.620
You can take it and it can take you to a cartoon world of impossible images.

809
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.340
That's his defense mechanism as a plant.
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

810
00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:02.010
It's just like a Jalapeno pepper.
But why it makes you want to eat it.

811
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:05.410
It makes us want to eat it.
But then the years that had originally a counter,

812
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:09.250
it told them like,
don't cause it'll fuck you up.
Is that true?
Yeah.
Just like,

813
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:12.150
well,
you know,
well,
I know that's true with hot peppers,

814
00:45:12.151 --> 00:45:15.420
but did you know that the Ama Nita miscarrying is like the number one food for

815
00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:16.170
Caribou?

816
00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:21.170
They love really that crazy red and white snow man looking Santa Claus mushroom.

817
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:26.790
Yeah.
That's the one that they believe that yet the em and eat a mushroom.

818
00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:30.180
This one from the sacred mushroom and the cross and that's the one that looks

819
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:33.960
like Santa Claus.
They love that shit.
They eat the reindeer.
A famous for it.

820
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.550
Really?
It just keep eating it.
Yeah.
That's how the whole Shamans,

821
00:45:36.551 --> 00:45:40.190
Santa Claus myth happened with reindeer.
That's how rain they're going mix.

822
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:45.420
We'll see the whole idea,
and this if you haven't heard this,
it's a crazy theory.

823
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:48.090
I don't know how much of it makes sense,

824
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:53.330
but the idea is that this mushroom represents Santa Claus and that Santa Claus,

825
00:45:54.211 --> 00:45:57.480
when you see this Santa Claus and you see him and he's like bringing new

826
00:45:57.481 --> 00:45:59.190
packages under the Christmas tree.

827
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.040
Well that those packages as bright shiny packages,

828
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:07.190
what those packages are is those mushrooms have a microrisal relationship with

829
00:46:07.201 --> 00:46:08.790
that tree with pine trees.

830
00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:11.760
They grow under these fucking pine trees and they grow in the room,

831
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:15.360
the forest and people collect them and that Santa Claus was a showman and the

832
00:46:15.361 --> 00:46:20.250
reason why they hung red stockings in front of the fire,
those aren't stockings.

833
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:24.100
Those are red mushrooms.
Those mushrooms are red and white.
Red and white there.

834
00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.850
Yeah,
they are the colors of Santa Claus and that's how they dry them out.

835
00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:28.230
They would hang them in front of the fireplace.

836
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:31.530
That's how they preserve on and that's also why they hang them on trees.

837
00:46:31.531 --> 00:46:32.910
You hang them on trees to drive them out.

838
00:46:32.911 --> 00:46:34.830
It's what you make of your reality as you're tripping out.

839
00:46:34.831 --> 00:46:37.930
You'd like whatever that those drapes become fucking something.
A waterfall.

840
00:46:37.931 --> 00:46:39.420
What's,
what's the poisonous one?

841
00:46:39.421 --> 00:46:43.800
I thought the poisonous one was the emoney and Mascara is a little bit
poisonous.

842
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:46.430
Yeah.
I thought that was the one to stay away from.
Well,
when,

843
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:51.360
when I say poisons the l,
it's in the LD 50 rate.
You have to worry about,

844
00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:53.220
you know,
you have to worry about toxicity.

845
00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:57.090
There's some that looked like psychedelic mushrooms,
but they're really toxic.

846
00:46:57.350 --> 00:47:01.050
You gotta be really good at,
right.
I think this is one system.
Yeah.
Yeah.

847
00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:05.010
There's some that will fuck you up,
man.
But there's like,
it's all in like,

848
00:47:05.011 --> 00:47:07.080
what kills us doesn't kill other things.

849
00:47:07.081 --> 00:47:09.810
And what kills other things doesn't kill us.
You know,
like sheep,

850
00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:13.710
sheep can't eat DMT.
If she sheep eat DMT,

851
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.390
they fucking fall down to the ground.

852
00:47:15.391 --> 00:47:18.700
Their little legs stick up and you have seizures and die.
Yeah,
yeah.

853
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:23.370
If they eat grass that has a high DMT content,
they're fucked.
Wow.
Yeah.

854
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:27.330
Look at us.
We have it in our brains and we can smoke it and trip out and we'll,

855
00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:30.040
you know,
relatively fine dogs can

856
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.930
<v 4>eat chocolate.
You know what I'm saying?
So when,
when,</v>

857
00:47:31.931 --> 00:47:33.850
when they do like tests on other animals,

858
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:35.670
that's one of the things you have to consider.
Like,
man,

859
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:40.480
we're all so we've absolutely,
this would be a good time to promote shrimp fest.

860
00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:41.370
Oh yeah.
That's,

861
00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:44.530
so tell me about this shroom festival organizing international mushroom
festival.

862
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:47.740
Ah,
where are you going to do at 18th,
19th and 20th all over the world,
Joe,

863
00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.180
whoever be oh,
people are just going to go on web cams.
Are you just going down?

864
00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:55.570
We're all just doing shrooms together.
I think Brian's got a good,
yeah.
If people,

865
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:59.770
if people want to uh,
want to,
um,
what's it called?
Tape.
Schaaf take pictures.

866
00:47:59.771 --> 00:48:04.760
Webcam.
Absolutely get involved in the community.
Yeah,
I'm Webcam it up man.
Yeah.

867
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.650
Yeah.
You definitely want people web cam in and Twitter's tech stores.
Yeah.

868
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:10.390
On Twitter.
We're going to have hashtag shrimp fest shroom fast.

869
00:48:10.391 --> 00:48:13.570
So when I think goes down with your plans to Hashtag that's we can all look,

870
00:48:13.571 --> 00:48:16.240
we can all sort of be together with it.
So how do you avoid getting arrested?

871
00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.990
Well,
you know,
just like every time we do illegal drugs.
Yeah.
But this one,

872
00:48:19.991 --> 00:48:24.100
you make it very vocal
getting arrested.
June 18th,

873
00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:26.860
19th and 20th century.
Cheveria want to step out of the house please?

874
00:48:26.861 --> 00:48:28.450
This is the door.
It's over here.
I know.

875
00:48:28.451 --> 00:48:32.740
It looks like a giant gaping vagina with teeth.
This is the door I would be,

876
00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.760
I would not be partaking ensuring fast.
Why would I do it?
No,
I just did it.

877
00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.520
What if when you do shit to him more than once,

878
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.970
what if when you do shrooms or you enter into some sort of a zone or was,

879
00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:46.270
if it wasn't true and maybe some other drug where there was a zone you could

880
00:48:46.271 --> 00:48:50.530
enter where everyone was in the same hallucination of people say all the people

881
00:48:50.531 --> 00:48:53.480
that are high who are out there,
shroom and all over the world,

882
00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:58.440
a music giant world of Warcraft.
Dope.

883
00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.740
When I'm not sure if that was at a music festival in Ottawa.

884
00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:02.140
I wasn't sure who he was and as I was leaving,

885
00:49:02.141 --> 00:49:03.340
as were all the whole crowd was leaving,

886
00:49:03.341 --> 00:49:06.460
I could tell who else was on some sort of hallucinogen really in your head,

887
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:10.940
really?
In my head,
but I,
everyone's on just antidepressants.

888
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:16.460
He's on it.
I could tell.
I can tell you're the in the vibe.
No,
it's lovey.

889
00:49:16.461 --> 00:49:19.540
Tra smiling.
I smile.

890
00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:23.170
Nothing scares me more than those Abilify commercials.

891
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:24.970
Nothing scares me more than,
than Arriann Salvia.

892
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:27.620
Those Abilify commercials or commercials where you're,

893
00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:32.110
your regular antidepressants don't work.
So you take this one,
what does that do?

894
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:35.860
And this one can make you suicidal,
homicidal.

895
00:49:35.861 --> 00:49:39.400
It can make you a fucking,
uh,
a menace.
But it's for,

896
00:49:39.401 --> 00:49:44.110
don't chew that shit up Brian.
It's for,
um,
people who uh,

897
00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:48.150
who are regular shit ain't working for them.
Yeah,
it does.

898
00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.960
People barely hanging on a lot of,
a lot of antidepressants.
Making suicidal.

899
00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:55.720
What the fuck for real careful start to in slow doses.

900
00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:58.990
How would I crazy catch 22 days side for the like,

901
00:49:58.991 --> 00:50:00.490
so if you feel more than normal,

902
00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:04.340
that tells me immediately you want to talk about Ren Salvia.
No,

903
00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:08.230
let's finish what we're talking about.
True freshmen.
So yeah,

904
00:50:08.231 --> 00:50:09.970
I've tried to get everyone to fucking do it,
to join it.

905
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:13.860
Tons of people at the commerce or doing it.
Tons of people.
Uh,

906
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.200
I might do it a couple times and I been big.
It's just 10.

907
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:19.360
We just got to sit in your house and do it or no,
no,
no.

908
00:50:19.361 --> 00:50:22.270
I'm going to go explain to me shrimp fest.
What is the concept behind it?

909
00:50:22.271 --> 00:50:24.700
And what are you talking to?
Everybody?
Let's go.
I'll fucking do it together.

910
00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:27.950
So I'll do make an excuse just to do some shrooms that they're awesome.

911
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.640
<v 6>I want you to experience them.
Here's the reason.
Just for the sake of the thing,</v>

912
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.550
how many freak outs you think you're going to cause worldwide.

913
00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:37.610
And I was planning it.
I was deciding when should we do this?

914
00:50:37.611 --> 00:50:40.340
And I thought Monday would be the best day because let's stay away from the

915
00:50:40.341 --> 00:50:43.000
squares.
There'll be at work,
let's get involved in it.

916
00:50:43.001 --> 00:50:45.680
When so many people were asking me the light,
but I want to,
I want to do it,

917
00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:48.530
but I can't take off a day of work.
Yeah man.
What year

918
00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:52.680
<v 2>your problem is,
you're only going to get the,
the uh,
the societal,
the outcasts.</v>

919
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:57.360
<v 6>So I added Saturday and Sunday.
Oh,
nice.
Monday,
Saturday,
Sunday.</v>

920
00:50:57.361 --> 00:50:58.920
What I would tell high school was over,
right?

921
00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:01.710
So kids didn't have to worry about schools and finals.
Wow.

922
00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:04.370
So somebody who's going to do something bad and they can blame you down.

923
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:07.020
You got to take responsibility for yourself and your own actions.

924
00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:09.860
It seems like that's not a good idea to promote a day day.

925
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:14.160
Everybody come up for July 4th barbecue and somebody dies on the way there.

926
00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:17.210
It's the same way.
It's like be careful.
Be careful.
Yeah.
There's this,

927
00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:20.610
you shouldn't do it and drive.
Nobody should drive on mushrooms.
Absolutely not.

928
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:23.280
Cause that's the point.
You're making a good point.
Um,
yeah.

929
00:51:23.281 --> 00:51:25.680
Don't do anything reckless at all,
but have some fun.
Organize a party,

930
00:51:25.681 --> 00:51:28.260
go to a beach,
go to a barbecue,
go to a music festival.

931
00:51:28.261 --> 00:51:30.210
There's worse things that we could do with our time.

932
00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.520
You're talking about Portabella mushrooms too?
No,

933
00:51:32.521 --> 00:51:35.880
I'm talking about psychedelic mushrooms and like know beans about bones,

934
00:51:35.881 --> 00:51:38.070
about it.
I'm clearly talking about illegal mushrooms,

935
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.940
but I'm still saying let's all do it.
Start looking now.
Fine.
Just rooms.

936
00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:42.893
Ask a waiter,

937
00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:46.720
ask whoever would would your stoner friends don't know how to get it if you're

938
00:51:46.721 --> 00:51:51.510
waiting or has more than one tattoo?
Yeah.
Ask Him.
Ask Him.
That's a good source.

939
00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.720
Especially if he's getting good tattoos.
If they don't have it,

940
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:58.800
they'll tell you where to get it.
You know,
if you tip well.
Yeah.
Well,

941
00:51:58.801 --> 00:52:00.360
where would you go?
Would you go to a bar,

942
00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:02.340
ask a waiter at a bar and that's the best move,
right.

943
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:06.030
I would say like a Houston's Houston's Houston's just because my roommate used

944
00:52:06.031 --> 00:52:09.720
to work there and he was like,
yeah,
we all had wheat.
I would say guitar center.

945
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:13.280
That'd be a good idea too.
You have to convince them that you're not a cop.
Right.

946
00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:14.490
Cause it's very weird.
Look.

947
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:18.480
Do you have any mushrooms through Google made a purchase from you,
sir?

948
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:23.500
<v 2>There was another woman who was a,
a cop,
uh,
who,
uh,</v>

949
00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:27.760
coerce some guys in to getting her drugs and then they arrested the guys for

950
00:52:27.761 --> 00:52:30.760
drugs.
Really?
Yeah.
The guy was saying that he could get,

951
00:52:30.761 --> 00:52:32.770
it was in somewhere near San Diego.

952
00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.990
I forget where it was and I bring this up because we,

953
00:52:34.991 --> 00:52:37.780
yesterday we were talking about that ridiculous case where the woman went to

954
00:52:37.781 --> 00:52:39.550
high school,
not just one woman,

955
00:52:39.551 --> 00:52:42.820
but a bunch of different people went to high school and pretended to be a high

956
00:52:42.821 --> 00:52:44.230
school students and they were cops,

957
00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:47.190
undercover cops and they busted all these people for wheat.
Wow.

958
00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:48.153
You didn't hear about,

959
00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:53.370
<v 6>damn,
that's a fucking rude man.
That's when you're just being the man.</v>

960
00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:57.630
What are you doing?
Why you ain't hurting the race so far more to come?
Fuck.

961
00:52:58.050 --> 00:52:59.600
That's what my point is like

962
00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:03.750
<v 2>when you,
when you ask someone,
like say if you're talking to a,</v>

963
00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:06.870
a a child and you're an adult,
all right.

964
00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:10.320
This woman has got to be like at least 19 to be a cop.
Right?

965
00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:15.770
And she's talking to some kids how much smarter or using them when you're 19 and

966
00:53:16.081 --> 00:53:18.600
they're 15 you're so much fucking smarter than them,
man.

967
00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:22.890
You could talk them into doing all kinds of shit.
Yeah,

968
00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:24.600
because you could talk them into it.
Dude.

969
00:53:24.601 --> 00:53:28.770
You barely talk normal as well as when you got a mouth full of fucking dry food

970
00:53:28.771 --> 00:53:33.270
or you,
that's why there's not far from you too.

971
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:36.380
What are you eating?
A cookie?
I have a basketball game tonight.
Oh,

972
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:40.530
nice.
Oh Park.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.

973
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:43.470
What about this says it like we're just supposed to know,

974
00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:46.590
but I played basketball at the park with all my comic friends.
Right.

975
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:49.940
I shot lights out.
I took a jolly rancher.
I look to hard before.
Oh yeah,

976
00:53:49.941 --> 00:53:53.100
I was on fire.
I've never played that good.
Never not in high school.

977
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:55.500
Never been that good.
And it gives you a certain sensitivity.

978
00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.600
Everything slowed down and the ball came at you like,
okay,

979
00:53:57.601 --> 00:54:00.720
I can get to catch that.
Should I pass it on the word per shot?

980
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.870
Well here it comes.
I should grab it now.
You should try it.
Pool on it.

981
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:07.170
You tried pullo 92 my first poker tournament.
Dude,

982
00:54:07.171 --> 00:54:10.870
you could play the fuck out of some pool when you're high.
Hmm.
You feel the boat.

983
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:14.040
I'm just never on an edible,
I don't think.
Yeah,
the edibles,

984
00:54:14.041 --> 00:54:16.710
the way to go regular high is good,

985
00:54:16.711 --> 00:54:19.830
but that there's something with the edible does to me is it?

986
00:54:19.831 --> 00:54:22.840
It tunes the whole body in,
you know where as pot,

987
00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:26.370
like when you smoke it goes blast right to your head and your high as fuck.

988
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:29.910
But it's not,
your body's not as in tuned the way it is with an edible.

989
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:34.080
Edible does something where the whole thing is hits the same frequency.

990
00:54:34.081 --> 00:54:37.830
The whole you like you get a control over your body,
a feeling over your body.

991
00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:42.660
That's why sex is so good.
Right.
Brian Edibles when your height squared.
Yeah,

992
00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:45.920
it's crazy shit.
And he's jolly ranchers lately they just,

993
00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:48.630
it's like doing banking banqueting immediately.
But yeah.
Wait,

994
00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.350
what does that mean?
It just like super body numbness.

995
00:54:51.351 --> 00:54:54.360
So you just let it lie there and just not feel anything.
It just,

996
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:57.930
everything feels numb.
Like it just make me stupid as fuck.

997
00:54:57.931 --> 00:55:01.810
I can't take those things.
That part of it,
it doesn't,
it doesn't do that now.

998
00:55:01.811 --> 00:55:05.310
It's just more of like a body part of the bike and that's all I associated with

999
00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:09.870
veganism.
I got Viking is after my first ACL operation,
the first one I did,

1000
00:55:09.871 --> 00:55:13.140
they did what's called a Patella tendon graft.
And what that is,

1001
00:55:13.141 --> 00:55:17.910
is they take the Patella tendon is a really big fat,
thick tendon.

1002
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:19.940
And what they do is they take,
uh,

1003
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:23.250
they drill a hole and they cut the bone out.

1004
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:27.510
They cut a section of bone out and slice the tendon and then cut a section of

1005
00:55:27.511 --> 00:55:29.220
the bone out where it connects.
And your Shin.

1006
00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:33.720
And then they open you up like a fish and they screw it into the bottom with a

1007
00:55:33.721 --> 00:55:38.100
screw and the screwed into the top of the screw and it's onsets and eventually

1008
00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:40.230
becomes like really strong like now.

1009
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:45.590
But the fucking pain of the screws that they put in the bone of your shin is

1010
00:55:48.391 --> 00:55:52.100
hard to describe.
Man.
It's fucking hard to describe.

1011
00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:53.520
And I was lying on the couch.

1012
00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.490
I had my second one done with the cadaver and it's way easier.

1013
00:55:56.491 --> 00:55:57.990
It was nowhere near the pain,

1014
00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:02.000
but I would get off the couch and it would be like a law.

1015
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:07.280
Like someone took a pitchfork and just dipped it in hot love or act.

1016
00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:11.350
It's just trying to just shoving it into your asshole.
Like that's what,

1017
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:16.270
that's how bad it hurt.
It was fucking intense.
And so they gave me some Vicodin,

1018
00:56:16.271 --> 00:56:19.080
so every time I'd get up off the couch,
it was really temporary.

1019
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:21.900
It would only last like maybe,
maybe 30 seconds or a minute,

1020
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:24.080
but the fucking pain was on.

1021
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.580
<v 4>I never felt anything like that.
I had had broken bones.</v>

1022
00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:32.550
I'd have I been sick.
I,
I've had a lot of like a real bad moments.
I

1023
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:35.400
fucking got rid of him,

1024
00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:38.950
got rid of him after one day cause I took it and I was sitting on the couch and

1025
00:56:38.951 --> 00:56:43.640
I was so fucked up.
I was so dumb.
I was so dull.

1026
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:44.290
I,

1027
00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:49.290
my mouth was open and I was watching MTV and I remember thinking I will never do

1028
00:56:49.661 --> 00:56:52.000
these again.
I don't give a fuck about the pain.

1029
00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:53.770
I don't ever want to feel like this.

1030
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:58.950
I just felt stupid as fuck and I don't know man.
Maybe it's just me because uh,

1031
00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.460
the dudes at the pool hall loved them.

1032
00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:05.800
They bought those shits off me with the quickness.
Yeah man.

1033
00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:09.840
I before even fucking offered my friend Jeff was like,
hey bud,
I fair.

1034
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:11.060
Hey do you got some viking ends?

1035
00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.320
You're trying to get rid of the other things but I can't you even fucking hear

1036
00:57:14.321 --> 00:57:18.280
you vultures.
They knew like,
yeah,
this stuff sucks.

1037
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:20.290
I just did like other constipated me,

1038
00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:24.550
they give you constipation how many times he has done these things.

1039
00:57:24.551 --> 00:57:27.550
So I took it from my knee surgery.
I didn't take it for like a week or two.
Yeah.

1040
00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:30.730
And um,
I didn't get the crazy stupid stuff,
but I did get a,

1041
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:35.710
you had a meniscus meniscus?
Not that.
Oh,
you're a bone crack.

1042
00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.990
Yeah.
Ooh.
Had the bone crack.
It's all,

1043
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:40.330
I don't know if that's all he'll hooked or something.

1044
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.110
There's somebody catch you in something.
I don't,

1045
00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:44.700
I honestly think it was kettlebells,
kettlebells,

1046
00:57:44.701 --> 00:57:48.340
and the next time to kettlebells after I came back from PTO therapy,

1047
00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:51.970
I could feel a tweak real was like,
I should,
this is what it was.

1048
00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.220
I thought it might've been the more,
cause I was like,

1049
00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:56.710
it was around the same time as I did some of those,
um,

1050
00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:59.170
they really out to your power,
but your problem,

1051
00:57:59.171 --> 00:58:03.460
once you went for like this long period of time where you weren't in shape and

1052
00:58:03.461 --> 00:58:06.390
then all of a sudden you threw yourself into Jujitsu class.
Yeah.

1053
00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:09.430
It was after like a year though.
Yeah.
But right away we were still getting,

1054
00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:12.640
you were getting some breakdowns,
you know,
it's hard and you don't,

1055
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:14.850
you don't eat that good.
No.
You know,

1056
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.050
we talked about that.
Like,
I'm like,
if you really want to do this,

1057
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:22.780
you have to take vitamins and you have to eat well.

1058
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:24.940
It really trying to get my candy.
I'd take to where I want.

1059
00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:29.920
Where's it at right now?
Well,
I'm suffering greatly.
The juicy fruit category,

1060
00:58:29.921 --> 00:58:34.090
GG fruit,
all the sort of [inaudible] was a fan of anything other than chocolate.

1061
00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:38.250
Why try other things?
Oh,
I got bored with life,
man.
Get out there and try them.

1062
00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:42.310
You know,
I try like a go crazy.
Get a little sour patch kids and I was like,

1063
00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.440
fucking melon.
Grab some chocolate

1064
00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:50.320
gummy Belen ranks.
Hmm.
Not really a melon rings fan.

1065
00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:54.440
Squirty Gumby squirty gummy bears.
A peanut branch.

1066
00:58:54.441 --> 00:58:59.441
I have the same voice in the same conversation when he's 80 Oh squirty gammy

1067
00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:03.810
verity.
Melanins slices.
They're all gonna think he's a pedophile.
It's like,

1068
00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.890
let's say I just never grew up in the same time.

1069
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:08.980
Like tell us about nine 11 well these terrorist,

1070
00:59:08.981 --> 00:59:13.981
the binos that was back when you can get Twizzlers at the corner store the gas

1071
00:59:14.681 --> 00:59:19.300
station,
get Twizzlers before they need them.
One day.

1072
00:59:19.301 --> 00:59:22.470
Twizzlers,
Twizzlers,
stop paying the other government.

1073
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:26.470
Just to be able to eat those.
They do nothing but bad for you.
Gavin,
come in,

1074
00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:31.370
bitches.
No,
your shit's poisonous.
Shut everything down.
The twizzler factor.

1075
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.250
I mean we look,
someone has to come to the,
someone has to come to the,

1076
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:37.670
the absolute conclusion that that's what's happening with cigarettes.

1077
00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:41.630
There's no other fucking way.
Cigarettes would still be legal.
They are.

1078
00:59:41.631 --> 00:59:43.970
They are paying the government to keep cigarettes legal.

1079
00:59:43.971 --> 00:59:45.200
There's just no way around it.

1080
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:50.470
If there's one thing that's killing 350 to 400,000 people every year,

1081
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:58.460
year,
Americans,
worldwide,
Americans wrap your head around that.

1082
00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:03.260
Richard Thousand Americans.
Every 300,000 Americans plus every year,

1083
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.460
so that's like dead from cigarettes.
A 10th of 1% of the country.
Well look,

1084
01:00:07.461 --> 01:00:11.930
they were going to die every thousand people.
Yeah,
every year.
Oh yeah.

1085
01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.980
Wow.
That's a lot.
Yeah.
That should totally be illegal.

1086
01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:15.903
Then she'd give you like a year,

1087
01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.660
I'm pulling this out of my ass,
so we'll just,
it's everything.

1088
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:25.280
It's every six and a half minutes.
Somebody dies in America or the world,

1089
01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:30.410
I don't know.
You don't know every 617 the rogue red smoke?
I don't know.

1090
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:33.500
I'm just guessing like why?

1091
01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:36.910
Why even saying cause I can't imagine the commercial going.
Listen to this.

1092
01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.230
Here's the,
it's even crazier.
It's even crazier.

1093
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:44.630
Worldwide tobacco deaths are more than 5 million per year.

1094
01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:50.440
Wow.
Whoa.
Now how many of those are accounting somebody?

1095
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:55.010
Here we go.
The most recent statistics America 2011 yeah,

1096
01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:59.120
443,000 us deaths attributed.

1097
01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:03.590
It's only been,
it's only been five months.
No,
each year they're saying each year.

1098
01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:06.910
Sorry,
I didn't read the full full sentence to you.
What does that,

1099
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:12.130
each year an estimated 443,000 people die prematurely from smoking or exposure

1100
01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:18.941
to secondhand smoke and another 8.6 million live with a serious illness caused

1101
01:01:19.521 --> 01:01:23.000
by smoking.
Wow.
Oh yeah.
They'd have people like that.
They don't die,

1102
01:01:23.001 --> 01:01:25.970
but they have trick Ya,
dude.
That is not just tracheotomy.

1103
01:01:25.971 --> 01:01:27.410
How about people of iron lungs?

1104
01:01:27.411 --> 01:01:30.260
How have people that are slowly dying or is that still around?

1105
01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:34.430
I saw an iron lung.
You see him at the airport,
man,
they're,

1106
01:01:34.431 --> 01:01:36.770
they're carrying around or there's some people that have iron lungs.
Yeah.

1107
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:39.500
The thing with it forces you to breathe in and out.
I'm sure that exists,

1108
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.590
but how about the people that are connected to those tanks?

1109
01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:46.250
Bring them everywhere.
Things in their,
in their nostrils.
And you know what it is,

1110
01:01:46.251 --> 01:01:48.080
man,
I saw it going down at the gun ranch.

1111
01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:51.680
He had that thing in his scooter in the back.
That's to his rifle.

1112
01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:54.710
It was also in the bag.
Well for some people I shouldn't say you know who it is.

1113
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:57.050
Cause for some people I'm sure they have to use that because of an actual

1114
01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:00.380
disease they didn't get from switching.
But,
but it's amazing man.

1115
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.230
Those numbers are really scary.

1116
01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:07.220
It's the numbers or the trippy thing about him is that it's never discussed.

1117
01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:07.611
You know,

1118
01:02:07.611 --> 01:02:11.210
they'll talk about 3000 people that died during nine 11 and no one's saying that

1119
01:02:11.211 --> 01:02:13.700
that's not a big deal.
It is a big deal and it's a horrible thing.

1120
01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.880
But 443,000 people are reacting to death,

1121
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.500
choking on their own fluid.

1122
01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:26.070
That's building up in their rotten lungs.
They drown.

1123
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.930
They drown in their own fluid.

1124
01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.050
They literally can't get oxygen into their lungs anymore.

1125
01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:33.900
They fill up with fluid and they die a horrible death.

1126
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:37.770
They have to strap them down.
That's a thousand people a day.

1127
01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:41.910
That's more than a thousand people a day.
[inaudible] crime,
Annie.
Yeah,

1128
01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:43.860
that's a lot.
Yeah.
That should totally be able to go.

1129
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:48.000
That should give you some time.
It's so scary,
right?
Six months,

1130
01:02:48.001 --> 01:02:50.880
six months to a year.
Yeah.
We were like,
it's going to happen here.
Six months.

1131
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:52.290
I don't think it should be illegal.

1132
01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:54.450
I think you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want.
On the second hand,

1133
01:02:54.451 --> 01:02:58.440
smoke makes me,
makes me second.
They're doing in terms of like not,
not in public.

1134
01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.370
That's scary.
When you have a,
you know,

1135
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:03.840
a spouse or children and you know your smoking and your apartment.

1136
01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.620
That's a lot of people are doing that and those kids are getting sick.
Yeah.

1137
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:07.490
That's a scary thing

1138
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:07.720
<v 3>then.</v>

1139
01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:12.210
Do you know it's against the law now in California to drive in a car with anyone

1140
01:03:12.211 --> 01:03:16.630
under the age of 18 I mean if it's your own kids and smoke cigarettes.
Yup.
Oh,

1141
01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.400
in smoke?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
It was like,
what are you doing?

1142
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:22.280
What the fuck you talking about?
Why you taking kids to school?
That's where it

1143
01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:27.500
really gets where we got only one way to keep kids from fucking do.

1144
01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.180
Just to keep them at home.
Don't drive them around.
Fuck No.

1145
01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:35.460
That's one thing I do remember as a kid Mike,

1146
01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:39.430
my friend's mom always driving us to the bowling alley every weekend because we

1147
01:03:39.431 --> 01:03:43.140
are in a bowling league and smoking the whole way there with the windows open

1148
01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.330
and as a kid I remember God,

1149
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:48.510
this is disgusting and I told my mom the other day about it know you are
smoking.

1150
01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.030
Yeah,
that's exactly it.

1151
01:03:50.031 --> 01:03:53.010
Probably one of the reasons why that or my grandfather always smoking.

1152
01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:58.380
Everyone slept around way kid.
That's definitely not why.

1153
01:03:58.381 --> 01:04:02.940
The reason why is because you had a cigarette in your mouth and you smoke it.
No,

1154
01:04:02.941 --> 01:04:04.170
but that's why you're smoking a cigarette.

1155
01:04:04.171 --> 01:04:06.960
The reason I ever got to the point where I would do that is because I grew up

1156
01:04:06.961 --> 01:04:08.640
with all everyone around me smoking.

1157
01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:15.070
<v 4>I grew up around people smoking.
My mom smoked when I was a little kid.
She quit.</v>

1158
01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:18.000
She quit when I was like 10 something like that.

1159
01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:20.950
I got to see her smile eventually.
If they were completely legal,

1160
01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:22.690
like wailing when I was born,
if there were illegal,

1161
01:04:22.691 --> 01:04:25.300
I would have eventually got into,
I would have like found one and try to,

1162
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:28.390
we all try them together when I was like 15 yeah.
My sister,

1163
01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:32.440
my sister stuck with it for a long time,
man.
She kept smoking for years,

1164
01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:37.090
so she quit now,
but fuck it ain't,
it's not easy,
man.

1165
01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.370
You know everybody,
Brian will tell you,
Joe,
you'll tell you,

1166
01:04:39.371 --> 01:04:42.510
you can tell everybody you know,
you can.
All,
you guys are both.

1167
01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:45.870
You're currently addicted and you were,
you know your debate.

1168
01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:48.940
We're covering six months or a year.
It's still open.
It's just amazing.

1169
01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:52.180
It's amazing that the government can somehow or another allow this,

1170
01:04:52.450 --> 01:04:55.210
that they can pretend they're looking out for our interests there.
You know,

1171
01:04:55.211 --> 01:05:00.211
stop fucking high school kids from selling weed and get some people pay our own

1172
01:05:00.311 --> 01:05:04.370
tax dollars.
Should have some chick played 21 jump street,
you know,
and going and,

1173
01:05:04.371 --> 01:05:06.190
and,
and get some weed off.
Some kids.

1174
01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:09.620
They didn't even uncover anything other than weed.
That's cool.

1175
01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.640
You know what that makes me,
that makes me happy about our new generation.

1176
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:15.760
The kids coming up.
Yeah.
They got arrested for weed,
but look,
what are they doing?

1177
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:20.950
I get some weed and trying to bang some cop.
That's right.
Exactly.

1178
01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.500
I'm trying to get laid.
I had just people at central Washington,

1179
01:05:23.501 --> 01:05:27.640
my show that were,
uh,
that uh,
they had no teeth and their smile.
Whoa.

1180
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:32.440
So I was like,
hey,
we got a on that situation.
And he goes,
he holds up his drink.

1181
01:05:32.441 --> 01:05:35.260
He goes,
seven years sober,
man.
And I was like,
fuck yeah.
I was like,
wait,

1182
01:05:35.261 --> 01:05:39.190
you're holding up a beer
had already said to me,
he goes,

1183
01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:42.400
you don't think it's a difference between a fucking drink at a comedy club and

1184
01:05:42.401 --> 01:05:45.430
Meth?
And I was like,
you're absolutely right and I apologize.

1185
01:05:45.431 --> 01:05:49.900
There's a complete difference.
How funny is that,
man?
Yeah.
How funny is that?

1186
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:53.290
Yeah,
and I was like,
you know how even sober?
I'm like,
fuck.
Of course you are.
Hey,

1187
01:05:53.291 --> 01:05:55.840
you need to take her advice from that.
A little Esther chick,

1188
01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:59.470
she says a lot of cool shit on Twitter.
Revise the advice.

1189
01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:01.510
Here's what little Esther just said on Twitter.

1190
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:03.970
Everyone that's in a relationship is delusional.

1191
01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:11.170
Will last her stop.
Move away from the fucker keyboard.
Right.

1192
01:06:11.171 --> 01:06:14.020
This is getting too transparent.
I'm starting to feel ill.

1193
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.750
There's a new breed of people who love taking ship public.

1194
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:20.830
I love like we're throwing shit out there.
That's just silliness.

1195
01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:24.190
Just so the person who has offended them,
we'll know they're talking about them.

1196
01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:28.750
There's a little of that.
That's a little bit I'm sure.
And then statement.

1197
01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:29.410
This is also,

1198
01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:32.470
that's the kind of thing that you say when you're 21 you think you really have

1199
01:06:32.471 --> 01:06:35.950
an answer.
That's the saddest thing about life.
You get older,

1200
01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:37.700
you get more questions,
you know,

1201
01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:40.670
you realize you accept that there are no answers to a lot of things,

1202
01:06:40.671 --> 01:06:43.480
so you just able to accept that.
That's a tough fucking cell man.

1203
01:06:43.481 --> 01:06:47.980
That one moment we have to give in and accept that there are no fucking answers.

1204
01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:51.760
I mean,
we all know that that's what turns people to religion.
I mean,

1205
01:06:51.761 --> 01:06:54.550
you were very,
you were much more religious than I was when I was a kid,

1206
01:06:54.551 --> 01:06:57.550
but I was very religious for a little while when my parents were breaking up and

1207
01:06:57.551 --> 01:07:00.360
I was five before I went to Catholic school and they cured me.
Yeah.

1208
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.820
They cured me in Catholic school,
the surge of religion,
fucking cunt,
none.

1209
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.680
These evil woman,
this woman was,
she was just rot rock.

1210
01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:12.700
That's what she wants.
She was Rochester,
Madge Josephine.
She was just rocked.

1211
01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:16.120
She was a rotten person,
like everything was bad about her.

1212
01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:19.420
She started yelling at me the first day in fucking school.
God,

1213
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:23.770
she was just evil man.
She was just an evil bitch.
She's dead now.
You think?

1214
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.890
How old was she though?
She was old as fuck.
She was old as fuck when I was like,

1215
01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.570
I was like six,
you know?

1216
01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:32.290
But I remember thinking like why I was getting through school.
Well,
you know,

1217
01:07:32.291 --> 01:07:35.620
every day I lived in terror.
It was just fucking so mean.

1218
01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.290
But while I was getting into school,
I remember thinking,

1219
01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:42.250
well now I have to like figure out what the fuck is going on because clearly

1220
01:07:42.251 --> 01:07:45.070
it's not religion because I thought when I went to church,

1221
01:07:45.071 --> 01:07:48.550
when I was a little kid,
when I was like three and four and five,
you know,

1222
01:07:48.551 --> 01:07:49.540
church to me was like,

1223
01:07:49.541 --> 01:07:52.150
my whole life was falling apart and my parents were getting divorced.

1224
01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:53.230
I didn't know what was going on.

1225
01:07:53.231 --> 01:07:56.320
My Dad was super violent and I was just starting to realize that he'd beat my

1226
01:07:56.321 --> 01:08:00.130
mom up for no reason.
So to me like there has to be God,

1227
01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.430
there has to be something,
you know?

1228
01:08:01.770 --> 01:08:04.960
I would go to them when I would go to church with my grandparents or with,

1229
01:08:05.090 --> 01:08:08.980
you know,
whoever took me,
I would,
I would say,
well this is this beautiful,

1230
01:08:08.981 --> 01:08:11.740
you know,
everybody here is being nice and,
and God be with you.

1231
01:08:11.741 --> 01:08:14.050
And they're all saying nice things and you know,
and if,

1232
01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.040
and they're telling me if you do the right thing,
you'd go to heaven

1233
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.100
<v 2>and all the sins on earth,
you know,
disappear and dissolve.</v>

1234
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:23.660
But this cunt was so evil and she was connected to this.
I was like,
wow.

1235
01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:26.860
She was like the shittiest salesperson for religion all time.

1236
01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:28.310
They don't get the right spokesman.

1237
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:31.170
But that's like one of the cool things about being Catholic.
Well,

1238
01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.260
you'll get the religion is so ridiculous.

1239
01:08:33.290 --> 01:08:37.070
Very few people completely agree with it.
It's so over the top.

1240
01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:41.340
Stupid and ridiculous and mean.
There was a story last week about one,

1241
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:46.390
one of the head guys and the pope's a whole thing about pedophilia got arrested

1242
01:08:47.871 --> 01:08:51.520
for pedophilia.
This motherfucker got arrested for,
uh,

1243
01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:57.280
he was trying to get a Moroccans to deliver him young boys and he was telling

1244
01:08:57.381 --> 01:08:59.870
them to get them from kids who had a troubled childhood.

1245
01:08:59.871 --> 01:09:00.860
What was his position on this shit

1246
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:02.770
<v 3>charge of pet.</v>

1247
01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:07.180
The pedophilia have to make sure that the priest didn't do it.

1248
01:09:07.181 --> 01:09:11.620
Like he was the guy that the pope I put in charge of making sure that doesn't

1249
01:09:11.621 --> 01:09:12.454
happen.

1250
01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:16.270
<v 2>He was there,
he was there.
Uh,
what's the branch of the cops and I forget the,</v>

1251
01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:21.690
no,
I've watched enough TV,
Peter Protectors.
But yeah,

1252
01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:22.950
so there is a story,

1253
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.000
a priests in the archdiocese of a top advisor to pope benedict the 16th.

1254
01:09:29.701 --> 01:09:29.911
What is,

1255
01:09:29.911 --> 01:09:34.911
he was arrested Friday on a pedophilia and drug charges and they have all the

1256
01:09:35.851 --> 01:09:39.470
papers of this dude asking for,
uh,
for,

1257
01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:43.620
they have like emails and shit of him asking for boys and wanting them from

1258
01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:46.030
backgrounds where they're there.
You know,

1259
01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.910
it didn't have a family and they're all fucked up.

1260
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.020
<v 3>How ridiculous is that?</v>

1261
01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:52.270
The guy that was in charge to make sure that didn't happen?

1262
01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:54.800
<v 2>This is his,
this is his.
This is one of the things you wrote.</v>

1263
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:59.360
I do not want 16 year old boys,
but younger 14 year olds are okay.

1264
01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.360
Look for needy boys who have family issues,

1265
01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.630
who's trading cocaine for boys and that the Vatican knew about the problem for

1266
01:10:08.631 --> 01:10:13.490
decades.
Listen man,
they're all creepy.
That's the worst part.

1267
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:17.210
I understand.
If a priest does nothing,
that's not the whole organization's fault.

1268
01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:20.810
Dude.
They've been doing this shit forever,
man.
They were doing this shit forever.

1269
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:24.290
This,
I mean they just,

1270
01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:28.670
they gathered back it up here.
If you don't arrest them and you're backing it up.

1271
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:32.810
This pope,
when he was a bishop,
this one that's currently in now,
they're,

1272
01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:35.870
they have all sorts of paperwork showing that he was shielding child molesters.

1273
01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:36.913
He was moving,

1274
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:40.910
he was moving them from one place to another and and and trying to get them to

1275
01:10:40.911 --> 01:10:43.430
avoid a prosecution.
My amazing,

1276
01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:46.100
it's amazing that anybody would take any of this shit seriously,

1277
01:10:46.101 --> 01:10:47.180
that it's still you.

1278
01:10:47.181 --> 01:10:50.200
They can still do this and they can still have meetings with Obama and the good,

1279
01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:54.500
everyone can still pretend this isn't something that's evil and you're going to

1280
01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:58.040
tell me,
yeah,
it's a fucking cult of kid fuckers.
That's what it is.

1281
01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:01.490
<v 3>Why is this not like on the front page of CNN?
Why is that?</v>

1282
01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:03.800
The only article about this was from some,
you know,

1283
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:07.060
translated from some Italian newspaper,
you know,

1284
01:11:07.290 --> 01:11:10.220
like why aren't they collecting all these facts and like really talking about

1285
01:11:10.221 --> 01:11:13.560
this on mainstream news,
isn't it?
Some of it might be also people are just tired.

1286
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.980
It's the same

1287
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.560
<v 4>story for the last 1520 years.
It was in the New York Times just trans.
No,
it did.</v>

1288
01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:19.980
They just translate the articles.

1289
01:11:19.981 --> 01:11:23.100
When I was saying I is there actually anybody really talking about this other

1290
01:11:23.101 --> 01:11:25.920
than translations from Italian newspapers,
you know,
I don't know,

1291
01:11:25.921 --> 01:11:28.440
but there's been other stories about these in the New York Times as well.

1292
01:11:28.441 --> 01:11:30.150
It's not like people were avoiding the,

1293
01:11:30.151 --> 01:11:32.100
all these put these pedophile issues and they,

1294
01:11:32.101 --> 01:11:36.150
there was also like in every mainstream story or every mainstream,
a new source.

1295
01:11:36.330 --> 01:11:41.070
There was some big meeting that they had recently to deal with the priests and

1296
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:45.810
sexual charges and that was all public to out a certain amount of it has to be

1297
01:11:45.811 --> 01:11:47.640
public because it's such a known issue.

1298
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.800
If you're out there are go to Catholic churches,

1299
01:11:49.801 --> 01:11:52.230
you're going to an organization that condones this behavior.

1300
01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:56.300
So just know that when you show up for church tomorrow.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1301
01:11:56.330 --> 01:12:00.870
You're joining an organization that can don't that behavior.
You know,

1302
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:05.010
what the fuck,
what are you doing?
It's amazing,
but you really are.
Yeah.

1303
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:05.761
They're like,
oh,

1304
01:12:05.761 --> 01:12:09.060
I'm still saying that with child molesters in my organization that are making

1305
01:12:09.061 --> 01:12:12.860
the rules for me,
but I'm not leaving this organization based on fairy tales.

1306
01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:13.620
Well,

1307
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:17.010
based on who the fuck knows what the original thing was to believe in Jesus,

1308
01:12:17.011 --> 01:12:19.390
you clearly know these people are.
Yeah.

1309
01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:22.230
Just go to a nondenominational church or something.
Well,

1310
01:12:22.231 --> 01:12:25.260
they're not acting in Jesus's name when they're fucking your kid's mouth.

1311
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.390
It's that simple.
That's right.
It's amazing how many people can get away with.

1312
01:12:30.391 --> 01:12:31.224
There was,
um,

1313
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:35.580
the bill Maher had a clip that somebody put up online from his show that that

1314
01:12:35.581 --> 01:12:37.710
made a really good point.
And,
uh,

1315
01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:42.740
he was talking about how many people call themselves Christians but don't follow

1316
01:12:42.751 --> 01:12:45.810
any of the rules of Christianity.
Well,

1317
01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:47.880
he was talking about the Osama bin Ladin thing.

1318
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:51.450
Like Jesus was like the most nonviolent guy ever,
you know.

1319
01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:53.850
And he was the guy who said,
turn your other cheek,
you know,

1320
01:12:53.851 --> 01:12:58.230
don't do not be evil to your enemies,
which we've done with love.
And meanwhile,

1321
01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:03.390
the Christians go into kill Muslims,
guns and horses on,
uh,
on boats.

1322
01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.790
Yeah.
And he was really funny because Obama,

1323
01:13:05.791 --> 01:13:09.810
they asked to Obama about people that would,
you know,

1324
01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:14.160
whether you know,
what's the controversy about the death of Osama bin Laden?

1325
01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:14.971
And he was like,

1326
01:13:14.971 --> 01:13:17.790
anybody to think there's anything wrong with getting rid of that guy.

1327
01:13:17.791 --> 01:13:20.790
And it needs to have their brain checked.
It needs to have their head checks.

1328
01:13:20.791 --> 01:13:22.770
Like this is a guy who pretends to be a Christian.

1329
01:13:22.771 --> 01:13:26.850
This was like Bill Maher's point.
And it's such a good point,
you know,

1330
01:13:26.851 --> 01:13:30.970
because it's like the most neglected aspect of Christianity as well as like,

1331
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:32.610
you're not supposed to hate,

1332
01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:35.620
you're not supposed to be angry at people and you're,

1333
01:13:35.621 --> 01:13:39.210
you're supposed to be all turn your other cheek and not just love,

1334
01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:44.280
love your enemy.
Love
what does it man.
Yeah,
take your enemy,

1335
01:13:44.281 --> 01:13:47.810
the guy who you hate and not just forgiven but love him.
Yeah.

1336
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:52.890
Well really it's awesome advice.
Why did they capture that guy?
Jesus?
No,

1337
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:57.330
Osama bin Ladin is definitely trying to capture Jesus.
I don't think it's real.

1338
01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:59.520
I don't,
I mean,
I don't know if it's real.
It might be real.

1339
01:13:59.521 --> 01:14:02.520
They might have done exactly what they said and they might've killed Osama bin

1340
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:06.390
Laden at that moment.
But you know,
there was a,
there's a lot of,
like,

1341
01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:10.170
there was a lot of reports like way back to 2002 that that guy was dead and they

1342
01:14:10.171 --> 01:14:12.280
were always saying that he was very sick.
You know,

1343
01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:14.200
they're always saying that that guy had,
you know,

1344
01:14:14.201 --> 01:14:17.830
a bad kidneys and he needed dialysis on a regular basis.

1345
01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:22.860
I don't think they took the chance of him hostily being out there to say like

1346
01:14:22.961 --> 01:14:25.660
unless they know they've seen his body,
there's no way.
Oh,

1347
01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:30.070
let the president go on and say,
I assure you he's dead.

1348
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:32.710
If like it might come up that he's not.
Do you?
Yeah,

1349
01:14:32.711 --> 01:14:36.880
but that w w if he was already dead a long time ago,
that's what they believe.

1350
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:39.070
What people believe is that this was just some sort of like,
oh,

1351
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:43.440
this is some sort of a publicity ploy to keep.
Look,
Obama is like this.

1352
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:47.280
This ingenious device,
if the Republicans have created get is,

1353
01:14:47.281 --> 01:14:49.390
get a guy run for the Democratic Party,

1354
01:14:49.391 --> 01:14:52.780
make them black and make them do everything a republican would do.
Yay.

1355
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:56.230
And everybody loves him and he's,
he's fucking you and you're clapping.
Yay.

1356
01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:59.770
He's the black president.
Yay.
Meanwhile he's fucking Bush.

1357
01:14:59.771 --> 01:15:02.350
Plus he's doing everything that Bush did.

1358
01:15:02.351 --> 01:15:05.050
Plus he's doing exactly the same shit.

1359
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:07.720
My problem with the theory that like you just did this to win an election that's

1360
01:15:07.721 --> 01:15:11.290
coming up.
It's like,
well,
if they're going to do that,
the timing is not right.

1361
01:15:11.650 --> 01:15:13.630
Wait.
Maybe it is though.

1362
01:15:13.631 --> 01:15:17.320
Maybe it is because maybe this is what sets the ball in motion.

1363
01:15:17.321 --> 01:15:22.060
Maybe they have like political experts that have actually studied like tides of

1364
01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:25.750
the cult of personality and how many times,
how many months does it take?

1365
01:15:25.810 --> 01:15:29.710
Maybe like all this shit with Kim Kardashians and all this,
this is this,

1366
01:15:29.711 --> 01:15:30.460
this is us.

1367
01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:34.180
All the government has done is create these famous people for no reason.

1368
01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:36.730
Just so he could see like chart the tides of how,

1369
01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:40.480
how much time does it take for people to get pissed off at you and how much time

1370
01:15:40.481 --> 01:15:42.340
does it take for you to recover from that?
You know,

1371
01:15:42.341 --> 01:15:43.750
and everybody was pissed off at Obama.

1372
01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.650
How much time does it take him to recover and be a bad mother fucker gun?
Well,

1373
01:15:46.651 --> 01:15:49.870
he's got to kill bin Laden now and then it needs like nine months for it to

1374
01:15:49.871 --> 01:15:51.340
fester in the American psyche.

1375
01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.880
And this is step one of a bunch of other things that we'll send to the place.

1376
01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:57.790
Perfect time to do it.
Yeah,
they're wagging the dog.
That's first step one,

1377
01:15:57.791 --> 01:16:00.670
they kill som in law and that's awesome.
Now step two,

1378
01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.590
they're going to thwart some nuclear attack.

1379
01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:06.790
They'll stop that look like bad asses.
Ariel Dab Republic re.
Yeah.

1380
01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:08.500
And then they move into step three,

1381
01:16:08.501 --> 01:16:11.770
and then the announced all these new jobs because the government will hire like

1382
01:16:11.771 --> 01:16:15.090
2 million census workers.
The government created 2 million new jobs.
Meanwhile,

1383
01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:17.590
it just a bunch of people knocking on your door and knowing you and asking you

1384
01:16:17.591 --> 01:16:20.980
what peanut butter you use.
You know,
I was like,
you put it on a fucking sensors.

1385
01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:22.360
That's why the only thing they could have beat,

1386
01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:26.680
beat Obama would be something like a lesbian armless lesbian,
armless lesbian.

1387
01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:29.580
Nobody wants an armless woman.
I think a lot of Republicans,

1388
01:16:29.690 --> 01:16:34.150
Shit Obama on this blacklist doing it.
I'll do it in four years.

1389
01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:35.530
I'm not running against Obama.

1390
01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:40.060
I think a lot of people would be good to run against Obama if they would like

1391
01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:44.140
Ron Paul.
Did you know Ron Paul and that other guy from New Mexico,

1392
01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:48.400
the former Gary Johnson?
Well,
first of all,

1393
01:16:48.610 --> 01:16:51.980
both of those guys are,
you know,
the Republicans.
Um,
I,

1394
01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:55.240
I'm pretty sure Gary Johnson is,
but I know that,
um,
what do you mean Ron Paul?

1395
01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:57.760
Like what do you mean?
What does that verb mean?
Ron Pauling it,

1396
01:16:57.790 --> 01:17:01.630
well Ron Paul is all about smaller government and is all about getting us out of

1397
01:17:01.631 --> 01:17:05.590
these wars and is all about being honest about what's happened with the American

1398
01:17:05.591 --> 01:17:10.590
people and then upholding the constitution and freedom,
uh,
of,
of uh,

1399
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:14.270
uh,
personal use of drugs and doing whatever the fuck you need to do.

1400
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:16.790
And we're getting a new constitution made by people that we can relate to.

1401
01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.380
That would help,

1402
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:21.800
but it didn't then it would be a question of who would be the ones that would

1403
01:17:21.801 --> 01:17:25.010
draft his fucking thing and how much would the government have a say in it?

1404
01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.310
You know,
cause you,
when,
when they come up with things like the Patriot Act,

1405
01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:31.070
you can't think that they're looking out for your best interests.

1406
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:35.240
So we can't let them coming up,
come up with a new constitution.
So who the fuck,

1407
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:38.510
I mean,
the,
the system right now is so corrupt.
You can't say,
hey,

1408
01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.130
you guys are all corrupt and fucked up.

1409
01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.810
We please fix this right outside of quiet.

1410
01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:44.570
It's a good point that people in charge,
we've got to be.

1411
01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.060
So who would it have to be?
We didn't have to be scholarships with the people.

1412
01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.730
Well,
they've shown time and time again that a lot of these guys,

1413
01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:53.000
especially when it comes to economics,
that are professors at universities,

1414
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:56.540
they're not only,
they don't know shit,
they're horse.
All these guys that,

1415
01:17:56.541 --> 01:17:59.630
especially the professors and,
and uh,
economics in a,

1416
01:17:59.670 --> 01:18:02.330
that are detailed in that movie,
the inside job think whatever money they go,

1417
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:05.810
oh my God,
these guys are getting paid left and right by all these different,

1418
01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:09.650
these professors in economics get paid to like sign off on these,

1419
01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:13.240
these different like trusts and different funds and different,
you know,
and,

1420
01:18:13.241 --> 01:18:16.880
and sign off on these different ideas and work for major corporations in the

1421
01:18:16.881 --> 01:18:18.950
future.
And they get these huge cushy fucking jobs,

1422
01:18:18.951 --> 01:18:20.210
like millions and millions of dollars.

1423
01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:24.590
So they say all these things that are complimentary towards certain styles of

1424
01:18:24.591 --> 01:18:28.280
the market and they teach certain things that would encourage,
you know,

1425
01:18:28.281 --> 01:18:32.990
the same sort of a system that they have set up or had set up for a long time

1426
01:18:32.991 --> 01:18:36.690
until this recent economic collapse and they endorse it and they say,
Oh,

1427
01:18:36.691 --> 01:18:39.180
this is rock solid and this is everything's fine.

1428
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:41.930
And it turns out if you follow the paper trail,
these motherfuckers are,

1429
01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:45.510
all of them eventually wind up getting cushy jobs.
It's all,
it's a,

1430
01:18:45.650 --> 01:18:48.060
it's a real sneaky snaky situation.
Francis,

1431
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:51.200
anytime you see an economist on the on Good Morning America or anything or

1432
01:18:51.230 --> 01:18:53.570
whatever,
talking about meet the press,
talking about whatever it goes there,

1433
01:18:53.571 --> 01:18:56.630
they're selling a book that's selling some books that sounds something.

1434
01:18:56.650 --> 01:18:59.690
So they need to say something that's incendiary enough that they can get on

1435
01:18:59.691 --> 01:19:02.480
those shows to sell more books.
Right.
She'll,
we go get it in culture.

1436
01:19:02.481 --> 01:19:06.550
She's a fucking professional troll.
She's professional at it.
She goes on,

1437
01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:11.000
she says a bunch.
She's the,
the the like vulture ish looking.
She's pretty,

1438
01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:14.080
if you're drunk.
Oh,
she's the thinner one with the straight hair.
Yeah,

1439
01:19:14.081 --> 01:19:15.820
like you might hate fucker.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1440
01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.790
If you were in San Diego and you were drunk,
you know she was at a bar.

1441
01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:22.640
I think you're funny and you're dirty.
June was suck your dirty Jew cock.

1442
01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:26.450
If she touched my dick on the way by to the bathroom,
like gently by,
I'd be like,

1443
01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.530
oh,
we thought she would do.
No.
If she did,

1444
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:31.400
then I would definitely get out of here.
Really.

1445
01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.800
Would you call her again afterwards or would you feel gross?

1446
01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:35.620
It was actually an culter.

1447
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:37.820
We'll just start with not just someone who looked like that.

1448
01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:41.650
Would you start bringing it around the store?
No,
you should really cool man.
The,

1449
01:19:41.770 --> 01:19:43.490
a lot of that shit is just her public image.

1450
01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:47.920
She's playing a character who she is though.
She is.
I mean,

1451
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:51.050
she's very smart at it.
She says a lot of incendiary shit and it's funny,

1452
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:55.640
you know,
and she,
you know,
she called Bob Edwards a faggot.
Well,

1453
01:19:55.670 --> 01:19:59.510
no way is it Bob Edwards?
It was.
She got John Edwards.
Yeah.

1454
01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:04.120
She called John Edwards a faggot watts.
She said he's still got a job.
You waited?

1455
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:07.380
Yeah man,
she's white.
She's a Republican.
It's all good.
She sat on the air.

1456
01:20:07.410 --> 01:20:08.840
It was really funny that she had to Apollo.

1457
01:20:08.841 --> 01:20:13.560
Jimmy Norton had a good joke and you know like a a wonder why she thought that

1458
01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:18.230
maybe she saw him more than twice.
What do you mean?
Well guys,

1459
01:20:18.250 --> 01:20:21.900
it looks like a faggot when we made her say that.
I wonder,

1460
01:20:21.901 --> 01:20:25.350
I guess she saw him more than twice.
I don't know what that guy looks like.

1461
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.350
What did,

1462
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:31.080
I love that the phrasing of that that's enough to like you start assessing them.

1463
01:20:31.081 --> 01:20:33.990
What the fuck's going on with this guy here?
Oh He's good.

1464
01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:39.120
He's the guy that was wife was dying of fucking cancer or that guy having a baby

1465
01:20:39.121 --> 01:20:41.820
with some other chick.
I have wonder man.

1466
01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:46.880
Back before we were just getting sort of seat to see now how many dudes were

1467
01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:50.340
we're rocking it like that.
All of them.
Why wouldn't they?

1468
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:52.230
I think that was just a part of the way it was done.

1469
01:20:52.231 --> 01:20:55.920
I mean like when you go back to like the Kennedy's sort of like,
everyone knew,

1470
01:20:55.921 --> 01:20:57.750
you remember when we were kids,
we were growing up.

1471
01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:00.700
We kind of all knew that Kennedy Fuck Marilyn Monroe.
Right.

1472
01:21:00.701 --> 01:21:03.030
What are new but didn't say anything.
Yeah.
Well it was,

1473
01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.550
it was sort of like one of those things.
It was just like,
it was,
uh,
we,

1474
01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:07.440
we would just say,
oh,
there's a different time.

1475
01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:11.710
I think back when they had no accountability,
they can just get away with shit.

1476
01:21:11.711 --> 01:21:14.970
Like a lot of politicians are in the position of getting laid.
They do it,

1477
01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:19.110
you know,
you've seen a movie,
see some cop fuck a hooker Zombie be like,
oh,

1478
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.590
that's normal.
But then you actually see a police officer.
You're like,
no way.

1479
01:21:22.890 --> 01:21:24.990
Right,
but why not?
That's who's doing it.

1480
01:21:24.991 --> 01:21:28.590
Regular people are doing these corrupt things that you would think,
no,
not them.

1481
01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.830
Sluts till you see come across a slut and full,
full,
you know,

1482
01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:35.460
as long dress or something.
Like,
no,
she wouldn't be like that.
Yeah.

1483
01:21:35.461 --> 01:21:38.340
There's sites get regular jobs.
Yeah.
They're all around us.

1484
01:21:38.341 --> 01:21:40.530
That's where our women are terrified when their husbands go to the office.

1485
01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.600
There's always had one crazy bitch.

1486
01:21:42.601 --> 01:21:45.650
It'll suck your Dick and a stock room and who's going to resist?
Yeah.

1487
01:21:45.690 --> 01:21:49.830
I mean you might live your whole life and never meet one or you might work for

1488
01:21:49.831 --> 01:21:50.641
the right office.

1489
01:21:50.641 --> 01:21:54.000
And this girl's crazy and she shows you a picture of her pussy on her cell phone

1490
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:54.661
and you're like,

1491
01:21:54.661 --> 01:21:58.530
what the fuck are you doing when you show me that for the next thing you know
it,

1492
01:21:58.650 --> 01:22:01.230
you're sure seem flirty.
[inaudible]
Eular,

1493
01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.690
he knows the best at picking those girls.
Oh,
Joe Diaz.

1494
01:22:03.691 --> 01:22:06.640
He can spot them a mile away and there she is right there.
That dirty freak.

1495
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:11.640
I could see it.
I can see it.
Her eyes,
Joe Rogan per age.
I call my Dick.

1496
01:22:12.930 --> 01:22:14.730
Oh,
he had the crazy stories yesterday,
man,

1497
01:22:14.731 --> 01:22:18.190
about trying to pass drug tests or putting various substances,
uh,

1498
01:22:18.210 --> 01:22:23.210
over his dick and then covering it with his four skin dropped into Dallas.

1499
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:28.800
So then it would all drop into the Piss Cup while he was pissing.

1500
01:22:28.801 --> 01:22:31.610
And we've taint the last two weeks.
Yeah.

1501
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:35.710
He would like add like chlorine.
He added chlorine.
He had a dream.

1502
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:36.833
If you put it in there,

1503
01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:41.430
he's putting Draino under the under is essentially put a rubber band around it

1504
01:22:41.431 --> 01:22:43.460
and burn some extra pain.
No.

1505
01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.450
<v 3>Yeah,
like the whole,
the whole thing.
I was,</v>

1506
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:49.200
I was trying to picture in my head and it made no sense.
It was,
it was like,

1507
01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:51.240
does he put it in there and then tie it in a,

1508
01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:55.360
not a team with his skin really did that.
He was just joking.
How,

1509
01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:56.810
but is this date attached to it?

1510
01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:00.840
<v 4>Apparently he said he has a big four skin.
His foreskin is very long,</v>

1511
01:23:00.841 --> 01:23:02.850
so he just stuffs it up there and let it sit there.

1512
01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.593
<v 3>Bass,</v>

1513
01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:10.230
I don't have a dick like I can to [inaudible] been around since that.
Alright.

1514
01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:14.620
Well I think normally when it's soft it's covered over login an eater.

1515
01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:18.400
So any let it gets hard then.
Yeah,
mate,
look,
some stuff,

1516
01:23:18.401 --> 01:23:21.340
whatever you got in there.
He's like,
first the chlorine was our crumples.

1517
01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:25.180
It was like coring crumbles from like one of those things that you like drop

1518
01:23:25.181 --> 01:23:28.420
into a pool to chlorinate the pool.
Okay.
Something like that.

1519
01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:32.830
Like shaved it and then he put that stuff under his dick was my one year old

1520
01:23:32.831 --> 01:23:37.180
nephew just had to go under the knife for a second time to do his circumcision.

1521
01:23:37.181 --> 01:23:40.720
And we had talked about this before and what happened is the first time they did

1522
01:23:40.721 --> 01:23:42.310
the circumstances,
it didn't take,

1523
01:23:42.311 --> 01:23:44.920
it started to grow back together or do something.

1524
01:23:44.921 --> 01:23:46.990
I don't understand what they were talking about.

1525
01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:52.150
So they had to put my nephew under and uh,
do plastic surgery,

1526
01:23:52.151 --> 01:23:56.050
cut off more and blah,
blah,
blah.
And my biggest thing,
I was just like,

1527
01:23:56.051 --> 01:24:00.190
wait a second,
you know,
like this is a high tech hospital.
Why is this happening?

1528
01:24:00.191 --> 01:24:02.050
How is this happening?
Why,
why couldn't you just,

1529
01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.790
I told my mom to get the oldest June,

1530
01:24:03.791 --> 01:24:06.050
give them a $100 and that would probably be better than,
than,

1531
01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:08.710
than high tech hospital.
She had herpes and it'll suck your kids.

1532
01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:11.350
Did he know that?
That's how they do it.
They cut it off,

1533
01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:15.410
<v 2>then they suck on it.
Who Sucks on it?
The oil sucks on the deck.
Yes.</v>

1534
01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:19.710
You don't know that,
that the ancient Hasidic practice of they,

1535
01:24:19.711 --> 01:24:23.650
when they believe it's acidic,
they,
when they,
uh,
the guy who was,
uh,
what's,

1536
01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:25.680
what's the guy's name?
The cuts,
your Dick Oil.

1537
01:24:25.710 --> 01:24:27.420
The oil when it's supposed to suck it,

1538
01:24:27.870 --> 01:24:30.870
that's how they're supposed to like stop the blood are the ones that I've seen.

1539
01:24:30.871 --> 01:24:33.490
Just these towels.
Yeah.
They suck it too though,
Dude.

1540
01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:36.000
The traditional ways to suck it.
There was a whole,
um,

1541
01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:40.980
there was a whole story because a baby died of herpes because the guy had herpes

1542
01:24:40.981 --> 01:24:41.581
on his mouth.

1543
01:24:41.581 --> 01:24:44.540
He had a cold sore in his mouth and he does the traditional way and he sucks a

1544
01:24:44.541 --> 01:24:48.150
little kids.
Dick like Pete,
it sounds like,
it sounds like I'm talking crazy.

1545
01:24:48.151 --> 01:24:52.620
It's crazy.
But it's,
there's the real thing.
Spell Moyle,
Spellman Moy,
Ellie,

1546
01:24:53.050 --> 01:24:57.420
e.
L.
I'm going to white here.
It was Moy Eeo.

1547
01:24:58.170 --> 01:25:01.020
<v 3>I guess I've seen a lot of times I've never seen that before.
It gets here.</v>

1548
01:25:01.021 --> 01:25:02.160
Is this a new practice now?

1549
01:25:02.161 --> 01:25:06.090
This new way to do circumcisions that that hospitals have been doing in the fail

1550
01:25:06.091 --> 01:25:07.620
rate is so much higher.

1551
01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:12.000
But I guess it's more sensitivity for the kid and all that.
It's super safer.

1552
01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:17.340
But the crazy thing is,
is that doctors say to each other's doctors,

1553
01:25:17.341 --> 01:25:20.040
it's an art.
Like it's,
it's,
it's a guessing game.

1554
01:25:20.041 --> 01:25:24.060
You have to be so good at it and it just experience.
Yeah.

1555
01:25:24.630 --> 01:25:29.630
<v 2>There's a video of a guy explaining why the Moyle has to suck a boy's penis</v>

1556
01:25:29.881 --> 01:25:34.180
after circumcision.
So if you go to look up on um,

1557
01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.930
on a online,
on youtube,

1558
01:25:36.931 --> 01:25:41.931
go to youtube and write in rabbi explains the importance of sucking.

1559
01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:43.740
<v 7>Explain.</v>

1560
01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:44.720
<v 3>I'd love to hear this.</v>

1561
01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:47.310
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1562
01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:48.360
<v 2>Explains,</v>

1563
01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:51.123
<v 7>explains</v>

1564
01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.420
<v 2>the importance of sucking a boy's penis.</v>

1565
01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.930
Yeah.
I see.
I didn't make this shit up,
man.
I would love to hear this.

1566
01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:03.910
Some ridiculous nonsense.
How'd you find this?
Me Start with

1567
01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:09.800
<v 6>the argument with and get an argument with the wife.</v>

1568
01:26:09.801 --> 01:26:12.980
Hide in the office.
Shit gets dark.

1569
01:26:13.090 --> 01:26:16.650
Shark bites boys oil a day.

1570
01:26:16.651 --> 01:26:19.230
And that's the second section.
A little loud.

1571
01:26:19.231 --> 01:26:23.290
It's a little loud for integrations of the pull the show.

1572
01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:29.220
Does that table in chapter two 66,

1573
01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.080
uh,
I love the three,
four,
five and six.

1574
01:26:33.081 --> 01:26:37.310
He describes how the circumcision is to be done.
This is after the cutting.

1575
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.260
The mogul does what's called the [inaudible] means to suck.

1576
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:46.520
It means to doing so with his mouth.
I want to say,
well,

1577
01:26:46.521 --> 01:26:50.540
why can't you use a tube while you could technically,

1578
01:26:50.541 --> 01:26:54.590
but it's not the customer as to why,
how it was done.
Now why is it that way?

1579
01:26:55.170 --> 01:26:59.120
It's sending the oldness.
You didn't have to.
Now you can have two.
So why not?

1580
01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:04.840
The answers I thought about it is that it's not as effective because the tube is

1581
01:27:06.250 --> 01:27:07.790
interpreting this right Neil as well.

1582
01:27:07.791 --> 01:27:12.020
It's not as pliable and furthermore,

1583
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:16.220
it's not as quick and it's not as close.

1584
01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:21.900
You have to have a quick suction action.
You have to have more pliability.
No.

1585
01:27:21.901 --> 01:27:26.000
So there's the theory.
Some people feel that it is.

1586
01:27:26.001 --> 01:27:30.440
Some people feel that it's not that the saliva of a human being has some

1587
01:27:30.441 --> 01:27:32.580
antiseptic qualities and it's

1588
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:35.720
in the never heard of

1589
01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:43.380
making up reasons why he thinks it should be.
And so

1590
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.000
that's what he would have has elements of cleaning of antiseptic

1591
01:27:52.270 --> 01:27:56.380
<v 4>yell at him.
That's sick.
Fuck sucking little babies.
Dicks.
Yeah,
that's not right,</v>

1592
01:27:56.660 --> 01:28:00.400
but,
but um,
this is a,
this is the tradition,
correct?
No,
no,

1593
01:28:00.401 --> 01:28:03.340
I've never heard that term.
And that might've been what they did.

1594
01:28:03.341 --> 01:28:07.090
What he said was that he was reading out of a passage of a book that said that

1595
01:28:07.091 --> 01:28:08.230
that was what you're supposed to do.

1596
01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:11.620
[inaudible] read out of the pastors and this is the passenger and then he then

1597
01:28:11.621 --> 01:28:15.910
interpreted what he thinks that should be no,
he was pretty clear that he said,

1598
01:28:15.911 --> 01:28:19.920
it says to suck.
Yeah,
you're supposed to use the device because why not?

1599
01:28:19.930 --> 01:28:23.230
Device goes,
well,
maybe it's not as good.
He didn't say what the mouth,

1600
01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:26.140
he said you can use a device,
you can use something else.
But he goes,

1601
01:28:26.141 --> 01:28:29.530
it's tradition not to,
he's interpreting it right there on that video.

1602
01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:32.650
But didn't it say in the scripture to suck it with the mouth?
No,

1603
01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:37.440
he said to suck and that means then with the mouth.
Huh?

1604
01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:40.990
He clearly says that you can interpret it just says suck.
Okay.

1605
01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:45.980
I don't want to listen to it again to,
uh,
to like figure it out.
But I don't,

1606
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.020
I don't think,
I've never seen that either wonky.
Is it though?

1607
01:28:50.021 --> 01:28:52.210
You're cutting babies.
Dick's and sucking on them.

1608
01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:55.890
So it's like the whole thing is never heard.
What a ridiculous thing it is.
Like,

1609
01:28:55.891 --> 01:28:59.800
I mean people will say like,
if you have a boy,
would you circumcise your kid?
No.

1610
01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:02.100
Why would I?
And the loads is Dick's going to look

1611
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:02.521
<v 3>ugly?</v>

1612
01:29:02.521 --> 01:29:06.630
Like what are you doing staring at People's decks by the time someone gets your

1613
01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:09.930
Dick,
okay,
look what?
What's the difference?

1614
01:29:09.931 --> 01:29:12.150
There's a little skin that's going to throw you off.
Good.
Get outta here.

1615
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:16.980
You're crazy cleaner,
right?
It's cleaner.
And Joe,
you know,

1616
01:29:16.981 --> 01:29:20.370
like most people do have,
are circumcised,
you know that,
right?
Yeah.

1617
01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:23.730
Because there's reasons for it.
I like my nephew had so much skin.

1618
01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:24.830
It's because there's reasons.

1619
01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:28.770
My nephew had so much skin that like there would be no way to clean his dick

1620
01:29:28.771 --> 01:29:32.290
unless you know about your nephews for skin size.

1621
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:35.280
Me and my mom had a conversation about it and we actually talked about my

1622
01:29:35.281 --> 01:29:38.760
nephews p and s for a half hour.
Then we started talking about my penis in my,

1623
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:42.690
my mom said that the doctor that did my dick used to always brag to her about

1624
01:29:42.691 --> 01:29:46.380
how good he was at circumcision.
He was like an artist and then so my mom goes,

1625
01:29:46.410 --> 01:29:49.830
he,
he did a good job.
Right.
All right.
What are you doing?
Oh,
sorry to hear that.

1626
01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:54.000
My mom actually goes,
he did a good job,
right?
Does it look good?
And my mind go,

1627
01:29:54.001 --> 01:29:57.470
mom,
are you really asking me if my penis,
let's just whip it out.

1628
01:29:58.590 --> 01:30:01.500
It's over the phone.
It was on the phone,
but I guess that's just say,

1629
01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:04.890
just say you made it,
you want some,
I think it's it.
It really is.

1630
01:30:04.891 --> 01:30:07.560
There's reasons why a lot of people should have it.

1631
01:30:07.561 --> 01:30:10.620
Like some people have way too much.
Again,
that's a cute thought.

1632
01:30:10.621 --> 01:30:13.380
I definitely have heard that there's not,
there's no medical reasons.
The India,

1633
01:30:13.381 --> 01:30:15.750
there's hope prevents aids.
Shut up.

1634
01:30:16.450 --> 01:30:20.910
Say Yeah,
I've heard sanitary.
Get out of here.
It's a natural.

1635
01:30:20.911 --> 01:30:24.120
You're supposed to have a sports can over your dick at some weird custom we do.

1636
01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.840
We cut it off as rude.
Shit's ridiculous.
Yeah,
you are supposed to have tonsils,

1637
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:29.940
but the only time I take him out as when they break bro.

1638
01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.190
You don't take your tonsils out there working.
Awesome.

1639
01:30:32.191 --> 01:30:37.090
You're forced gins working fine.
Especially for skin to a tonsil.
Why did I do,

1640
01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.960
how about your appendix bro?
You don't fucking need up Bro.

1641
01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:43.050
You have your appendix out.
I don't know.
Would it bursts you take it out.

1642
01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.510
There's no reason to cut your fucking healthy normal.
All the old,

1643
01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.920
they used to always be fine,
but it's like tonsils were five,

1644
01:30:48.921 --> 01:30:51.870
two and the oldest people they died.
Yeah,
there wasn't fun.

1645
01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.400
It was a big difference there.

1646
01:30:53.401 --> 01:30:56.190
Just cause of death by a thousand years ago has nothing to do with what we know

1647
01:30:56.191 --> 01:30:59.250
now about anything.
Well,
I wonder why they started it in the first place.

1648
01:30:59.251 --> 01:31:01.370
What do you mean?
What do you think made them choose?

1649
01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:04.140
Do it's just the commandment,
but I don't know why non Jews do it.

1650
01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:07.110
It's gotta be from my mind.
You know why Jews do it?

1651
01:31:07.111 --> 01:31:09.900
But you don't know why they started doing it.
Whose idea was it?

1652
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:13.200
Why did that stick?
It's not,
I don't think it's just because everyone does.

1653
01:31:13.210 --> 01:31:16.140
I think there's actually health reasons to do.
It's what my mom has explained.

1654
01:31:16.141 --> 01:31:19.110
Cause I said the same thing.
I'm like,
why?
Why even do it?

1655
01:31:19.111 --> 01:31:20.280
It did take the first question.

1656
01:31:20.281 --> 01:31:22.230
That would be interesting if it was five years ago,

1657
01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:27.270
but what the world of Google it look it up.
Health benefits of circumcision.

1658
01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:30.600
Here we go.
That's a good point.
Yeah,
but that,
because I asked,
I called my mom,

1659
01:31:30.601 --> 01:31:33.270
it's like we'll leave the poor kid alone if it didn't take the first time.

1660
01:31:33.271 --> 01:31:35.310
Don't do it.
And she goes,
no,
the doctor said,

1661
01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:37.640
the doctor says you want it to do that

1662
01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:41.640
guard up Dick.

1663
01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:45.930
And I guess I could take off too little and too much.

1664
01:31:45.931 --> 01:31:48.360
So it's like you have a doctor that's pretty much going,
hey,

1665
01:31:48.361 --> 01:31:51.180
you're going to have a great sex life or you're going to hate your life.

1666
01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:52.081
Isn't that weird?

1667
01:31:52.081 --> 01:31:55.830
This is one of those divided issues and that we're going to find two completely

1668
01:31:55.831 --> 01:31:58.530
different schools of thought.
Let's see if it was divided,

1669
01:31:58.531 --> 01:32:01.920
wouldn't be like 90% of our 80% or whatever it is.
Are The people you

1670
01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:03.850
<v 4>states are circumcised?
Yeah,</v>

1671
01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:07.180
I think it probably still would be because people do what they always done.

1672
01:32:07.330 --> 01:32:11.960
If the tradition for a long time over a few lifetimes to circumcision,
you know,

1673
01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:14.320
it's really difficult to break that off.

1674
01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:16.990
When people started having children and grandmothers starts asking,

1675
01:32:16.991 --> 01:32:18.130
you know you're going to,
you know,

1676
01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:23.140
take the baby and give him a circumcised aren't like a diamonds and wedding

1677
01:32:23.141 --> 01:32:26.760
rings.
The new thing,
the new thing.
What do you mean isn't that,

1678
01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:28.570
isn't that just like a hundred years ago really?

1679
01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:32.410
Something like that was of the diamonds and wedding rings or like you're

1680
01:32:32.411 --> 01:32:35.630
supposed to spend a lot of money and so surprised.
I wouldn't be surprised,
man.

1681
01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:39.250
Now it's like everyone has to do it just because it's like become accepted.

1682
01:32:39.670 --> 01:32:42.670
Let's see.
Complications.
Let's read complications.

1683
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:47.790
Complications ranging in from oh 0.6 to ope to 55% have been cited where having

1684
01:32:49.151 --> 01:32:53.350
it or not having it.
Yeah.
Of complications in uh,
having it more specific.

1685
01:32:53.351 --> 01:32:57.250
Estimates have included two to 10% and oh 0.2,

1686
01:32:57.260 --> 01:33:00.140
2.6% okay.
Of circuits.

1687
01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.470
I just like compounding commiseration completely different numbers.

1688
01:33:02.471 --> 01:33:05.690
This is Wikipedia.
This is just wonky.
Anyway.
Uh,

1689
01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.960
according to the American Medical Association,

1690
01:33:07.961 --> 01:33:12.220
blood loss and infection are the most common complications but most bleeding is

1691
01:33:12.221 --> 01:33:14.050
minor.
Kids be stopped by applying pressure.

1692
01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:18.610
The survey of circumcision complications by Kaplan in 1983 revealed that the

1693
01:33:18.611 --> 01:33:23.611
rate of bleeding complications with shown between oh 0.1% and 35%

1694
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:27.760
<v 3>I think it's more now is what the doctor was saying because of this new way that</v>

1695
01:33:27.761 --> 01:33:30.760
they do it.
That's higher complications.

1696
01:33:30.761 --> 01:33:33.790
I heard that a lot more people are having problems with certain citizens they

1697
01:33:33.791 --> 01:33:37.300
used and they used to and it's because it's,
it's,
it's like,

1698
01:33:37.301 --> 01:33:40.480
I guess it's easier for the doctor where in the past it used to be you go to

1699
01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:45.010
like somebody that does it as living like a,
uh,
a Jew,
you know,

1700
01:33:45.011 --> 01:33:47.800
whatever those guys are called.
It's all about the,
yeah.
But that guy,

1701
01:33:47.890 --> 01:33:49.420
that's all he does all day long.

1702
01:33:49.421 --> 01:33:52.150
Like he is like an artist for penis circumcisions.

1703
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:55.540
Now they go to these doctors where they're fresh out of college and this could

1704
01:33:55.541 --> 01:33:57.820
be their second time doing it ever.
You know what I mean?

1705
01:33:57.821 --> 01:34:00.340
Is kicking the do it while the kids awake,
right?
Yeah.

1706
01:34:00.341 --> 01:34:03.580
So they made it what I believe it is,
they may it those keys the

1707
01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:04.413
<v 4>kid under right.</v>

1708
01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:10.800
Pinky and wine and let the kids suck on it.
That's just to get him drunk.
Yeah,

1709
01:34:11.010 --> 01:34:12.950
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And then they'll

1710
01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:18.970
get the draw.
That's crazy.
Your job is what they actually do.

1711
01:34:19.210 --> 01:34:24.210
Raise a little drug that though fucking with baby gets a little harder before I

1712
01:34:24.701 --> 01:34:27.760
suck the kids penis after cutting it off.
I like to get him drunk.

1713
01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:34.900
My rival the Christian soon for weird pedophilia.
Shit.

1714
01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:35.920
Who was the first,

1715
01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:39.460
I want to know what the fucking origin of search from circumcision was.

1716
01:34:40.150 --> 01:34:41.800
I want to know what the fuck where did king from,

1717
01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:45.460
we should get a penis doctor in here.
I don't know.
I wonder if they know.

1718
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:50.510
I wonder if there's some makes ancient cave art of here's The pyramid is good.

1719
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:56.170
When Jews said to circumcise your children,
I don't think that was the new thing.

1720
01:34:56.380 --> 01:35:00.560
Like circumcision was probably already out.
Yeah.
Cause then decide what to do.

1721
01:35:01.130 --> 01:35:02.180
What the fuck caused it.

1722
01:35:03.170 --> 01:35:06.680
Sexually transmitted diseases wasn't around would be the house and years ago,

1723
01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:11.540
a thousand years maybe the clap and stuff like that shit is always been around

1724
01:35:11.541 --> 01:35:16.010
man.
It's got to been around,
you know,
um,
Al Capone died of syphilis.

1725
01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:20.300
Yeah,
that was,
but that wasn't,
yeah,
but what was that?

1726
01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:24.650
That was the 1930s it was at the time.
Two years ago.
Come on man.

1727
01:35:24.710 --> 01:35:27.530
This shit was around before that.
It was,
it's been around.

1728
01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:32.450
I bet it's been around a long time.
AIDS was around 50 years ago maybe.
I mean I,

1729
01:35:32.451 --> 01:35:33.470
I've worked,
got talking again,

1730
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:38.030
they're saying that it might help prevent HIV infection.

1731
01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.450
I could see that totally more skin opening area where they have,

1732
01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:43.220
we've I to have a way higher rate of catching HIV than men.

1733
01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:48.170
201 200 times more likely to get HIV from a man and vice versa

1734
01:35:49.730 --> 01:35:52.350
because of all that open wound d looking area.

1735
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:57.430
They can get all funky in there with east infections and they have to carry the

1736
01:35:57.471 --> 01:35:59.560
children.
It's a lot of guns.

1737
01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:03.590
A child would might make him way more likely to get aids.
Yeah.

1738
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:05.300
So that's the rest of your taking that way.

1739
01:36:06.410 --> 01:36:08.540
Complications include and just having it,

1740
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:12.660
<v 3>having a clean house,
you know,
like fucking fungus and bug.</v>

1741
01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:15.460
Do you have to Joey Diaz has no problems.

1742
01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:19.270
That's top of it and I've seen it in fucking five years.

1743
01:36:19.271 --> 01:36:24.130
He doesn't know we're strong.
After he had a heart attack.
It's hard,

1744
01:36:24.131 --> 01:36:26.500
strong seat at five years.
Well,

1745
01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.300
she sees him when he stands in front of the mirror.

1746
01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:30.970
I'm sure he gives it a little look over.

1747
01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:34.720
Was reading glasses on and you know another question I asked my mom is like,

1748
01:36:34.721 --> 01:36:38.020
why is my doctor talking to you about how good he is at cutting penises?

1749
01:36:38.021 --> 01:36:43.021
Is that like some kind of hit like he's hitting on my mom to at circumcision.

1750
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:48.900
<v 4>You know why?
It's because all my life as it's a pretty dick.
Just we'll show you.</v>

1751
01:36:48.901 --> 01:36:53.100
What song
do you think about your mom hooking up with other dudes?

1752
01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:55.490
I asked my mom wants,
oh,
you're a mom single.

1753
01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:56.291
<v 3>She,
no,</v>

1754
01:36:56.291 --> 01:37:00.760
she's married but she was single for a while when I was like from third grade to

1755
01:37:00.761 --> 01:37:04.330
like,
I don't know,
seventh grade or sixth grade.
She went on,

1756
01:37:05.230 --> 01:37:08.890
she dated a guy that owned a house boat for a while named Denny that he's taking

1757
01:37:08.891 --> 01:37:12.400
on the boat.
Take me on the boat with his little hound dog.
That's a weird,

1758
01:37:12.401 --> 01:37:14.810
when your mom was told you guys yet.
Oof.

1759
01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:18.580
The worst one was is that my mom used to date this guy that was a pilot and he

1760
01:37:18.581 --> 01:37:21.670
just got his license and like he used to have this one that's a little small

1761
01:37:21.671 --> 01:37:26.671
propeller planes like three seater and we used to fly back and forth from like

1762
01:37:26.891 --> 01:37:30.430
different go to go places and I just remember going on like like six hour

1763
01:37:30.431 --> 01:37:34.690
journeys in this plane as a kid terrified out of my mind.

1764
01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:36.370
You know what they're like flirting in the front.

1765
01:37:36.371 --> 01:37:40.180
I'm the back of trying to re Garfield when take you up in a little baby plane

1766
01:37:40.181 --> 01:37:41.310
for six hours.
Yeah,

1767
01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:44.830
we would go on trips like go from like Ohio to like fucking West Virginia or

1768
01:37:44.831 --> 01:37:46.450
some dude's at rocket like that.

1769
01:37:46.451 --> 01:37:50.230
They have like a little propeller plane and they just fly out of here.

1770
01:37:50.290 --> 01:37:51.670
How fast can those jammies go?

1771
01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:55.770
I don't know but it's not like a jet fast but is it like 150 miles an hour fast?

1772
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:56.730
<v 4>Like a Cessna.</v>

1773
01:37:56.730 --> 01:38:00.660
How fast you get a sense of how fast you're going to marry as fuck.

1774
01:38:00.661 --> 01:38:03.990
And I remember going through a storm once we went through a storm ones and I

1775
01:38:03.991 --> 01:38:06.750
remember thinking it was like airplane cause I was one of my favorite movies as

1776
01:38:06.751 --> 01:38:09.540
a kid who's an airplane.
I remember thinking that the whole time.

1777
01:38:09.541 --> 01:38:11.370
Like it's just like the movie airplane.

1778
01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:16.260
I'm going to dive into the episode of silver spoons where they all go down in a

1779
01:38:16.261 --> 01:38:18.510
propeller plane through a storm where they crush on a desert island.

1780
01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:22.110
I don't remember that one.
Rick.
He's got a bag of skittles or M and.
M's,

1781
01:38:22.111 --> 01:38:22.860
I don't remember now,

1782
01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:25.680
but he had to share with everybody why assessment can travel up.

1783
01:38:25.681 --> 01:38:30.681
The Cessna four oh six can travel up to the speed of 283 miles an hour.

1784
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.320
Wow.
This was a lot more of the way.
Well yeah it is.

1785
01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:37.950
This was like a barnstorming plane.
Now this was the take assessment as a jet,

1786
01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:41.430
right,
isn't it?
It's like a fucking propeller plane rides it.

1787
01:38:42.410 --> 01:38:45.750
This was like one propeller in the front kind of plain and this is scary

1788
01:38:45.751 --> 01:38:49.310
planning like somebody to have like pull it down,
pull it off.

1789
01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:51.720
This is like how the fuck why?
And then my in this plane,

1790
01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:55.800
maybe that's a dope ass Cessna,
you know,

1791
01:38:55.801 --> 01:38:59.520
cause I've heard something about 150 or 200 miles an hour and that's how that

1792
01:38:59.521 --> 01:39:01.380
sounds pretty fast.
But either way,

1793
01:39:01.381 --> 01:39:04.200
that's pretty cool that you could do that and have that kind of freedom.

1794
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:08.790
You can get your own plane and fly to another state.
It was pretty bad ass.

1795
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:14.150
Avoid everything.
Avoid traffic,
avoid everything.
Just land.
There was a um,

1796
01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:18.720
Stephen King movie and I read the book first and then I,
then I got the movie,

1797
01:39:18.721 --> 01:39:20.430
there was a book,
I think it was one of his short stories,

1798
01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:24.190
but it's called night flyer and it was about a dude who was a,

1799
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:27.690
he was a newspaper reporter.
Yeah,
yeah,

1800
01:39:27.691 --> 01:39:32.220
I remember that was terribly good book of short stories.
The movies terribly,

1801
01:39:32.221 --> 01:39:36.320
awfully great.
Yeah,
he's just one of those.
I was like,
it's bad,
but it's good.

1802
01:39:36.330 --> 01:39:37.163
Like a,
it's,

1803
01:39:37.570 --> 01:39:40.980
it's one of those movies where I'm happy if it's one o'clock in the morning and

1804
01:39:40.981 --> 01:39:43.710
I'm flipping through the channels board and then it comes on,
I'm like,
Oh shit,

1805
01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:47.820
this is,
well let me get some popcorn,
you know?
And um,
anyway,
in this story,

1806
01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:48.510
this guy was,

1807
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:52.260
he had his Cessna and he would fly in to these little airports and there was a

1808
01:39:52.261 --> 01:39:53.760
vampire that was doing the same thing.

1809
01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:58.020
It's a vampire was flying in the vampire hunter an airplane and we'd like Jack

1810
01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:01.890
People at airports and shit.
Really?
Yeah.
They had like little tiny airports.

1811
01:40:02.190 --> 01:40:05.700
It was Kinda cool.
It's Kinda cool and Shitty at the same time.
It was not,

1812
01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:08.130
it wasn't,
you know,
anything to be proud of,
but it was fun.

1813
01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.180
It was fun to watch all of his stuff works better as stories.
Really.
Yeah.

1814
01:40:12.181 --> 01:40:16.020
Way better when you start making it a physical reality,
like,
oh,
it's hard.

1815
01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:18.690
Salem's lot pulled it off sales.
That was terrible.

1816
01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.690
I didn't think it was terrible.
We were young.
Maybe it was terrible.

1817
01:40:21.691 --> 01:40:22.500
I haven't seen it recently.

1818
01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:25.950
Random cares just popped up out of nowhere saying really important information.

1819
01:40:25.951 --> 01:40:26.970
But like,
who is that?

1820
01:40:26.971 --> 01:40:29.940
I enjoyed the fuck out of it when I was a little kid when I was dancing in front

1821
01:40:29.941 --> 01:40:34.200
of the window,
the maximum overdrive.
I think maybe he just,

1822
01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.130
Stephen King's never really gotten like probably a really good screenwriter and

1823
01:40:38.131 --> 01:40:42.690
director behind him except like stories are fantastical.
If there's a word,

1824
01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.390
you know he's,
his stories are so much better in the imagination,
you know,

1825
01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:50.220
some of them like,
you know,
like to Tommy knockers.

1826
01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:52.660
Did you ever see the movie the Tommy knockers that was not moving?

1827
01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:56.950
I saw Carrie remember it.
It was my Monday.
Have you seen that one?

1828
01:40:57.190 --> 01:40:59.020
But like there was a bunch of them that I've seen,

1829
01:40:59.021 --> 01:41:00.200
but I don't know if I saw a time,

1830
01:41:00.201 --> 01:41:01.600
you're not going to have a few seem to remember.

1831
01:41:01.601 --> 01:41:05.830
It was like a made for TV special.
The good,
but the book,
it's Great.

1832
01:41:06.130 --> 01:41:10.810
The book is really interesting,
man.
Like look like pet cemetery,
the movies.

1833
01:41:10.811 --> 01:41:13.450
Like it's all right.
It's okay.
It's not bad.

1834
01:41:13.451 --> 01:41:17.960
It's kind of interesting that I pay with Naama and I want to play with you.

1835
01:41:18.190 --> 01:41:21.550
Play with you daddy.
Whoa,
hang.
Maximum overdrive.

1836
01:41:21.610 --> 01:41:25.180
But the book is the shit man.
Pet Cemetery.
The book is fascinating.

1837
01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:29.710
Stephen King is so good at like pulling it raw emotions like these people that

1838
01:41:29.711 --> 01:41:33.280
wanted their daughter back.
So they buried her.
The whole thing about,
it's like,

1839
01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:37.180
cause with desperation then they had the cat,

1840
01:41:37.181 --> 01:41:39.670
the cat that came back that was acting all fucked up.

1841
01:41:39.671 --> 01:41:43.330
And we just fucking movies,
just books rather.

1842
01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:46.900
Oh the movies can never fuck with those books because you'd be alone in your

1843
01:41:46.901 --> 01:41:50.410
room when you didn't want to stop reading.
And you would keep going and going.

1844
01:41:50.411 --> 01:41:52.960
You know,
like I would read them like when I was on the train,

1845
01:41:52.961 --> 01:41:55.220
when I was headed into a,
when I was living in Newton,

1846
01:41:55.221 --> 01:41:58.600
I'd take the train into taekwondo in Boston and I didn't want to get off the

1847
01:41:58.601 --> 01:42:01.510
train man.
I'd get on a good one.
And I'd be like,
fuck,

1848
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:06.670
I can't believe my stops here already.
Uh,
Christine Woods and Christine hemp.

1849
01:42:06.730 --> 01:42:09.640
That was one of my fears.
Christine.
And I liked the car ones.
For some reason.

1850
01:42:09.850 --> 01:42:11.870
Christine was awesome.
It was the car while,
yeah,

1851
01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:13.360
maximum overdrive kind of rode that one.

1852
01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.460
Maximum overdrive was the truck one where the truck's Green Goblin,

1853
01:42:17.650 --> 01:42:21.160
the one had the green Goblin as the f in the front of it and his bad out.

1854
01:42:21.161 --> 01:42:22.560
I just remember the Green Goblin and I thought that was,

1855
01:42:22.561 --> 01:42:27.130
is there any one God's responsible for more Badass fucking stories and Stephen

1856
01:42:27.130 --> 01:42:27.210
King,

1857
01:42:27.210 --> 01:42:30.020
<v 6>it has got a lot.
It's very,
very,
he writes a lot.</v>

1858
01:42:30.021 --> 01:42:34.370
So prolific sketcher he's doing an interview and even the whole time he's doing

1859
01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:35.360
interview might have been Dana Carvey.

1860
01:42:35.361 --> 01:42:37.730
It's one of those time periods and he's just typing away,

1861
01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:40.560
just typing away on his computer.
He's like,
yeah,
I'm writing a new book about uh,

1862
01:42:40.561 --> 01:42:43.010
whatever.
Like how do you get your,
um,
whatever.
He said,
ah,
you know,

1863
01:42:43.011 --> 01:42:44.990
I go to the supermarket and just keep typing.
And then officer,

1864
01:42:44.991 --> 01:42:48.590
they just stops and the guy goes,
what's the matter?
He goes,
I just,

1865
01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:52.450
she's got writer's block and back up top and then just goes right back to
typing.

1866
01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:53.973
Yeah.
It's funny.

1867
01:42:54.010 --> 01:42:55.930
<v 4>No one's got less writer's block than that guy.</v>

1868
01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.690
He just forces himself to work and work every day.
I mean,

1869
01:42:58.691 --> 01:43:01.750
he was working after he recovered from his horrible car accident.

1870
01:43:02.110 --> 01:43:03.310
If you don't know the stories,

1871
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:06.790
some guy was like talking to his dog and his car and not paying attention.

1872
01:43:06.791 --> 01:43:10.990
He clips Stephen King.
It was walking on the side of the road.
Yeah.
Nailed them,

1873
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:15.460
sent them him flying,
broke every fucking bone in his body,
his hips,
his legs,

1874
01:43:15.461 --> 01:43:20.290
his femurs arms,
his ribs.
He's just fucked for like the longest time.

1875
01:43:20.530 --> 01:43:22.630
So it took him forever to recover from that.

1876
01:43:22.631 --> 01:43:25.720
And as he's recovering and he set up a fucking death for him and gave him a

1877
01:43:25.721 --> 01:43:26.554
fucking cool

1878
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:29.330
<v 6>typing away.
I started working again.
You know Ralph,</v>

1879
01:43:29.331 --> 01:43:32.710
he told the story at my a story show about how he got into a car accident.

1880
01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:35.680
Same thing I would think happened.
Really broke all the bones in his body.

1881
01:43:35.681 --> 01:43:38.380
They told him we're going to walk again.
When was this?
When he was,

1882
01:43:38.381 --> 01:43:40.180
I think in high school.
Really?
Yeah.

1883
01:43:40.181 --> 01:43:42.850
And then he was like a jock and then he said he was talking about,

1884
01:43:42.851 --> 01:43:44.590
but it's like he's just got real solid.
And he goes,
you know,

1885
01:43:44.591 --> 01:43:48.390
and then I gained some weight from there and just kinda spiraled.
Wow.

1886
01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:52.020
Shit happens in life.
And it was good cause

1887
01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:56.900
<v 4>it really,
everyone was just listening hard.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1888
01:43:56.901 --> 01:44:00.050
Ralph,
he's got that thing where you don't talk about it when you're around them.

1889
01:44:00.051 --> 01:44:04.670
But you know,
he's morbidly obese.
He makes jokes about it,

1890
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:07.820
but I still don't really talk about it with him.
Yeah.
I don't either.

1891
01:44:09.290 --> 01:44:11.360
It's like there's a few of those dudes.

1892
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:14.270
It's like you don't know what to say to him.
There's nothing he could say.

1893
01:44:14.271 --> 01:44:16.760
You got your own personal journey.
You're on man.
Yeah.

1894
01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:20.450
And you're not in a good spot.
You got to figure it out and you got to,

1895
01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:23.780
you got to somehow or another turn that boat or you junk.

1896
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:27.170
Some people were don't be,
you don't need everything in your life.
Yeah.

1897
01:44:27.171 --> 01:44:31.190
And you know,
for some people it's so fucking difficult to lose weight.

1898
01:44:31.191 --> 01:44:32.390
Some people just haven't made,

1899
01:44:32.391 --> 01:44:34.640
they can eat all day and they don't have any problems at all.
It's hard.

1900
01:44:34.641 --> 01:44:37.490
Other people,
man,
like Brian,
you fucking struggle,
man.

1901
01:44:37.491 --> 01:44:40.340
Like you eat like a cheeseburger and all of a sudden you gain like five pounds.

1902
01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:43.040
Like it doesn't even make sense.
A cheeseburger doesn't even weigh five pounds.

1903
01:44:43.041 --> 01:44:46.100
Right?
Somehow or another,
like you gained more weight than you eat.

1904
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.620
It's all because my metabolism

1905
01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:53.830
<v 3>I like today,
I haven't had one thing today and it's five 30,
you know,</v>

1906
01:44:53.890 --> 01:44:55.750
I haven't ate one thing today except coffee.

1907
01:44:56.230 --> 01:44:57.610
Well that's not good for your metabolism.

1908
01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:01.610
Terrible supposed to saying my metabolism is fucked up.
So I eat a hamburger.

1909
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:05.680
Evolve meals going,
supposed to do it.
That's why I know,
that's what I'm saying.

1910
01:45:05.681 --> 01:45:09.880
That's why I suck at it.
Oh,
not eating habits we did for a while,

1911
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:13.720
<v 4>man.
You,
you,
you got down,
you've lost like some stupid amount of weight.</v>

1912
01:45:13.730 --> 01:45:14.310
Didn't you?

1913
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:18.590
<v 3>60,
60 to 70 or you did it over the course of like five months,
right?
Well,</v>

1914
01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:22.780
the main majority of is three months and then 10.
Wow.

1915
01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:28.150
How much of a gain back?
Uh,
I got down to one 65.
Right now I'm on 85,

1916
01:45:28.151 --> 01:45:28.460
so,

1917
01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:31.410
<v 4>okay,
that's 20 pounds,
but not terrible.
But what's,</v>

1918
01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:33.320
what 65 you were done or you're still losing weight?

1919
01:45:34.230 --> 01:45:36.810
<v 3>One 65 like that.
That must be why,
but no,</v>

1920
01:45:36.811 --> 01:45:40.740
I thought I looked like I had aids so I was like this,
that's what you look like.

1921
01:45:40.741 --> 01:45:44.420
Stupid.
I don't like the,
to me and that's just your faces.

1922
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:47.100
You just get used to that round.
It's like whenever I shave a goatee,

1923
01:45:47.110 --> 01:45:48.260
but I have a good team for like a year later

1924
01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:52.300
<v 4>shave,
but it's like,
Whoa,
what happened to my lips?
Yeah.
When I shaved my face,</v>

1925
01:45:52.330 --> 01:45:55.840
I'm amazed at how small my head looks when I grow a beard.

1926
01:45:55.870 --> 01:46:00.520
My head looks like it's 10 times bigger,
just fucking black mass and my face,

1927
01:46:00.521 --> 01:46:03.940
her and I feel like I have this big fat,
stupid face.

1928
01:46:03.941 --> 01:46:07.180
My face feels fat and stupid and then I shave it and I'm like,
oh,

1929
01:46:07.181 --> 01:46:08.500
it's my head and my face was under there.

1930
01:46:08.670 --> 01:46:12.330
<v 3>Yeah,
I just shaved it for that very reason.
I was just like,
God,</v>

1931
01:46:12.331 --> 01:46:16.020
I look fucking old.
And fat right now.
Yeah.

1932
01:46:16.021 --> 01:46:20.220
I shaved it and I got id for fucking buying Nyquil the other day at fucking cvs.

1933
01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:23.520
You always get a deed for buying.
Never had that problem.
They're supposed to.

1934
01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:25.650
You get the idea,
no matter how old you are,

1935
01:46:25.651 --> 01:46:28.020
and so that they know who's buying it.
Oh yeah,
you can't.

1936
01:46:28.021 --> 01:46:32.600
It's not because it does cause your heart to you,
bro.
Bro,

1937
01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:35.850
that's not what they're doing,
man.
They're,
they're doing that

1938
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.640
<v 4>cause you're,
you know,
you're supposed to get registered.</v>

1939
01:46:38.641 --> 01:46:41.280
You're supposed to register when you buy anything,
they can turn into math.

1940
01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:44.360
<v 3>Wow.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
I love those moments in life.
You're convinced.
It was like,</v>

1941
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:45.410
well,
I guess I look really young.

1942
01:46:45.411 --> 01:46:47.870
I just have that convinced that this is a fact that this guy,

1943
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:49.950
then you'll find it.
In another fact,
you're like,
oh,

1944
01:46:50.330 --> 01:46:53.160
<v 4>just because of that girl to Vegas go,
oh my God,</v>

1945
01:46:53.161 --> 01:46:56.070
I still get carded all the time and I swear to God,

1946
01:46:56.071 --> 01:46:58.710
she looked like she was 45 years old.
It was like,

1947
01:46:58.890 --> 01:47:01.950
some people just want to believe that I get carted all the time.

1948
01:47:02.130 --> 01:47:05.070
No one wants to ever admit like Dan remembering my shit.

1949
01:47:06.630 --> 01:47:11.010
I thought they took the chemical out of Nyquil that you can make math with.
Yes.

1950
01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:14.940
They took the chemical out of most things that you can make math with that you

1951
01:47:14.941 --> 01:47:18.620
can,
you can still do it because we could still make a certain amount of things.

1952
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:21.180
The late seed aminophylline and there's,
there's certain,

1953
01:47:21.390 --> 01:47:23.400
there's certain things that are very desirable in there.

1954
01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:26.490
The codene used to be in Nyquil.
Right.
That was a different thing.

1955
01:47:26.850 --> 01:47:27.990
That's not the math stuff

1956
01:47:28.050 --> 01:47:30.480
<v 3>the lady said,
cause when I asked her,
I was like,
are you seriously?</v>

1957
01:47:30.481 --> 01:47:32.070
I Ding me for Nyquil?
She goes,
well,

1958
01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:37.100
it's because cvs has policy is to try to get kids not to get addicted to cough

1959
01:47:37.441 --> 01:47:40.470
syrup at a young age.
And that's why they have to do it.
Well there's that too.

1960
01:47:40.471 --> 01:47:44.190
And they said they ID anyone under the age of 18 or,
oh,

1961
01:47:44.191 --> 01:47:48.870
so she did idea for your age?
Yes.
Wow.
But what,
what kind of Shit are you getting?

1962
01:47:48.871 --> 01:47:51.330
You're getting prescription shit.
No,
it's just getting NYQUIL.

1963
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:54.650
<v 4>What was the other day?
Cough.
Nyquil doesn't have coding.</v>

1964
01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:59.180
So if I sat a 16 year old boy and to get Nyquil,
they wouldn't sell to them.

1965
01:47:59.630 --> 01:48:04.220
Right.
This is a new thing at first cvs.
Why wouldn't know?

1966
01:48:04.221 --> 01:48:06.470
Because I've never gone to it.
I thought they were just,
I thought you were.

1967
01:48:06.530 --> 01:48:09.300
When I say Nyquil,
I don't buy like the drink.
I get like the,

1968
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:13.640
the pills with couple pills like dayquil and nyquil that can't be tracked

1969
01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:16.730
through the other stuff.
Yeah,
I have.
I've seen it too,
but everyone,

1970
01:48:16.731 --> 01:48:21.200
they stopped having,
Cody knew and I stopped buying it.
I had it,
I was sick dude.

1971
01:48:21.230 --> 01:48:23.060
I was on news radio and uh,

1972
01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:27.290
I had the day off luckily and I was sick and I took coding that took Cody Nyquil

1973
01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:30.440
and I sat in front of my fucking TV watching TV going,

1974
01:48:30.530 --> 01:48:34.490
I feel so awesome.
I was so high.

1975
01:48:34.630 --> 01:48:39.470
Most mostly the coding is a very different kind of high,
it's a very like happy,

1976
01:48:39.471 --> 01:48:43.340
silly relax.
Like my pillow felt great,

1977
01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:47.690
like covers felt great.
Awe.
Nyquil with coding was the shit.

1978
01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:48.870
How much would you have to drink to get the,

1979
01:48:48.930 --> 01:48:53.930
I checked whatever that said to drink like a capsule at Benji's had a July 5th

1980
01:48:54.321 --> 01:48:54.891
party last year.

1981
01:48:54.891 --> 01:48:57.140
Every borough where he had his grandmother's cough medicine and some kids were

1982
01:48:57.141 --> 01:48:59.450
doing it.
The real shit with Cody was like the real crazy stuff.

1983
01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:02.750
Well the real shit with coding and it's hard to get but used to be able to get

1984
01:49:02.751 --> 01:49:05.450
it at a corner store.
I know a comic,
he used to be addicted to it.

1985
01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:06.580
<v 3>I think it's just over the counter.</v>

1986
01:49:06.610 --> 01:49:10.330
I think it could still get it if you just talk to a pharmacist at cvs

1987
01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:14.940
<v 4>coding bro.
I don't think so.
I don't know if it's the same stuff bro.
I think</v>

1988
01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:19.410
you can still get liquid night and they'll still fuck you up but it won't fuck

1989
01:49:19.411 --> 01:49:22.800
you up as well.
I think the Nyquil,
listen we were talking about

1990
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:27.550
password guessing all day.
Actually look 60 to

1991
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:29.903
maybe,

1992
01:49:30.890 --> 01:49:31.311
<v 3>but yet,</v>

1993
01:49:31.311 --> 01:49:34.370
you know when I was a kid I didn't even do the Nyquil for awhile but I started

1994
01:49:34.371 --> 01:49:38.390
off with doing is the no nos cause that was like speed and so I'd buy a Shitload

1995
01:49:38.391 --> 01:49:39.224
of Nodoz

1996
01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:45.930
<v 4>peppers,
20 of those mother fuckers.
I was always scared of that shit.
Yeah,</v>

1997
01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:48.070
I knew whenever 20 cause one of those things

1998
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:52.830
<v 2>you take it man,
you're committed to that
for the next fucking three hours.</v>

1999
01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:53.960
That was my first,

2000
01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:56.030
<v 6>my first job.
At least do that before a,</v>

2001
01:49:56.031 --> 01:49:59.150
before a football and basketball games to get up,
you know.

2002
01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:02.890
So I take one of those pills.
Caffeine pills,
whatever they're called.
Yeah.

2003
01:50:03.550 --> 01:50:07.970
Now he'd f five I or five hour energy drink,
which I,
by the way,

2004
01:50:07.971 --> 01:50:11.560
I finally read the bottle.
It says half a bottle for moderate awakeness.

2005
01:50:11.570 --> 01:50:14.270
I've always took the whole thing and be up for like nine hours.
Yeah.

2006
01:50:14.271 --> 01:50:16.640
Now just take like a third really.
So it was enough for me.

2007
01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:18.660
I don't drink coffee like you do.
All right.

2008
01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:22.510
<v 2>Yeah.
You don't drink any caffeine,
you a used to,
but then you got the headaches.</v>

2009
01:50:22.511 --> 01:50:27.460
Once.
Right.
And you fail it.
No,
I never drank coffee coats to sprites.

2010
01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:30.340
Just my tastes changed one day and then the withdrawal gave me a humongous

2011
01:50:30.341 --> 01:50:32.860
headaches,
which were control is.
So then I was like,

2012
01:50:32.861 --> 01:50:36.280
I don't want to have to go through withdrawal it.
I changed my tastes.
I agree.

2013
01:50:36.281 --> 01:50:40.600
But coffee's awesome.
Awesome.
You guys are addicts.
Tait Fletcher said it best.

2014
01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:45.510
He said it's like a warm hug.
So coffee's like hug Tate.

2015
01:50:45.930 --> 01:50:49.420
He's right.
Yeah.
Coffee's delicious.
I love it.
I love it when I write.

2016
01:50:49.421 --> 01:50:51.700
It's comforting like a write something and then take a little sip.

2017
01:50:51.701 --> 01:50:56.080
Here's my little reward for writing.
Even as a kid,
I liked coffee,
ice cream.

2018
01:50:58.100 --> 01:50:59.860
Well I buy the shit I buys from Hawaii.

2019
01:50:59.861 --> 01:51:02.820
I buy that Kona coffee and it's so delicious,
man.
These their,

2020
01:51:02.821 --> 01:51:03.970
their bad motherfuckers.

2021
01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:07.540
It's weird how there's like spots in the world where they just have it down.

2022
01:51:07.570 --> 01:51:12.100
They can just grow one thing.
Awesome.
And in Kona on the big island of Hawaii,

2023
01:51:12.101 --> 01:51:15.100
they'd make the best tasting coffee man.
It's so good.

2024
01:51:15.610 --> 01:51:19.180
It's like a cigars from Cuba.
There's like a bolt of VA whole,

2025
01:51:19.181 --> 01:51:22.660
I forget the name of the place.
Perfect for smell area.

2026
01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:26.620
That's the area where they can grow the best cigars and Cuba is very small,

2027
01:51:26.770 --> 01:51:28.390
but that fucking soil,

2028
01:51:28.391 --> 01:51:30.730
there's something about that shit where the sun hits it every day,

2029
01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:33.460
whatever it is,
man.
The right spot on the planet,

2030
01:51:33.490 --> 01:51:38.290
the right amount of dead plants if rotted in there over the millions of years

2031
01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:40.900
and it's just the perfect soil,
the best tobacco,

2032
01:51:41.590 --> 01:51:44.680
and they've been growing them there for years and years like they can make a

2033
01:51:44.681 --> 01:51:45.550
real good cigar.

2034
01:51:45.550 --> 01:51:50.550
When they take the seeds from Cuba and they bring them to Nicaragua or Dominican

2035
01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:53.770
Republic,
they can still make a pretty kick ass cigar,
but there's just something,

2036
01:51:53.771 --> 01:51:55.960
a little extra kick.
If you know cigars,

2037
01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:58.560
it's a little extra kick about those Cubans.
Habanero peppers,

2038
01:51:58.570 --> 01:52:02.320
he take it get in from Mexico or hotter,
really hot.
When I was growing up here.

2039
01:52:02.410 --> 01:52:06.700
How much harder I can taste them.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You fucked up.

2040
01:52:06.701 --> 01:52:09.970
We never went to that Chili place died.
I always thought it would go,

2041
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.150
fuck we fucked up man.
We talked,
there was a place in Encino called Chili,

2042
01:52:13.151 --> 01:52:16.630
my soul and I went there with my boy,
Tom Hirsch,

2043
01:52:16.631 --> 01:52:19.450
cocoa and David Hurwitz for fear factor and a,

2044
01:52:19.451 --> 01:52:24.451
it was a guy who was just a chili fanatic and he was the hard core.

2045
01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:28.330
Like you couldn't believe that a guy had a store and he was selling Chili this

2046
01:52:28.331 --> 01:52:31.900
hot because he would have a bunch of different levels,
but there was level.

2047
01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:36.760
I didn't even try 10 I tried level nine and that was good.
Okay.
Oh my God.
Wow.

2048
01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:39.730
It was that,
what's that called?
Called capisce couple.

2049
01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.110
What does that stuff called?
Capsaicin.
Capsaicin.
I've only seen it written.

2050
01:52:44.111 --> 01:52:48.550
I've never said the,
but that stuff.
He had that stuff in it and it had um,

2051
01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:53.860
the ghost pepper.
Yes.
That's what's called the ghost pepper,

2052
01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:55.280
which is just one of those gas.

2053
01:52:55.281 --> 01:52:58.610
He had the extract of ghost pepper in some of his shit.
Yeah,

2054
01:52:58.611 --> 01:53:02.590
I saw that at a hot place in Austin place.

2055
01:53:02.591 --> 01:53:05.660
It's sort of hot sauce bottles,
just Scoville units are off the charts.

2056
01:53:05.661 --> 01:53:09.230
So I didn't even have the super crazy death shit.
I had one notch below that.

2057
01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:12.700
I put one scoop into my mouth.
My tongue went numb.

2058
01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:17.810
I started hiccupping completely uncontrollably.
Tears were flowing down.

2059
01:53:17.811 --> 01:53:20.810
My face snot was pouring down my nose.

2060
01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:24.360
<v 6>Now you can see how that's a defense mechanism.
Yeah,
planet.
Oh my God.</v>

2061
01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:26.660
Never try that again.
If you accidentally like,
maybe I'll try this berry.

2062
01:53:26.690 --> 01:53:27.950
You would never try that barrier again,

2063
01:53:28.030 --> 01:53:31.330
<v 2>but he told me that he would get dudes that would come in from Tibet,</v>

2064
01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:33.700
especially when people heard about it.

2065
01:53:33.730 --> 01:53:38.620
I Tibet and dude's apparently have insane tolerance for hot foods and they would

2066
01:53:38.621 --> 01:53:42.910
come in and take his death shit and poor more death sauce,

2067
01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:44.500
more capsaicin,
capsaicin,

2068
01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:48.700
pour that shit on his chili and he couldn't believe they could eat it.

2069
01:53:48.850 --> 01:53:51.130
He would sit there watching him and these guys would just love it.

2070
01:53:51.131 --> 01:53:53.740
They were sweating and loving it,
loving it.

2071
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:57.670
It's like I guess different people in different climates develop some sort of a

2072
01:53:57.671 --> 01:53:58.540
different tolerance.

2073
01:53:58.930 --> 01:53:59.763
<v 6>A lot of time</v>

2074
01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:04.770
<v 2>I just shit blood now.
If that going to get close to that shit,
dude,</v>

2075
01:54:04.771 --> 01:54:07.800
I'm telling you,
I have never had anything as hot as this Chili.

2076
01:54:07.801 --> 01:54:11.880
And this was like I said,
this is number nine out of 10.
Done.
He close.
Yeah,

2077
01:54:11.881 --> 01:54:15.990
he died.
He was a big,
it was a big guy.
He had a lot of his own Chili.

2078
01:54:16.170 --> 01:54:18.450
They used to have it too at that place.
The griddle,

2079
01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:21.930
is that the place they used to have his chili's?
These are seldom there.

2080
01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:24.600
Oh really?
That's how I found out the guy died because they've said,
hey,

2081
01:54:24.601 --> 01:54:27.870
you guys don't have those chilies anymore and the gall,
the guy died.
I'm like,
oh,

2082
01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:33.480
<v 6>such a bummer man.
See that's when those people die.
Like a macho man,</v>

2083
01:54:33.481 --> 01:54:35.180
Randy Savage.
Dot.
It's like,
it's too bad.
But he had,

2084
01:54:35.210 --> 01:54:38.400
he wasn't in my world anymore.
He wasn't assisting me or Michael Jackson.

2085
01:54:38.401 --> 01:54:41.550
He's not making any good music anymore.
But like when that guy like that dies,

2086
01:54:41.570 --> 01:54:43.140
you're like,
I,
you have a loss now.

2087
01:54:43.210 --> 01:54:45.760
<v 2>Yeah.
Well he was a real chilly kind of sore.</v>

2088
01:54:45.761 --> 01:54:48.520
I would've loved to seen him on that.
Uh,
Anthony Bourdain show,

2089
01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:51.150
the no reservation show would go,
he would attack.

2090
01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:55.090
Definitely had to visited that guy if the guy stayed alive.
But anyway,

2091
01:54:55.091 --> 01:54:58.930
his Chili's where the shit and he had like all these different flavors and they

2092
01:54:58.931 --> 01:55:00.430
were just,
all of them would just,

2093
01:55:00.431 --> 01:55:04.660
you'd be sweating and he had like these hardcore dudes that would go there.

2094
01:55:04.750 --> 01:55:07.570
Like he had like recommendations and all these articles written about his place

2095
01:55:07.571 --> 01:55:11.300
all over the wall.
And it was just gives,
it was the chili was so hardcore,
they,

2096
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:14.440
you know,
like all the crazy people would be like to would we found the spot,

2097
01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:17.650
you know,
like if you're really insane into that hot food,

2098
01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:21.490
some people can just throw it down.
I love it.
I do too.
I do too,

2099
01:55:21.491 --> 01:55:23.560
but I don't think I could take as much as you could take and then you

2100
01:55:24.330 --> 01:55:27.840
<v 6>way worse,
whereas way more than me.
Really?
Yeah.
It's also,</v>

2101
01:55:27.841 --> 01:55:32.280
it's a stupid thing people brag about.
Yeah,
I can do this.
Like coffee,

2102
01:55:32.281 --> 01:55:35.640
just like that stuff better.
So manly thing,
how much you can take.

2103
01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:36.960
That's what that's told you.
The same thing.

2104
01:55:36.961 --> 01:55:39.960
People in Australia are making fun of me cause I wasn't drinking so much like oh

2105
01:55:39.961 --> 01:55:43.350
you have no tolerance and it was like light up a joint and I will take whole

2106
01:55:43.351 --> 01:55:44.184
country on

2107
01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:47.640
<v 0>let's do this while I'm talking about manhood.
Let's fucking do this.</v>

2108
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:50.820
That's totally unfair because they don't have real partner.
No they don't.

2109
01:55:50.821 --> 01:55:54.450
I mean they do but they don't.
They think they do.
They think their pods awesome.

2110
01:55:54.810 --> 01:55:58.040
You're like that's cute.
You want to like rub their head?
Me Suite.
Yeah.
Sweet.

2111
01:55:58.050 --> 01:56:02.400
We do a little 15% THC.
Joey Diaz brought some shit over yesterday.

2112
01:56:02.401 --> 01:56:06.210
It was 34% THC.
The mats.
Is that what he brought?

2113
01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:09.060
Oh Gee Kush.
That's ridiculous.

2114
01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:14.560
That shit can change the world.
Okay.
If we get enough people to try Matt,

2115
01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:15.360
Oh Gee Kush.

2116
01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:18.240
It could change the fucking attention for the whole ride to he takes you for the

2117
01:56:18.241 --> 01:56:21.180
whole ride and when you're done you have some things to think about.

2118
01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:25.520
You have to like,
oh yeah,
you got some things to think about it.

2119
01:56:25.521 --> 01:56:27.930
There might be somebody you want to call up and apologize for some shit that

2120
01:56:27.931 --> 01:56:31.080
happened to the seventh grade.
Just tell us more.

2121
01:56:31.081 --> 01:56:34.730
Yesterday had the stuff he grows his logic Kush from the same clone is the guy

2122
01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:38.160
grabs his store and he built the little bugs are too small.

2123
01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:41.100
They boiled down and make honey butter out of it.
Do you guys ever seen that?

2124
01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:44.940
Oh my God.
They sift it through butane that the beauty,
so it melted.

2125
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:48.980
It's like paste that the butane Bernoff cause it just evaporates in the air.
Um,

2126
01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:53.400
and then it's just this like paste so brutally.
Hi.

2127
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:58.230
Oh my God,
I'm so scared.
Just listening to you talking about that now.

2128
01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:03.150
I think he's had half grams go for like 60 people don't even know that have

2129
01:57:03.151 --> 01:57:04.920
never eaten it.
They really don't know.

2130
01:57:04.921 --> 01:57:08.640
And that don't people especially squares or if people really straight,

2131
01:57:08.850 --> 01:57:12.420
they don't know that experience.
How Tara,
when we joke around about it,

2132
01:57:12.421 --> 01:57:17.290
like when Joey pulled out that cookie yesterday,
I got scared.
I was,
yeah,

2133
01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:18.540
I got that taste in my mouth.

2134
01:57:18.541 --> 01:57:21.550
After you eat mushrooms right before you start shipping.
That's the taste.

2135
01:57:22.170 --> 01:57:25.890
There's a smell that certain really powerful edibles have.

2136
01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:29.840
There's the smell on the air on the airline to a yes.
Yeah.

2137
01:57:29.890 --> 01:57:32.970
Those are from the same place he gets it from.
Oh No.

2138
01:57:32.971 --> 01:57:36.180
There was nothing on the airline.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
You didn't do that.

2139
01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:39.400
There's no way you would do something that ridiculous me.
It's just a story.

2140
01:57:40.130 --> 01:57:44.460
It's fiction anyway.
Yeah,
there's a smell.
You opened up that cart and I was like,

2141
01:57:44.461 --> 01:57:48.150
what?
Going to expect the smell like smell.

2142
01:57:49.410 --> 01:57:50.580
Especially in that too,

2143
01:57:50.581 --> 01:57:54.540
but that plane broke that Tupperware seal and that hit me.
I was like,

2144
01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:59.100
I always thinking I was thinking things ran through my mugshot,
mugshot,

2145
01:57:59.101 --> 01:58:01.800
stamping the hand stamping the hand fingerprints,
cuffs,

2146
01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:06.660
jail door shot phone called a lawyer.
Shit.
How much motherfucker,

2147
01:58:06.661 --> 01:58:10.280
I gotta be here for how long?
Goddammit.
Ari slapping arc

2148
01:58:11.970 --> 01:58:15.350
flashes.
I have like a slide show presence.

2149
01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:18.600
Are you ever like have a friend like curses and public ucls kids behind her?

2150
01:58:18.601 --> 01:58:23.260
He just forgot what it was.
That was that feeling.
The same thing too.

2151
01:58:25.250 --> 01:58:28.290
I was like,
oh my God,
first of all that,
but you just brought so much,

2152
01:58:28.590 --> 01:58:32.100
there was no way you could eat it all.
And I was like,
it was for than trip.

2153
01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:35.730
We were too deep and too,
there was only a couple hours to land.
I'm like,

2154
01:58:35.731 --> 01:58:36.390
I can't do it.

2155
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:41.390
This last time you want to do is be baked to the gills and then go through

2156
01:58:41.831 --> 01:58:42.430
foreign

2157
01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:45.860
<v 2>country costumes.
Talked to him.
I didn't take a man.
Yeah Dude.
I,</v>

2158
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:49.060
well I show up for planes high,
but I don't bring anything on me.

2159
01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:50.830
But when we were in Australia,

2160
01:58:50.831 --> 01:58:54.010
I ate a cookie right before we left for the airport.

2161
01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:55.640
So by the time we got for the airport,
I'm,

2162
01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:58.690
I'm giving this lady my passport and she's telling me that it doesn't look

2163
01:58:58.691 --> 01:59:02.040
anything like me.
You're believing her.
She's just some

2164
01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:08.050
dumb,
dumb,
dumb.
I was like,

2165
01:59:08.290 --> 01:59:09.880
it was one of those things where were talking to somebody like,

2166
01:59:09.881 --> 01:59:12.880
I can't believe I'm forced to have a conversation with you and you're in some

2167
01:59:12.881 --> 01:59:15.810
sort of position of power,
you know?
I go,
that's amazing.
She goes,

2168
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:18.130
doesn't look anything like you.
I go,
what the,
what are you talking about?
I go,

2169
01:59:18.131 --> 01:59:22.030
that's me.
I'm smiling in that page.
See that's me.
I got a big smile.

2170
01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:25.260
It's just like she's sick.
She had like,

2171
01:59:25.261 --> 01:59:28.090
why are you shaking your heads cause this isn't me.
Like what are you saying?

2172
01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:33.130
I got it like ambivalent,
like this is ridiculous.
She do.
She was questioning me.

2173
01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:35.830
I was like,
oh my God lady.
I've been here for three days.

2174
01:59:35.831 --> 01:59:39.820
I worked for the ultimate fighting championship.
I'm going,
Oh wow,
the fuck.

2175
01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:44.500
Oh Wow.
Crazy Australian broad.
They're all crazy.
Oh they are.

2176
01:59:44.501 --> 01:59:48.850
But at least you know they let Canada and Canada like,
no,

2177
01:59:48.851 --> 01:59:50.240
you cut a fart in high school.

2178
01:59:53.150 --> 01:59:57.550
You did anything fucked up.
Even if what you did was like exonerate,

2179
01:59:57.551 --> 02:00:00.190
you were exonerated from,
you're still getting pulled into a room.

2180
02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:03.880
Eddie Bravo can't go to Canada without getting pulled into a room because he got

2181
02:00:03.881 --> 02:00:07.330
a gun charge that was legal.
He had a gun on him.
He was legally,

2182
02:00:07.331 --> 02:00:08.860
he's working for a check cashing company,

2183
02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:10.390
carrying around a ton of cash with them.

2184
02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:14.020
He got pulled over for a traffic violation and he informed the officer,

2185
02:00:14.021 --> 02:00:17.800
I have a go a loaded gun in the car.
Sit.
Thank you.
Step out.
Why do you need this?

2186
02:00:17.801 --> 02:00:19.480
They,
they handcuff him.
They put him in the car.

2187
02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:21.490
I worked for check cashing company.
Um,

2188
02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:23.560
I have to carry a gun and carry large amounts of cash.

2189
02:00:23.710 --> 02:00:27.270
They check up at the store.
Okay,
you're all set.
Here's your gun.
Free to go.

2190
02:00:27.310 --> 02:00:30.550
But it's still on his record.
So every time we go to Canada,

2191
02:00:30.551 --> 02:00:34.420
he gets pulled over into a fucking room and they grill him.
That's nuts.
Yeah.

2192
02:00:34.421 --> 02:00:38.260
They don't fuck around.
And Canada son,
what are you doing?

2193
02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:45.940
He went shrines in another place.
Brian.
Strange.

2194
02:00:45.941 --> 02:00:48.940
Brian today probably.
Why I you to show for it as well.
To be a part of it.

2195
02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:51.520
I'm a scanner.
I just ate.

2196
02:00:51.521 --> 02:00:54.770
There's no reason I need to reset my body before I go back and see that.
Yeah,

2197
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:57.340
it's good to take time off,
bro.
You learned something.

2198
02:00:57.341 --> 02:01:01.540
You had a crazy trip and everybody who says that you don't learn anything and

2199
02:01:01.541 --> 02:01:05.440
it's just like,
fuck you.
I start.
I'm so tired of that argument,
man.

2200
02:01:05.441 --> 02:01:07.600
It's online all the time.
Like,
you know,
what were you thinking?

2201
02:01:07.601 --> 02:01:11.350
Just frying your brain.
You are definitely haven't done it.
Here's what I think.

2202
02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:15.490
I don't feel that there's a connection to a higher power.
I thought that,

2203
02:01:15.491 --> 02:01:17.590
but I learned stuff about myself and what was going to be happy.

2204
02:01:17.591 --> 02:01:20.590
I see myself and my place in the world clearly,
right and the most,

2205
02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:23.860
the more that I could hold onto and take back with me,
the better it is for me.

2206
02:01:23.890 --> 02:01:27.730
Well,
the idea is that that is the higher power.
The higher power is realization.

2207
02:01:27.731 --> 02:01:28.960
The higher power is understanding.

2208
02:01:28.961 --> 02:01:33.430
The higher power is a stage of enlightenment that you can achieve while under

2209
02:01:33.431 --> 02:01:37.870
the spell of the mushroom that you don't normally have.
Oh God.

2210
02:01:37.871 --> 02:01:38.704
It's a higher,

2211
02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:42.680
we're going deeper and deeper connects you more and more to the truth and more

2212
02:01:42.681 --> 02:01:46.190
and more to the love and that what you're getting out of it by getting a fresh

2213
02:01:46.191 --> 02:01:49.690
perspective on yourself and dissolving your ego and you know,
you feel this,

2214
02:01:49.691 --> 02:01:51.110
the connection of love and everything.

2215
02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:55.700
W W what it's supposed to be is you connecting to the Gaia,
to mother earth,

2216
02:01:55.701 --> 02:01:59.330
to the true love of the universe and then coming back to reality and have

2217
02:01:59.331 --> 02:02:02.600
something to sort of learn from and have something to sort of like,
you know,

2218
02:02:02.601 --> 02:02:03.434
look at your life.

2219
02:02:03.450 --> 02:02:06.920
That is the idea of her sitting in my car and thinking there's no reason.

2220
02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:10.070
I don't tell people like other comedians will say that I like something to do,

2221
02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:12.580
just show my support instead of keeping it quiet and only say,
yeah,

2222
02:02:12.590 --> 02:02:13.800
this is messed up.
Just tell.

2223
02:02:13.940 --> 02:02:16.760
I remember writing a letter to Chris Fairbanks saying you have a really

2224
02:02:16.761 --> 02:02:19.350
interesting delivery style and it's cool that it works like that.

2225
02:02:19.351 --> 02:02:22.190
It's like technically that's awesome.
That's cool.
You just said thank you.

2226
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:25.670
I really appreciate that and that's,
that's like why wouldn't I be doing that?

2227
02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:29.310
Why would I be at holding myself back from doing that shit for so long?
Yeah.

2228
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:33.290
I love when you know you're not supposed to say it,

2229
02:02:33.291 --> 02:02:36.980
but I love when I get emails from like comics that I respect and I say they saw

2230
02:02:36.981 --> 02:02:40.220
something.
It's like,
you know,
like if Stan Hope,
we'll say send me some email.

2231
02:02:40.221 --> 02:02:42.510
And he saw something that I didn't love it and I'm like,
wow,

2232
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:46.730
it sits a nice feeling.
And I do it all the time.
I really had me going.

2233
02:02:46.850 --> 02:02:49.740
I do that all the time,
especially in person.
I love to do that in person.

2234
02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:52.760
You See Guy Light Up,
you know?
And you tell him like,
God damn,

2235
02:02:52.761 --> 02:02:56.040
that bit you did was awesome.
Right off you get off.
Yeah,

2236
02:02:56.780 --> 02:03:00.020
I remember that by the way.
Yes you are after that.
But I've got to,
well,

2237
02:03:00.021 --> 02:03:02.810
even when they,
I mean whenever you tell them it doesn't matter,
just tell him.

2238
02:03:03.050 --> 02:03:06.200
Yeah man.
You know it's,
it's all hippy bullshit.
Everybody,

2239
02:03:06.201 --> 02:03:10.580
you know who'd be bullshit spreading all that.
Love you.
Queers go soldiers.

2240
02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:14.270
Doug's was the way to do talk that way.
If you have that,

2241
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:18.290
why are you so unhappy?
So I'll be unhappy.
There's a lot of dudes are insecure,

2242
02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:21.530
they're insecure and they're struggling and they don't have what they want.

2243
02:03:21.531 --> 02:03:24.260
And when you're in a state where you don't have what you want and you haven't

2244
02:03:24.261 --> 02:03:27.350
achieved what you want,
you're in this constant state of unease.

2245
02:03:27.650 --> 02:03:30.380
And when you see people who are at ease,
there's a tendency,

2246
02:03:30.381 --> 02:03:31.710
a natural tendency that I've,
I've,

2247
02:03:31.740 --> 02:03:36.220
I've experienced myself to shit on those people to shit on these people and all

2248
02:03:36.221 --> 02:03:39.710
these fucking asshole what you think cause you fucking,
you got some money,

2249
02:03:39.711 --> 02:03:44.310
you're better than me.
You know the,
there's a tendency to like,
oh yeah,

2250
02:03:44.590 --> 02:03:47.850
you're a fucking materialists.
You have great,
like your real deep,
yeah.

2251
02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:51.470
There's important things in life other than you know your career or your life

2252
02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:55.610
and they want to say this just because they,
they're in a position of unease.

2253
02:03:56.630 --> 02:04:00.710
It's like hitting a,
the Kardashians.
Yeah.
It's hard to like anything man.

2254
02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.530
It's all,
a lot of people have a hard time liking things.
Yeah.

2255
02:04:03.570 --> 02:04:05.750
They have a hard time enjoying things because they don't like themselves.

2256
02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:08.480
Even if you're not until gravity,
you can like lots of stuff and we'd be like,

2257
02:04:08.481 --> 02:04:09.640
that was awesome that it's,

2258
02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:11.920
some pitcher can be terrible but could throw one good picture.

2259
02:04:11.970 --> 02:04:15.500
The game get lit up a 14 rods,
but one fucking beautiful pitch.

2260
02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:18.750
You could appreciate that one pitch.
I don't know what the fuck are you can,

2261
02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:20.690
you can see the positives and everything.

2262
02:04:21.110 --> 02:04:22.900
You don't have to everything just because they're more successful.

2263
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:24.370
You don't have to hate them.
You know,

2264
02:04:24.410 --> 02:04:29.410
I deal with a lot of these message boards and especially for mixed martial arts

2265
02:04:29.481 --> 02:04:34.481
and disrespected these guys show to fighters and you know that are doing the

2266
02:04:34.590 --> 02:04:38.040
most dangerous and most fucked up job in the world.

2267
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:42.480
The riskiest job outside of being a soldier or a cop or a fire percent.

2268
02:04:42.481 --> 02:04:43.680
Someone who actually risk their life.

2269
02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:48.570
The next riskiest job is probably being a mixed martial arts fighter.

2270
02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:51.780
It's,
there's very little chance you're going to have a good future.

2271
02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:54.900
There's a real high chance you're going to get badly,
badly injured.

2272
02:04:54.901 --> 02:04:56.480
You may never make a lot of money.
Yeah,

2273
02:04:56.500 --> 02:04:59.730
you're going to have knee reconstructions.
Everybody has broken hands,

2274
02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:03.450
everybody has this always shit.
It's going to go along and if you do it right,

2275
02:05:03.451 --> 02:05:06.320
you can get glory and you can get to,
you know,

2276
02:05:06.321 --> 02:05:10.260
a great financial place and you can,
but it's risky as fuck.

2277
02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:13.500
And I think that people,
oh,
the people who are fans,

2278
02:05:13.650 --> 02:05:15.960
all those people who are out there doing it and trying it,

2279
02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:18.630
you owe them your respect.
Some level of respect.

2280
02:05:18.690 --> 02:05:22.110
When you see something a very high level,
a lot of times it's like,
well you know,

2281
02:05:22.111 --> 02:05:23.760
you say he didn't have a good style.

2282
02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:28.250
You say he didn't fight well it wasn't a good fight.
But to call them like these,

2283
02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:32.640
these,
these things that they say on these forums like that people,

2284
02:05:32.670 --> 02:05:35.790
they get so fucking salting of fighters and shit all over,

2285
02:05:35.791 --> 02:05:39.210
all their performances.
It's like,
man,
guys cancel each other.

2286
02:05:39.211 --> 02:05:42.260
Alec people are shitting all over.
Tiago Alvarez like Chicago was like,
Shit,

2287
02:05:42.270 --> 02:05:45.600
couldn't pull the trigger.
[inaudible] Rick story's a beast.
Man.

2288
02:05:45.620 --> 02:05:48.240
That kid's a gorilla.
That kid jumped all over.

2289
02:05:48.241 --> 02:05:52.140
Tiago need the fuck out of his legs,
didn't give him any inches,
any room.

2290
02:05:52.170 --> 02:05:55.350
Instead of saying Taco sucks,
how good is that restoring?

2291
02:05:55.710 --> 02:05:58.500
And it was a good stories a boy.
And can you just hold on?

2292
02:05:58.501 --> 02:06:00.840
So he's putting me to sleep.
You're crazy.
It's,

2293
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:04.800
they're balancing themselves out because both guys are awesome as fuck.

2294
02:06:04.801 --> 02:06:08.010
They're canceling each other out rather cause Tiago,
Elvis is awesome.

2295
02:06:08.011 --> 02:06:11.400
He's a bad motherfucker.
And this Rick story's a bad motherfucker too.

2296
02:06:11.490 --> 02:06:13.680
And when you put the two of them together,
sometimes it's,

2297
02:06:13.681 --> 02:06:16.860
it takes a long time for something to happen because they're defending and

2298
02:06:16.861 --> 02:06:20.250
canceling each other out and they're throwing bombs at each other and both of

2299
02:06:20.251 --> 02:06:23.250
them or cover up well covering up.
Well,
you know,
it's,
it's,

2300
02:06:23.251 --> 02:06:25.260
they're well matched when they're well matched.

2301
02:06:25.261 --> 02:06:29.610
It makes for a really difficult fight for one guy to get the upper hand.

2302
02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:32.520
So people get so disrespectful.

2303
02:06:32.670 --> 02:06:36.870
And so like unappreciative of of the efforts of what these fucking guys go

2304
02:06:36.871 --> 02:06:40.530
through,
they did it.
We can't even wrap our heads around what they have to do.

2305
02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:44.600
They dedicate like six,
eight weeks of their life,
a minimum training,

2306
02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.650
training all day,
every fucking day.
I say the training videos,
I'm like,

2307
02:06:49.820 --> 02:06:52.830
oh,
I never want to do any of that every day.

2308
02:06:52.890 --> 02:06:57.030
And just people probably are 11 years old.
You know,
some of them,

2309
02:06:57.780 --> 02:07:00.530
you get these people and you're like,
oh,
we forget you had a guy's private.

2310
02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:01.550
We know it's a lot sadder.

2311
02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:05.370
Some of them are in their forties there's still just a bunch of mean cunts.

2312
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:08.580
Talking Shit about something like that online.
It's like,
yeah,

2313
02:07:09.450 --> 02:07:12.510
well I think people are learning how to navigate online.
I think there's,

2314
02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:14.730
there's more negativity than ever online,

2315
02:07:14.731 --> 02:07:17.580
but I think that's because there's more people online than ever.

2316
02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:21.960
There's places where you can find where you can minimize your negativity,

2317
02:07:21.961 --> 02:07:23.070
like your Twitter account.

2318
02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:26.400
You can easily minimize the negativity on your Twitter page,
like block.

2319
02:07:26.401 --> 02:07:28.110
And people are constantly do that.
I very,

2320
02:07:28.140 --> 02:07:30.860
very rarely will argue with anyone on Twitter and I just,

2321
02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:33.150
when you say something Conti,
what am I gonna defend myself?

2322
02:07:33.151 --> 02:07:36.040
I just block you or I retweet what you said so

2323
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:39.370
<v 0>that everybody else knows what kind of a con you are loving.
And I block you.</v>

2324
02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:42.010
If if they say something where they're just questioning something,

2325
02:07:42.011 --> 02:07:44.200
I thought that it,
that's okay.
Just say it nicely,
but when you're like,

2326
02:07:44.201 --> 02:07:46.630
you fucking idiot moron.
It's like,
shut up.

2327
02:07:46.810 --> 02:07:49.540
I know there's so many videos like an NPR today on the way over here,

2328
02:07:49.570 --> 02:07:52.870
they were talking about this guy wrote some book about how the way you act

2329
02:07:52.871 --> 02:07:56.310
online will bleed into your real life.
Oh,
for sure.
If you're constantly like,

2330
02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:00.130
you fucking loser,
idiot,
kill yourself.
There's video's terrible.
Fuck you.

2331
02:08:00.430 --> 02:08:03.310
Like you take that with you to work the next day and you're more negative.

2332
02:08:03.370 --> 02:08:04.750
Not all of it,
but some level.

2333
02:08:04.751 --> 02:08:07.570
You and Wayne were negative with your coworkers and stuff and your friends

2334
02:08:07.630 --> 02:08:10.930
totally makes sense.
You know it's,
you can't just get away with that it,

2335
02:08:10.931 --> 02:08:13.900
there's this energy connected to all that negativity you're pumping out and it's

2336
02:08:13.901 --> 02:08:16.660
going to come back around again.
It sounds like hippie bullshit,

2337
02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:21.400
but it's proven to be reality 35 okay.

2338
02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:24.490
They have great lives.
They're stressful lives.
There'll be a hippie.

2339
02:08:24.491 --> 02:08:25.540
It's not the worst thing in the world.

2340
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.340
<v 3>New Challenge for you.
Hiring,</v>

2341
02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:30.830
talking about every time you see a flower that you have to smell it.

2342
02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:35.450
Every time I see a flower that's going to be so hard.
That's ridiculous.
Or rose?

2343
02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:40.480
No,
I would still have to florists and every corner in La.

2344
02:08:40.580 --> 02:08:42.700
I've been doing it for like the last couple of months.
Yeah,

2345
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:46.100
and it's so embarrassing the other days and dude was like skateboarding and I'm

2346
02:08:46.101 --> 02:08:49.010
like,
Oh fuck,
I'm walking by this.
Whereas I have to stop and smell this flower,

2347
02:08:49.011 --> 02:08:51.710
but there's this kid skateboarding coming towards me.
It's just stop.

2348
02:08:51.711 --> 02:08:56.150
It smelled like,
why are you forcing yourself to do it?

2349
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:59.630
Whether you like it or not because it's good.
It's good.
It smells great.

2350
02:08:59.631 --> 02:09:01.970
It's good to tell yourself not to be embarrassed about the skateboard or just go

2351
02:09:01.971 --> 02:09:04.970
ahead and spell it if you want.
Sounds good.
Brian,
I'm bringing you a doctorate.

2352
02:09:04.971 --> 02:09:08.480
I'm convinced there's something really wrong with your major psychological

2353
02:09:09.530 --> 02:09:12.470
damage.
You're like,
uh,
I don't know.
There's something up there.
You don't.

2354
02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:15.890
You don't see anything awesome about stopping and smelling a flower every now

2355
02:09:15.891 --> 02:09:18.500
and then,
but don't let it fucking old Jeff.
Don't be late for work.

2356
02:09:19.070 --> 02:09:22.920
Make you miss your flight.
So many flows up to keep putting one.

2357
02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:27.260
No,
no.
I'm saying when you're walking,
if you walk by when smell one.

2358
02:09:27.261 --> 02:09:29.840
But it's great.
I,
I've been doing it for awhile and I love it now.

2359
02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:31.580
Fucking good shit.

2360
02:09:31.930 --> 02:09:36.520
<v 0>Or you had a,
a freak out when you were at Brian's place.
Yeah.
Oh,
here's another,</v>

2361
02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:39.850
because I did have a freak out.
I would say,
if you're going to do psychedelics,

2362
02:09:39.851 --> 02:09:44.620
make sure you are around people that you trust people that will help you.

2363
02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:47.230
Um,
don't want to put yourself in a bad environment.

2364
02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:48.921
<v 3>Don't do it.</v>

2365
02:09:48.921 --> 02:09:52.580
Live on a podcast when you're jammed into our room with five other people.

2366
02:09:52.581 --> 02:09:53.414
Probably either.

2367
02:09:54.330 --> 02:09:57.630
<v 0>Maybe.
Yeah.
So the idea was you guys were going to,</v>

2368
02:09:57.631 --> 02:10:00.480
you were going to do it on a podcast live.
You're going to do Salvia,

2369
02:10:00.481 --> 02:10:02.370
which is still legal,
right?
It's illegal in California.

2370
02:10:02.820 --> 02:10:06.140
So we weren't doing anything wrong folks.
So you decided to do,
isn't that crazy?

2371
02:10:06.141 --> 02:10:09.030
It's Salvia is legal by the way.
This shit.
Anyway,
so you're doing Salvia,

2372
02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:13.080
you're doing it live on the air and then you have a little spazz out.

2373
02:10:14.090 --> 02:10:17.640
The problem is here's the deal and I will say this,
I can't stress enough.
Really,

2374
02:10:17.641 --> 02:10:20.460
you need to trust your friends because I s I would watch Brian fuck with

2375
02:10:20.461 --> 02:10:21.450
everybody else.
It was doing,

2376
02:10:21.451 --> 02:10:24.900
it shall farts right in their face and tell the girl she had her boobs out and

2377
02:10:24.901 --> 02:10:27.750
make her feel self conscious and it's like fine,
don't stop doing that.

2378
02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:31.230
You don't like they're fucked up like acid and mushrooms and Salvia,

2379
02:10:31.410 --> 02:10:34.190
they don't need anybody's help.
Right.
Work.
Right.
They will work

2380
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:37.640
<v 5>on their own chemicals.
Right.
So every time he started pulling at me,</v>

2381
02:10:37.641 --> 02:10:39.230
I knew he was fucking with me in some way.

2382
02:10:39.470 --> 02:10:44.200
But in my weird a world where I barely had a grasp on reality where I'm like,
no,

2383
02:10:44.201 --> 02:10:46.220
no,
if you pull me over there,
that's where I'll die.

2384
02:10:46.221 --> 02:10:47.690
And I know you're not trying to pull me over there,

2385
02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:51.700
but I'm going to drown to death for the sake of your little game.
What?
Yep.

2386
02:10:51.701 --> 02:10:52.880
Cause you don't know where you are.

2387
02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:56.600
I have in a different planet where the rules of physics of the gravity and the

2388
02:10:56.601 --> 02:11:00.410
time and meanwhile Brian is pulling you through me and I think he's fucking with

2389
02:11:00.411 --> 02:11:02.840
her for first.
Let's,
let's,
let's rewind here.

2390
02:11:02.841 --> 02:11:04.940
We had two other people do it on this podcast,

2391
02:11:04.941 --> 02:11:08.540
which is the 90 shock probably guys and the first person we see hang.
And again,

2392
02:11:08.541 --> 02:11:12.700
I did not fuck with either of these people while they were doing,
you know,

2393
02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:15.950
after it,
after it was done and they came out of it,

2394
02:11:15.951 --> 02:11:19.130
we kind of fucked around but they were back into consciousness.
You shoved,

2395
02:11:19.131 --> 02:11:22.820
this is not one that fart spray,
um,
fleshlight into his face.

2396
02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:27.060
He was not,
he was shoved it out of your face while you were under two?
No.

2397
02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:29.930
All right.
That's another thing.
I didn't see it.
If you watch,
yeah,

2398
02:11:29.931 --> 02:11:32.690
if you watch the video,
it was behind his bag and it was only for the cameras.

2399
02:11:32.691 --> 02:11:37.430
It wasn't for our buck is hearing you say stuff like this so that it's like now

2400
02:11:37.431 --> 02:11:40.940
I'm always like,
are you guys fucking with me or is my reality changing it?

2401
02:11:40.941 --> 02:11:43.850
If I see something,
if I see,
let's say I did see that drapes becoming waterfall.

2402
02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:46.760
Right.
I want to know something's fucking with him.
Like I want to know.

2403
02:11:46.761 --> 02:11:49.160
That's probably not the case.
If he now watching this video,

2404
02:11:49.170 --> 02:11:52.670
you realized I wasn't fucking with you at all.
No,
you were just like mill.

2405
02:11:52.671 --> 02:11:55.160
It looks on the screen behind me.
All right.

2406
02:11:55.161 --> 02:11:57.740
The screen behind you was behind you so you couldn't even see it.

2407
02:11:57.800 --> 02:11:59.630
I could turn this far.
It's like you didn't,

2408
02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:03.180
but you were trying to do the same thing to Alison.
I saw you.
Fuck.
Sorry.

2409
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:08.090
What I was doing was not that.
Alright.
What I was doing was not fucking with you.

2410
02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:12.830
It was Ford,
the video viewers of the show that the TV was behind you.

2411
02:12:12.831 --> 02:12:15.980
You couldn't even see the TV.
Yeah.
Uh,
okay.

2412
02:12:16.070 --> 02:12:21.070
Do you think that possibly misconstrued what you took us to the UFC before you

2413
02:12:22.011 --> 02:12:24.050
even start shipping?
He couldn't see when I was doing,

2414
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:26.960
before I even start tripping people.

2415
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:29.360
There's certain types of people and that's okay.
It's just who you are.

2416
02:12:29.570 --> 02:12:34.540
We'll like to do things like this,
which you did.
And Mike Bryan,

2417
02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:37.350
I know I'm not trying to get,
and you keep trying and I was like,
that's annoying.

2418
02:12:37.620 --> 02:12:39.710
Hey sooner I will cherry talk.
Brian,

2419
02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:41.930
you got to let them talk because you can't know exactly he's talking about

2420
02:12:41.931 --> 02:12:46.470
because you can't interrupt this.
This is Brian.
This site,
people listening,
right?

2421
02:12:46.490 --> 02:12:46.850
Container.

2422
02:12:46.850 --> 02:12:49.580
I don't want anyone to do that because soon I will be tripping and I want to

2423
02:12:49.581 --> 02:12:51.140
know,
oh,
that's me tripping.

2424
02:12:51.141 --> 02:12:55.130
I want to trust that I'm losing my reality now and not someone's fucking with me

2425
02:12:55.131 --> 02:12:58.580
and making me think.
What did we made?
Cycle Patty.
Thanks.
She was on something.

2426
02:12:58.790 --> 02:13:00.110
She didn't think she was on anything.

2427
02:13:00.111 --> 02:13:02.450
We make her think she was tripping or whatever it was.

2428
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:06.200
We didn't fuck with her trip.
Okay.
All right.
This is what I told you last time.

2429
02:13:06.201 --> 02:13:08.250
You said this when we did,
uh,
when you're,

2430
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:11.270
what you're talking about where I was talking like this.
All right.

2431
02:13:11.271 --> 02:13:16.271
This is two people having fine out at a UFC and you did acid and it's not me

2432
02:13:16.401 --> 02:13:18.470
fucking with you when I go,
oh,
are you fueling it?

2433
02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:22.040
It's me just joking around with you as a friend would do if we weren't even on

2434
02:13:22.041 --> 02:13:26.810
acid.
Right?
Right.
I'm not sitting here going,
I'm going to fucking ruin this trip.

2435
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:29.900
Ooh Girl,

2436
02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:32.070
who you are so to you

2437
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:34.620
<v 2>haven't done anything wrong.
Do you understand how this is coming?</v>

2438
02:13:34.970 --> 02:13:36.130
<v 3>You're a test that you think,</v>

2439
02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:40.260
<v 2>well,
I'm not saying you did.
I have not said you did once,</v>

2440
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:44.100
but I'm saying you are so attached to that.
You are so defending it.

2441
02:13:44.250 --> 02:13:46.770
You can't say,
yeah,
maybe I shouldn't have been saying that.

2442
02:13:46.771 --> 02:13:49.710
If it was annoying to you while you were trying to like trip out on acid,

2443
02:13:49.711 --> 02:13:51.660
maybe it wasn't noisy.
I didn't mean to be,

2444
02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:54.730
<v 3>but you're not listening.
What happened?
I know what happened when Alison was,</v>

2445
02:13:55.090 --> 02:13:58.270
Alison was under and you kept or was there something weird and you kept saying,

2446
02:13:58.750 --> 02:14:00.990
Oh,
you had your boobs out.
You said it a few times.
Alison was,

2447
02:14:01.090 --> 02:14:04.540
Alison was an under,
you know that right?
She never point.
We never went under.

2448
02:14:04.630 --> 02:14:05.630
I know she didn't want another,

2449
02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:09.260
cause he was sitting there talking to us the whole time.
You so she faked it.
No,

2450
02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:13.600
she,
when you're in Salvia you either go under or you're feeling fucking crazy.

2451
02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:17.930
Right.
Already went to a different rural.
That's what Alison did it do.

2452
02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:21.230
<v 2>I don't get what you're defending.
So she was going fucking crazy.</v>

2453
02:14:21.231 --> 02:14:23.030
And you're telling her tits were out so that's okay.

2454
02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:25.440
<v 3>No,
no.
We're all sitting in there talking to her back and forth.</v>

2455
02:14:25.441 --> 02:14:26.610
She was making sense.

2456
02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:29.640
She was not out of her mind and we're talking about who later was that she was

2457
02:14:29.641 --> 02:14:30.600
still tripping out.
Balls

2458
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:37.800
talk good when you're fucked up on psychedelics and still be fucked up though.

2459
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:40.360
She knew where she was is what I'm saying.
She did not fall

2460
02:14:41.980 --> 02:14:45.240
because he knows that you're not going to Barf ever.
Like,
no,

2461
02:14:45.241 --> 02:14:47.580
you're not going to Barf.
And I was like,
it's a trip.
I was like,

2462
02:14:47.610 --> 02:14:50.310
I wouldn't sit right there if I were you.
But I was freaking out.

2463
02:14:50.370 --> 02:14:52.860
I felt like I was going to Barf and I was toppling over,
but I was still,

2464
02:14:53.150 --> 02:14:56.740
and he was telling me,
he was telling you,
you're not going to get barf.

2465
02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:57.810
Who'd got you a trashcan?

2466
02:14:57.830 --> 02:15:00.480
Who is doing all this stuff to you but you still think I attacked you somehow

2467
02:15:00.481 --> 02:15:03.360
when you did your salary?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And beforehand too.

2468
02:15:04.110 --> 02:15:06.600
I see you fucking with people.
That's okay.
And then,

2469
02:15:06.610 --> 02:15:10.290
and then when we did acid one time you thought I was fucking maybe and just

2470
02:15:10.291 --> 02:15:13.860
because I was like,
hey,
go you fucking with you.

2471
02:15:13.890 --> 02:15:15.270
But I had to fully tell you what somebody like Brian,

2472
02:15:15.300 --> 02:15:17.880
why do you always think I'm a fucking with you?
You'd like to do that.

2473
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:19.500
That's just why is that in your head?

2474
02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:21.650
<v 2>You think?
Well maybe we Brian,
Brian,
Brian.</v>

2475
02:15:21.651 --> 02:15:23.960
Do you not understand that maybe the way you play around,

2476
02:15:23.961 --> 02:15:25.610
even though I know you're just playing around,

2477
02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.440
it might not be fun for other people.

2478
02:15:29.010 --> 02:15:29.880
<v 3>Yes,
but if,</v>

2479
02:15:30.270 --> 02:15:33.240
but what I'm saying is what he's talking about when he was doing acid,

2480
02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:37.530
we were walking at a UFC.
Ryan,
hold on,
hold on,
hold on.
Hold on,
hold on,
hold on,

2481
02:15:37.531 --> 02:15:38.364
hold on.
Hello.

2482
02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:43.500
<v 2>You are explaining the reason why you did things and you are saying that you did</v>

2483
02:15:44.101 --> 02:15:48.150
it just as a friend and you are completely discounting his experience with what

2484
02:15:48.151 --> 02:15:51.470
you were doing and that what you were doing was annoying to his response was

2485
02:15:51.471 --> 02:15:55.500
saying that you were doing it all from a good place,
a place of a friend,

2486
02:15:55.501 --> 02:15:57.660
a place of playing around so he shouldn't be upset.

2487
02:15:57.810 --> 02:15:59.940
But what he's saying is your what?

2488
02:15:59.941 --> 02:16:03.900
Your actions are directly making him feel like shit and you're not coming to

2489
02:16:03.901 --> 02:16:04.180
grips.

2490
02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:07.840
<v 3>I see what you're saying.
But your officer,
did he hear what his response was?
Hey,</v>

2491
02:16:07.841 --> 02:16:10.750
I'm not tripping.
And I was like,
oh no,
we're just fucking around.

2492
02:16:10.751 --> 02:16:13.230
We're walking to the bathroom.
He wasn't work.

2493
02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:17.800
I'm not sitting here making voices to Ari that's sitting there going,
wow,

2494
02:16:17.910 --> 02:16:22.000
I am fucked up.
We're walking to the bathroom at a UFC.
I understand Brian.

2495
02:16:22.030 --> 02:16:22.870
I know all I'm saying.

2496
02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:26.480
<v 2>Okay.
What he said.
What?
Brian,</v>

2497
02:16:26.481 --> 02:16:30.070
you have a real hard time with other people agreeing with you and

2498
02:16:30.910 --> 02:16:33.310
<v 0>a bunch of different examples of you fucking with people.
All right.</v>

2499
02:16:33.311 --> 02:16:36.340
What's another one,
Brian,
you don't feel bad for your actions,
man.

2500
02:16:36.341 --> 02:16:37.870
You don't feel bad for making some money.

2501
02:16:37.871 --> 02:16:40.780
You're making me feel bad about something that,
that that didn't exist.

2502
02:16:40.781 --> 02:16:44.920
We're walking to the bathroom both and he's not trying to make you feel bad

2503
02:16:44.921 --> 02:16:48.130
about that.
I'm making you feel about about defending it relentlessly.

2504
02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:52.810
The action itself was no big deal and it is a big deal to him.

2505
02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:54.210
He said that you were ignoring him,

2506
02:16:54.730 --> 02:16:57.240
you and relate to him and then when he was tripping you would knowing your

2507
02:16:57.241 --> 02:16:57.750
morning.

2508
02:16:57.750 --> 02:17:00.250
<v 5>Okay,
got it.
But I've got it.
All right.
Was that the only thing I did that night?</v>

2509
02:17:00.251 --> 02:17:03.400
Yes.
Right.
Oh,
I know later in the night I had to tell you like Brian,

2510
02:17:03.730 --> 02:17:06.740
what do they do?
Okay.
Later on then I had to tell me where I tell you,
Brian,

2511
02:17:06.741 --> 02:17:09.460
seriously,
I need your help right now.
I can't have you fucking with me.

2512
02:17:09.461 --> 02:17:11.620
I need you to be protective of me instead of fucking with I know,

2513
02:17:11.621 --> 02:17:13.330
but I wasn't doing anything when he said that.

2514
02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:15.400
You just said that when we're sitting there at the UFC,

2515
02:17:15.401 --> 02:17:17.240
do you remember that were on our way out?
Yeah,

2516
02:17:17.241 --> 02:17:19.690
we're towards the outside but I wasn't doing anything.

2517
02:17:19.691 --> 02:17:23.440
When you said that you were just telling me to not fuck with you,
right,

2518
02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:27.460
cause you were talking weird before.
No,
I wasn't.
Okay.
Anyway,
see Hong,

2519
02:17:27.461 --> 02:17:31.540
when you put the spark sprained his foes,
he wasn't.
He wasn't.
He was.

2520
02:17:31.541 --> 02:17:33.520
We found out later that he was hung up on it later,

2521
02:17:33.521 --> 02:17:36.550
that every time he gets to wait three minutes,
they were like still super bomb.

2522
02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:38.740
Now you couldn't have known that fine.
We all thought they were fine,

2523
02:17:38.890 --> 02:17:40.540
but you were fucking with them.
That's what you'd like to do.

2524
02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:45.700
You put that fart spray on people's faces like the read the in space or did he

2525
02:17:45.701 --> 02:17:48.250
open it up?
I don't remember.
You just shoved it right in his face.

2526
02:17:48.251 --> 02:17:50.530
It was only a second layer to it and I did.
I open it.
I'm going to see it.

2527
02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:52.590
You just open it up and shoved his face.
He didn't even talk.

2528
02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:55.890
There was no like smell out there and just,
I didn't remember that.
Okay.

2529
02:17:56.230 --> 02:17:58.810
It's all on there.
But with the Ari with that,
that whole thing,

2530
02:17:58.870 --> 02:18:02.140
that last time when,
when when I was talking funny and stuff like that,

2531
02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:06.310
that was not me fucking with you.
And I know,
I know you said that at that time,

2532
02:18:06.311 --> 02:18:08.800
but that really upset me because what we were doing,

2533
02:18:08.801 --> 02:18:13.090
we were just walking to go to the bathroom and we were conversating and I just

2534
02:18:13.091 --> 02:18:16.570
said our seats those one time we're sitting our seats and you're like,
no,
it was,

2535
02:18:16.571 --> 02:18:20.020
we were walking to the bathroom.
I was like,
Brian,
stop it.
Please integrate.

2536
02:18:20.140 --> 02:18:23.800
I'm not doing anything.
I'm like Brian or joking.
Yeah,
but it's like,

2537
02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:29.080
it was kind of ruining my truck.
But Ari,
you weren't tripping yet,
remember?

2538
02:18:29.170 --> 02:18:31.330
I know,
but you want to know what's,
no,
but I know,

2539
02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:35.350
I saw you sitting there tripping and it wasn't just 10 minutes after you took

2540
02:18:35.351 --> 02:18:37.000
acid and went and do that.

2541
02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:39.910
This is what I'm trying to tell you is it wasn't really attack.

2542
02:18:40.130 --> 02:18:41.780
<v 0>I understand that,
but you did do it and it did it.</v>

2543
02:18:41.781 --> 02:18:45.890
And when you lose your grasp on reality,
never talk in a weird voice.

2544
02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:49.720
Anytime you do any kind of real defensible

2545
02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:53.710
show,
do you understand what you attack?

2546
02:18:54.140 --> 02:18:58.940
RSS Feeds right now being attacked right now you're acting silly.

2547
02:18:58.970 --> 02:19:01.000
Okay.
No one's attacking you.
All right.

2548
02:19:01.100 --> 02:19:03.530
My point to the people out there was do not do,

2549
02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:06.680
I would not do mushrooms with someone who you might think would mess with you in

2550
02:19:06.681 --> 02:19:07.610
any way.
You look.

2551
02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:12.320
No one's saying that what you did do didn't come from a place of fun and

2552
02:19:12.321 --> 02:19:14.510
friendship and that you weren't trying to fuck with him.

2553
02:19:14.780 --> 02:19:19.100
But if someone does not want you to do that while you're doing it and you do it

2554
02:19:19.101 --> 02:19:22.160
and it bothers them and it freaks them out,
whatever you did to him,

2555
02:19:22.161 --> 02:19:23.270
I saw you grabbing him.

2556
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:26.480
I saw the video when he was fucked up and you were holding onto him and talking

2557
02:19:26.481 --> 02:19:27.290
to them.

2558
02:19:27.290 --> 02:19:29.600
I saw you pull out the flashlight and I know you were just joking around,

2559
02:19:29.601 --> 02:19:30.291
but you can,

2560
02:19:30.291 --> 02:19:33.770
you not see that even though you're doing this as a friend and just playing

2561
02:19:33.771 --> 02:19:36.980
around for the video for him while he was tripping out,

2562
02:19:37.130 --> 02:19:39.140
that might not be comfortable.
That's what I'm saying.

2563
02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:42.110
You saw the video and you're still thinking I did something wrong in that video

2564
02:19:42.170 --> 02:19:46.100
chewed.
What is wrong with you?
I'm not saying you did something wrong.

2565
02:19:46.220 --> 02:19:49.130
I'm saying you were playing around and he might not have enjoyed it.

2566
02:19:49.370 --> 02:19:50.930
Is that okay?
Is that okay?

2567
02:19:50.931 --> 02:19:53.360
That's you do things and other people don't enjoy them.

2568
02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:58.460
Can they not enjoy some things you do?
So I remember somebody once you like,

2569
02:19:58.520 --> 02:19:59.570
you're a lot of live video.

2570
02:19:59.570 --> 02:20:03.560
I was stuck on the telling everyone to shut up for saying don't talk about death

2571
02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:07.970
in,
I was fucking with them.
It didn't discount all the other shit you did.

2572
02:20:07.971 --> 02:20:08.970
And if video are,

2573
02:20:08.971 --> 02:20:13.130
he tried to stand up and I was the one that jumped to the ground to try to hold

2574
02:20:13.131 --> 02:20:15.860
him.
So he buried himself.
Thank you for that.

2575
02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:20.870
And then you start swinging and fam flailing and kicking and stay while everyone

2576
02:20:20.871 --> 02:20:21.860
was just watching.

2577
02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:26.150
I was trying to protect your legs and hand from night punching windows and

2578
02:20:26.151 --> 02:20:27.400
breaking things all around you.

2579
02:20:28.210 --> 02:20:30.680
I was in this place where I was coming back from another world,
right?

2580
02:20:30.681 --> 02:20:33.820
The Laws of physics that apply to me and I thought I was in grave danger and

2581
02:20:33.821 --> 02:20:36.560
here's this truckster who's grabbing me,
who doesn't understand?

2582
02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:38.760
I've been at my world.
I know I'm not saying that.

2583
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:42.260
I'm not saying what you thought I'm saying is that Joe's saying that I've did

2584
02:20:42.261 --> 02:20:44.810
all this stuff to you but and I have no one did anything wrong.

2585
02:20:45.380 --> 02:20:47.810
You're not even listening to what I said.
I didn't see you do anything wrong.

2586
02:20:47.811 --> 02:20:48.644
I said,
well,
you did.

2587
02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:52.490
You did out of a place of friendship and playing around and doing it for a video

2588
02:20:52.491 --> 02:20:54.200
show and you didn't do anything wrong,

2589
02:20:54.320 --> 02:20:58.580
but it sometimes things that you do that are not wrong still annoy people and

2590
02:20:58.581 --> 02:21:00.230
out of it as a general courtesy.

2591
02:21:00.350 --> 02:21:02.810
You don't do those things because other people don't like you to do them.

2592
02:21:02.811 --> 02:21:06.110
To them.
It's that.
It's that simple.
It's not that you did anything wrong.

2593
02:21:06.290 --> 02:21:09.350
It's just some people don't like you doing some shit and they're in another

2594
02:21:09.351 --> 02:21:12.640
fucking dementia.
It's like it's August drugs.
Look,

2595
02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:17.480
it's like best case scenario.
You got a smile.
Worst case scenario,

2596
02:21:17.540 --> 02:21:21.830
you've ruined this trip,
which is not the most egregious crime ruined your trip.

2597
02:21:22.400 --> 02:21:23.330
You take the chance to,

2598
02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:25.990
that trip was ruined because of you because my lack of distrust with you,

2599
02:21:26.030 --> 02:21:30.230
the Salvia,
but oh,
anyone else have to still had a great time.

2600
02:21:30.470 --> 02:21:33.440
Don't make it what you saw.
There was not a bad time,
so you're bad.

2601
02:21:33.441 --> 02:21:35.510
Trip was all my fault.
Just the last part.

2602
02:21:35.511 --> 02:21:38.930
I was trying to get you specifically Brian red band off of me because you are

2603
02:21:38.931 --> 02:21:42.440
going to play a trick on me and put me into a really dangerous position that you

2604
02:21:42.441 --> 02:21:46.040
weren't aware of.
This is me.
I think talking about money,
no grasp on reality.

2605
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:51.110
It's done well.
Obviously.
It's what it was like.

2606
02:21:51.170 --> 02:21:53.210
I don't want the trickster fucking with me right now.

2607
02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:55.460
It's very unfortunate that you had these feelings.

2608
02:21:55.490 --> 02:21:58.940
It's very unfortunate that Brian feels attacked here.
You know,

2609
02:21:58.941 --> 02:22:00.620
but I think that the [inaudible],
first of all,

2610
02:22:00.621 --> 02:22:05.270
the idea of doing this fucking crazy psychedelic drug on a podcast with a bunch

2611
02:22:05.271 --> 02:22:07.460
of Comedians,
it's ridiculous.

2612
02:22:07.461 --> 02:22:10.190
You can't get upset at Brian because here you are on a fucking,

2613
02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:14.010
the idea of what you're doing is silly beyond belief.
Guess who didn't do it?

2614
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:17.460
Because I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't put myself in that situation.
Well,

2615
02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:20.510
what I'm saying,
you keep thinking that I'm attacking you.

2616
02:22:20.511 --> 02:22:22.850
I don't think you did anything wrong.
I watched what you did.

2617
02:22:22.851 --> 02:22:23.750
I don't think you did anything wrong,

2618
02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:26.910
but you have to accept fact that even though you didn't do anything wrong,

2619
02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:29.220
you shouldn't do it.
If it freaks somebody out,

2620
02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:31.250
if it's fucking with someone's head in,

2621
02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:33.240
you know they're telling you to get the fuck off them.

2622
02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:36.090
Maybe you should get the fuck off them.
You got to leave him alone.

2623
02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:38.790
I know you weren't doing it.
The idea was ridiculous.

2624
02:22:38.850 --> 02:22:41.790
You should have never done it.
Well,
I mean,
but why not,
right?
Yeah,

2625
02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:44.430
but I'm saying it's not the perfect way to do Salvia and you're going to get

2626
02:22:44.431 --> 02:22:48.660
upset at some shit because Salvia such a mind blowing incredible reality

2627
02:22:48.661 --> 02:22:51.930
dissolving experience and the people are fucking with you and joking around with

2628
02:22:51.931 --> 02:22:55.200
you and there's a camera on you and the fucking Internet world is watching.

2629
02:22:55.470 --> 02:22:57.900
It's going to suck anyway,
man.
It's going to be fucked up there.

2630
02:22:57.940 --> 02:23:01.380
That world watching and I don't mind and it's still worth seriously what you
saw.

2631
02:23:01.381 --> 02:23:04.470
If you see that video,
that was a great trip.
I had a really good time next.

2632
02:23:04.471 --> 02:23:07.230
That was the other place I was there for months and years.

2633
02:23:07.231 --> 02:23:10.650
We're going to take you and we're going to put you in my fucking cage out in the

2634
02:23:10.651 --> 02:23:13.520
garage where you can't hurt yourself and then we're going to do,

2635
02:23:13.550 --> 02:23:17.490
we're going to Salvey you the fuck up and push you in that thing and lock it

2636
02:23:17.491 --> 02:23:21.970
down and then we're going to video tape so you can flail around and just going

2637
02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:25.880
to run in the heavy bags.
I'll be handcuffed under watering.
Just pool.
Yeah.

2638
02:23:25.890 --> 02:23:30.420
He'll be doing a David Blaine with one of those Chinese surgical masks on and it

2639
02:23:30.421 --> 02:23:33.690
just bugs me that Ra because I really didn't fuck with you and I didn't fuck

2640
02:23:33.691 --> 02:23:37.840
with you that,
that last thing,
the UFC,
I purposely did not fuck on you.

2641
02:23:38.210 --> 02:23:40.080
I think you were fucking with people,

2642
02:23:40.081 --> 02:23:41.760
but I think you were doing it for the right reasons,

2643
02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:45.810
but you want it to be funny to make money show if you're not talking right,

2644
02:23:45.811 --> 02:23:49.580
and just making those jokes.
It's like that's the joke comes from a place of,

2645
02:23:49.860 --> 02:23:54.300
wouldn't this be funny if I'm messing with Alison,
I can't speak for them,

2646
02:23:54.301 --> 02:23:55.380
but I bet you asked him both of them,

2647
02:23:55.381 --> 02:23:57.300
if I fuck with them or wearing their trip in any way,

2648
02:23:57.301 --> 02:23:58.310
they would say absolutely not.
Okay.

2649
02:23:59.020 --> 02:24:01.470
Doesn't remember you shoving a thing in his face.
That's fine.

2650
02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:06.390
But I saw you shove a fart spray thing and somebodies face while they were out

2651
02:24:06.510 --> 02:24:09.960
and I'm like,
oh,
that might happen to me when I'm out.

2652
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:14.210
If this guy who likes doing that is around.
Yeah,
it's all Weldon.

2653
02:24:14.730 --> 02:24:18.150
Earlier than that,
I put the,
he didn't do anything wrong,
Brian,

2654
02:24:18.151 --> 02:24:20.580
you didn't do anything wrong.
You're doing a whole lot of this stuff.

2655
02:24:21.290 --> 02:24:24.390
Entertainment,
not fuck with people's trips out there.
Let them have their guests.

2656
02:24:24.450 --> 02:24:27.660
But if you're going to have a fucking trip on a comedy podcasts with a bunch of

2657
02:24:27.661 --> 02:24:30.000
comedians and they're all laughing and giggling,
guess what?

2658
02:24:30.001 --> 02:24:30.990
It's going to be wonky.

2659
02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:33.840
It's going to go nutty and I don't think you can blame the comedians for fucking

2660
02:24:33.841 --> 02:24:34.170
with you.

2661
02:24:34.170 --> 02:24:38.810
And especially when an ongoing gag is our flashlight wine and cheese prank.
Okay?

2662
02:24:39.150 --> 02:24:43.260
That said,
Brian,
you,
you,
you,
you fucking lock up in a field.

2663
02:24:43.270 --> 02:24:45.120
Like make people's brains say,
okay,

2664
02:24:45.390 --> 02:24:48.630
you lock up and you don't ever considered the possibility that maybe you

2665
02:24:48.631 --> 02:24:50.400
could've done something to annoy him.
You have to,

2666
02:24:50.540 --> 02:24:54.090
you will tell you this doesn't have to be logical.
If you annoy somebody,

2667
02:24:54.091 --> 02:24:55.220
sometimes you just annoy someone.

2668
02:24:55.250 --> 02:24:58.650
You don't mean to [inaudible] there was a time at sales once where somebody,

2669
02:24:58.710 --> 02:25:00.990
some girls might even share it with somebody.
She was like,
Oh,

2670
02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:03.960
we've got a lot of layers are on overload.
It's like three layers.
I'm like,
Brian,

2671
02:25:04.290 --> 02:25:06.880
it's not a bad thing if you have layers on and you're like,
oh,

2672
02:25:08.610 --> 02:25:12.130
but it was like no one's attacking.
You don't have like deny instantly.

2673
02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:17.120
I liked to wear layers.
This layer right here feel the same.
This is how,

2674
02:25:17.130 --> 02:25:20.040
this is not a commentary on the check for ovaries tonight.
Boy,

2675
02:25:20.890 --> 02:25:23.580
which doctor [inaudible] had a question for you cause I stopped doing a Swain

2676
02:25:23.581 --> 02:25:24.280
milk recently

2677
02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:27.400
<v 4>because of all the estrogen and stuff like that.
I feel like a man again,</v>

2678
02:25:27.460 --> 02:25:30.280
almond milk have the same problems that every day.

2679
02:25:30.810 --> 02:25:34.090
Make that go amongst real good.
It's easy to adjust.
It's very easy to agenda.

2680
02:25:34.091 --> 02:25:37.870
It's really good for babies.
Babies love it.
Um,
the uh,
almond milk is delicious.

2681
02:25:37.930 --> 02:25:40.160
I use that from my,
um,
my shakes every day.

2682
02:25:40.420 --> 02:25:44.000
But don't get the shit that's flavored cause it's just sugar.
It's this,
you know,

2683
02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:46.750
you get like a vanilla.
There's nothing healthy about that.
Absolutely.

2684
02:25:47.110 --> 02:25:49.870
Make your own almond milk.
I know some do to make their own shit.

2685
02:25:49.871 --> 02:25:53.080
Supposed to be much more delicious,
but it's a huge fucking pain in the ass.

2686
02:25:53.130 --> 02:25:57.670
Cause soy milk good for you.
So yes,
it's not bad for you,
but you can get,

2687
02:25:57.671 --> 02:26:00.700
soy is a tricky thing man.
And especially if you,

2688
02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:03.520
if you follow genetically modified food and soil,

2689
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:05.800
a lot of times it's genetically and I wasn't trying to attack you.

2690
02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:10.520
You're always subject.
Just changed that one thing that one time when you said,

2691
02:26:10.521 --> 02:26:12.100
I always trying to route voices.

2692
02:26:12.140 --> 02:26:15.090
I knew I wasn't fucking with you because I knew you weren't tripping it.
I know,

2693
02:26:15.130 --> 02:26:17.830
but it's like that.
That was me just going cake.
You're about to do acid.

2694
02:26:17.831 --> 02:26:22.420
Very exciting doesn't it doesn't help anybody when the trips,
it's all good.

2695
02:26:22.421 --> 02:26:25.210
But I didn't mean to go times.
The correct answer sometimes is,

2696
02:26:25.211 --> 02:26:27.850
sorry I was fucking around.
I thought it was funny at the time.

2697
02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:30.670
Instead of like defending to the death what you've said.

2698
02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:34.660
My only thought was if I want to do,
you're a great guy,

2699
02:26:34.661 --> 02:26:36.820
but under these circumstances it's not perfect.

2700
02:26:37.090 --> 02:26:40.330
So if I'm going to have a nice [inaudible] Sam and everyone else was like going,

2701
02:26:40.540 --> 02:26:42.580
he looks dead and they're saying all these horrible things.

2702
02:26:42.590 --> 02:26:44.310
Now with the one guy that told him this time,

2703
02:26:44.750 --> 02:26:46.750
does it really matter what other people did?

2704
02:26:46.870 --> 02:26:48.450
Does it really matter if there's something

2705
02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:55.060
that you did that annoys him?
You have to take responsibility for that.
It's,

2706
02:26:55.061 --> 02:26:58.690
I'm not saying you did anything wrong,
man.
We've,
we've discussed this to death.

2707
02:26:58.750 --> 02:27:03.750
RSS Feeds a bra goal perhaps will be joining us in Vegas.

2708
02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:06.490
I might throw him on stage.
This motherfucker,

2709
02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:09.200
it needs to go up there with a huge place.
Yeah.

2710
02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:11.920
Arash is going to be there July 1st first.

2711
02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:15.670
I believe Benson is going to stop in and do a guest set too.
Oh,
nice.
Um,

2712
02:27:15.671 --> 02:27:17.770
so July 1st,
that's a,
in Vegas,

2713
02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:22.240
June 25th I'm with Cocoa Canary.
Joey Diaz,

2714
02:27:22.270 --> 02:27:26.080
the captain razor.
What does he put on his deck?

2715
02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:30.430
Drain on the deck and Ajax cut the right size car.
Anyway,

2716
02:27:30.431 --> 02:27:32.860
Carnegie Music Hall,
a Saturday,
Dave,

2717
02:27:32.890 --> 02:27:37.450
June 25th and that's in Plattsburgh.
Oh No,
it's not the New York.

2718
02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:42.160
It's big deal.
That's such a humongous difference.
I was like,

2719
02:27:42.161 --> 02:27:44.050
well I didn't hear about your play.
Carnegie Hall.

2720
02:27:44.110 --> 02:27:47.470
I know how many people fit in Carnegie Music Hall in New York.
I don't know.

2721
02:27:47.830 --> 02:27:49.570
I can't fill that thing,
but I think,
um,

2722
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:54.130
didn't fucking Charlie Sheen fill that thing.
I need a scandal.

2723
02:27:55.250 --> 02:27:57.730
I don't want it.
Anyway,
Carnegie Music Hall in Philadelphia,

2724
02:27:57.970 --> 02:28:00.730
which is the day before the UFC and then there's another one,
like I said,

2725
02:28:00.940 --> 02:28:05.940
July 1st it'll be me and Ari and Joey Diaz and most likely these great,

2726
02:28:06.790 --> 02:28:09.130
the best place we played in Vegas.
We got to Dale the years.

2727
02:28:09.131 --> 02:28:09.850
That was the best place.

2728
02:28:09.850 --> 02:28:12.190
We did a lot of gigs at house of Blues and how's the blues?

2729
02:28:12.191 --> 02:28:14.200
They're the people that work there are really cool as fuck,

2730
02:28:14.201 --> 02:28:18.040
but the venue is too wonky and courts palms when was fine.
It's okay.

2731
02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:20.710
It's not,
that place was the best at Mandalay.

2732
02:28:20.711 --> 02:28:25.420
Bay Theater is fucking perfect and it's like 1800 or so people and it's a,

2733
02:28:25.430 --> 02:28:28.640
it's fucking packed in there and we did it a few months ago and we're going to

2734
02:28:28.641 --> 02:28:32.050
do anything perfectly.
The way to set up theater show for comedy solution.

2735
02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:34.880
I think we went through a little bit of a hissy fit today.

2736
02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:39.890
Had a little bit of a little bit of a cat fight or you guys can all watch it
too.

2737
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:43.750
It's not a shared number.
23 on desktop or not.
Not as shown him.
It's one of those

2738
02:28:46.740 --> 02:28:51.450
are his podcasts is the skeptic tank.
It's on the desk squad.
Yeah.
Naughty though.

2739
02:28:51.470 --> 02:28:53.570
There's a bunch of other ones that are really good.
They're the naughty show.

2740
02:28:53.571 --> 02:28:57.710
And Tom's Tom and his wife have a your mom's house.
Yeah.
So check that out.

2741
02:28:57.711 --> 02:29:01.940
It's a desk quad on iTunes and we'll be back again tomorrow.
Same Bat time.

2742
02:29:01.941 --> 02:29:06.570
Same Bat channel with Dunkin motherfucking Trussell.
It's a full desk quad week.

2743
02:29:07.430 --> 02:29:08.680
Are you guys going to kiss and make up?

2744
02:29:10.910 --> 02:29:15.520
That's why I never even brought it up to him
this week.
And uh,
yeah,

2745
02:29:15.770 --> 02:29:19.570
comedy store in La Jolla Friday and Saturday night.
Who you with?
Uh,
sleep.

2746
02:29:19.580 --> 02:29:23.460
Some want to go another and just nice,
nice,
excellent combination.

2747
02:29:23.461 --> 02:29:24.690
And that comedy store,
if you've never been there.

2748
02:29:24.691 --> 02:29:26.180
And commissioning in La Jolla is the shit,

2749
02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:29.930
but a jump on it pitches cause it's gonna sell out quick.
It's a,

2750
02:29:29.931 --> 02:29:32.420
it's a place is packed all the time.
All right,
that's it.

2751
02:29:32.450 --> 02:29:34.960
We'll see you guys tomorrow with Dunkin mothers.
Oh,

2752
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:37.670
fresh light and thanks to the flashlight.

2756
02:29:48.110 --> 02:29:52.250
Shoot your loads at that discount.
Do you want one of those?
You sure?
Yeah.

2757
02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:56.480
Yeah.
And you'll use it every day until you bleed to death.
It's the cleaning it.

2758
02:29:56.540 --> 02:30:00.620
It's,
I don't think that's a good idea to have around on my place.
It's easy.
Okay.

2759
02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:02.600
Goodnight.
I love you guys.
