00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>We live Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

2
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.060
<v Speaker 1>you're so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so quick on the draw.</v>

3
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.550
<v Speaker 1>You fucking maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give Jamie a couple of days off and he </v>

4
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>started chomping at the bit to hit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal button.</v>

5
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft made a fucking ai and they had</v>

6
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:31.611
<v Speaker 1>a deleted after a day became because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>became a Hitler loving sex robot.</v>

7
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.880
<v Speaker 1>What it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody found a way to make it do that </v>

8
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.271
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like of course they found a flaw in the </v>

9
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:44.601
<v Speaker 1>AI that will make it repeat stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a team of people on twitter like </v>

10
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>purposely tried to make it racist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this crap.</v>

11
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:54.681
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it highlights the problems with an </v>

13
00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:57.141
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the idea that you've created </v>

14
00:00:57.141 --> 00:00:59.070
<v Speaker 1>something that's some sort of a computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone kinda manipulate.</v>

15
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it's this easy to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking Microsoft created,</v>

16
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.360
<v Speaker 1>you would have thought that Microsoft </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a computer manufacturer and the </v>

17
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.070
<v Speaker 1>manufacturer of operating systems would </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the goddamn internet.</v>

18
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.500
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so realistic that that's what kids </v>

19
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>actually are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to deal with everyday on twitter,</v>

20
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:20.540
<v Speaker 1>like a seven year old goes on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to see racist shit,</v>

21
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>just going to see porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to see all this crazy stuff.</v>

22
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually pretty realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it isn't a way.</v>

23
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:31.161
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that this is a real problem </v>

24
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a real problem with like what </v>

25
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>kids are being exposed to like right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

26
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>If they go online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think they go online as soon as </v>

27
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>they get a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

28
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Soon as kids get a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start talking to each other and </v>

29
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.960
<v Speaker 1>they understand that the foam gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>

30
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.960
<v Speaker 1>they're online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.711
<v Speaker 1>So they're exposed to fucking everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get on facebook and if you're doing </v>

32
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:53.811
<v Speaker 1>that man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're getting on twitter like on a </v>

33
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:56.631
<v Speaker 1>daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be exposed to some </v>

34
00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:56.631
<v Speaker 1>really nutty shit.</v>

35
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>And these fucking kids like they did not</v>
<v Speaker 1>being prepared for this.</v>

36
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:04.180
<v Speaker 1>There's just been thrown into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

37
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.680
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just hearing what my mom's,</v>

38
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.350
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's been on the Internet recently.</v>

39
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>She got the internet like a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just her,</v>

40
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>her language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how she talks is different.</v>

41
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Like she's talking about retweeting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hashtags and it's like my mom never used</v>

42
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:22.671
<v Speaker 1>that language before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody made a post on the Rogan for </v>

43
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:22.671
<v Speaker 1>the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was so perfect.</v>

44
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:23.340
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the Internet,</v>

45
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>I never had any conversations about </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminism.</v>

46
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I never argue with anybody about </v>
<v Speaker 1>transgenders.</v>

47
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.540
<v Speaker 1>There's like all these things that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden became an issue because of </v>

48
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.871
<v Speaker 1>the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like we were were transgender </v>

49
00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:38.871
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're kids.</v>

50
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing.</v>

51
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>We were led to like run them over with </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>

52
00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:47.631
<v Speaker 1>I thought I couldn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was that renee richards who </v>

53
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>was a high profile case because renee </v>
<v Speaker 1>richards.</v>

54
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Is that the name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Renee renee the tennis player.</v>

55
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Is that the right name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might not be the right name.</v>

56
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.750
<v Speaker 1>The last name might be off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a tennis player who was a </v>

57
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>man who was not a very good tennis </v>
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>

58
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not very good as a professional.</v>

59
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the right name.</v>

60
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot better than me because I don't </v>

61
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>play tennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

62
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>So he became a woman and just started </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking dominating,</v>

63
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>like became like a top flight tennis </v>
<v Speaker 1>player and a lot of people were like,</v>

64
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

65
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is,</v>

66
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

67
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>is that really a woman like this was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the precursor to the uh,</v>

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
<v Speaker 1>the bullshit about the chick who used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a dude for 30 years became a check </v>

69
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>for two years and they started fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>female mma with this is a way the female</v>

70
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>mma one is a way worse case because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about someone beating the</v>

71
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:40.771
<v Speaker 1>shit out of somebody would mail bones </v>
<v Speaker 1>and male mind and mailed tendons and all</v>

72
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>that jazz.</v>

73
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>But Renee Richards was beaten a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

74
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:49.531
<v Speaker 1>like really good test players that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>born women and there was a real </v>

75
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>controversy behind it where people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

76
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking know like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

77
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have a transgender league is</v>

78
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.130
<v Speaker 1>what they should have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should have transgender men.</v>

79
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 1>And transgender is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>

80
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to be accepted as a regular </v>

81
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.410
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you are but not in fucking sports.</v>

82
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why I can't play like </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Olympics is like they're,</v>

83
00:04:10.461 --> 00:04:15.461
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're experiencing social pressure </v>

84
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 1>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a big part of it and I think for</v>

85
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:21.631
<v Speaker 1>some sports that don't have anything to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do with explosiveness and sheer power,</v>

86
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 1>and then you could say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

87
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Serena Williams is always going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger and faster than a lot of men.</v>

88
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>It's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly one of them is Serena or </v>

89
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>their sister.</v>

90
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>The drug testing people came to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

91
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 1>They locked themselves in a fucking safe</v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

92
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.460
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that they just got done </v>

93
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.460
<v Speaker 1>smoking a joint though and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

94
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.460
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

95
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.430
<v Speaker 1>I do not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

96
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I think his steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's performance enhancing </v>

97
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.391
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that are girls that take </v>

98
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:58.291
<v Speaker 1>testosterone there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu girls and they compete and they </v>

99
00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>travel all over the place and compete </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they take fucking testosterone.</v>

100
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.580
<v Speaker 1>The testosterone in the Jujitsu world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is coming from obviously a person </v>

101
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 1>who takes testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

102
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Serena Williams locked herself in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>panic room and drug test to mix up.</v>

103
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 1>There was no mixed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knew what the fuck was going on.</v>

104
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Like as a stocker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's trying to kill me.</v>

105
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>If that chicken at tennis racket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could beat the fuck out of anyone in</v>

106
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

107
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.620
<v Speaker 1>You think she's really worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>some fucking dork with the pocket </v>

108
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>protector comes to our house with a Piss</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cup.</v>

109
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.320

<v Speaker 1>answered the door.</v>

110
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

111
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.480
<v Speaker 1>They have rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The USA Da.</v>

112
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>They need to know where you are at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>types to crazy.</v>

113
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:41.941
<v Speaker 1>Their rules are Donaldson Rooney who </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously fights for the UFC is one of </v>

114
00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 1>the top pros in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He flew to Vegas for the UFC and they </v>

117
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.770
<v Speaker 1>were at your house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We trying to test you.</v>

118
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

119
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm at the UFC like we have to tell us </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly where you are.</v>

120
00:05:56.951 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

121
00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>the fucking</v>

122
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 2>UFC knows where I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

123
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm here for the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you talking about?</v>

124
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they literally,</v>

125
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.990
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't there competing was there to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch,</v>

126
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will tell you,</v>

127
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 2>you have to tell them where you are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>any given day all the time.</v>

128
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 2>You're always have to be able to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>reached.</v>

129
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

130
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.240
<v Speaker 2>So she fucking do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

131
00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:16.970
<v Speaker 2>but you think it instead of a panic </v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

132
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 2>she could just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to answer the door.</v>

133
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:23.891
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to be asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why is she confirmed that she was </v>

134
00:06:23.891 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 2>scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She locked herself in her panic room and</v>

135
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 2>she confirms that she really was scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great escape is a great excuse.</v>

136
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be the case,</v>

137
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 2>the guy at the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

138
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 2>I might be full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy at the door might have been some</v>

139
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.650
<v Speaker 2>serial killer look and fuck.</v>

140
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Who also works for the USA Da.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might've been swole.</v>

141
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Who might've been scary looking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows?</v>

142
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I had a guess,</v>

143
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.870
<v Speaker 2>that chick is so fucking explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's so fast and it is a ridiculously </v>

144
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:55.781
<v Speaker 2>competitive sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean unbelievably competitive and the </v>

145
00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 2>money is astronomical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about millions of dollars</v>

146
00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:02.570
<v Speaker 2>to be someone like a Serina Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course she would take steroids if she</v>

147
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:07.571
<v Speaker 2>could get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she get away with and she doesn't </v>

148
00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 2>have a problem with it ethically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she was one of those people that grew</v>

149
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 2>up in the world of competitive sports </v>
<v Speaker 2>like she is,</v>

150
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they realize,</v>

151
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking dog eat dog world.</v>

152
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 2>You know what I had Lance Armstrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto?</v>

153
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.700
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to take steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to do all that stuff.</v>

154
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.250
<v Speaker 2>He did it because everybody else was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it and they realized like,</v>

155
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 2>we gotta do this.</v>

156
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 2>We want to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to win,</v>

157
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 2>you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to fucking do this.</v>

158
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.290
<v Speaker 2>They all do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

159
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 2>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why sports suck.</v>

160
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.310
<v Speaker 2>They don't suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

161
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.370
<v Speaker 2>because you don't know who's on what and</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's doing what time are you just </v>

162
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:36.370
<v Speaker 2>watching bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

163
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.601
<v Speaker 2>but that's part of the fun is wondering </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not a guys on the Jews.</v>

164
00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Do you see Rosie Donald's brother caught</v>
<v Speaker 2>way he said about us.</v>

165
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he's Roseville.</v>

166
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Donald's brother's gay and this is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>he said.</v>

167
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.320
<v Speaker 2>He said it's like gay porn with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ending.</v>

168
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.810
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what gay people would say.</v>

169
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.600
<v Speaker 2>He looks so funny though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when he's saying it,</v>

170
00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.010
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it's fake.</v>

171
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:00.050
<v Speaker 2>That's one of those things like this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not real.</v>

172
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.260
<v Speaker 2>This is part of this simulation that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bullshit.</v>

173
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.500
<v Speaker 2>That video is one of the funniest videos</v>
<v Speaker 2>is quite hilarious.</v>

174
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a Saturday night live </v>
<v Speaker 2>skit.</v>

175
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.380
<v Speaker 2>He can get away with it because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay.</v>

176
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 2>Gay people have so much more leeway to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say gay stuff.</v>

177
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.540
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's call everything gay because it's </v>

178
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.250
<v Speaker 2>gay to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to him as gay.</v>

179
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.680
<v Speaker 2>To him it is like gay porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you think,</v>

180
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:26.710
<v Speaker 2>do you think there's a huge percentage </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people that aren't into the UFC that </v>

181
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.280
<v Speaker 2>go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree man.</v>

182
00:08:28.281 --> 00:08:30.620
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of guys rolling around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>

183
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be upset at that guy.</v>

184
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that guy helped the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

185
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.850
<v Speaker 2>Let's play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's play.</v>

186
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it because it's so fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name is Daniel Donald Rolling</v>

187
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:49.130
<v Speaker 3>around on top of one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to dominate each other just in </v>

188
00:08:50.161 --> 00:08:52.950
<v Speaker 3>case you don't know that's gay porn with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a different ending</v>

189
00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.580
<v Speaker 1>else says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>

190
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:04.110
<v Speaker 3>I won't describe the ending for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as I've gotten older,</v>

191
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:06.050
<v Speaker 3>the endings are less important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

192
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:11.110
<v Speaker 3>so take a delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The timing,</v>

193
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:18.100
<v Speaker 3>the aggression and the violence of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was did not make me necessarily </v>

194
00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:23.861
<v Speaker 3>comfortable but can kind of agnostic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we had a colleague here was brought</v>

195
00:09:27.081 --> 00:09:30.200
<v Speaker 3>before the committee and I've enjoyed </v>
<v Speaker 3>this week discussion about our rules.</v>

196
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:31.850
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't be gay.</v>

197
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.510
<v Speaker 1>I think John Waters off the bolts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed our conversation.</v>

198
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes these processes work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

199
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.990
<v Speaker 3>We had a colleague here who was deeply </v>
<v Speaker 3>offended by what this was deeply </v>

200
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:51.020
<v Speaker 3>offended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the Christians to the Lions </v>

201
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Roman time.</v>

202
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:56.290
<v Speaker 1>It pauses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see why people think that </v>

203
00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.100
<v Speaker 1>because they get deeply offended by </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

204
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.120
<v Speaker 1>They should be able to change what other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people enjoy or they should be able to </v>

205
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.260
<v Speaker 1>take freedoms away from people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you talk about something</v>

206
00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:09.261
<v Speaker 1>that's been already licensed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulated by 49 out of 50 states that </v>

207
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:15.531
<v Speaker 1>this guy could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm offended and then I feel like this </v>

208
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:15.750
<v Speaker 1>is like the Christians in Lyons kiss </v>
<v Speaker 1>what dummy.</v>

209
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.180
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two problems with that.</v>

210
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:23.300
<v Speaker 1>The Christians didn't have a choice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking lines didn't have a choice </v>

211
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.751
<v Speaker 1>and it was to the death and they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>train for it and it wasn't like a huge </v>

212
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:31.131
<v Speaker 1>dream of theirs and it couldn't be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hugely profitable career where you can </v>

213
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:35.331
<v Speaker 1>make Ronda Rousey conor mcgregor type </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and nate diaz money now to our </v>

214
00:10:35.331 --> 00:10:37.080
<v Speaker 1>friend Nate Diaz is rolling in cash now.</v>

215
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Roland balling out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might not.</v>

216
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:46.190
<v Speaker 1>He might not fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might beat his ass again if they </v>

217
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.981
<v Speaker 1>fight and then like take two years off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's making millions of dollars or </v>

218
00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:50.650
<v Speaker 1>not be connor's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>

219
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean connor convenient.</v>

220
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Just slap them the way I just had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling going into that fight.</v>

221
00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a big difference.</v>

222
00:10:59.671 --> 00:11:04.671
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Nate Diaz strikes in anybody else </v>

223
00:11:04.671 --> 00:11:06.660
<v Speaker 1>that connor's fought like natives real </v>
<v Speaker 1>slick with his hands.</v>

224
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.290
<v Speaker 1>He's real good at shoulder roll and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a Nasty Jab.</v>

225
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 1>He drops his hands and sneak stuff in on</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

226
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.760
<v Speaker 1>He knows how to throw punches too with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like minimal minimal wind up.</v>

227
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.820
<v Speaker 1>He knows how to pop hop you and those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dang you man.</v>

228
00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:25.821
<v Speaker 1>They fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He dings guys on the Chin like what he </v>

229
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:25.821
<v Speaker 1>did with Michael Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

230
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a tough fight.</v>

231
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.220
<v Speaker 1>And he's a tough out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only guys ever stopped him is Josh </v>

232
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Thomson had kicked him and when Josh </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thompson had kicked him,</v>

233
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:34.890
<v Speaker 1>like he's still didn't go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got rocked,</v>

234
00:11:34.891 --> 00:11:37.930
<v Speaker 1>but he's fucking tough man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

235
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it goes to the ground,</v>

236
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.880
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the wrong guy.</v>

237
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz is the wrong guy to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground with.</v>

238
00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:48.960
<v Speaker 1>He's a legit black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really high level black belt.</v>

239
00:11:48.961 --> 00:11:53.961
<v Speaker 1>And I knew connor had gotten submitted </v>
<v Speaker 1>by Joe Duffy when anybody can get </v>

240
00:11:53.961 --> 00:11:57.621
<v Speaker 1>submitted if you get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he got submitted by that Joe Duffy </v>

241
00:11:57.621 --> 00:12:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a few years ago and Joe Duffy is a </v>

242
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.310
<v Speaker 1>very talented fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it,</v>

243
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.650
<v Speaker 1>but nate wouldn't have got submitted by </v>
<v Speaker 1>that same guy.</v>

244
00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I highly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly,</v>

245
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:07.480
<v Speaker 1>highly doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those San Joe's like that,</v>

246
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:09.880
<v Speaker 1>that level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a few guys were like,</v>

247
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you submit that guy like he's only </v>

248
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.701
<v Speaker 1>been submitted in the USC dosantos wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because he had a broken jaw </v>

249
00:12:17.701 --> 00:12:17.701
<v Speaker 1>and it's clay.</v>

250
00:12:17.701 --> 00:12:18.660
<v Speaker 1>Guido submitted them because clay was on</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of them,</v>

251
00:12:18.661 --> 00:12:23.661
<v Speaker 1>squeeze in his neck and his jaw was </v>
<v Speaker 1>smashed and he realized he was really </v>

252
00:12:23.661 --> 00:12:26.020
<v Speaker 1>fucked and so he tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like a guy like conor,</v>

253
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 1>if you've been tapped before by Joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>Duffy just a couple of years ago with an</v>

254
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 1>arm triangle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get caught like that.</v>

255
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:36.181
<v Speaker 1>Like you've got a lot to learn and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know if you've learned and all in </v>

256
00:12:36.181 --> 00:12:40.081
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you got to be obsessed with </v>

257
00:12:40.081 --> 00:12:40.081
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be in there every day training</v>

258
00:12:40.081 --> 00:12:41.800
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think he was that.</v>

259
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was more of a movement and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's striking and all that stuff.</v>

260
00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:49.000
<v Speaker 1>And I know he was doing some Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like the primary focus.</v>

261
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.420
<v Speaker 1>So I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

262
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.320
<v Speaker 1>that's a big deepened fucking Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might knock them out.</v>

263
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean connor can knock out anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't,</v>

264
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.640
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now that he didn't.</v>

265
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:02.670
<v Speaker 1>And now that nate knows he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they're going to go into the </v>

266
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.860
<v Speaker 1>second fight and nate's going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>full training camp.</v>

267
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

268
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.540
<v Speaker 1>What's the benefit of this second fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>for conor?</v>

269
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Just to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I thought.</v>

270
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Money outside of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any good?</v>

271
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could always go down to 1:45</v>

272
00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:18.760
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still a champion at 1:45,</v>

273
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:23.910
<v Speaker 1>but the amount of money and Nate Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conor mcgregor makes conor mcgregor </v>

274
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Speaker 1>rematch makes is going to be off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking charts.</v>

275
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz is a superstar and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't realize it until like the Michael</v>

276
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Johnson fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People realized it when he was calling </v>

277
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:38.470
<v Speaker 1>out connor in the in the octagon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was cheering and also like the</v>

278
00:13:38.471 --> 00:13:40.660
<v Speaker 1>ratings when Nate Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a fuck,</v>

279
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a big thing we're Dana white </v>

280
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.390
<v Speaker 1>had said that he's not a needle mover is</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were in the middle of contract</v>

281
00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:49.420
<v Speaker 1>negotiations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The couldn't be further from the truth.</v>

282
00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 1>He's a big needle mover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Love Dana,</v>

283
00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:55.730
<v Speaker 1>but that's just contract negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk like Nate Diaz.</v>

284
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's possible he didn't know,</v>

285
00:13:58.091 --> 00:14:03.091
<v Speaker 1>but I know because of the Diaz brothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as like my friends that are like </v>

286
00:14:03.091 --> 00:14:03.400
<v Speaker 1>casual mma fans.</v>

287
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.040
<v Speaker 1>The Diaz brothers are fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're huge.</v>

288
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are giant stars and after </v>
<v Speaker 1>nick like pretended to sleep with </v>

289
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva and like their big talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>mad shit,</v>

290
00:14:16.001 --> 00:14:17.500

<v Speaker 1>they actually can fight.</v>

291
00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:22.501
<v Speaker 1>They fight very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're excellent world class </v>

292
00:14:22.501 --> 00:14:25.861
<v Speaker 1>fighters and they talk mad shit and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke a lot of weed and they mostly eat </v>

293
00:14:26.021 --> 00:14:29.290
<v Speaker 1>vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think nick might be all Vegan.</v>

294
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I think dick still eats like fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know nate eats fish and I think </v>

295
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.820
<v Speaker 1>they eat eggs to the tortillas and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's made with eggs and them,</v>

296
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.560
<v Speaker 1>but they're interesting guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

297
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.800
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking legit,</v>

298
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:46.210
<v Speaker 1>fascinating people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like there's money.</v>

299
00:14:46.211 --> 00:14:51.211
<v Speaker 1>My point is that guy's out of his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a Christian versus the lions </v>

300
00:14:51.211 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 1>is a huge support that these guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant</v>

301
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.650
<v Speaker 2>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make it fucking boatloads of cash.</v>

302
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.860
<v Speaker 2>Ronda Rousey was on the God cover sports</v>
<v Speaker 2>illustrated with one of those paint </v>

303
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 2>things on paint titties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>

304
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>

305
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I pick.</v>

306
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Paint my cock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>

307
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:11.180
<v Speaker 2>If I pay my cock and I go out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that all right or is it make it look </v>

308
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.770
<v Speaker 2>like an elephant or chicken or </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]?</v>

309
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 2>There's a line there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

310
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:16.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like a woman's nipples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot show a woman's nipples on the</v>

311
00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:17.900
<v Speaker 2>cover of the magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

312
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:22.901
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come you can show them painted on </v>

313
00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:22.901
<v Speaker 2>like why do we decided to paint on is </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

314
00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

315
00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 2>There is a naked Ronda rousey with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fake swimsuit on.</v>

316
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.300
<v Speaker 2>That's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like her vagina.</v>

317
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming like most girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see some of it from the front,</v>

318
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we spit?</v>

319
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Can we zoom in on the not do that.</v>

320
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Let's be respectful here for her sake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for Travis Browne say,</v>

321
00:15:41.591 --> 00:15:43.100
<v Speaker 2>because if he finds you will fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill you.</v>

322
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a cool thing though.</v>

323
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:47.690
<v Speaker 2>That's like a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to look a cat design.</v>

324
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:52.720
<v Speaker 2>I didn't notice that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good because at the bottom could </v>

325
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.061
<v Speaker 2>be a hairy chin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See there they thought about that in </v>

326
00:15:55.061 --> 00:15:55.730
<v Speaker 2>advance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had to probably Tuck in some lip.</v>

327
00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:57.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not,</v>

328
00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she's one of those tidy girls.</v>

329
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that rude?</v>

330
00:16:01.571 --> 00:16:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Is it rude to say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point is I'm.</v>

331
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda knows I love her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point is I can do that with my cock.</v>

332
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so cool.</v>

333
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:15.220
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I could wear like I could get a </v>

334
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:15.230
<v Speaker 2>full on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard on and put Lycra on,</v>

335
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:20.500
<v Speaker 2>put like spandex on and put it online </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people would say I was offensive.</v>

336
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it would be okay.</v>

337
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Like that was what the game did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>

338
00:16:25.281 --> 00:16:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Remember that Jamie or rap fan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

339
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.210
<v Speaker 2>He had an instagram posts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

340
00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:30.500
<v Speaker 2>he put an instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a.</v>

341
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.680
<v Speaker 2>he's got a hog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a fuck up police flashlights took a</v>

342
00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:39.860
<v Speaker 2>picture of him standing there with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking boner.</v>

343
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't even show it in this.</v>

344
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one that chose it got in </v>

345
00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:47.730
<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus stopped doing it,</v>

346
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.720
<v Speaker 2>but he's holding onto it and one he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>warming it up.</v>

347
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:54.020
<v Speaker 2>And then number two is just showing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

348
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be honest,</v>

349
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.320
<v Speaker 2>even as a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's scary.</v>

350
00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.980
<v Speaker 2>He's a large person too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a large human,</v>

351
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:06.280
<v Speaker 2>so that's like buddy can't fight it is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>video of him a beaten some guy up and </v>

352
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh dude,</v>

353
00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:09.020
<v Speaker 2>we need to work on some stuff with you.</v>

354
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.610
<v Speaker 2>We need to work on your technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

355
00:17:10.611 --> 00:17:12.290
<v Speaker 2>he could fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he can't.</v>

356
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:17.530
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know like how he doesn't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual techniques like Katt Williams </v>

357
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:18.740
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not as good as Kat Williams.</v>

358
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Cat defended the choke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you notice that when they went to the</v>

359
00:17:21.951 --> 00:17:23.840
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cat never got strangled.</v>

360
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.200
<v Speaker 2>He held on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had two on ones.</v>

361
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:30.860
<v Speaker 2>What you're supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the way he threw that left hand,</v>

362
00:17:30.861 --> 00:17:35.861
<v Speaker 2>I got to say there was zero power behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it probably wouldn't knock out my </v>

363
00:17:35.861 --> 00:17:38.900
<v Speaker 2>seven year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was no fat in this technique.</v>

364
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Like he didn't wind up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just uncorked it from here and it was</v>

365
00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:47.771
<v Speaker 2>a straight punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He uncorked a very short straight left </v>

366
00:17:47.771 --> 00:17:49.380
<v Speaker 2>hand with a ring onto which is like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deadly weapon.</v>

367
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 2>When you see the extended</v>

368
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:55.310
<v Speaker 4>version of the video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it definitely seems like he was </v>

369
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.351
<v Speaker 4>threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seemed like that kid was up in his </v>

370
00:17:57.351 --> 00:17:57.351
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He followed him for whatever reason.</v>

371
00:17:57.351 --> 00:17:58.890
<v Speaker 4>That's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The kid apparently said,</v>

372
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.230
<v Speaker 4>Kat Williams is funnier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

373
00:18:01.231 --> 00:18:03.450
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why,</v>

374
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.210
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

375
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 4>why do people want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

376
00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:06.990
<v Speaker 4>why is it you want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Worldstar.</v>

377
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:07.770
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

378
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.290
<v Speaker 4>It's got to do them Worldstar hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to play the full version.</v>

379
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.910
<v Speaker 4>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here we go.</v>

380
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.970
<v Speaker 4>The kid gets this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>use this version.</v>

381
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:16.740
<v Speaker 4>It looks like he's just fighting with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>

382
00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.640
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how come we miss all the other stuff</v>

383
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Speaker 4>up until this got very good control?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>

384
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.490
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terrible defense.</v>

385
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:28.260
<v Speaker 4>I'd take it back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was already choked out.</v>

386
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.290
<v Speaker 4>He didn't go to the hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

387
00:18:31.291 --> 00:18:32.700
<v Speaker 4>that's not his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got one.</v>

388
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have to on one.</v>

389
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.520
<v Speaker 4>He's not holding the choking army there.</v>

390
00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.840
<v Speaker 4>It's called little boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Little boy.</v>

391
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.510
<v Speaker 4>And they were playing soccer on a field </v>
<v Speaker 4>or something like that with a looks like</v>

392
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.950
<v Speaker 4>20 people or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shirt on.</v>

393
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.550
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't look like a disc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that.</v>

394
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:54.560
<v Speaker 4>That'd be good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should photoshop one and all of the </v>

395
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:54.560
<v Speaker 4>photos with him and then online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

396
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:54.890
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

397
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.440
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

398
00:18:55.441 --> 00:19:00.441
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why was he playing soccer with some </v>

399
00:19:00.441 --> 00:19:00.441
<v Speaker 4>kids?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about why not?</v>

400
00:19:00.441 --> 00:19:03.300
<v Speaker 4>If he wants to be friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Katt Williams is a gigantic star.</v>

401
00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.740
<v Speaker 4>The end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just saying he was hanging out with</v>

402
00:19:04.741 --> 00:19:06.300
<v Speaker 4>people in the hood and this is why most </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

403
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.980
<v Speaker 4>most celebrities don't come and hang out</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the hood.</v>

404
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.980
<v Speaker 4>So he was just hanging out with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's unfortunate.</v>

405
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.370
<v Speaker 4>It looked like there was definitely some</v>
<v Speaker 4>confrontation going on,</v>

406
00:19:14.371 --> 00:19:18.300
<v Speaker 4>but who knows how the fuck has built up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that and you've got to expect that,</v>

407
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.100
<v Speaker 4>especially if he's involved in sports </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing sports or people put people play</v>

408
00:19:23.101 --> 00:19:24.180
<v Speaker 4>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they talk shit,</v>

409
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that choke on the subway here in culver </v>

410
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:29.600
<v Speaker 4>city was way better GC.</v>

411
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.820
<v Speaker 4>That one was better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even then why is that guy grabbing </v>

412
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:33.820
<v Speaker 4>his forearm like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

413
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.280
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't grab like that.</v>

414
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:40.300
<v Speaker 4>That's not how you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean someone like that's like some </v>

415
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:40.320
<v Speaker 4>wrestling type shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a wrestling sleeper hold.</v>

416
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.230
<v Speaker 4>But he did it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he,</v>

417
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.340
<v Speaker 4>he squeezed that guy out and he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

418
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:49.390
<v Speaker 4>he's just a normal guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't like a Jujitsu guy or a fight </v>

419
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.390
<v Speaker 4>or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was just a normal dude.</v>

420
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.220
<v Speaker 4>Dexter Dexter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No kidding.</v>

421
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:57.440
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does seem weird that that Jujitsu </v>

422
00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.390
<v Speaker 4>moves like choking and stuff like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>seems so common now since the UFC a like</v>

423
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.950
<v Speaker 4>you didn't see this shit 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People doing jokes,</v>

424
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:10.090
<v Speaker 4>but when high school we had a sleeper </v>
<v Speaker 4>hold like because it was on progress </v>

425
00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:10.500
<v Speaker 4>line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we didn't think it was real.</v>

426
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:11.940
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd hear about the sleeper.</v>

427
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.330
<v Speaker 4>He's got that slave buyer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

428
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.680
<v Speaker 4>guys would get guys in a sleeper hold in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a pro wrestling match and then they </v>

429
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.041
<v Speaker 4>would fight it off and fight it off and </v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually would go to sleep and the </v>

430
00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:24.921
<v Speaker 4>ref,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd pick their arm up to make sure </v>

431
00:20:24.921 --> 00:20:24.921
<v Speaker 4>they're awake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You remember that?</v>

432
00:20:24.921 --> 00:20:24.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was.</v>

433
00:20:24.921 --> 00:20:28.521
<v Speaker 4>But we didn't think it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like no one knew that you could really </v>

434
00:20:28.521 --> 00:20:29.700
<v Speaker 4>choke someone out until the UFC came </v>
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

435
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.320
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In Highschool,</v>

436
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.070
<v Speaker 4>Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no more sleeper.</v>

437
00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:36.080
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was not in wrestling rest.</v>

438
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.760
<v Speaker 4>It was only in pro wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in wrestling,</v>

439
00:20:38.761 --> 00:20:43.761
<v Speaker 4>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't even do a full Nelson </v>

440
00:20:43.761 --> 00:20:43.761
<v Speaker 4>because it puts too much pressure on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>neck.</v>

441
00:20:43.761 --> 00:20:46.430
<v Speaker 4>You could do like a half Nelson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you're trying to pin someone,</v>

442
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 4>what that means is if you were behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

443
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:53.220
<v Speaker 1>you get an under hook and you go around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back of their head and you get now </v>

444
00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.450
<v Speaker 1>full Nelson is you have both arms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad place to be.</v>

445
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.350
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hurts.</v>

446
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.330
<v Speaker 1>You could push down your neck and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>made that.</v>

447
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 1>They made that illegal when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school at least.</v>

448
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.300
<v Speaker 1>And so like if you wanted to pin someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to use a half Nelson so he could</v>

449
00:21:04.301 --> 00:21:09.301
<v Speaker 1>never do a fucking sleeper hold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's like some shit they didn't </v>

450
00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:10.690
<v Speaker 1>know about that you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Matt Hughes choked out.</v>

451
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Ricardo Almeda with just a front </v>
<v Speaker 1>headlock.</v>

452
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.290
<v Speaker 1>What he did was he held onto the front </v>
<v Speaker 1>head lock.</v>

453
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:21.280
<v Speaker 1>He had an Matt Hughes is fucking country</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>

454
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some dudes that grow up </v>
<v Speaker 1>working from the time they're young like</v>

455
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:30.130
<v Speaker 1>lifting bales of Hay and learning how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use their body.</v>

456
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.160
<v Speaker 1>And also he had excellent genetics too </v>
<v Speaker 1>because his brother was built like that </v>

457
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:35.160
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

458
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.500
<v Speaker 1>But there's some strength that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of guys have like farm strength,</v>

459
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.720
<v Speaker 1>that Shit's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

460
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of Kettlebell guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Pavle Tot souly,</v>

461
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.890
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got that kind of bill to where it's</v>

462
00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:50.110
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that if you try to wrestle with</v>

463
00:21:50.111 --> 00:21:55.111
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he even though he looks like a fairly </v>

464
00:21:55.111 --> 00:21:55.780
<v Speaker 1>normal size athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably just stupid fucking strong.</v>

465
00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:00.530
<v Speaker 1>And so Matt Hughes gets his front head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ca headlock on Ricardo Medo right.</v>

466
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.560
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a legal wrestling move that's </v>

467
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.951
<v Speaker 1>fucking legal as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they've changed shit because all </v>

468
00:22:07.951 --> 00:22:11.521
<v Speaker 1>he's doing is grabbing his neck and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>using his head and his neck to squeeze </v>

469
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:17.170
<v Speaker 1>the shoulder and arm of Ricardo Almeida </v>
<v Speaker 1>against his neck on one side.</v>

470
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.320
<v Speaker 1>And then he's using his arm and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder to squeeze the neck on the </v>

471
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.881
<v Speaker 1>other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's essentially the same thing as a </v>

472
00:22:26.881 --> 00:22:26.881
<v Speaker 1>head and arm choke.</v>

473
00:22:26.881 --> 00:22:29.470
<v Speaker 1>He's just in a different position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like he's in the north south position</v>

474
00:22:29.471 --> 00:22:31.990
<v Speaker 1>from a standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means they,</v>

475
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:34.330
<v Speaker 1>he grabs his head and he pulls him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Matt's.</v>

476
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Matt's got the upper hand is his arm is </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrapped around Ricardo's neck now they </v>

477
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:43.291
<v Speaker 1>were reversed on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That position where Ricardo is being </v>

478
00:22:43.291 --> 00:22:44.980
<v Speaker 1>choked is essentially the same as a head</v>
<v Speaker 1>and arm choke,</v>

479
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:50.130
<v Speaker 1>which is a super common choke and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>finish it the same way with the hand </v>

480
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:51.580
<v Speaker 1>grip and the same way you get easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>finish it that way.</v>

481
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Some guys grabbed the Bicep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way matt is doing it,</v>

482
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.160
<v Speaker 1>a lot of guys finish it that way so he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be different like he would be </v>

483
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.091
<v Speaker 1>mounting them where his body would be on</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of his body instead of like in a </v>

484
00:23:03.091 --> 00:23:04.060
<v Speaker 1>north south position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's essentially the same.</v>

485
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Same way you're applying pressure to </v>
<v Speaker 1>choke someone unconscious.</v>

486
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:13.460
<v Speaker 1>We had never seen that in the UFC before</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor since no one's been able to do it </v>

487
00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.951
<v Speaker 1>since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point being like there's some </v>

488
00:23:16.951 --> 00:23:17.800
<v Speaker 1>wrestling shit that they still out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could still do,</v>

489
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.900
<v Speaker 1>but guy like Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he choke you out with Mark Schultz.</v>

490
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Got He got kicked out of the Olympics </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he ripped a guy's fucking </v>

491
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:30.220
<v Speaker 1>shoulder apart with a a move that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal at the time.</v>

492
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:35.580
<v Speaker 1>It was like a Kimora.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He they call a double wrist lock and </v>

493
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.000
<v Speaker 1>catch wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you pull up Mark Schultz,</v>

494
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I forgot the gentleman's name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy wrestled,</v>

495
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I want to say he was from Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran has a very strong wrestling </v>

496
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.270
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Mark Schultz was all fucking go real</v>

497
00:23:47.271 --> 00:23:51.980
<v Speaker 1>law when he was competing as he's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy that Fox catcher movies based on,</v>

498
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.510
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile not really based on him.</v>

499
00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is and it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They played fast and loose with a lot of</v>

500
00:23:57.651 --> 00:24:02.651
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made it look like he was gay and he's </v>

501
00:24:02.651 --> 00:24:02.651
<v Speaker 1>doing coke and he had frosted tips and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of weird shit in there.</v>

502
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:08.290
<v Speaker 1>But that move as far as I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just took it too far or something I </v>

503
00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:09.110
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was an illegal move.</v>

504
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch this,</v>

505
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.400
<v Speaker 1>watch what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drops,</v>

506
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.260
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to Kamora.</v>

507
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.100
<v Speaker 1>He Yanks it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pulls them down.</v>

508
00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Just destroys his arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just destroys them.</v>

509
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guy's just screaming in agony on</v>

510
00:24:24.021 --> 00:24:27.680
<v Speaker 1>the ground back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ABC Wide World of sports I think,</v>

511
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.820
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have that shit anymore.</v>

512
00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Used to get exposed to weird sports.</v>

513
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would take you to like a javelin </v>

514
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:39.340
<v Speaker 1>contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like ABC wide world is ports.</v>

515
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:44.170
<v Speaker 1>They would show you all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different shit that you'd never seen </v>

516
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:44.170
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they had a Minnesota Plat.</v>

517
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Fats play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Willie Mosconi in a pool match an ABC </v>

518
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.150
<v Speaker 1>wide world of sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Whoa,</v>

519
00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show us some cool shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

520
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:56.340
<v Speaker 5>I saw vr pool demo the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that five thing I showed you a </v>

521
00:24:56.411 --> 00:25:01.411
<v Speaker 5>couple of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone was made of a full pool game </v>

522
00:25:01.411 --> 00:25:02.320
<v Speaker 5>where you're walking around a pool hall </v>
<v Speaker 5>and a you can set up,</v>

523
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.060
<v Speaker 5>you can set up a bunch of trick shots </v>
<v Speaker 5>with looks.</v>

524
00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:09.090
<v Speaker 5>It looks a little gaming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can have like beer bottles and </v>

525
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.420
<v Speaker 5>whatnot on the table and shoot your pool</v>
<v Speaker 5>balls right through the bottles and.</v>

526
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:15.570
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw at best buy there's this new </v>

527
00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:16.960
<v Speaker 5>camera out that's only like $400,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a three 60 camera,</v>

528
00:25:16.961 --> 00:25:21.961
<v Speaker 5>which so you could just put it right </v>
<v Speaker 5>here and it records everything around </v>

529
00:25:21.961 --> 00:25:21.961
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen this,</v>

530
00:25:21.961 --> 00:25:24.220
<v Speaker 5>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's good or not,</v>

531
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.050
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of interesting.</v>

532
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:27.070
<v Speaker 5>It is interesting.</v>

533
00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

534
00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.440
<v Speaker 1>This is bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

535
00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.310
<v Speaker 1>it's showing you the angles and stuff</v>

536
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.820
<v Speaker 5>so you can just walk around if you want </v>
<v Speaker 5>the English you can,</v>

537
00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:44.090
<v Speaker 5>but everything in the whole room is </v>
<v Speaker 5>available at the touch apparently or a </v>

538
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.190
<v Speaker 5>certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>

539
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.300
<v Speaker 5>Let's set up ramps.</v>

540
00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will be really interesting is if </v>

541
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:51.800
<v Speaker 1>you could somehow set this up with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and have virtual balls,</v>

542
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.320
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is you wouldn't feel the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball,</v>

543
00:25:54.321 --> 00:25:59.321
<v Speaker 1>like the whole idea pool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like see what they're doing is just </v>

544
00:25:59.321 --> 00:25:59.630
<v Speaker 1>showing the shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like landing the shots,</v>

545
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.680
<v Speaker 1>but with pulls really all about is </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling the rotation of the ball and</v>

546
00:26:03.681 --> 00:26:04.520
<v Speaker 1>cue ball control.</v>

547
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:07.020
<v Speaker 5>There's a little feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little bit of touching yet,</v>

548
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.550
<v Speaker 5>but if I don't know if they could make </v>
<v Speaker 5>it feel to say never.</v>

549
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:09.910
<v Speaker 5>You would</v>

550
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:10.950
<v Speaker 1>need wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

551
00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:12.470
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What pool is,</v>

552
00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:17.471
<v Speaker 1>is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big thing about it is the </v>

553
00:26:17.471 --> 00:26:17.471
<v Speaker 1>weight of the queue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like um,</v>

554
00:26:17.471 --> 00:26:21.900
<v Speaker 1>guys will change their weight just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit and they feel it in a big </v>

555
00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.501
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll go from a 19 point one </v>

556
00:26:25.501 --> 00:26:25.501
<v Speaker 1>ounce q,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two in 19 point three and they're like,</v>

557
00:26:25.501 --> 00:26:27.130
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm over stroking this ball.</v>

558
00:26:27.131 --> 00:26:32.131
<v Speaker 1>I got to back off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we were talking about like two </v>

559
00:26:32.131 --> 00:26:32.560
<v Speaker 1>tenths of an ounce and it's a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in the way it feels.</v>

560
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Or if you go from like one ounce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one ounce is giant,</v>

561
00:26:35.411 --> 00:26:37.630
<v Speaker 1>you go from a 19 to a 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit.</v>

562
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:40.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a big difference for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think like one ounce,</v>

563
00:26:40.181 --> 00:26:42.460
<v Speaker 1>like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you even notice you hold it in</v>

564
00:26:42.461 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 1>your hand after a you wouldn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice right</v>

565
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.750
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You notice notice in a big way.</v>

566
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that would work,</v>

567
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:53.570
<v Speaker 2>but some shit would work on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think once they figured out how to do </v>

568
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.260
<v Speaker 2>like some sort of a neurological input </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

569
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.030
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to be able to play on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a computer.</v>

570
00:26:58.031 --> 00:27:03.031
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna be able to feel the keys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be able to like if you </v>

571
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:03.350
<v Speaker 2>pull vault,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be able to feel the poll.</v>

572
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:06.540
<v Speaker 2>It will be able to feel the breeze as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go launching through the air.</v>

573
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.810
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff's gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Video game version of you on UFC two is </v>

574
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:15.771
<v Speaker 2>so creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome that I love it and it just the </v>

575
00:27:15.771 --> 00:27:18.621
<v Speaker 2>idea of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine taking that version of you by </v>

576
00:27:18.621 --> 00:27:22.340
<v Speaker 2>mixing the podcasts with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably could do something like </v>

577
00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:22.340
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be so real.</v>

578
00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know why I did that.</v>

579
00:27:23.581 --> 00:27:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I got out of doing more commentary to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

580
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Commentary is a commentary and a video </v>
<v Speaker 2>game is painstaking and it's one of the </v>

581
00:27:32.941 --> 00:27:34.680
<v Speaker 2>easiest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

582
00:27:34.681 --> 00:27:37.320
<v Speaker 2>that's me from my new ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all shredded now.</v>

583
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:42.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm the a guy that beat every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>player using you.</v>

584
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:48.110
<v Speaker 2>That's two hours sitting while talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>like doing like a podcast while he's </v>

585
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.110
<v Speaker 2>playing you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

586
00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.090
<v Speaker 2>So cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's real like you hid that from all</v>

587
00:27:51.091 --> 00:27:54.090
<v Speaker 2>of us to like none of us knew about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

588
00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:59.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't tell anybody I was supposed to </v>

589
00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.761
<v Speaker 2>be quiet about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to take off my clothes and put </v>

590
00:28:01.761 --> 00:28:03.350
<v Speaker 2>shorts on and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

591
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.440
<v Speaker 2>they spin it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

592
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.920
<v Speaker 2>you stand totally still and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go through a series of poses.</v>

593
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.240
<v Speaker 2>And so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

594
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:13.140
<v Speaker 2>like your hold your arms out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll hold your arms out like that.</v>

595
00:28:13.141 --> 00:28:16.080
<v Speaker 2>You do certain movements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I had a kick.</v>

596
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I had to throw any kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember now.</v>

597
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:21.500
<v Speaker 2>But your kick in the game looks like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kicked.</v>

598
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.310
<v Speaker 2>It looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks pretty real.</v>

599
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.070
<v Speaker 2>It looks all well they did the </v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques.</v>

600
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.680
<v Speaker 2>They've all analyze the techniques for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

601
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:31.170
<v Speaker 2>like did Jujitsu techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all super good.</v>

602
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.600
<v Speaker 2>The wrestling techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing and kicking.</v>

603
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 2>It's all like really good fundamentals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody,</v>

604
00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:39.150

<v Speaker 2>fundamentals in this game,</v>

605
00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:44.151
<v Speaker 2>their fundamentals are really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did such a good job also of really </v>

606
00:28:44.151 --> 00:28:47.130
<v Speaker 2>making the experience this time around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like just like the ring girls walking in</v>

607
00:28:47.131 --> 00:28:48.630
<v Speaker 2>the background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like everything.</v>

608

<v Speaker 2>that uncanny valley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crossing that uncanny valley.</v>

613
00:29:00.621 --> 00:29:00.710
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

615
00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.671
<v Speaker 2>up with the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial videos and videos of like </v>

00:29:12.931 --> 00:29:17.931
<v Speaker 2>everything show we went to Nvidia and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw the latest in their ability to </v>

619
00:29:17.931 --> 00:29:20.910
<v Speaker 2>recreate a person's face and they still </v>
<v Speaker 2>had problems with,</v>

620
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:22.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with tongues.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Tongues were a big one and hair and some</v>
<v Speaker 2>hair.</v>

622
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Just an eyes like eyeballs where your </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyeball connects to your eyelashes and </v>

623
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.190
<v Speaker 2>your eyelid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That looked a little funky.</v>

624
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.540
<v Speaker 2>But everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're like knocking on this door where</v>

631
00:29:50.561 --> 00:29:55.561
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be able to recreate </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and you're not going to be able </v>

632
00:29:55.561 --> 00:29:58.291
<v Speaker 1>to know whether or not you're watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's completely computer </v>

633
00:29:58.291 --> 00:30:00.961
<v Speaker 1>generated or something that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they did something recently that I </v>

634
00:30:00.961 --> 00:30:05.251
<v Speaker 1>tweeted a couple of days ago or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday where this guy superimposed </v>

635
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.560
<v Speaker 1>his facial expressions on George Bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so like he got,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's probably already happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He 100 percent.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of approval or something like that.</v>

647

653
00:30:50.401 --> 00:30:52.261
<v Speaker 1>George Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be like someone telling </v>

659
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.120
<v Speaker 1>That video can be fake as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have made that on your phone </v>

660
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.860
<v Speaker 1>with the face swap APP and shit that's </v>

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.810
<v Speaker 1>That shit's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just a little stupid program.</v>

662
00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.950
<v Speaker 1>How about the ones when they put tongues</v>
<v Speaker 1>on people like us doing this,</v>

663
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.720
<v Speaker 1>that is so crazy and he's obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerating.</v>

664
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:21.750
<v Speaker 1>He's making like big smiles and weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>side decide motions with his face just </v>

665
00:31:21.881 --> 00:31:26.800
<v Speaker 1>to show that they could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I guess how it works is they take a.</v>

666
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they're showing it right here.</v>

667
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:32.920
<v Speaker 1>They take a three dimensional moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>video of this guy's face.</v>

668
00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.490
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he's moving around,</v>

669
00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:41.610
<v Speaker 1>they take a three dimensional image of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other person's face and they map out</v>

670
00:31:41.801 --> 00:31:46.801
<v Speaker 1>where his mouth is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what the shape of his mouth is and </v>

671
00:31:46.801 --> 00:31:49.981
<v Speaker 1>they just have that guy's mouth do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements of the other guy is just </v>

672
00:31:49.981 --> 00:31:50.460
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

673
00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:56.060
<v Speaker 1>The smiles are off though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you see like Putin smile like Donald </v>

674
00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Trump's looks fake as fuck because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got such a weird mouth.</v>

675
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Like his range of motion in his mouth is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an old lady trying to do the </v>

676
00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.230
<v Speaker 1>splits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

677
00:32:04.231 --> 00:32:07.690
<v Speaker 1>In his mouth doesn't move very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a small mouth.</v>

678
00:32:07.691 --> 00:32:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a crazy technology.</v>

679
00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:13.660
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

680
00:32:13.661 --> 00:32:16.780
<v Speaker 1>they did this with Reagan way back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day with audio.</v>

681
00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:22.560
<v Speaker 1>There was a thing where someone had </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken a series of Ronald Reagan's </v>

682
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.880
<v Speaker 1>speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that?</v>

683
00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:29.920
<v Speaker 1>And they edited the audio to show the </v>
<v Speaker 1>know for Ronald Reagan to make some </v>

684
00:32:30.611 --> 00:32:33.820
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot all about that old school.</v>

685
00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.220
<v Speaker 1>It was old school and they played it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>tv and we're like,</v>

686
00:32:36.221 --> 00:32:41.221
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching that going well </v>

687
00:32:41.221 --> 00:32:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Nancy remix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan's speech went viral years </v>

688
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:45.050
<v Speaker 1>before Internet memes and that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long ass time ago.</v>

689
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.080
<v Speaker 1>You know what else went viral?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Gere in the Journal Story.</v>

690
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:51.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the real viral treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taco Bell,</v>

691
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that one is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people come,</v>

692
00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:59.780
<v Speaker 1>they come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's somebody eight come from a Taco </v>

693
00:32:59.780 --> 00:32:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Bell Burrito or something like that.</v>

694
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Did I guarantee that happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Richard Gere durable thing was a</v>

695
00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:06.890
<v Speaker 1>much better example because it's a story</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Eddie Bravo heard.</v>

696
00:33:06.891 --> 00:33:08.870
<v Speaker 1>He grew up in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up.</v>

697
00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:13.871
<v Speaker 1>I heard it in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We heard on the other side of the </v>

698
00:33:13.871 --> 00:33:13.871
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

699
00:33:13.871 --> 00:33:14.680
<v Speaker 1>this fucking store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew you heard it right?</v>

700
00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:17.780
<v Speaker 1>I almost think it was a Howard stern </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

701
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:20.180
<v Speaker 1>was the scientology thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly.</v>

702
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 1>That's the rumor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rumor was Richard Gere and left </v>

703
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.760
<v Speaker 1>scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientology decided to fucking drag them</v>

704
00:33:25.761 --> 00:33:27.310
<v Speaker 1>through the mud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

705
00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

706
00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:33.160
<v Speaker 1>I think scientology does not like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you leave and that's why people </v>

707
00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:37.160
<v Speaker 1>stay like the people that have left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fucking go after you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go after you hard and the people </v>

709
00:33:42.161 --> 00:33:42.800
<v Speaker 1>that that do leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time they just shut the fuck</v>

710
00:33:42.801 --> 00:33:47.801
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people that have left that have </v>

711
00:33:47.801 --> 00:33:47.801
<v Speaker 1>talked shit about them.</v>

712
00:33:47.801 --> 00:33:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

715
00:33:56.321 --> 00:33:59.711

<v Speaker 1>scientology crew showed up at their </v>

716
00:33:59.711 --> 00:34:03.911
<v Speaker 1>house and they filmed these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand like how creepy </v>

<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

726
00:34:24.661 --> 00:34:29.661
<v Speaker 1>David miscavige guy like one of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his relatives released book and </v>

727
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:33.260

<v Speaker 1>Like you can't talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

729
00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.380

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:41.650
<v Speaker 1>you know you've got a real problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can talk about being a </v>

731
00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:41.650
<v Speaker 1>baptist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

732
00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:44.060
<v Speaker 1>you could talk all day about growing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a Baptist church.</v>

733
00:34:44.061 --> 00:34:45.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody's going to fucking come after</v>

734
00:34:45.591 --> 00:34:47.510
<v Speaker 1>you because they're not doing anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

735
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.830
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

736
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:53.120
<v Speaker 1>even though it's a religion to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you can't talk about what you</v>

737
00:34:53.121 --> 00:34:55.160
<v Speaker 1>guys are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can't.</v>

738
00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Someone can't complain about what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

739
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:59.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Applied to the Catholic church,</v>

740
00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

741
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:09.490
<v Speaker 1>it seems like that day's coming though </v>
<v Speaker 1>when that shit gets exposed to being </v>

742
00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:14.150
<v Speaker 1>something cosby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're going to find way more about </v>

743
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.840
<v Speaker 1>scientology or Tom Cruise or any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

744
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:18.020
<v Speaker 1>all these people maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

745
00:35:18.021 --> 00:35:23.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's definitely gonna be harder </v>

746
00:35:23.021 --> 00:35:23.021
<v Speaker 1>for them to get people to listen.</v>

747
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to be easy.</v>

748
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.780
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the Internet,</v>

749
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:31.810
<v Speaker 1>you just had to have like a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful people that are part of a </v>

750
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:32.200
<v Speaker 1>group that were really friendly and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want it to be a part of it.</v>

751
00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.640
<v Speaker 1>You wanted to get in there with them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next thing you know,</v>

752
00:35:34.641 --> 00:35:36.770
<v Speaker 1>you have thousands and thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>members.</v>

753
00:35:36.771 --> 00:35:38.670
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't hard to do back then.</v>

754
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:42.860
<v Speaker 1>But now like you don't have to wait </v>
<v Speaker 1>until you're 10 years in,</v>

755
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:46.440
<v Speaker 1>find out about the fetus and the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

756
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:51.500
<v Speaker 1>where the bodies are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they fucking drop them into the </v>

757
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:55.851
<v Speaker 1>volcano and they're frozen or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you read the actual story that l</v>

758
00:35:56.641 --> 00:35:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Ron Hubbard wrote as detailed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

759
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.150
<v Speaker 1>in that going clear moving where the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>first read it and he was like,</v>

760
00:36:03.151 --> 00:36:06.900
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get that now.</v>

761
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:11.220
<v Speaker 1>So it's harder to get people to join now</v>
<v Speaker 1>with something like totally wacky.</v>

762
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.110
<v Speaker 1>But there's some other shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>sort of</v>

775

<v Speaker 4>It's just a message board.</v>

<v Speaker 4>aimed at helping them realize their true</v>

780
00:37:03.181 --> 00:37:05.520
<v Speaker 4>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sounds like something.</v>

<v Speaker 1>which may be okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

839
00:39:43.661 --> 00:39:46.490
<v Speaker 2>it took time to grow that beard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that beard.</v>

00:39:46.491 --> 00:39:47.440
<v Speaker 2>He's got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird,</v>

841
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.000
<v Speaker 2>funny Fu Manchu style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Long,</v>

842
00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.460
<v Speaker 2>long like goat beard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

843
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:54.940
<v Speaker 2>he's got one of those like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

844
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:58.630
<v Speaker 2>have you ever seen a Turkey beard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkeys have this weird thing.</v>

845
00:39:58.631 --> 00:40:01.270
<v Speaker 2>They grow out of the middle of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>chest is like this long beard.</v>

846
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.880
<v Speaker 2>It looks like some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the longer it is,</v>

847
00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:06.740
<v Speaker 2>the older the Turkey is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it becomes like a,</v>

848
00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I guess a part of the way they struck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were that big Turkey things weird.</v>

849
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's like they let the other </v>

850
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no bitch,</v>

<v Speaker 2>got grown off his chin.</v>

854
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.720
<v Speaker 2>So it's highly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's out of his fucking mind that,</v>

855
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.770
<v Speaker 2>that dude looks like the Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oregon people look like kind of like the</v>

856
00:40:29.771 --> 00:40:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Oregon state bird almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

857
00:40:31.831 --> 00:40:35.680
<v Speaker 2>why shouldn't I be able to live a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to wear that Fox hat because it was</v>

858
00:40:35.681 --> 00:40:38.770
<v Speaker 2>a girl at south south by southwest who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a fencer.</v>

859
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:43.950
<v Speaker 2>She's a competitive fencer and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to wear a full head garb and the </v>

860
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:45.250
<v Speaker 2>photos and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

861
00:40:45.251 --> 00:40:50.251
<v Speaker 2>you have to take that off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so south by southwest had to </v>

862
00:40:50.251 --> 00:40:51.820
<v Speaker 2>apologize because they asked her to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>her religious clothing off.</v>

863
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:53.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy should go to south by southwest</v>

864
00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:58.920
<v Speaker 2>where it's fucking Fox hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should all do that because it's all </v>

865
00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:58.920
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all ridiculous.</v>

866
00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:03.841
<v Speaker 2>Like any clothing that you have to wear </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to take your photos with </v>

867
00:41:03.841 --> 00:41:05.740
<v Speaker 2>that clothing in order for you to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>free,</v>

868
00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.800
<v Speaker 2>like the eastern religions made up.</v>

869
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so any clothing that you wear,</v>

870
00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:15.610
<v Speaker 2>any like fanatical garb that you wear </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go somewhere that's made up?</v>

871
00:41:15.611 --> 00:41:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if that's made up shit,</v>

872
00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.240
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to say you're Fox </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

873
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:21.580
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to say you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel aware octopus on your head.</v>

874
00:41:21.581 --> 00:41:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are reasons you're not supposed to</v>

875
00:41:23.321 --> 00:41:24.470
<v Speaker 2>have anything on your head because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

876
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.500
<v Speaker 2>You have to see what you look like with </v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

877
00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:29.050
<v Speaker 2>you know what you look like normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like base.</v>

878
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.900
<v Speaker 2>So if we're looking for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know your security.</v>

879
00:41:31.901 --> 00:41:35.990
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why you have an idea in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place because there's a lot of</v>

880
00:41:35.991 --> 00:41:40.670
<v Speaker 2>people like if you put on like a face </v>
<v Speaker 2>mask,</v>

881
00:41:40.671 --> 00:41:43.770
<v Speaker 2>like a skier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's where it's like it shows you a,</v>

882
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:48.790
<v Speaker 2>like from the eyebrows up is covered and</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the mouth down is covered.</v>

883
00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

884
00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:55.220
<v Speaker 2>You could be a million different people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to tell who you are without</v>

885
00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:58.190
<v Speaker 2>seeing your whole face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shape of your head,</v>

886
00:41:58.191 --> 00:42:00.200
<v Speaker 2>the color of your hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole deal.</v>

887
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:05.740
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that look </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking similar as hell and so to have </v>

888
00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:09.101
<v Speaker 2>an id in the law allow someone to wear </v>
<v Speaker 2>some really elaborate costume where your</v>

889
00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:14.330
<v Speaker 2>most of your heads covered and you say </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it because of your religion.</v>

890
00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're apologizing to her because </v>

892
00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.750
<v Speaker 2>of the wacky rules that she follows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't allow you to show your head like,</v>

893
00:42:23.751 --> 00:42:28.040
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 2016 folks.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

895
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.030

<v Speaker 2>Like the religious tolerance,</v>

896
00:42:32.031 --> 00:42:33.980
<v Speaker 2>it's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Religious tolerance.</v>

897
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.190
<v Speaker 2>It's we have to be tolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless they're Christian,</v>

898
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:42.430
<v Speaker 2>their Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could shit right in their mouth and </v>

<v Speaker 2>you could make the sign of the cross </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your shit on their forehead and no </v>

900
00:42:44.591 --> 00:42:44.591
<v Speaker 2>one cares.</v>

<v Speaker 2>totally okay to mock openly and make fun</v>

902
00:42:48.921 --> 00:42:52.310
<v Speaker 2>of nobody because you think you're a </v>

<v Speaker 2>part of your religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pope and training and I'm really low</v>

<v Speaker 2>the game doesn't even have to go to </v>

<v Speaker 2>A fake Dick.</v>

944
00:44:47.631 --> 00:44:52.610
<v Speaker 2>The only thing they could do is they'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to have some sort of a deposition </v>

945
00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:52.610
<v Speaker 2>with pulled it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows you.</v>

946
00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:55.710
<v Speaker 2>But he might be a shower and not a grow </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a grower and not a shower.</v>

947
00:44:56.010 --> 00:45:01.010
<v Speaker 2>So like he might have to get worked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to prove it or you're completely right </v>

948
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.980
<v Speaker 2>or it's just fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just grabbed some girls Dildo,</v>

949
00:45:01.981 --> 00:45:06.981
<v Speaker 2>put it in his shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a photo just to make everyone go </v>

950
00:45:06.981 --> 00:45:06.981
<v Speaker 2>home and go to the copy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a ticket.</v>

951
00:45:06.981 --> 00:45:06.981
<v Speaker 2>I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems connected.</v>

952
00:45:06.981 --> 00:45:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Well that's you though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to understand your unusual and </v>

953
00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:12.180
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's connected.</v>

954
00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Like is the Dick is connected to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at it,</v>

955
00:45:15.331 --> 00:45:17.010
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously like it doesn't look like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

956
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:22.070
<v Speaker 2>If it was a Dildo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be like a dropoff point at the </v>

957
00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:22.070
<v Speaker 2>base and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

958
00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:23.310
<v Speaker 2>How exactly is this thing attached?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

959
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.260
<v Speaker 2>What they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that you stick onto the side of</v>

960
00:45:25.261 --> 00:45:27.600
<v Speaker 2>the wall of the shower maybe just went </v>
<v Speaker 2>like on his.</v>

961
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be like he talked,</v>

962
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:32.790
<v Speaker 2>he talked and had that one too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even if he stuck it in,</v>

963
00:45:32.791 --> 00:45:37.791
<v Speaker 2>it would be going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be off to the side like </v>

964
00:45:37.791 --> 00:45:37.791
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have spandex,</v>

965
00:45:37.791 --> 00:45:39.390
<v Speaker 2>he probably just put it to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those long double ended.</v>

966
00:45:39.391 --> 00:45:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Once you know that the long snake one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not connected though.</v>

967
00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

968
00:45:43.201 --> 00:45:44.400
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stared at his dick.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

971

<v Speaker 2>fucking oatmeal box in his pants.</v>

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:15.120
<v Speaker 1>these fucking things are hilarious and </v>

<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a funny idea.</v>

1018
00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:20.610
<v Speaker 1>They're not being made by professionals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which kind of shows you what we have </v>

1019
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:24.361
<v Speaker 1>said all along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a lot of funny people out </v>

<v Speaker 1>there that don't ever do anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't ever become like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's hilarious.</v>

1024
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:38.730

<v Speaker 1>most people just knew him as a Jujitsu </v>

1025
00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:38.730
<v Speaker 1>instructor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But he was built.</v>

1028
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.000
<v Speaker 1>He was busy with a bunch of other shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and never pursued it,</v>

1029
00:48:46.001 --> 00:48:48.860
<v Speaker 1>but he actually did a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember he.</v>

1030
00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:52.360
<v Speaker 1>I thought I heard he was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did well a few times.</v>

1031
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:56.890
<v Speaker 1>He did like he had nine sets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did nine times and I was nine times.</v>

1032
00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:02.980
<v Speaker 1>A few of them were like the Hindenburg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few of them were like,</v>

1033
00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:05.890
<v Speaker 1>he just wanted to just quit life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were bad.</v>

1034
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.870
<v Speaker 1>A few of them were bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just didn't work,</v>

1035
00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:12.250
<v Speaker 1>but a few of them were funny man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a few of them that were really</v>

1036
00:49:12.251 --> 00:49:14.350
<v Speaker 1>funny and then there was other ones that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were like a little a mix,</v>

1037
00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:16.780
<v Speaker 1>a mix of like really funny and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that didn't work,</v>

1038
00:49:16.781 --> 00:49:20.050
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like everything else in this world,</v>

1039
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.390
<v Speaker 1>it seems way easier than it is.</v>

1040
00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:24.840
<v Speaker 1>It just does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you look at bowling.</v>

1041
00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just grabbed that stupid ball and roll </v>

1042
00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:30.420
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How hard could that be?</v>

1043
00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's hard because you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have pros like they have </v>

1044
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:35.890
<v Speaker 1>tournaments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they play on tv,</v>

1045
00:49:35.891 --> 00:49:38.240
<v Speaker 1>they roll the ball better than the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people rolled the ball.</v>

1046
00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Just like subtle nuances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will.</v>

1047
00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:43.570
<v Speaker 1>They have special shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They slide when they released the ball,</v>

1048
00:49:43.571 --> 00:49:48.571
<v Speaker 1>they have gloves and they spin the ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>as they release it and they wanted to </v>

1049
00:49:48.571 --> 00:49:52.021
<v Speaker 1>hit that front pin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's perfect way and it seems so </v>

1050
00:49:52.021 --> 00:49:54.280
<v Speaker 1>fucking easy if you're outside looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the outside in,</v>

1051
00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:57.130
<v Speaker 1>at bowling you but shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can fucking do that.</v>

1052
00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:59.380
<v Speaker 1>But if you've never bowled in your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go out and try it,</v>

1053
00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you going to be bad?</v>

1054
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with everything,</v>

1055
00:50:03.221 --> 00:50:08.221
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything you name it it all things </v>

1056
00:50:08.221 --> 00:50:08.221
<v Speaker 1>that look easy.</v>

1057
00:50:08.221 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Like that fucking gay guy talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay porn with a different ending.</v>

1058
00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you think his speeches are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not easy.</v>

1059
00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Like what that guy's doing the way he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>

1060
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:20.050
<v Speaker 1>even though it's silly and gay and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got jokes thrown in there.</v>

1061
00:50:20.051 --> 00:50:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Like it's fucking delivery is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>goddamn smooth.</v>

1062
00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:25.180
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

1063
00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he knows what he's doing.</v>

1064
00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Like he how he's being perceived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's adjusting.</v>

1065
00:50:30.141 --> 00:50:33.080
<v Speaker 1>He's pausing in the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying it the right way.</v>

1066
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:38.320
<v Speaker 1>You take the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make him stand up and give a speech </v>

1067
00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.741
<v Speaker 1>about mma in front of a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in suits in some room like that </v>

1068
00:50:41.741 --> 00:50:45.800
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a built in joke though.</v>

1069
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows he's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all he has to do is talk about guys</v>

1070
00:50:48.891 --> 00:50:53.891
<v Speaker 1>being hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll do that to disarm the </v>

1071
00:50:53.891 --> 00:50:53.891
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

1072
00:50:53.891 --> 00:50:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Like gay guys have that built in thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can always talk about guys being </v>

1073
00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:56.900
<v Speaker 1>hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1074
00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:01.960
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard for me to concentrate up </v>
<v Speaker 1>here with all these hot guys in the </v>

1075
00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:05.891
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he'd say things like that and then </v>

1076
00:51:05.891 --> 00:51:07.780
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they break the ice and people start </v>

1077
00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:07.780
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

1078
00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:09.710
<v Speaker 1>there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it ain't easy man.</v>

1079
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:12.530
<v Speaker 1>So Eddie tried it and it just was too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much time.</v>

1080
00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:15.500
<v Speaker 1>He was busy with his music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's busy teaching.</v>

1081
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:18.710
<v Speaker 1>He's busy competing at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He still competing so he quit.</v>

1082
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.530
<v Speaker 1>He didn't wanna do it anymore because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was right around the time when he fought</v>

1083
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:24.920
<v Speaker 1>and fought and Abu Dhabi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was right around when I was trying it</v>

1084
00:51:24.921 --> 00:51:26.210
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he could do it.</v>

1085
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Especially now because he's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching for so long.</v>

1086
00:51:28.701 --> 00:51:33.701
<v Speaker 1>He's getting really comfortable with </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking in front of people and in his </v>

1087
00:51:33.701 --> 00:51:33.701
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

1088
00:51:33.701 --> 00:51:37.900
<v Speaker 1>He's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes in his classes he'll say </v>

1089
00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:38.120
<v Speaker 1>hilarious shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just not planned out.</v>

1090
00:51:38.121 --> 00:51:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Not Jokes he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll just,</v>

1091
00:51:39.591 --> 00:51:42.320
<v Speaker 1>something will come up and he'll say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something or you know,</v>

1092
00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.060
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's like his classes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

1093
00:51:44.061 --> 00:51:49.061
<v Speaker 1>Like one time he came in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about some Ufo </v>

1094
00:51:49.061 --> 00:51:51.431
<v Speaker 1>documentary that he saw me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1095
00:51:51.501 --> 00:51:55.020
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus stopped with the chem trails.</v>

1096
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:56.720
<v Speaker 1>It was talking about Kim Charles the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day.</v>

1097
00:51:57.010 --> 00:52:02.010
<v Speaker 1>It still know he's still doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They some new documentary documents that</v>

1098
00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:06.130
<v Speaker 1>they're approving over La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were putting spraying over the last</v>

1099
00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:11.130
<v Speaker 1>couple of months told you that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>never not admitted to to doing it.</v>

1100
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.120
<v Speaker 1>But hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the difference.</v>

1101
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:16.460
<v Speaker 1>What they have admitted to and what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1102
00:52:16.461 --> 00:52:21.461
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they do an Abu Dhabi on a regular </v>

1103
00:52:21.461 --> 00:52:21.461
<v Speaker 1>basis is they do cloud seeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1104
00:52:21.461 --> 00:52:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Cloud seeding is absolutely real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they do is they figure out how </v>

1105
00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:28.470
<v Speaker 1>to make it rain and they spray some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of silver iodine.</v>

1106
00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out what the fuck they spray to </v>

1107
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.510
<v Speaker 1>reflect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1108
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1109
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.510
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

1110
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:34.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey shit.</v>

1111
00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:37.040
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the silver stuff somehow or another,</v>

1112
00:52:37.041 --> 00:52:40.580
<v Speaker 1>when you spray it in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it coalesces.</v>

1113
00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:45.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the wrong word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It somehow or another attracts these </v>

1114
00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:46.160
<v Speaker 1>clouds to form and that you can make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>rain.</v>

1115
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:51.400
<v Speaker 1>And Abi Dhabi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've made it rain once a week for a </v>

1116
00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.940
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make it rain there like once a week</v>

1117
00:52:52.941 --> 00:52:56.000
<v Speaker 1>they just fucking spray the Scott and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the desert,</v>

1118
00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:59.390
<v Speaker 1>silver iodide potassium iodide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1119
00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Which by the way is absolutely a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different substance than what these </v>

1120
00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:06.770
<v Speaker 1>people are claiming is in these chem </v>
<v Speaker 1>trails.</v>

1121
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.930
<v Speaker 1>That was the problem with doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1122
00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Like that Joe Rogan questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything show like the people have </v>

1123
00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.800
<v Speaker 1>some shit in their head and they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1124
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.500
<v Speaker 1>they just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what they believe.</v>

1125
00:53:18.501 --> 00:53:22.640
<v Speaker 1>It's locked in there and they don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to accept other information.</v>

1126
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Like this one guy that made this </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary on chem trails,</v>

1127
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had made two documentaries on </v>
<v Speaker 1>chem trails and he said he had evidence.</v>

1128
00:53:30.331 --> 00:53:35.331
<v Speaker 1>He had evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have tested the water and the water </v>

1129
00:53:35.331 --> 00:53:36.970
<v Speaker 1>shows high levels of aluminum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why is there aluminum in the Wa?</v>

1130
00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out,</v>

1131
00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:43.850
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dirt all across the world has </v>

1132
00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:44.670
<v Speaker 1>aluminum in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really common.</v>

1133
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:49.730
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most common things </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find like as far as like a </v>

1134
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:53.090
<v Speaker 1>metals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's super common for aluminum to </v>

1135
00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:53.090
<v Speaker 1>be in the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they get aluminum.</v>

1136
00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the ground.</v>

1137
00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:58.731
<v Speaker 1>It's all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when this guy showed me his </v>

1138
00:53:58.731 --> 00:53:58.731
<v Speaker 1>paperwork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1139
00:53:58.731 --> 00:54:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you the tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hands me this paper and I.</v>

1140
00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:03.260
<v Speaker 1>and it says sludge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

1141
00:54:03.261 --> 00:54:05.310
<v Speaker 1>well why is this a sludge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1142
00:54:05.311 --> 00:54:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I gave them water.</v>

1143
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.820
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what it says at the lab.</v>

1144
00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:11.370
<v Speaker 1>They tested it and they said it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sludge.</v>

1145
00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:14.820
<v Speaker 1>So what is sludge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1146
00:54:14.821 --> 00:54:17.010
<v Speaker 1>well I don't know what his slides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well let's Google it.</v>

1147
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Sludge I think is water mixed with shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and water and dirt.</v>

1148
00:54:21.721 --> 00:54:23.040
<v Speaker 1>That's what sledges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I go,</v>

1149
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:28.041
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you admit that dirt has aluminum in </v>

1150
00:54:28.041 --> 00:54:28.041
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1151
00:54:28.041 --> 00:54:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

1152
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this water did not have dirty,</v>

1153
00:54:30.931 --> 00:54:33.870
<v Speaker 1>but it says sludge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means water and dirt.</v>

1154
00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:38.430
<v Speaker 1>So your water and dirt tested positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>for water and dirt.</v>

1155
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your sludge tested positive for </v>

1156
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.100
<v Speaker 1>being dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1157
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Did you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't prove that they're spraying </v>

1158
00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:49.550
<v Speaker 1>shit in the air like this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

1159
00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:54.181
<v Speaker 1>if they sprayed shit in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would look different than fucking </v>

1160
00:54:54.181 --> 00:54:57.231
<v Speaker 1>clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what a cloud is is moisture here </v>

1161
00:54:57.231 --> 00:55:01.400
<v Speaker 1>moisture and when you have a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of condensation in the air and </v>

1162
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.490
<v Speaker 1>you send those fucking jet engines </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it,</v>

1163
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:07.670
<v Speaker 1>it spirals and it's got all this massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>power and heat and it changes the </v>

1164
00:55:08.131 --> 00:55:11.580
<v Speaker 1>temperature of the air in those funnels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those tubes,</v>

1165
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.550
<v Speaker 1>it creates artificial clouds like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making this up.</v>

1166
00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:19.550
<v Speaker 1>This is all science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the scientists have figured this </v>

1167
00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:22.161
<v Speaker 1>out fucking decades and decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like this is a beaten into the </v>

1168
00:55:22.161 --> 00:55:26.691
<v Speaker 1>ground subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They absolutely know that you can do </v>

1169
00:55:26.691 --> 00:55:29.391
<v Speaker 1>that is this is 100 percent proven that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can send a jet engine to certain </v>

1170
00:55:29.391 --> 00:55:30.480
<v Speaker 1>levels of condensation and people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1171
00:55:30.481 --> 00:55:33.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come she turns on and turns off?</v>

1172
00:55:33.001 --> 00:55:34.950
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look up in the sky.</v>

1173
00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever notice that clouds aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>uniform across the entire sky?</v>

1174
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:44.630
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because moisture's not uniform across </v>

1175
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:47.301
<v Speaker 1>the entire sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you'll be fucking driving and </v>

1176
00:55:47.301 --> 00:55:48.810
<v Speaker 1>it'll be raining in one area and he'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive to another area and you could pass</v>

1177
00:55:48.811 --> 00:55:51.650
<v Speaker 1>through an area where it's not raining </v>
<v Speaker 1>and into a new area.</v>

1178
00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.160
<v Speaker 1>It's raining again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're laughing.</v>

1179
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We drove from the rainy part into the </v>

1180
00:55:58.280 --> 00:55:58.280
<v Speaker 1>fucking drug part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do that.</v>

1181
00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why would you not assume that the air</v>

1182
00:56:00.211 --> 00:56:03.090
<v Speaker 1>in the sky would be very similar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>

1183
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it is like this is.</v>

1184
00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:09.120
<v Speaker 1>This is a dumb theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of fucking conspiracy</v>

1185
00:56:09.121 --> 00:56:13.200
<v Speaker 1>theories that everybody should look into</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a lot of them that are legit as fuck.</v>

1186
00:56:13.201 --> 00:56:18.201
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of false flags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of lying to the American </v>

1187
00:56:18.201 --> 00:56:22.671
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking Gulf of Tonkin that got us </v>

1188
00:56:22.671 --> 00:56:25.281
<v Speaker 1>into Vietnam's based on bullshit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>operation northwoods hundred percent </v>

1189
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:30.510
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and lies all the shit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking William Randolph hearst did to </v>

1190
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:31.870
<v Speaker 1>get marijuana illegal in the reefer </v>
<v Speaker 1>madness.</v>

1191
00:56:31.871 --> 00:56:36.871
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of real life conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as you start believe in </v>

1192
00:56:36.941 --> 00:56:40.720
<v Speaker 1>something and you're unwilling to accept</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that you might be wrong,</v>

1193
00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:44.950
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a fucking problem and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>get mad at me on twitter like,</v>

1194
00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this youtube documentary.</v>

1195
00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it.</v>

1196
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:51.580
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean people haven't sprayed </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit in the sky before folks,</v>

1197
00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:55.840
<v Speaker 1>but when you're looking at those goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 1>trails that happened behind jets,</v>

1198
00:56:56.020 --> 00:57:00.370
<v Speaker 1>that is normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is just what happens when you fly a</v>

1199
00:57:00.371 --> 00:57:02.780
<v Speaker 1>jet through the atmosphere and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

1200
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:05.620
<v Speaker 1>People should be worried about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking jet fuel.</v>

1201
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:07.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what they should be worried </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1202
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Everybody that lives around airports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all get like high rates of </v>

1203
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:14.440
<v Speaker 1>respiratory illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was just like a real scandal there.</v>

1204
00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:17.740
<v Speaker 1>That's the the real scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you live near an airport,</v>

1205
00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:20.320
<v Speaker 1>you're breeding that fucking burning jet</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuel.</v>

1206
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.290
<v Speaker 1>If you work at an airport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted those baggage handlers,</v>

1207
00:57:23.291 --> 00:57:25.030
<v Speaker 1>one of those dudes is on the strip every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1208
00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you breathing in every day?</v>

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's real health concerns there.</v>

1210
00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

1211
00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:32.920
<v Speaker 1>how?</v>

1212
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:35.320
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a big deal it would be if we really</v>

1213
00:57:35.321 --> 00:57:40.321
<v Speaker 1>found out the government was spraying </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and the sky above us and for what </v>

1214
00:57:40.321 --> 00:57:40.840
<v Speaker 1>reason?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>

1215
00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Is it mind control?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's not working is to try to </v>

1216
00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:45.970
<v Speaker 1>make everybody ill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not working either.</v>

1217
00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Topics so much doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and adorable subject.</v>

1218
00:57:50.471 --> 00:57:55.471
<v Speaker 1>It's adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know we're going to find out the </v>

1219
00:57:55.471 --> 00:57:55.471
<v Speaker 1>planes that crashed into the World Trade</v>
<v Speaker 1>Center,</v>

1220
00:57:55.471 --> 00:57:58.510
<v Speaker 1>work a crop dusting at the timer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing chem trails.</v>

1221
00:57:58.511 --> 00:58:03.460
<v Speaker 1>There's something that'd be funny if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>combine conspiracy to do this.</v>

1222
00:58:03.461 --> 00:58:04.780
<v Speaker 1>People who don't even believe they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>real plain.</v>

1223
00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1224
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:11.040
<v Speaker 1>There's people who think that those were</v>
<v Speaker 1>holograms and then they'll show you in </v>

1225
00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:11.040
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1226
00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:15.871
<v Speaker 1>you can see there's a pixelation on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left wing people.</v>

1227
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Their brains are broken man and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not getting any </v>

1228
00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:21.120
<v Speaker 1>postings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a good point.</v>

1229
00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Where you guys are talking about just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit ago,</v>

1230
00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:25.860
<v Speaker 1>like video at some point won't be enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence for proof.</v>

1231
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's right now.</v>

1232
00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it's real close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think rule right now we're looking at </v>

1233
00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:33.250
<v Speaker 1>some normal shit that's showing us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube ads,</v>

1234
00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:38.700
<v Speaker 1>but in the darkest halls of justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what foot governments </v>

1235
00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:42.540
<v Speaker 1>government back in the Justice League of</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

1236
00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:47.550
<v Speaker 1>fucking Superhero compounds and Xavier </v>
<v Speaker 1>President of Xavier or Professor Xavier,</v>

1237
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I think the highest levels of all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like,</v>

1238
00:58:51.971 --> 00:58:53.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that magic leap shit.</v>

1239
00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at what they release and </v>

1240
00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:01.351
<v Speaker 1>we're watching these little videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're putting out and it looks cool </v>

1241
00:59:01.351 --> 00:59:01.351
<v Speaker 1>and everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're,</v>

1242
00:59:01.351 --> 00:59:05.041
<v Speaker 1>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting the consumer version of </v>

1243
00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:08.131
<v Speaker 1>the report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the people that are working on it </v>

1244
00:59:08.131 --> 00:59:10.581
<v Speaker 1>at the highest level where you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to their office and sign </v>

1245
00:59:10.581 --> 00:59:10.581
<v Speaker 1>nondisclosures and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1246
00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:14.350
<v Speaker 1>like I went to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nvidia offices.</v>

1247
00:59:14.351 --> 00:59:16.360
<v Speaker 1>And when you go in there and they show </v>
<v Speaker 1>you all your stuff,</v>

1248
00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:18.040
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to.</v>

1249
00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't like take videos of it other </v>

1250
00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:23.370
<v Speaker 1>than the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they allow you to,</v>

1251
00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:27.340
<v Speaker 2>they'll show you some stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they released their stuff very </v>

1252
00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:27.530
<v Speaker 2>carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't give out the specifications of</v>

1253
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:29.900
<v Speaker 2>how they make their things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because it's all,</v>

1254
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.570
<v Speaker 2>there's a big technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>race is constantly on,</v>

1255
00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.870
<v Speaker 2>you just get assigned non disclosures </v>
<v Speaker 2>for any of these things.</v>

1256
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Now when you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1257
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.280
<v Speaker 2>motion capture for a video game or any </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those,</v>

1258
00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:45.310
<v Speaker 2>those things to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make you sign all this paperwork </v>

1259
00:59:45.310 --> 00:59:45.310
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ain't that easy.</v>

1260
00:59:45.310 --> 00:59:49.570
<v Speaker 2>So the people that are at the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of creating the CGI effects,</v>

1261
00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:53.420
<v Speaker 2>we have no idea like how good they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1262
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:55.580
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get better every year.</v>

1263
00:59:56.180 --> 01:00:01.180
<v Speaker 2>So like if we go to like one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>CGI labs does shit for movies and see </v>

1264
01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.500
<v Speaker 2>how good that stuff looks better to blow</v>
<v Speaker 2>you away.</v>

1265
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:06.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's been happening for awhile.</v>

1266
01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.450
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's shit that we don't know</v>

1267
01:00:08.451 --> 01:00:08.780
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1268
01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:10.520
<v Speaker 2>We'll think about the movies that come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1269
01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those fucking movies like Jurassic Park,</v>

1270
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.290
<v Speaker 2>the new Jurassic Park,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was insane.</v>

1271
01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.750
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of goofy movie,</v>

1272
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:22.430
<v Speaker 2>but it was an insane showcase for like </v>
<v Speaker 2>full state of the art,</v>

1273
01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:27.580
<v Speaker 2>Cgi Shit that's available right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the dinosaurs looked incredible </v>

1274
01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.830
<v Speaker 2>like that took like how long I think to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make over a year.</v>

1275
01:00:30.831 --> 01:00:35.831
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the technology that was </v>

1276
01:00:35.831 --> 01:00:35.831
<v Speaker 2>available when they first started doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that project.</v>

1277
01:00:35.831 --> 01:00:36.860
<v Speaker 2>So like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

1278
01:00:36.861 --> 01:00:38.420
<v Speaker 2>two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say two years ago,</v>

1279
01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.000
<v Speaker 2>what can they do now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can they do in five years?</v>

1280
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:43.100
<v Speaker 2>I go to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're showing us.</v>

1281
01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's popped off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is called the climb.</v>

1282
01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.000
<v Speaker 2>It's a mountain climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1283
01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:48.800
<v Speaker 2>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1284
01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:50.870
<v Speaker 2>You no hands your arms.</v>

1285
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:52.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just have hands it shows you.</v>

1286
01:00:52.561 --> 01:00:57.561
<v Speaker 5>But the way that they've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the scale on what you see when you get </v>

1287
01:00:57.561 --> 01:01:01.311
<v Speaker 5>up to like climbing the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mountains and the amount of detail they </v>

1288
01:01:01.311 --> 01:01:03.450
<v Speaker 5>put in here so you can like put your </v>
<v Speaker 5>face all the way up to your hand and see</v>

1289
01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:06.530
<v Speaker 5>the stitches in the gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They look,</v>

1290
01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:09.000
<v Speaker 5>it looks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw a little more of an explanation on</v>

1291
01:01:09.001 --> 01:01:09.480
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

1292
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:13.170
<v Speaker 5>it seems like why would I want to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that for fun?</v>

1293
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1299
01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.720
<v Speaker 2>and was just climbing on a crane and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing handstands for fun.</v>

1300
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he also does leaps.</v>

1301
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:33.530
<v Speaker 2>He'll lead from the top of one building </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the other,</v>

01:01:34.551 --> 01:01:39.551
<v Speaker 2>He's still in the corner of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>building and leaped across the street </v>

1304
01:01:39.551 --> 01:01:43.480
<v Speaker 2>and landed on another building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like these guys are serious fucking </v>

1305
01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:45.530

1334
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:54.810
<v Speaker 2>Another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1335
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's hanging.</v>

1336
01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:05.010
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1337
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy's out of his fucking mind.</v>

1338
01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.660
<v Speaker 2>This is so hard to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard.</v>

1339
01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:17.980
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to watch when you're not </v>

1340
01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:17.980
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Facebook here is this facebook,</v>

1341
01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:20.760
<v Speaker 2>James l Kingston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's out of his mind.</v>

1342
01:03:20.761 --> 01:03:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That dude's out of his fucking mind,</v>

1343
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:27.130
<v Speaker 2>but that's how we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like Alex honnold.</v>

1344
01:03:27.131 --> 01:03:27.730
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's.</v>

1345
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's differ.</v>

1346
01:03:29.011 --> 01:03:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully he's getting paid for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>

1347
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.210
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1348
01:03:33.211 --> 01:03:35.550
<v Speaker 2>I think what he's both equally crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1349
01:03:35.551 --> 01:03:40.500
<v Speaker 2>what he's doing is illegal with Alex </v>
<v Speaker 2>honnold does is a sport young Jamie.</v>

1350
01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:43.380
<v Speaker 2>I know what Alex does is pretty nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

1351
01:03:43.381 --> 01:03:48.381
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the climbing dudes like the hardcore </v>

1352
01:03:48.381 --> 01:03:51.291
<v Speaker 2>climbing guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fall into one or two camps when it </v>

1353
01:03:51.291 --> 01:03:52.800
<v Speaker 2>comes to Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>either they revere him or they,</v>

1354
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:57.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think he's a real problem and they </v>

1355
01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:57.830
<v Speaker 2>think he's going to die.</v>

1356
01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:58.030
<v Speaker 2>Like there was this one documentary they</v>
<v Speaker 2>did about a more,</v>

1357
01:03:58.031 --> 01:04:03.031
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those pieces that he did about </v>

1358
01:04:03.031 --> 01:04:04.581
<v Speaker 2>them were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talked this one old school climber </v>

1359
01:04:04.581 --> 01:04:04.581
<v Speaker 2>who uses ropes and the whole deal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1360
01:04:04.581 --> 01:04:06.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not a matter of if he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>

1361
01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:12.050
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy was just like being a real </v>

1362
01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:14.340
<v Speaker 2>negative about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I don't understand is because when</v>

1363
01:04:14.341 --> 01:04:19.341
<v Speaker 2>I watch a guy like Alex Honnold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say obviously he knows what the fuck </v>

1364
01:04:19.341 --> 01:04:23.721
<v Speaker 2>he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing it all the time and he </v>

1365
01:04:23.721 --> 01:04:26.661
<v Speaker 2>continues to do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why do you assume that one day he's </v>

1366
01:04:26.661 --> 01:04:27.900
<v Speaker 2>going to have a mental lapse and not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do it?</v>

1367
01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can do it.</v>

1368
01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Is he doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing it right.</v>

1369
01:04:30.511 --> 01:04:32.280
<v Speaker 2>He's doing it okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well if he's doing it,</v>

1370
01:04:32.281 --> 01:04:33.360
<v Speaker 2>he can continue to do it.</v>

1371
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:36.540
<v Speaker 2>The less his handbrakes unless he gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>

1372
01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.780
<v Speaker 2>unless he stops working out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean why,</v>

1373
01:04:38.781 --> 01:04:43.781
<v Speaker 2>why is he not going to be able to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well one day he's going to fall like </v>

1374
01:04:43.781 --> 01:04:46.470
<v Speaker 2>what are you hex in him and putting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking the Kibosh on him.</v>

1375
01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.520
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1376
01:04:47.521 --> 01:04:51.000
<v Speaker 2>you don't know he's going to fall like </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's doing is very dangerous.</v>

1377
01:04:51.001 --> 01:04:56.001
<v Speaker 2>But he might do it forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might be able to do it until he's 80 </v>

1378
01:04:56.001 --> 01:04:56.280
<v Speaker 2>and then quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might know what he's doing.</v>

1379
01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.530
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1380
01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:00.630
<v Speaker 2>he goes over those courses with a rope </v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

1381
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:04.800
<v Speaker 2>he knows he's got a path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he doesn't just climb something and</v>

1382
01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:09.801
<v Speaker 2>hope he could figure out how to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes through these things with ropes </v>

1383
01:05:09.811 --> 01:05:12.480
<v Speaker 2>first and then once he goes through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things with ropes,</v>

1384
01:05:12.481 --> 01:05:16.650
<v Speaker 2>he sees his path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he marks it and it goes even even still,</v>

1385
01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:18.150
<v Speaker 2>I guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why</v>

1386
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:23.160
<v Speaker 4>are they think it's bad that he might </v>
<v Speaker 4>die doing it because it shows other </v>

1387
01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:26.041
<v Speaker 4>people that on a bad path to take on </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly the reason why they think it's </v>

1388
01:05:26.041 --> 01:05:28.390
<v Speaker 4>so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then we should stop having Nascar.</v>

1389
01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:29.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1390
01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:32.500
<v Speaker 4>Things you can do that will kill you </v>
<v Speaker 4>that aren't even that dangerous.</v>

1391
01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching a girl yesterday on the </v>

1392
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:37.600
<v Speaker 1>fucking highway at night wearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>sunglasses,</v>

1393
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.250
<v Speaker 1>scrolling through her facebook in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law in the left lane.</v>

1394
01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:42.380
<v Speaker 1>The far left lane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were honking.</v>

1395
01:05:42.381 --> 01:05:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Is there a passenger?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't give a fuck.</v>

1396
01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>She's fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's probably eating while she was </v>

1397
01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:51.050
<v Speaker 1>driving to big fat face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking down at her phone,</v>

1398
01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:54.140
<v Speaker 1>scrolling through her pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just careless,</v>

1399
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:59.150
<v Speaker 1>careless American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to everything that would be people.</v>

1400
01:05:59.151 --> 01:06:01.120
<v Speaker 1>If they're wanting to mock America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1401
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>she's probably looking at Kim </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kardashians.</v>

1402
01:06:02.811 --> 01:06:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had sunglasses on.</v>

1403
01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:10.120
<v Speaker 1>She's driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were their big overfed face and she's </v>

1404
01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:13.721
<v Speaker 1>scrolling through putting everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>around her in danger because she's </v>

1405
01:06:13.721 --> 01:06:14.420
<v Speaker 1>barely paying attention and she's doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scroll lean.</v>

1406
01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Here's something that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize when they're scrolling,</v>

1407
01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:20.090
<v Speaker 1>if they have their hand on the steering </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheel and they have their phone,</v>

1408
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:23.990
<v Speaker 1>they do this where they lean over </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards their phone.</v>

1409
01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.410
<v Speaker 1>So like if you look at her from behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1410
01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.590
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1411
01:06:27.591 --> 01:06:32.591
<v Speaker 1>why is this bitch gone 60 miles an hour?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look it over and because everybody </v>

1412
01:06:32.591 --> 01:06:33.620
<v Speaker 1>else was flying by and left and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and she's in the left lane.</v>

1413
01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.590
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the glow from her phone,</v>

1414
01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:41.680
<v Speaker 1>which is a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then her head is like all the way </v>

1415
01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:44.831
<v Speaker 1>over to the right side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this picture is like barely paying </v>

1416
01:06:44.831 --> 01:06:45.500
<v Speaker 1>attention to what she's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1417
01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:50.120
<v Speaker 1>she barely paying attention and she had </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking sunglasses on and it's dark out.</v>

1418
01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:55.690
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was hilariously American</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she probably had a trump bumper </v>

1419
01:06:55.690 --> 01:06:57.530
<v Speaker 1>sticker on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a mount,</v>

1420
01:06:57.531 --> 01:07:00.030
<v Speaker 1>so I just put my ipad pro right in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the move to.</v>

1421
01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:02.000
<v Speaker 1>She's probably on her way to Ted Cruz's </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

1422
01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:03.470
<v Speaker 1>She's going to go fuck them.</v>

1423
01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:09.610
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen that documentary that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on,</v>

1424
01:07:09.611 --> 01:07:10.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe that?</v>

1425
01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:13.200
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what we're talking about?</v>

1426
01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:15.880
<v Speaker 4>Five women have come out or they said </v>
<v Speaker 4>five women.</v>

1427
01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.420
<v Speaker 4>Ted Cruz is having an affair with five </v>
<v Speaker 4>different women.</v>

1428
01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:23.720
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kudos because you know if you're going </v>

<v Speaker 4>go deep.</v>

1430
01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:28.190
<v Speaker 4>Have a gang of them and they said that </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of them even worked for trump now.</v>

1431
01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.470
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you do it.</v>

1452
01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:24.911
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched Hillary Clinton yesterday on </v>

1453
01:08:24.911 --> 01:08:24.911
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Kimmel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that video now?</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Kimmel did a really fucking smart </v>

1455
01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:29.470
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very funny.</v>

1456
01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:34.150
<v Speaker 1>He set up this thing where he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>hillary come on and he told her about </v>

1457
01:08:34.150 --> 01:08:38.261
<v Speaker 1>mansplaining and he asked her if she </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew what mansplaining was and then she </v>

1458
01:08:38.261 --> 01:08:41.320
<v Speaker 1>started giving her explanation and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrected her course.</v>

1459
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:46.600
<v Speaker 1>And so then he had her go up and give </v>
<v Speaker 1>her speeches and he told her how she </v>

1460
01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.370
<v Speaker 1>probably should actually dress and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>she should talk.</v>

1461
01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:52.850
<v Speaker 1>And he basically mansplained his way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the whole thing.</v>

1462
01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Can we play this or will this get us </v>

1481
01:09:32.721 --> 01:09:33.530
<v Speaker 1>But since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1482
01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:34.640
<v Speaker 1>he's a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice guy.</v>

1483
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.630
<v Speaker 1>He can get away with being a fake Dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

1484
01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:39.560
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It almost made her likable.</v>

1485
01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Quite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not feeling the Bern.</v>

1486
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:45.290
<v Speaker 1>I feel the burn more than I feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>

1487
01:09:45.350 --> 01:09:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like burning and I've said this before</v>

1488
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:51.500
<v Speaker 1>because the social stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what he represents socially will</v>

1489
01:09:51.501 --> 01:09:55.820
<v Speaker 1>be a good like uniting of our country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it'll help us.</v>

1490
01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.600
<v Speaker 1>I think what trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he represents socialists,</v>

1491
01:09:59.601 --> 01:10:04.601
<v Speaker 1>the thing that disturbs me the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when he says things about like </v>

1492
01:10:04.601 --> 01:10:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans and that kind of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>

1493
01:10:06.171 --> 01:10:11.171
<v Speaker 1>That to me is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the dumbest part about what it </v>

1494
01:10:11.171 --> 01:10:12.320
<v Speaker 1>does and the people that react to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the go,</v>

1495
01:10:12.321 --> 01:10:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Rah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rah,</v>

1496
01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.560
<v Speaker 1>that get all fucking Rah Rah about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of shit.</v>

1497
01:10:15.561 --> 01:10:19.460
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst aspects of our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got lucky as fuck.</v>

1498
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:23.570
<v Speaker 1>We got lucky as fuck to be born in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

1499
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:29.350
<v Speaker 1>You could say what you want about where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you live and you might love Iceland are </v>

1500
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:32.861
<v Speaker 1>fucking Sweden or wherever you are right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and you're listening to this and </v>

1501
01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:32.861
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you're right.</v>

1502
01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:33.200
<v Speaker 1>I bet you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're what you.</v>

1503
01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Where you live has great great </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities.</v>

1504
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with where you live,</v>

1505
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:45.850
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between being born in America and being </v>

1506
01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:50.531
<v Speaker 1>born in Mexico is fucking staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a giant fucking difference as far </v>

1507
01:10:52.461 --> 01:10:57.461
<v Speaker 1>as the opportunities you have as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the chances of you being able to </v>

1508
01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:02.300
<v Speaker 1>get a great job and be able to support </v>
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>

1509
01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:07.540
<v Speaker 1>like people aren't sneaking into America</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it sucks they're sneaking into </v>

1510
01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:11.951
<v Speaker 1>America because they got a shitty roll </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dice and they got born into a poor </v>

1511
01:11:11.951 --> 01:11:15.420
<v Speaker 1>family in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is connected to the richest nation</v>

1512
01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:16.620
<v Speaker 1>in the world today.</v>

1513
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:21.720
<v Speaker 1>It's that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I got lucky as fuck we all did,</v>

1514
01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.960
<v Speaker 1>and so for a guy like Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't recognize that shit like you </v>

1515
01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:27.330
<v Speaker 1>should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be the number one thing that</v>

1516
01:11:27.331 --> 01:11:32.331
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to keep America great and </v>

1517
01:11:32.331 --> 01:11:32.331
<v Speaker 1>you want to make America great again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything like that,</v>

1518
01:11:32.331 --> 01:11:33.540
<v Speaker 1>we all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all down with that,</v>

1519
01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.680
<v Speaker 1>but you can't talk shit about Mexicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't talk shit about them all being</v>

1520
01:11:37.681 --> 01:11:39.630
<v Speaker 1>rapists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderers,</v>

1521
01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 1>than the sheer numbers of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>come over from Mexico that are great,</v>

1522
01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:48.650
<v Speaker 1>that don't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're just trying to work and </v>

1523
01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:48.990
<v Speaker 1>trying to feed their families while </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it illegally.</v>

1524
01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of other people have done </v>

1525
01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:55.971
<v Speaker 1>it illegally to and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they send back money and they </v>

1526
01:11:55.971 --> 01:11:55.971
<v Speaker 1>suddenly realize there's job </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities here,</v>

1527
01:11:55.971 --> 01:12:00.861
<v Speaker 1>and Donald Trump's fucking home </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies employ illegal aliens.</v>

1528
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:04.470
<v Speaker 1>His wife came from another country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1529
01:12:04.471 --> 01:12:09.471
<v Speaker 1>the whole Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was Mitt Romney had hilarious joke </v>

1530
01:12:09.471 --> 01:12:09.471
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he said.</v>

1531
01:12:09.471 --> 01:12:10.050
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1532
01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:10.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1533
01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:15.930
<v Speaker 1>there's some jobs that Americans won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>take trump out of white from and get it,</v>

1534
01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:24.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the product disturbs me about </v>

1535
01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:24.930
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1536
01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:24.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the stuff,</v>

1537
01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:27.290
<v Speaker 1>I liked some of the stuff he does think </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's Larry.</v>

1538
01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he's going to win just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know for sure in 2020 it's </v>

1539
01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:37.281
<v Speaker 1>going to be trump versus Kanye the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>our world is going right now.</v>

1540
01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.320
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just not going to happen.</v>

1541
01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:41.730
<v Speaker 1>He's not really going to run for </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

1542
01:12:41.731 --> 01:12:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1543
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:44.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fake.</v>

1544
01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:46.740
<v Speaker 1>That's how you sell cds and what have </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1545
01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:48.540
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think that's where we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going?</v>

1546
01:12:48.541 --> 01:12:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Especially if trump wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four years later we've bounced back.</v>

1547
01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I think we bounced back hard the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1548
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I think if trump wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is you get someone like a </v>

1549
01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:02.151
<v Speaker 1>Gary Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary Johnson who is without a doubt the </v>

1550
01:13:02.151 --> 01:13:05.421
<v Speaker 1>best candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody takes him seriously because </v>

1551
01:13:05.421 --> 01:13:05.421
<v Speaker 1>he's an independent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

1552
01:13:05.421 --> 01:13:07.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a legit former governor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico,</v>

1553
01:13:07.770 --> 01:13:10.710
<v Speaker 1>did a fantastic job there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very open minded,</v>

1554
01:13:10.711 --> 01:13:12.360
<v Speaker 1>very liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very progressive,</v>

1555
01:13:12.361 --> 01:13:15.450
<v Speaker 1>but also very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fiscally aware,</v>

1556
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:17.910
<v Speaker 1>like he's got a lot of super positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities.</v>

1557
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:23.030
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't want to be a part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that bullshit two party system and </v>

1558
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.030
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to take them seriously,</v>

1559
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:26.970
<v Speaker 1>but a guy like Gary Johnson could be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real leader in a real president,</v>

1560
01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:30.150
<v Speaker 1>but to be a president is a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid job.</v>

1561
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:35.510
<v Speaker 1>It's to be one person that's in charge </v>
<v Speaker 1>of so many different parts of this </v>

1562
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:36.990
<v Speaker 1>country that it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1563
01:13:36.991 --> 01:13:40.800
<v Speaker 1>you have to be in charge of how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes we charge people.</v>

1564
01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of your platform.</v>

1565
01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:45.600
<v Speaker 1>What's your foreign policy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the military budget?</v>

1566
01:13:45.601 --> 01:13:47.520
<v Speaker 1>What's all these things that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's.</v>

1567
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:50.370
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do about healthcare?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do about education?</v>

1568
01:13:50.371 --> 01:13:55.371
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things require fucking </v>

1569
01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:00.620
<v Speaker 1>years and years and years of extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>study like you have to like really be </v>

1570
01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:04.791
<v Speaker 1>immersed in each individual aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our civilization to even have a thought </v>

1571
01:14:06.091 --> 01:14:09.960
<v Speaker 1>of how to fix it and correct it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>change the system whether it's taxes,</v>

1572
01:14:09.961 --> 01:14:11.350
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will.</v>

1573
01:14:11.351 --> 01:14:16.351
<v Speaker 1>All these different things require </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible levels of expertise in the </v>

1574
01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:20.621
<v Speaker 1>expect that in all these different areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>from one person and then expect them to </v>

1575
01:14:20.621 --> 01:14:25.591
<v Speaker 1>have a unique progressive ideas about </v>
<v Speaker 1>society and culture and you know,</v>

1576
01:14:26.181 --> 01:14:31.181
<v Speaker 1>and how we move pass over silly </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences about race and gender and </v>

1577
01:14:31.181 --> 01:14:33.460
<v Speaker 1>sexual orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This person is,</v>

1578
01:14:33.461 --> 01:14:35.290
<v Speaker 1>one person would have to be a master.</v>

1579
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.750
<v Speaker 1>They would have to be some guru from </v>
<v Speaker 1>another planet.</v>

1580
01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:43.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean they would literally have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>some non human because a human being </v>

1581
01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:47.250
<v Speaker 1>can't have that many levels of expertise</v>
<v Speaker 1>because to be an expert in anything </v>

1582
01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:51.040
<v Speaker 1>that's like super complicated like </v>
<v Speaker 1>finance,</v>

1583
01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.100
<v Speaker 1>like God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys are studying it all the time.</v>

1584
01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to be like a really </v>

1585
01:14:59.520 --> 01:14:59.520
<v Speaker 1>good finance guy and also have a mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>racquetball game or something like that.</v>

1586
01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Say Your Watch freaked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it do it my security.</v>

1587
01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:06.180
<v Speaker 1>My home security just went off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it vibrates.</v>

1588
01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Broken your house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's just ups guy.</v>

1589
01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bang that shit.</v>

1590
01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:13.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to turn it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throw it in the water.</v>

1591
01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:19.100
<v Speaker 1>It's probably the best move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want a computer on your </v>

1592

<v Speaker 1>So it's really cheap.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wonder why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What's cool?</v>

1598
01:15:26.411 --> 01:15:28.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you're driving and </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody texts you,</v>

1599
01:15:28.251 --> 01:15:29.500

<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1638
01:16:59.310 --> 01:16:59.680
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just dangerous and it's addictive.</v>

1639
01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:02.140
<v Speaker 1>I know phones are addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I see people texting.</v>

1640
01:17:02.141 --> 01:17:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I think we should all just make an </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement.</v>

1641
01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:06.790
<v Speaker 1>All of us just leave your fucking phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

1642
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 1>When you're in your car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't kill anybody because if you do,</v>

1643
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:14.060
<v Speaker 1>you'll never forgive yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wind up texting and you plow into</v>

1644
01:17:14.061 --> 01:17:16.790
<v Speaker 1>someone and someone dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some fucking kid dies,</v>

1645
01:17:16.791 --> 01:17:20.090
<v Speaker 1>some old lady dies or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll never forgive yourself.</v>

1646
01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Just stop fucking with your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop looking down at it.</v>

1647
01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Put it down and just drive like the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>time where you can just chill and just </v>

1648
01:17:28.221 --> 01:17:30.680
<v Speaker 1>be involved in what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Present.</v>

1649
01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Be Mindful what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take this fucking thing and I throw it</v>

1650
01:17:34.731 --> 01:17:35.600
<v Speaker 1>in the passenger seat.</v>

1651
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:36.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>

1652
01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it in my lap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it in the center console.</v>

1653
01:17:40.191 --> 01:17:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to look at it.</v>

1654
01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Let's put it over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think we should all do that.</v>

1655
01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:46.070
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking scary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1656
01:17:46.071 --> 01:17:51.071
<v Speaker 1>Watching that dummy yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drive in with sunglasses on the right </v>

1657
01:17:51.071 --> 01:17:52.010
<v Speaker 1>handed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lean.</v>

1658
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Scrolling through her instagram and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking down,</v>

1659
01:17:54.651 --> 01:17:55.670
<v Speaker 1>looking down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking up,</v>

1660
01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:56.720
<v Speaker 1>looking down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking down,</v>

1661
01:17:56.721 --> 01:17:59.780
<v Speaker 1>looking up the amount of distance that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you travel.</v>

1662
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.560
<v Speaker 1>When you're looking at your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going 60 miles an hour and you're</v>

1663
01:18:02.561 --> 01:18:04.640
<v Speaker 1>looking at your phone for like two </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

1664
01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:08.120
<v Speaker 1>How many fucking feet of you going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about that.</v>

1665
01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:11.870
<v Speaker 1>If you're going 60 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that one too.</v>

1666
01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:16.960
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of fucking space you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>covering and you're not even looking at </v>

1667
01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:16.960
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>

1668
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:19.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mostly bought to.</v>

1669
01:18:19.731 --> 01:18:22.860
<v Speaker 4>So for health fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sensors on it.</v>

1670
01:18:22.930 --> 01:18:24.810
<v Speaker 4>Eat vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fit the fitbit.</v>

1671
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:29.830
<v Speaker 4>I had the fitbit for a while but started</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking up all the time so I heard this </v>

1672
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:31.070
<v Speaker 4>is a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I thought those fit bits or the shit.</v>

1673
01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:33.380
<v Speaker 4>That's what I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they're not waterproof,</v>

1674
01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.450
<v Speaker 4>but they're water resistant and I we'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>win.</v>

1675
01:18:36.490 --> 01:18:37.210
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

1676
01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:38.420
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1677
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:41.450
<v Speaker 4>So how could you have something to </v>
<v Speaker 4>exercises?</v>

1678
01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:46.480
<v Speaker 4>I got some of those beats headphones </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are supposedly really good that </v>

1679
01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:47.610
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to be able to sweat in </v>
<v Speaker 4>these big,</v>

1680
01:18:47.611 --> 01:18:48.680
<v Speaker 4>just like those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

1681
01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:51.350
<v Speaker 4>just like those exact ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wireless ones,</v>

1682
01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:53.580
<v Speaker 4>they break after you sweat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm too much shadow.</v>

1683
01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:58.580
<v Speaker 4>Fitbit did awesome on that little button</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that came apart,</v>

1684
01:18:58.581 --> 01:19:03.581
<v Speaker 4>so I have a super glue it back together </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the button stopped working after </v>

1685
01:19:03.581 --> 01:19:04.490
<v Speaker 4>awhile and then they started working </v>
<v Speaker 4>again a couple months later I had to buy</v>

1686
01:19:04.491 --> 01:19:06.620
<v Speaker 4>another pair just because I needed some.</v>

1687
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:08.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just give these a try.</v>

1688
01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:11.880
<v Speaker 4>I've been going wired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really liked them except they just.</v>

1689
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.420
<v Speaker 4>You can't sweat too much in them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>

1690
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:17.900
<v Speaker 4>I liked the wired ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you lift weights and stuff like</v>

1691
01:19:17.901 --> 01:19:20.180
<v Speaker 4>specially kettlebell movements and </v>
<v Speaker 4>things along those lines,</v>

1692
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:25.450
<v Speaker 4>you run the possibility of them getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>tangled up or they get bunched up </v>

1693
01:19:25.450 --> 01:19:26.870
<v Speaker 4>because that have a microphone on it so </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can use it for fun.</v>

1694
01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.570
<v Speaker 4>It's great for the fall and I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it for everything,</v>

1695
01:19:29.571 --> 01:19:31.250
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

1696
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:33.320
<v Speaker 4>It's really easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

1697
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:34.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fan.</v>

1698
01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.290
<v Speaker 4>People told me that it's not loud </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough,</v>

1699
01:19:36.291 --> 01:19:38.800
<v Speaker 4>but you know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to blow my fucking ears.</v>

1700
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:41.870
<v Speaker 4>I listen to music in the gym the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>day and it was fine.</v>

1701
01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:45.230
<v Speaker 4>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty decent headphones,</v>

1702
01:19:45.231 --> 01:19:47.590
<v Speaker 4>but this from what they cost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they shouldn't be.</v>

1703
01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:50.430
<v Speaker 4>They should last five to 10 year </v>
<v Speaker 4>standard Rs.</v>

1704
01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:51.290
<v Speaker 4>200 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1705
01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Electronics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1706
01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:56.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't get them wet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just they can only protect so much,</v>

1707
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:59.960
<v Speaker 1>which apparently they've done an insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>job with these iphones.</v>

1708
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:02.030
<v Speaker 1>You can dump these in a toilet for half </v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour.</v>

1709
01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.430
<v Speaker 1>How do I know this?</v>

1710
01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 4>Someone else did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can dunk it in the</v>

1711
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.430
<v Speaker 1>phone because in the reason why this </v>
<v Speaker 1>should piss everybody off a little bit.</v>

1712
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:16.790
<v Speaker 1>They made these waterproof because now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can turn them in and you can </v>

1713
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:17.730
<v Speaker 1>exchange them when you want to get a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

1714
01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:20.310
<v Speaker 1>So they wanted to make it so they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>break.</v>

1715
01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:23.370
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you do that already?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You assholes.</v>

1716
01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Like why didn't you do that a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago?</v>

1717
01:20:25.201 --> 01:20:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Because samsungs had waterproof phones </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the new Samsung.</v>

1718
01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.680
<v Speaker 1>S seven is waterproof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1719
01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:32.710
<v Speaker 1>What do you got there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got the note?</v>

1720
01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No filter.</v>

1721
01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Dope man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the difference between an </v>

1722
01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:39.540
<v Speaker 1>android phone and an apple phone is </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost indistinguishable now.</v>

1723
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.840
<v Speaker 1>As far as like the ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phones ability.</v>

1724
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they could just work on the third </v>

1725
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.870
<v Speaker 1>party apps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like scopes on it.</v>

1726
01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Well instagram was real bad on the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of it.</v>

1727
01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:55.230
<v Speaker 1>I only use instagram on a iphone now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1728
01:20:55.290 --> 01:21:00.290
<v Speaker 1>on the old version of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still use a galaxy phone for the </v>

1729
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:00.290
<v Speaker 1>studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alon,</v>

1730
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:01.770
<v Speaker 1>the studio phone for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for guests and stuff.</v>

1731
01:21:01.771 --> 01:21:03.960
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a ting phone and that's a,</v>

1732
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:05.340
<v Speaker 1>that's an android phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it,</v>

1733
01:21:05.341 --> 01:21:06.780
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works great.</v>

1734
01:21:06.781 --> 01:21:09.060
<v Speaker 1>It's smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to use,</v>

1735
01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:09.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

1736
01:21:10.090 --> 01:21:15.090
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't piss me off when I go </v>
<v Speaker 1>online with it or anything when I look </v>

1737
01:21:15.090 --> 01:21:18.081
<v Speaker 1>at youtube videos or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some stuff it just doesn't </v>

1738
01:21:18.081 --> 01:21:18.081
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as.</v>

1739
01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Which doesn't make any sense because </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't there as many android phones now </v>

1740
01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:23.240
<v Speaker 1>as there are apple phones?</v>

1741
01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:26.680
<v Speaker 5>I think there's more apple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It should be pretty.</v>

1742
01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:29.000
<v Speaker 5>Even if it's not one to just slightly </v>
<v Speaker 5>over the other.</v>

1743
01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:34.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would think by now they would've </v>

1744
01:21:34.130 --> 01:21:35.550
<v Speaker 5>caught up like everything would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>caught up still as far as the android </v>

1745
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:35.800
<v Speaker 5>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's still like as a company will make a</v>

1746
01:21:35.801 --> 01:21:40.801
<v Speaker 5>phone for like Samsung or Sony or 10 </v>
<v Speaker 5>different companies that can make an </v>

1747
01:21:40.801 --> 01:21:44.611
<v Speaker 5>android phone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they have to have the most updated </v>

1748
01:21:44.611 --> 01:21:47.611
<v Speaker 5>version of the operating system and that</v>
<v Speaker 5>any update that has to go through the </v>

1749
01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:49.210
<v Speaker 5>carrier to get through each of those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you could have four point one.</v>

1750
01:21:49.211 --> 01:21:54.211
<v Speaker 5>Brian could have four point three.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could have the new four point five or </v>

1751
01:21:54.211 --> 01:21:54.211
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know if that's real.</v>

1752
01:21:54.211 --> 01:21:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another problem.</v>

1753
01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:59.010
<v Speaker 1>The other problem is a lot of companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>like t mobile or anyone,</v>

1754
01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.990
<v Speaker 1>they'll add their own bullshit and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1755
01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Samsung will add their own bullshit on </v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the original android.</v>

1756
01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:11.680
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to buy just android,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like straight android,</v>

1757
01:22:11.681 --> 01:22:14.380
<v Speaker 1>you do it through Google and you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>that nexus foam.</v>

1758
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:18.040
<v Speaker 1>The nexus phone is really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the nexus phone,</v>

1759
01:22:18.041 --> 01:22:20.140
<v Speaker 1>you pay google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't pay a carrier,</v>

1760
01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:24.670
<v Speaker 1>like you don't pay verizon or t mobile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just pay google.</v>

1761
01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:29.820
<v Speaker 1>And so your phone works on everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it moves around and they just rent time </v>

1762
01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:32.440
<v Speaker 1>on everybody's network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that to be fascinating.</v>

1763
01:22:32.530 --> 01:22:34.300
<v Speaker 1>So it uses both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Networks,</v>

1764
01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:36.430
<v Speaker 1>uses everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says everything.</v>

1765
01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.240
<v Speaker 1>So wherever you are apparently make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

1766
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Apparently that's how it works though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

1767
01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:48.460
<v Speaker 1>you just pay google instead of paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>verizon or instead of paying t mobile </v>

1768
01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:52.810
<v Speaker 1>and theoretically it uses the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>signal around all the time.</v>

1769
01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:54.700
<v Speaker 1>It seems like somebody like t mobile </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1770
01:22:54.701 --> 01:22:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want you to do that.</v>

1771
01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Why would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We make more money.</v>

1772
01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1773
01:23:01.630 --> 01:23:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1774
01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:07.930
<v Speaker 1>people even think Google themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a cell phone provider.</v>

1775
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think of Android,</v>

1776
01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:14.710
<v Speaker 1>but most people don't think about buying</v>
<v Speaker 1>their phone from google and using Google</v>

1777
01:23:14.711 --> 01:23:17.530
<v Speaker 1>as their service provider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they?</v>

1778
01:23:17.531 --> 01:23:19.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard that.</v>

1779
01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Chris Ryan told me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Chris Ryan from sex at dawn and </v>

1780
01:23:24.210 --> 01:23:25.570
<v Speaker 1>tangentially speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>

1781
01:23:25.571 --> 01:23:27.310
<v Speaker 1>that's what he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got it that way.</v>

1782
01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.830
<v Speaker 1>And he got it because he wants it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work everywhere.</v>

1783
01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:31.000
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's Roman,</v>

1784
01:23:31.001 --> 01:23:33.820
<v Speaker 1>there's no roaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His phone works in Indonesia,</v>

1785
01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.020
<v Speaker 1>works everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1786
01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:38.140
<v Speaker 1>it just works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how the team mobile is pretty much.</v>

1787
01:23:38.141 --> 01:23:39.840
<v Speaker 1>You can go pretty much anywhere and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just works.</v>

1788
01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:42.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no extra cost.</v>

1789
01:23:42.131 --> 01:23:44.320
<v Speaker 1>It's just crossing Mexico or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1790
01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:50.130
<v Speaker 1>That's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But didn't they get in trouble for </v>

1791
01:23:50.130 --> 01:23:50.130
<v Speaker 1>streaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for throttling?</v>

1792
01:23:50.130 --> 01:23:52.550
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have this plan that's a,</v>

1793
01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:57.600
<v Speaker 4>they don't charge you for Netflix for </v>
<v Speaker 4>videos or any music's things like </v>

1794
01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:58.950
<v Speaker 4>spotify.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So all that bandwidth is free.</v>

1795
01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:02.730
<v Speaker 4>It's all you can eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now it's been exposed or whatever.</v>

1796
01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:07.760
<v Speaker 4>They didn't really hide it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they said that the videos are down </v>

1797
01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.150
<v Speaker 4>graded to for ADP,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like for your phone 100 percent</v>

1798
01:24:11.371 --> 01:24:16.371
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're in the difference between </v>

1799
01:24:16.371 --> 01:24:16.371
<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20:00</v>

1800
01:24:16.371 --> 01:24:18.300
<v Speaker 4>PM for ADP on a whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a four inch screen or five inch screen.</v>

1801
01:24:18.301 --> 01:24:19.590
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to notice the </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference.</v>

1802
01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:24.800
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Verizon and att and t made a huge </v>

1803
01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:24.800
<v Speaker 4>deal about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Blah,</v>

1804
01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.981
<v Speaker 4>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's funny though is yesterday on the </v>

1805
01:24:27.981 --> 01:24:29.730
<v Speaker 4>owner's periscope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the CEO of t a t mobile,</v>

1806
01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:35.180
<v Speaker 4>it was shown that this whole time </v>
<v Speaker 4>verizon and att and t had been </v>

1807
01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:35.180
<v Speaker 4>downgrading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's two,</v>

1808
01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:39.741
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 p said they just got caught for like </v>

1809
01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:42.600
<v Speaker 4>even having worse signal then a team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody does it.</v>

1810
01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:45.060
<v Speaker 4>Everybody eyes and then the beams </v>
<v Speaker 4>acceptable.</v>

1811
01:24:45.061 --> 01:24:50.061
<v Speaker 4>It seems like an intelligent move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make sure that your stream doesn't get </v>

1812
01:24:50.061 --> 01:24:50.061
<v Speaker 4>interrupted because it's not too much </v>
<v Speaker 4>download.</v>

1813
01:24:50.061 --> 01:24:52.500
<v Speaker 4>And netflix is actually the ones behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1814
01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:57.560
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was downgrading it from mobile </v>

1815
01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:58.920
<v Speaker 4>because if everyone in the road had 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>80 p for no reason,</v>

1816
01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:01.050
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1817
01:25:01.051 --> 01:25:03.960
<v Speaker 4>it seems like a massive waste of phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

1818
01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:04.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Do you have the new one yet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I love it because you're just using </v>

1837
01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:01.840
<v Speaker 4>the microphone and being like a broad </v>
<v Speaker 4>city and it shows you where it's on Hulu</v>

<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1840
01:26:08.031 --> 01:26:13.031

<v Speaker 4>Do except by always having an upside </v>

1841
01:26:13.031 --> 01:26:14.390
<v Speaker 4>down or it's embedded and I'd sit on it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it turns it off.</v>

1842
01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:17.840
<v Speaker 4>If there's a lot of problems with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>remote cat paused the walking dead.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

1848
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:31.750
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you were a sleazy guy and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>girl said you can stay over at my house </v>

1849
01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.880

1851
01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:37.040
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry about it.</v>

1852
01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:40.280
<v Speaker 4>And he climbed in bed with her and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>took your pants off and you started like</v>

1853
01:26:40.281 --> 01:26:43.100
<v Speaker 4>rubbing your at Dick up against her ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all my cats like.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>just watch TV.</v>

1856
01:26:46.341 --> 01:26:46.940
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

1859
01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:52.440
<v Speaker 4>And He plops down next to you and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>forces his head into your armpits and he</v>

1860
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:56.150
<v Speaker 4>walks all over you and climbs on top of </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1861
01:26:56.151 --> 01:26:57.980
<v Speaker 4>And he's like constantly what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim?</v>

1862
01:26:58.050 --> 01:26:58.340
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

1863
01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:04.420
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is that Google a network cellular </v>

1864
01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:05.710
<v Speaker 4>network that you're talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1865
01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:09.050
<v Speaker 4>this is a google fi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1866
01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:12.400
<v Speaker 4>And so this is what works with the nexus</v>
<v Speaker 4>phone.</v>

1867
01:27:12.670 --> 01:27:17.670
<v Speaker 4>Their phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you pay them for one plan and </v>

1868
01:27:17.670 --> 01:27:19.730
<v Speaker 4>you paid for their data and their $10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>per gig for data.</v>

1869
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Five basics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>$20 per month.</v>

1870
01:27:22.131 --> 01:27:23.210
<v Speaker 4>Fuck off.</v>

1871
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:28.160
<v Speaker 4>See how many gigs I used at month seven </v>
<v Speaker 4>or eight?</v>

1872
01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:30.140
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always $10 per gigabyte.</v>

1873
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:34.730
<v Speaker 4>$10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>$10 per gig per month.</v>

1874
01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:38.890
<v Speaker 4>$20 for two gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're only using $30,</v>

1875
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:43.230
<v Speaker 4>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much does a lot though?</v>

1876
01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:47.030
<v Speaker 4>How many gigs do you use a month?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I used about seven or eight gigs</v>

1877
01:27:47.031 --> 01:27:48.680
<v Speaker 4>a month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm around three,</v>

1878
01:27:48.710 --> 01:27:49.960
<v Speaker 4>three and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe three now.</v>

1879
01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:52.130
<v Speaker 4>I did a lot of periscope and video </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1880
01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:55.490
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that counts all of that streaming you</v>

1881
01:27:55.491 --> 01:28:00.491
<v Speaker 4>do listening to music unless you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>downloading it from the servers and </v>

1882
01:28:00.491 --> 01:28:00.491
<v Speaker 4>whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

1883
01:28:00.491 --> 01:28:02.420
<v Speaker 4>So do you have unlimited downloads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian?</v>

1884
01:28:02.421 --> 01:28:05.120
<v Speaker 4>Like how does men live?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a family plan,</v>

1885
01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:07.910
<v Speaker 4>which is unlimited data unlimited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1886
01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:12.620
<v Speaker 4>That's my t mobile limited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unlimited for unused data though.</v>

1887
01:28:12.970 --> 01:28:13.710
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

1888
01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:15.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't pay for unused data.</v>

1889
01:28:15.231 --> 01:28:17.270
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what tim does.</v>

1890
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:18.180
<v Speaker 4>Everybody does that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1891
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:20.540
<v Speaker 4>That's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty expensive though.</v>

1892
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:21.530
<v Speaker 4>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1893
01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:26.270
<v Speaker 4>it says 32 bucks a month for two gigs </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Jamie just says he only uses three,</v>

1894
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:31.390
<v Speaker 4>so let's make it 42 bucks off without </v>
<v Speaker 4>the $20 you can change your life without</v>

1895
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:34.220
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Plus the cost of data.</v>

1896
01:28:34.221 --> 01:28:35.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1897
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:39.140
<v Speaker 4>So that would be $20 plus 30.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well he's come,</v>

1898
01:28:39.170 --> 01:28:41.360
<v Speaker 4>he's got three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make any sense because he's</v>

1899
01:28:41.361 --> 01:28:44.240
<v Speaker 4>got 20 bucks plus two gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's got two gigs.</v>

1900
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:48.230
<v Speaker 4>That's $20 and then it's only 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>$12.</v>

1901
01:28:48.231 --> 01:28:53.231
<v Speaker 4>More than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got eight bucks back because he </v>

1902
01:28:53.231 --> 01:28:55.991
<v Speaker 4>didn't use all this data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See if I used three point five,</v>

1903
01:28:57.370 --> 01:28:59.410
<v Speaker 4>you will go to Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's Brian uses?</v>

1904
01:28:59.490 --> 01:29:02.550

<v Speaker 4>Just to be honest with your Cam girling </v>

1906
01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:07.640
<v Speaker 4>100 bucks a month,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is fine.</v>

1907
01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:08.880
<v Speaker 4>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's normal.</v>

1908
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:09.880
<v Speaker 4>What do you pay a month,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian?</v>

1909
01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:13.170
<v Speaker 4>How about 100 bucks to fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you talking about bones?</v>

1910
01:29:13.171 --> 01:29:18.171
<v Speaker 4>And I can use an iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this puts you on technically the </v>

1911

<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure the people like a unbox </v>

<v Speaker 4>well I was in a phone with somebody from</v>
<v Speaker 4>verizon when somebody from 18 and t </v>

1932
01:30:27.771 --> 01:30:29.730
<v Speaker 4>verizon was dead and he though it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1933
01:30:30.630 --> 01:30:34.470
<v Speaker 4>so it would be cool to see if I went </v>
<v Speaker 4>through that with that service.</v>

1934
01:30:34.471 --> 01:30:39.471
<v Speaker 4>If it just automatically went to a t and</v>
<v Speaker 4>t or or if it really just chooses like </v>

1935
01:30:39.471 --> 01:30:43.791
<v Speaker 4>sprint smartphone cameras shoot out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Galaxy s seven edge takes on the iphone </v>

1936
01:30:45.931 --> 01:30:48.840
<v Speaker 4>six plus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a comparison there.</v>

1937
01:30:48.841 --> 01:30:51.180
<v Speaker 4>Just do some side by side photos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just photos.</v>

1938
01:30:51.181 --> 01:30:51.960
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at that.</v>

1939
01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:57.490
<v Speaker 4>Let's see which one is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the Samsung is the one on the </v>

1940
01:30:57.490 --> 01:30:57.490
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>

1941
01:30:57.490 --> 01:30:57.490
<v Speaker 4>On the one on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On top I guess,</v>

1942
01:30:57.490 --> 01:30:59.760
<v Speaker 4>and when I scroll over here it shows you</v>
<v Speaker 4>the iphone version.</v>

1943
01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:00.750
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Iphone is better.</v>

1944
01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:04.150
<v Speaker 4>Way better away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's over conversations.</v>

1945
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:06.030
<v Speaker 4>Dead Front.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Facing camera.</v>

1946
01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:11.060
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The difference in the front facing </v>

1947
01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:11.060
<v Speaker 4>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which one is which?</v>

1948
01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:11.060
<v Speaker 4>Again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the samsungs on the left.</v>

1949
01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:11.610
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's over.</v>

1950
01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:15.210
<v Speaker 4>Iphone is better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Conversations over.</v>

1951
01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:20.370
<v Speaker 4>I use both everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They both have low light into this.</v>

1952
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:21.870
<v Speaker 4>We're doing these kinds of comparisons </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

1953
01:31:21.871 --> 01:31:23.430
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard to make these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute.</v>

1954
01:31:23.431 --> 01:31:25.030
<v Speaker 4>Who's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's that low light?</v>

1955
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:27.540
<v Speaker 4>This one should be iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This should be Samsung.</v>

1956
01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:30.680
<v Speaker 4>Samsung is way better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know the uh,</v>

1957
01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.700
<v Speaker 4>the photographer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how well they do.</v>

1958
01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:37.900
<v Speaker 4>But that's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the same photo we're supposed to </v>

1959
01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:37.900
<v Speaker 4>assume.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1960
01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:37.900
<v Speaker 4>I were supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but wait a minute.</v>

1961
01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:42.500
<v Speaker 4>Samsung's bigger aperture really comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>into play when you're taking photos in </v>

1962
01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:42.500
<v Speaker 4>low light.</v>

1963
01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:46.190
<v Speaker 4>These images were shot in the dark back </v>
<v Speaker 4>corner of a coffee shop and both phones </v>

1964
01:31:47.130 --> 01:31:49.500
<v Speaker 4>struggled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the iphone fared worse.</v>

1965
01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:54.560
<v Speaker 4>That's a big difference man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Scroll back again so you can see </v>

1966
01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:54.560
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is way better.</v>

1967
01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:59.450
<v Speaker 4>Samsung is fucking way better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that is such a vast contrast.</v>

1968
01:32:01.210 --> 01:32:06.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy this one though because I </v>

1969
01:32:06.210 --> 01:32:08.371
<v Speaker 4>use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the note five is one of the best </v>

1970
01:32:08.371 --> 01:32:10.760
<v Speaker 4>cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The no five is one of the best cameras </v>

1971
01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:14.520
<v Speaker 4>on a Samsung.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I use both of these every night and </v>

1972
01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:15.640
<v Speaker 4>while the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this one does have good low light,</v>

1973
01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:20.730
<v Speaker 4>it also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very blurry when you move it </v>

1974
01:32:20.730 --> 01:32:20.730
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to get a really good shot.</v>

1975
01:32:20.730 --> 01:32:25.020
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that doesn't have as good of </v>

1976
01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:25.020
<v Speaker 4>cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1977
01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:26.791
<v Speaker 4>Seven edge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven edges of the newer camera and </v>

1978
01:32:26.791 --> 01:32:28.720
<v Speaker 4>newer by four months or so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's newer,</v>

1979
01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:32.050
<v Speaker 4>but is it better be get better mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1980
01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:35.960
<v Speaker 4>you're doing your new iphone cameras.</v>

1981
01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:40.970
<v Speaker 4>He's doing chem trails a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just trying to add like there's </v>

1982
01:32:40.970 --> 01:32:43.870
<v Speaker 4>certain things you can do when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking a phone in a dark situation and </v>

1983
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:46.651
<v Speaker 4>make it look a little bit better and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know if they're doing all that </v>

1984
01:32:46.651 --> 01:32:47.920
<v Speaker 4>they can to make the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

1985
01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:49.860
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1986
01:32:49.930 --> 01:32:52.120
<v Speaker 4>this one here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Speed.</v>

1987
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:54.490
<v Speaker 4>Which is what's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shutter speed?</v>

1988
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:55.850
<v Speaker 4>Will they both look good?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1989
01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:56.820
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very.</v>

1990
01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:58.270
<v Speaker 4>Which one's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that Samsung?</v>

1991
01:32:58.300 --> 01:32:59.770
<v Speaker 4>Samsung on top?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That looks better.</v>

1992
01:32:59.890 --> 01:33:03.850
<v Speaker 4>I fumble a Samsung one looks better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's the problem.</v>

1993
01:33:03.851 --> 01:33:05.830
<v Speaker 4>The angle slightly different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do it again.</v>

1994
01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:11.040
<v Speaker 4>See that one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going down more than when you're </v>

1995
01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:11.040
<v Speaker 4>up more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I mean.</v>

1996
01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:12.790
<v Speaker 4>The light changes everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do it more time.</v>

1997
01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:17.820
<v Speaker 4>Scroll back pretty fucking close and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really such a where they should go </v>

1998
01:33:19.151 --> 01:33:24.151
<v Speaker 4>way out of their way to make sure you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the exact same angle because when </v>

1999
01:33:24.151 --> 01:33:25.600
<v Speaker 4>you don't have the same angle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to tell like one of them,</v>

2000
01:33:25.601 --> 01:33:27.460
<v Speaker 4>like this one is way closer.</v>

2001
01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why would they do that?</v>

2002
01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:35.710
<v Speaker 4>It's really one is that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Samsung top was pretty God damn good,</v>

2003
01:33:35.711 --> 01:33:37.750
<v Speaker 4>but that looks better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boy Genius report,</v>

2004
01:33:37.751 --> 01:33:40.220
<v Speaker 4>which is a pretty legit website.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2005
01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:45.420
<v Speaker 4>they did a whole thing with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] versus the iphone six plus a</v>

2006
01:33:45.890 --> 01:33:50.050
<v Speaker 4>and they found that the iphone is still </v>
<v Speaker 4>the best.</v>

2007
01:33:50.110 --> 01:33:55.110
<v Speaker 4>It's a says the SR two six plus camera </v>
<v Speaker 4>outperformed the s seven more often than</v>

2008
01:33:57.281 --> 01:33:59.450
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2009
01:33:59.470 --> 01:34:02.320
<v Speaker 4>it seems like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like only low light is where it</v>

2010
01:34:02.321 --> 01:34:05.530
<v Speaker 4>really has it nailed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But God damn the differences like here,</v>

2011
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:11.310
<v Speaker 4>these are the differences that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>iphone seems to get things a little </v>

2012
01:34:11.310 --> 01:34:12.850
<v Speaker 4>lighter and clear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2013
01:34:12.851 --> 01:34:17.851
<v Speaker 4>here's another low light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is an s seven and this is the </v>

2014
01:34:17.851 --> 01:34:19.780
<v Speaker 4>iphone and this is way better than this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a little light picture.</v>

2015
01:34:19.781 --> 01:34:21.940
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just the photographer,</v>

2016
01:34:21.941 --> 01:34:23.260
<v Speaker 4>you can't really do this shit.</v>

2017
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:24.910
<v Speaker 4>You could just have to have the camera </v>
<v Speaker 4>and go.</v>

2018
01:34:24.911 --> 01:34:26.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time that this way works.</v>

2019
01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:32.370
<v Speaker 4>They should do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should have like a double selfie </v>

2020
01:34:32.370 --> 01:34:34.561
<v Speaker 4>stick that faces forward and they press </v>
<v Speaker 4>Baltimore the exact same time in the </v>

2021
01:34:34.561 --> 01:34:36.160
<v Speaker 4>exact same level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would do that?</v>

2022
01:34:36.161 --> 01:34:37.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they usually do that.</v>

2023
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:38.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how they should do it.</v>

2024
01:34:39.190 --> 01:34:44.190
<v Speaker 4>They should have everything on a mounted</v>
<v Speaker 4>platform that takes a photo of the exact</v>

2025
01:34:44.261 --> 01:34:48.520
<v Speaker 4>same time so that you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But even then one of them would be a few</v>

2026
01:34:48.521 --> 01:34:51.670
<v Speaker 4>inches over to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you'd get a little slightly different</v>

2027
01:34:51.671 --> 01:34:52.190
<v Speaker 4>angle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2028
01:34:52.810 --> 01:34:56.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But either way they're both really good.</v>

2029
01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:57.710
<v Speaker 4>Fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

2030
01:34:57.750 --> 01:35:02.750
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just what kind of environment you </v>

2031
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:04.361
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I use all apple shit so it's easier for </v>

2032
01:35:04.361 --> 01:35:04.490
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if I didn't have apolis it,</v>

2033
01:35:04.491 --> 01:35:07.750
<v Speaker 4>I probably would use just a Samsung </v>
<v Speaker 4>five.</v>

2034
01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:13.060
<v Speaker 4>Well that's like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friends sending me that video and I </v>

2035
01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:13.400
<v Speaker 4>watched it on my TV and seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing like that that exists in</v>

2036
01:35:13.401 --> 01:35:14.330
<v Speaker 4>android yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there?</v>

2037
01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:16.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could have a google chromecast.</v>

2038
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:20.450
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That setup or Amazon fire stick.</v>

2039
01:35:20.451 --> 01:35:21.680
<v Speaker 4>I have that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2040
01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:26.800
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what that means is that like a stick </v>

2041
01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:26.870
<v Speaker 4>it into the USB?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that how it works?</v>

2042
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:31.400
<v Speaker 4>Or The htmi actual TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You download the chrome cast app to your</v>

2043
01:35:31.401 --> 01:35:34.370
<v Speaker 4>phone so that anytime you have a video </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing it because it just as good.</v>

2044
01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:35.570
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2045
01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:38.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't have an apple tv so I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never used it.</v>

2046
01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:41.660
<v Speaker 4>I have chromecast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2047
01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:46.680
<v Speaker 4>it works not as good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I really stutters a lot when you're</v>

2048
01:35:46.881 --> 01:35:50.300
<v Speaker 4>playing stuff back in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to play it through chrome only.</v>

2049
01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:51.260
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2050
01:35:51.261 --> 01:35:52.180
<v Speaker 4>you have to go through the browser.</v>

2051
01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:57.440
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of times like apple is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>way better when it comes to that in my </v>

2052
01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:59.570
<v Speaker 4>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing about the apple setup was that</v>

2053
01:35:59.571 --> 01:36:01.210
<v Speaker 4>it was instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2054
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:03.110
<v Speaker 4>That was what blew me away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend was like,</v>

2055
01:36:03.111 --> 01:36:04.610
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you from the moment I </v>

2059
01:36:14.050 --> 01:36:14.780
<v Speaker 4>received the text to the moment I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicked back on the couch watching it was</v>

2060
01:36:14.781 --> 01:36:16.250
<v Speaker 4>more than.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No more than 10 seconds.</v>

2061
01:36:16.290 --> 01:36:18.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>looking at the TV.</v>

2065
01:36:24.650 --> 01:36:28.430
<v Speaker 4>One clicking is so big like Amazon one </v>
<v Speaker 4>click.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That shit is not flushable.</v>

2088
01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:18.780
<v Speaker 4>You are clogging pipes all over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world that causing millions of dollars </v>

2089
01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:18.890
<v Speaker 4>for the plumbing problems all over the </v>

<v Speaker 4>Paint that stuff.</v>

2091
01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:25.700

<v Speaker 4>You can't just.</v>

2094
01:37:30.701 --> 01:37:33.260
<v Speaker 4>all those things are gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those toilets that we had in Japan,</v>

2095
01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:35.120
<v Speaker 4>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I have now.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're always there.</v>

2099
01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:42.770
<v Speaker 4>They have the shitty ones at Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just attached the topic.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Is that kind of you have give given the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazon.</v>

2101

<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you the company that I see own</v>

2102
01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:53.320
<v Speaker 4>my place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not going to put a nice toilet </v>

2103
01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:53.320
<v Speaker 4>removed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you leave,</v>

2104
01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:53.320
<v Speaker 4>you hire someone to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They come over,</v>

2105
01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:55.650
<v Speaker 4>they install it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you hire someone to take it out</v>

2106
01:37:55.651 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 4>when you're gone.</v>

2107
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:57.750
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you just don't want to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2108
01:37:57.751 --> 01:38:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a nice warm jet of water up your</v>

2109
01:38:01.981 --> 01:38:05.040
<v Speaker 1>asshole anytime you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a bit about it now.</v>

2110
01:38:05.041 --> 01:38:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Let him do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's true.</v>

2111
01:38:06.151 --> 01:38:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Like if you read some wacky tweets by </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2112
01:38:08.671 --> 01:38:12.270
<v Speaker 1>most likely I've got a jet of hot water </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting up my ass when I'm writing.</v>

2113
01:38:14.110 --> 01:38:19.110
<v Speaker 4>I do some ferocious tweeting on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>toilet when the UFC going back to Japan.</v>

2114
01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have any plans.</v>

2115
01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:23.410
<v Speaker 1>New York coming up first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2116
01:38:23.411 --> 01:38:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got approved in New York.</v>

2117
01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:28.960
<v Speaker 1>That was part of Rosie O'Donnell's </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother's gay fantasy.</v>

2118
01:38:29.410 --> 01:38:31.630
<v Speaker 1>They don't think they have a car setup </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

2119
01:38:32.110 --> 01:38:34.360
<v Speaker 1>The next big one is the John Jones </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

2120
01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:35.600
<v Speaker 1>which is in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2121
01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:38.230
<v Speaker 1>that's in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge card.</v>

2122
01:38:38.770 --> 01:38:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel cormier.</v>

2123
01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dump,</v>

2124
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.070
<v Speaker 1>dump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dump.</v>

2125
01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:46.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be insane.</v>

2126
01:38:47.230 --> 01:38:50.470
<v Speaker 4>There's a really cool documentary I </v>
<v Speaker 4>recommend called spy in the pod.</v>

2127
01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:54.580
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a three part BBC series.</v>

2128
01:38:54.730 --> 01:38:59.730
<v Speaker 4>What they did is they made these robot </v>
<v Speaker 4>fish and turtles and dolphins and they </v>

2129
01:38:59.730 --> 01:39:02.290
<v Speaker 4>had cameras all over them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in their eyes and stuff like that,</v>

2130
01:39:02.291 --> 01:39:07.291
<v Speaker 4>and they swam with the dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the dolphins thought these fake </v>

2131
01:39:07.291 --> 01:39:07.720
<v Speaker 4>robots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're like apart,</v>

2132
01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:10.150
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like friends or like another dolphin.</v>

2133
01:39:10.450 --> 01:39:15.450
<v Speaker 4>And it's really cool how they got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really into like things that no </v>

2134
01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:16.420
<v Speaker 4>one's ever seen before because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2135
01:39:16.770 --> 01:39:18.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a robot.</v>

2136
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:19.860
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2137
01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:25.080
<v Speaker 4>it's also really cool to see how other </v>
<v Speaker 4>fish attacked like the turtle and stuff </v>

2138
01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:27.010
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that seemed like that's a camera.</v>

2139
01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:32.040
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a fake turtle that's going </v>

2140
01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.140
<v Speaker 4>around and that's a fake fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really silly also,</v>

2141
01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:35.490
<v Speaker 4>but it got really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2142
01:39:35.630 --> 01:39:38.730
<v Speaker 1>it was dolphins catching flying fish in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air and their mouth.</v>

2143
01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dolphin life is a ball.</v>

2144
01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:43.770
<v Speaker 1>They're just having a great old time out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the ocean.</v>

2145
01:39:44.650 --> 01:39:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Is He?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seaworld is say they're not going to </v>

2146
01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:49.650
<v Speaker 1>breed orcas anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2147
01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:49.920
<v Speaker 1>But that's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

2148
01:39:49.921 --> 01:39:54.921
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to breed our slaves </v>
<v Speaker 1>slaves and no longer going to make any </v>

2149
01:39:54.921 --> 01:39:56.640
<v Speaker 1>space another way to buy them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry,</v>

2150
01:39:56.641 --> 01:39:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2151
01:39:58.230 --> 01:40:03.230
<v Speaker 1>that's what got exposed by Phil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phil Demaris when he was on the podcast </v>

2152
01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:05.310
<v Speaker 1>exposed that he's like sea world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're liars.</v>

2153
01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:08.520
<v Speaker 1>They're getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dolphins in their orchestra from</v>

2154
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:11.280
<v Speaker 1>another company which gets them from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild.</v>

2155
01:40:11.550 --> 01:40:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how they got them and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to say,</v>

2156
01:40:13.651 --> 01:40:15.260
<v Speaker 1>we haven't gotten a captive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2157
01:40:15.610 --> 01:40:17.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm an Orca from the wild in 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2158
01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.950
<v Speaker 1>that's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not true.</v>

2159
01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't gotten them from the wild.</v>

2160
01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:24.030
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they haven't done it.</v>

2161
01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.700
<v Speaker 1>They got somebody else to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody else did it.</v>

2162
01:40:26.701 --> 01:40:31.701
<v Speaker 1>They sold it to one organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they got their dolphins from that </v>

2163
01:40:31.701 --> 01:40:31.701
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all fucked up,</v>

2164
01:40:31.701 --> 01:40:31.720
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are.</v>

2165
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Those are like people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2166
01:40:33.631 --> 01:40:34.710
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a water person.</v>

2167
01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:40.310
<v Speaker 1>And they're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a different way of existing </v>

2168
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:42.210
<v Speaker 1>than we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are smart as shit,</v>

2169
01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:46.380
<v Speaker 1>like in some crazy way that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the noises they make.</v>

2170
01:40:46.650 --> 01:40:48.960
<v Speaker 1>We still can't decipher them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know what the hell they're</v>

2171
01:40:48.961 --> 01:40:51.240
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea what they're saying,</v>

2172
01:40:51.241 --> 01:40:53.620
<v Speaker 1>but they know what they're saying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

2173
01:40:53.621 --> 01:40:57.580
<v Speaker 1>That is that like they have a language </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have been studying.</v>

2174
01:40:57.581 --> 01:41:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Lilly was studying that shit in the</v>

2175
01:41:00.641 --> 01:41:04.510
<v Speaker 1>19 sixties and when lily was done </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying it,</v>

2176
01:41:04.690 --> 01:41:09.690
<v Speaker 1>what they were trying to do is they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to talk dolphins into making </v>

2177
01:41:09.690 --> 01:41:09.970
<v Speaker 1>people noises.</v>

2178
01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:14.410
<v Speaker 1>There's a radiolab podcast about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called hello.</v>

2179
01:41:15.310 --> 01:41:20.310
<v Speaker 1>And they were trying to figure out a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get dolphins to make human language </v>

2180
01:41:20.681 --> 01:41:24.250
<v Speaker 1>noises so that we could understand them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They even have the voice box to do that.</v>

2181
01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:25.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2182
01:41:25.330 --> 01:41:27.520
<v Speaker 1>that was part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they wanted to imitate it.</v>

2183
01:41:27.521 --> 01:41:30.490
<v Speaker 1>But also part of the problem was they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had this lady,</v>

2184
01:41:30.491 --> 01:41:34.420
<v Speaker 1>researcher Lilly who was crazy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that don't know.</v>

2185
01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:35.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>

2186
01:41:35.231 --> 01:41:38.380
<v Speaker 1>crazy but crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lily invented the semi,</v>

2187
01:41:38.410 --> 01:41:40.870
<v Speaker 1>the sensory deprivation tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lily.</v>

2188
01:41:40.871 --> 01:41:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm also was this pioneer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interspecies communication.</v>

2189
01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was really like working on this </v>

2190
01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:51.700
<v Speaker 1>dolphin thing long before anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was viable.</v>

2191
01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:54.610
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with dolphins and the one of</v>

2192
01:41:54.611 --> 01:41:58.210
<v Speaker 1>the methods that he came up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was set up a sensory deprivation tank</v>

2193
01:41:58.211 --> 01:42:03.211
<v Speaker 1>next to a dolphin tank and he would take</v>
<v Speaker 1>acid and climbing the sensory </v>

2194
01:42:03.211 --> 01:42:07.771
<v Speaker 1>deprivation tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jacked up on acid and try to like sense </v>

2195
01:42:07.771 --> 01:42:11.581
<v Speaker 1>thoughts through the water and listened </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them talking and see if he could </v>

2196
01:42:11.581 --> 01:42:11.581
<v Speaker 1>decipher them.</v>

2197
01:42:11.581 --> 01:42:15.960
<v Speaker 1>And apparently he had some anecdotal </v>
<v Speaker 1>success or he kind of understood what </v>

2198
01:42:16.991 --> 01:42:17.650
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who,</v>

2199
01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fucked up on acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what he's actually seeing.</v>

2200
01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:22.860
<v Speaker 1>But the woman that he was with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2201
01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:25.090
<v Speaker 1>this was the interesting part about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

2202
01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:27.640
<v Speaker 1>the woman that was part of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>

2203
01:42:27.850 --> 01:42:32.850
<v Speaker 1>she lived in this place that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>created for dolphins and the place that </v>

2204
01:42:33.101 --> 01:42:36.280
<v Speaker 1>they created for dolphins was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had this,</v>

2205
01:42:36.281 --> 01:42:41.281
<v Speaker 1>I'm like living room setup and they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>water in the living room and these </v>

2206
01:42:41.281 --> 01:42:45.991
<v Speaker 1>dolphins swam around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or this dolphin swam around in this </v>

2207
01:42:45.991 --> 01:42:48.670
<v Speaker 1>water with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it lived with her,</v>

2208
01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:53.700
<v Speaker 1>like her bed was in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she would like get out of bed and </v>

2209
01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:57.960
<v Speaker 1>stepped down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she'd be in waist high water and </v>

2210
01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:57.960
<v Speaker 1>she'd walk around like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2211
01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:00.430
<v Speaker 1>the dolphins in this area that often </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets horny and it's a big distraction.</v>

2212
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:02.770
<v Speaker 1>So what she decides to do is start </v>
<v Speaker 1>jerking the dolphin off.</v>

2213
01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Just like that guy that got caught last </v>
<v Speaker 1>week that you hear about this.</v>

2214
01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:08.350
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2215
01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:13.440
<v Speaker 1>This happened last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course every time there's any </v>

2216
01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:13.450
<v Speaker 1>kind of news with dolphin sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone tweets me.</v>

2217
01:43:13.451 --> 01:43:18.451
<v Speaker 1>So dolphin sex abuse whistleblower calls</v>
<v Speaker 1>out aquarium for jerking off sea </v>

2218
01:43:18.451 --> 01:43:19.450
<v Speaker 1>mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that a bad thing?</v>

2219
01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this lady,</v>

2220
01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:24.700
<v Speaker 1>what was her description of it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2221
01:43:24.850 --> 01:43:28.070
<v Speaker 1>it was a physical need that had to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken care of before they can go back to</v>

2222
01:43:28.071 --> 01:43:31.210
<v Speaker 1>doing the work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this dolphin was so distracted.</v>

2223
01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:33.760
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing over there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at that story,</v>

2224
01:43:35.110 --> 01:43:36.820
<v Speaker 1>still looking it up after you put it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the screen.</v>

2225
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:39.760
<v Speaker 1>He cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just put it up.</v>

2226
01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she,</v>

2227
01:43:41.850 --> 01:43:42.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

2228
01:43:42.821 --> 01:43:46.840
<v Speaker 1>this is just a reality of being a living</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing with a sex drive.</v>

2229
01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Like we have to take care of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it's going to distract them,</v>

2230
01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:54.390
<v Speaker 1>but that shut down all the research and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they found out about lily doing </v>

2231
01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:54.550
<v Speaker 1>acid and he's also being in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketamine.</v>

2232
01:43:54.570 --> 01:43:58.940
<v Speaker 1>You'd shoot ketamine into Moscow </v>
<v Speaker 1>intramuscularly and get into the sensory</v>

2233
01:43:58.941 --> 01:44:01.520
<v Speaker 1>deprivation tank guy was out of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

2234
01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Just some of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially back then when people didn't </v>

2235
01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:10.040
<v Speaker 1>really know what the fuck ketamine was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2236
01:44:10.041 --> 01:44:13.360
<v Speaker 1>they didn't understand what this guy was</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and this is the acid days,</v>

2237
01:44:13.361 --> 01:44:18.361
<v Speaker 1>like acid wasn't even illegal back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy was doing all these wacky </v>

2238
01:44:18.361 --> 01:44:20.780
<v Speaker 1>experiments and he was so far off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep end,</v>

2239
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:26.050
<v Speaker 1>like so far removed from what most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people knew about psychedelic drugs that</v>

2240
01:44:26.841 --> 01:44:31.841
<v Speaker 1>he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just out there on the furthest </v>

2241
01:44:31.841 --> 01:44:33.410
<v Speaker 1>fringes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now just to this day,</v>

2242
01:44:33.411 --> 01:44:35.660
<v Speaker 1>people are still trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck he was doing.</v>

2243
01:44:36.150 --> 01:44:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Still trying to figure out how far we </v>
<v Speaker 1>got and what,</v>

2244
01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:40.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>

2245
01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:43.350
<v Speaker 1>he was a real crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Lily.</v>

2246
01:44:43.351 --> 01:44:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the,</v>

2247
01:44:44.661 --> 01:44:47.630
<v Speaker 1>the motivation behind that movie altered</v>
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>

2248
01:44:48.050 --> 01:44:51.740
<v Speaker 1>That was all about lily because lily was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scientist and you know,</v>

2249
01:44:51.741 --> 01:44:53.840
<v Speaker 1>then he was taken all this crazy shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are like,</v>

2250
01:44:53.841 --> 01:44:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2251
01:44:54.170 --> 01:44:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing,</v>

2252
01:44:55.461 --> 01:45:00.461
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're taking some crazy </v>

2253
01:45:00.461 --> 01:45:00.461
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs and we don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>really understand.</v>

2254
01:45:00.461 --> 01:45:00.461
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

2255
01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:01.520
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2256
01:45:02.810 --> 01:45:04.490
<v Speaker 1>leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll go hang out with dolphins.</v>

2257
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:07.550
<v Speaker 1>It would just take this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

2258
01:45:07.551 --> 01:45:12.551
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radio lab podcast is really </v>

2259
01:45:12.551 --> 01:45:14.291
<v Speaker 1>interesting because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird how hung up people get where </v>

2260
01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:19.330
<v Speaker 1>as soon as it becomes about sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if the dolphin had any other needs </v>

2261
01:45:19.330 --> 01:45:21.870
<v Speaker 1>that had to be met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe dolphins have a,</v>

2262
01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:25.730
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of hugging that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to have on a daily basis.</v>

2263
01:45:25.730 --> 01:45:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe their unique requirements are</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they need to be caressed on a daily</v>

2264
01:45:31.041 --> 01:45:32.390
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they get sick.</v>

2265
01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:34.790
<v Speaker 1>If people just climbing in the tank with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and correct them,</v>

2266
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:38.060
<v Speaker 1>no one ever problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's caressing his dick.</v>

2267
01:45:38.690 --> 01:45:40.220
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>

2268
01:45:40.610 --> 01:45:45.610
<v Speaker 1>That's where you draw the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We draw the line there because we're </v>

2269
01:45:45.610 --> 01:45:48.881
<v Speaker 1>ashamed of sex were shamed or sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a scientist who addresses sexuality </v>

2270
01:45:50.151 --> 01:45:53.570
<v Speaker 1>the same way we would address food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shelter,</v>

2271
01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:55.760
<v Speaker 1>warmth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as a physical need.</v>

2272
01:45:55.761 --> 01:46:00.761
<v Speaker 1>She addressed it as a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not confined by the constraints of our </v>

2273
01:46:00.761 --> 01:46:02.840
<v Speaker 1>culture and our ridiculous civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just thought about,</v>

2274
01:46:02.841 --> 01:46:03.890
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a problem here,</v>

2275
01:46:04.130 --> 01:46:06.500
<v Speaker 1>let's take care of this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we can try to get this thing to</v>

2276
01:46:06.501 --> 01:46:08.480
<v Speaker 1>say hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's like,</v>

2277
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:10.730
<v Speaker 1>we're shutting it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're jerking off.</v>

2278
01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:15.731
<v Speaker 1>Dolphins is John Lilly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assistance that are alive are working </v>

2279
01:46:18.231 --> 01:46:19.250
<v Speaker 1>and that woman's.</v>

2280
01:46:19.250 --> 01:46:21.710
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the women in the Radiolab </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

2281
01:46:21.711 --> 01:46:23.030
<v Speaker 1>She's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2282
01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:26.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a few of them that are alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm todd mccormick,</v>

2283
01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:29.150
<v Speaker 1>has John Lilly's sensory deprivation </v>
<v Speaker 1>tank.</v>

2284
01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:34.390
<v Speaker 1>He's got one of his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a part of the early Samati </v>

2285
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.390
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

2286
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:38.861
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first sensory deprivation tank was a </v>

2287
01:46:38.861 --> 01:46:39.320
<v Speaker 1>somebody that's the one I wound up </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving away online.</v>

2288
01:46:39.321 --> 01:46:44.321
<v Speaker 1>Remember we made that video and we gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>it away was when I found out about the </v>

2289
01:46:44.321 --> 01:46:45.290
<v Speaker 1>float lab float labs pot there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their pods,</v>

2290
01:46:45.291 --> 01:46:48.590
<v Speaker 1>they're a sensory depth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tanks are just so much better.</v>

2291
01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:51.930
<v Speaker 1>There's two companies that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking kill it right now.</v>

2292
01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:55.800
<v Speaker 1>There's a float lab which just kills it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make the best shit.</v>

2293
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Everything is state of the art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>state of the art,</v>

2294
01:46:58.610 --> 01:47:01.680
<v Speaker 1>a decontamination of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ozone,</v>

2295
01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:02.880
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

2296
01:47:02.881 --> 01:47:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I've zeroed like connection with them or</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other sensory deprivation tank.</v>

2297
01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:10.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

2298
01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not selling them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although we have talked to,</v>

2299
01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:14.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another company in,</v>

2300
01:47:15.090 --> 01:47:16.980
<v Speaker 1>in Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does the zero gravity.</v>

2301
01:47:16.981 --> 01:47:21.981
<v Speaker 1>Is that what's called an Austin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure it's that they have a dope </v>

2302
01:47:21.981 --> 01:47:22.830
<v Speaker 1>tank as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've thought about,</v>

2303
01:47:22.850 --> 01:47:23.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

2304
01:47:23.730 --> 01:47:28.730
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the onnit company of releasing an audit </v>

2305
01:47:28.730 --> 01:47:32.300
<v Speaker 1>tank or being involved in some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>high end tank because what this guy's </v>

2306
01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:35.730
<v Speaker 1>doing in Austin is A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin is his name zero gravity.</v>

2307
01:47:36.090 --> 01:47:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin is doing it with,</v>

2308
01:47:38.380 --> 01:47:43.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's using like bolt holes like the,</v>

2309
01:47:44.311 --> 01:47:46.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same companies that make.</v>

2310
01:47:46.561 --> 01:47:47.880
<v Speaker 1>There's Kevin right there with the long </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>

2311
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Look at that fucking God damn hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy by the way.</v>

2312
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Super Nice Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his,</v>

2313
01:47:54.181 --> 01:47:59.181
<v Speaker 1>his tanks are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're right up there with the float </v>

2314
01:47:59.181 --> 01:47:59.340
<v Speaker 1>lab tanks and what they're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of having a lining,</v>

2315
01:47:59.650 --> 01:48:03.540
<v Speaker 1>like the float lab uses this super thick</v>
<v Speaker 1>lining.</v>

2316
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:06.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to what the float labs look like</v>

2317
01:48:06.571 --> 01:48:11.571
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're just real heavy duty float </v>

2318
01:48:11.571 --> 01:48:16.161
<v Speaker 1>lab uses the aligning that they use when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make Koi ponds that real thick </v>

2319
01:48:16.201 --> 01:48:21.201
<v Speaker 1>rubber lining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was a big problem with the </v>

2320
01:48:21.201 --> 01:48:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Cemati tanks was that the lining would </v>
<v Speaker 1>burn out because uh,</v>

2321
01:48:22.291 --> 01:48:27.291
<v Speaker 1>occasionally you get like a hole in it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then some water would get through </v>

2322
01:48:27.291 --> 01:48:31.671
<v Speaker 1>and it would get on the heating element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would short circuit and burned </v>

2323
01:48:31.671 --> 01:48:32.370
<v Speaker 1>through and then it would flood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happened to me.</v>

2324
01:48:32.371 --> 01:48:33.990
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my basement got flooded.</v>

2325
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy guys figured out a way </v>

2326
01:48:39.910 --> 01:48:41.430
<v Speaker 1>around that no lining at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And instead they use A.</v>

2327
01:48:41.470 --> 01:48:46.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm like the same sort of manufacturing </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles that you would make a boat </v>

2328
01:48:46.801 --> 01:48:48.750
<v Speaker 1>out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so tall?</v>

2329
01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:51.510
<v Speaker 1>So you stand in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you want to stand in it?</v>

2330
01:48:51.570 --> 01:48:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Because you can lie in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to duck when you get </v>

2331
01:48:56.570 --> 01:48:56.700
<v Speaker 1>out or you can just stand up and walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2332
01:48:57.090 --> 01:49:00.130
<v Speaker 1>So they just made them taller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also you get more air in there.</v>

2333
01:49:00.450 --> 01:49:04.890
<v Speaker 1>The float lab ones have buttons that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can press that circulate the air.</v>

2334
01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Like mine has three different speeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can have a little bit of air,</v>

2335
01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:12.990
<v Speaker 1>a lot of air or just blows like full </v>
<v Speaker 1>blast or it get shut it off.</v>

2336
01:49:13.410 --> 01:49:17.310
<v Speaker 1>So you could circulate some air inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chamber while you're in it.</v>

2337
01:49:17.850 --> 01:49:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time I have that off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can turn it on.</v>

2338
01:49:20.970 --> 01:49:25.230
<v Speaker 1>It also helps to cool your body off a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit because sometimes you can get</v>

2339
01:49:25.231 --> 01:49:30.231
<v Speaker 1>a little sweaty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's hard to get the shut that </v>

2340
01:49:30.231 --> 01:49:33.780
<v Speaker 1>fucking phone watch nonsense off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take it off man.</v>

2341
01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:36.450
<v Speaker 1>He can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't.</v>

2342
01:49:36.451 --> 01:49:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Dang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every hour.</v>

2343
01:49:37.291 --> 01:49:42.291
<v Speaker 1>That's just retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you haven't done the years is due </v>

2344
01:49:42.291 --> 01:49:42.291
<v Speaker 1>every hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a clock.</v>

2345
01:49:42.291 --> 01:49:45.870
<v Speaker 1>That was my alarm system here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're exactly at 4:00.</v>

2346
01:49:45.871 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 1>You haven't done the music or isn't it </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>

2347
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:48.710
<v Speaker 4>have you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2348
01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:49.060
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2349
01:49:49.061 --> 01:49:51.620
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you interested in trying that much?</v>

2350
01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:52.930
<v Speaker 4>But no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting,</v>

2351
01:49:53.050 --> 01:49:54.670
<v Speaker 4>I just haven't gotten down to their </v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

2352
01:49:54.671 --> 01:49:57.190
<v Speaker 4>I only use the tank that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I would definitely try it.</v>

2353
01:49:57.550 --> 01:50:02.550
<v Speaker 4>What he's done with the music thing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>figuring out how to wait to have these </v>

2354
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:05.161
<v Speaker 4>floating waterproof speakers that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>right next to your ears and they </v>

2355
01:50:05.161 --> 01:50:09.331
<v Speaker 4>literally make the water vibrates so you</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel music in your feet and your skin.</v>

2356
01:50:09.851 --> 01:50:14.851
<v Speaker 4>You feel it in your balls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you feel the music and the water </v>

2357
01:50:14.851 --> 01:50:18.281
<v Speaker 4>and it's supposed to be incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to be like some real next </v>

2358
01:50:18.281 --> 01:50:20.660
<v Speaker 4>level shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're cute.</v>

2359
01:50:20.770 --> 01:50:22.110
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even really need that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those wouldn't.</v>

2360
01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:24.610
<v Speaker 4>Binaural beats I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get some interesting.</v>

2361
01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:25.600
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

2362
01:50:25.690 --> 01:50:27.040
<v Speaker 4>Didn't you just get frozen the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>day?</v>

2363
01:50:27.041 --> 01:50:28.540
<v Speaker 4>Jamie did the crypto thing.</v>

2364
01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:29.980
<v Speaker 4>How was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was great.</v>

2365
01:50:29.981 --> 01:50:31.780
<v Speaker 4>It was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't genuine.</v>

2366
01:50:32.230 --> 01:50:34.900
<v Speaker 4>It was a bit like what I would expect if</v>
<v Speaker 4>a torturous.</v>

2367
01:50:34.930 --> 01:50:37.420
<v Speaker 4>Does it feel like torture?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No physical be tortured?</v>

2368
01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:38.700
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2369
01:50:39.130 --> 01:50:40.720
<v Speaker 4>I was just playing a mind game with </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself.</v>

2370
01:50:40.721 --> 01:50:43.570
<v Speaker 4>I only went for two minutes and they put</v>
<v Speaker 4>music which help go do it.</v>

2371
01:50:43.571 --> 01:50:44.280
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2372
01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:46.270
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't mind it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's do it.</v>

2373
01:50:46.350 --> 01:50:48.640
<v Speaker 4>Let's do it right after this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just like a little mind game.</v>

2374
01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:50.320
<v Speaker 4>They're playing led Zeppelin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'd like,</v>

2375
01:50:50.321 --> 01:50:55.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's music and it's only two minutes </v>

2376
01:50:55.321 --> 01:50:57.481
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a full song so you're just </v>

2377
01:50:57.481 --> 01:50:57.481
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>

2378
01:50:57.481 --> 01:50:58.300
<v Speaker 4>it sucks for the first 30 seconds I even</v>
<v Speaker 4>know what you're expecting.</v>

2379
01:50:58.301 --> 01:50:59.150
<v Speaker 4>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

2380
01:50:59.151 --> 01:50:59.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm here,</v>

2381
01:50:59.831 --> 01:51:01.330
<v Speaker 4>this is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like Rhonda,</v>

2382
01:51:01.331 --> 01:51:03.490
<v Speaker 4>Patrick Number,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body gets used to it.</v>

2383
01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.860
<v Speaker 4>So like when you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you did those two minutes,</v>

2384
01:51:05.861 --> 01:51:06.790
<v Speaker 4>felt like an eternity.</v>

2385
01:51:07.150 --> 01:51:09.220
<v Speaker 4>After awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three minutes feels pretty easy.</v>

2386
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:11.860
<v Speaker 4>He just sits down there no more than </v>
<v Speaker 4>three.</v>

2387
01:51:11.861 --> 01:51:12.720
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like the.</v>

2388
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:15.850
<v Speaker 4>I've done three slash 20 simone I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever done three minutes.</v>

2389
01:51:15.851 --> 01:51:17.530
<v Speaker 4>Twenty seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets hairy.</v>

2390
01:51:17.650 --> 01:51:22.650
<v Speaker 4>Those last 20 seconds get a little air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there any part of your body that acs </v>

2391
01:51:22.650 --> 01:51:26.130
<v Speaker 4>does something that you've noticed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like your butthole for free shot or </v>

2392
01:51:26.130 --> 01:51:27.880
<v Speaker 4>dizzy or decor?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like kind of know your legs,</v>

2393
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:30.070
<v Speaker 4>shake your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>start shaking.</v>

2394
01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:32.020
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't as cold as I thought it would </v>
<v Speaker 4>be honest.</v>

2395
01:51:32.021 --> 01:51:37.021
<v Speaker 4>I thought it would be unbearably cold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been in cold situations before and </v>

2396
01:51:37.021 --> 01:51:41.461
<v Speaker 4>it's just as cold as you get sick balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like did they get the tight or you know </v>

2397
01:51:41.741 --> 01:51:42.550
<v Speaker 4>what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when your,</v>

2398
01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:47.760
<v Speaker 4>like when your balls are talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>your testicles and know that you're </v>

2399
01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:48.010
<v Speaker 4>wearing underwear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your um,</v>

2400
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:50.860
<v Speaker 4>what happens is your body at first is </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2401
01:51:50.861 --> 01:51:54.010
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit and it doesn't feel that cold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it feels like,</v>

2402
01:51:54.011 --> 01:51:55.570
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can stand it.</v>

2403
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:58.480
<v Speaker 4>But after a couple minutes it reveals </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

2404
01:51:59.090 --> 01:52:01.330
<v Speaker 4>You hit three minutes and it reveals </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

2405
01:52:01.331 --> 01:52:02.800
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

2406
01:52:02.801 --> 01:52:07.801
<v Speaker 4>Like it reaches a level of cold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like where your body can't keep itself </v>

2407
01:52:07.801 --> 01:52:08.080
<v Speaker 4>warm anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And your body also,</v>

2408
01:52:08.081 --> 01:52:13.081
<v Speaker 4>your blood has retreated your buds </v>
<v Speaker 4>retreating to your core to try to </v>

2409
01:52:13.081 --> 01:52:14.890
<v Speaker 4>protect your dancing Oregon time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just side to side to side step.</v>

2410
01:52:14.891 --> 01:52:19.891
<v Speaker 4>And then do you have a sensor on or in </v>
<v Speaker 4>any way they're detecting your heart </v>

2411
01:52:19.891 --> 01:52:20.830
<v Speaker 4>rate to make sure you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're right there.</v>

2412
01:52:20.831 --> 01:52:25.831
<v Speaker 4>They could see you through the glass and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could always leave anytime you want </v>

2413
01:52:25.831 --> 01:52:26.340
<v Speaker 4>and walk out the door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The door's right next to you.</v>

2414
01:52:26.341 --> 01:52:27.700
<v Speaker 4>It's not a hard to open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just push it.</v>

2415
01:52:27.701 --> 01:52:32.701
<v Speaker 4>You stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem with it is if you touch the </v>

2416
01:52:33.221 --> 01:52:35.200
<v Speaker 4>walls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could definitely get some frost bite</v>

2417
01:52:35.201 --> 01:52:36.670
<v Speaker 4>you gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make sure you don't touch the walls.</v>

2418
01:52:37.150 --> 01:52:39.490
<v Speaker 4>You gotta stand in the center.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>

2419
01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:44.520
<v Speaker 4>don't touch anything with your skin </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know it's not a lot of room </v>

2420
01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 4>to move and it's 270 degrees below zero</v>

2421
01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:48.110
<v Speaker 1>shits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No joke.</v>

2422
01:52:48.450 --> 01:52:50.140
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be scary.</v>

2423
01:52:50.150 --> 01:52:52.480
<v Speaker 4>You're building yourself up more in like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a haunted house,</v>

2424
01:52:52.481 --> 01:52:54.700
<v Speaker 4>like it's not that bad when you should </v>
<v Speaker 4>get some of that scary dude.</v>

2425
01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:59.940
<v Speaker 4>It's freaky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't like being in situations </v>

2426
01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:02.101
<v Speaker 4>where what if this door accidentally </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's breaks and they have to open it in </v>

2427
01:53:02.101 --> 01:53:02.980
<v Speaker 4>10 minutes or I die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could open it.</v>

2428
01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:04.060
<v Speaker 4>It's not hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2429
01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:06.160
<v Speaker 4>Just pushes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't have a knob.</v>

2430
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:09.220
<v Speaker 4>It just pushes shot and closes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got a little handle on it.</v>

2431
01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:11.410
<v Speaker 4>It's not even like being in a cooler at </v>
<v Speaker 4>a restaurant.</v>

2432
01:53:11.470 --> 01:53:16.470
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm thinking is super easy </v>

2433
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.470
<v Speaker 4>to open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It opens pretty easy.</v>

2434
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:17.530
<v Speaker 4>It opens easy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's really weird.</v>

2435
01:53:18.130 --> 01:53:19.120
<v Speaker 4>But afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2436
01:53:19.121 --> 01:53:21.040
<v Speaker 4>you feel amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't you feel great?</v>

2437
01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:23.130
<v Speaker 4>I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2438
01:53:23.170 --> 01:53:25.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I drank coffee later that night,</v>

2439
01:53:25.211 --> 01:53:29.020
<v Speaker 4>but it kept me up like I had way more </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy than I usually do on a given day.</v>

2440
01:53:29.021 --> 01:53:29.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2441
01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Well with Dr Patrick said it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Epinephrin and then your brain produces </v>

2442
01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:38.861
<v Speaker 1>it and also cold shock proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They produce all this anti inflammatory </v>

2443
01:53:38.861 --> 01:53:42.911
<v Speaker 1>response and the way it makes your brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels very interesting the way it makes </v>

2444
01:53:42.911 --> 01:53:44.690
<v Speaker 1>your whole body feel like you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

2445
01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2446
01:53:46.131 --> 01:53:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>

2447
01:53:48.141 --> 01:53:51.740
<v Speaker 1>You feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know the physical benefits of it</v>

2448
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for anybody who works out and </v>

2449
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.430
<v Speaker 1>lift weights and does anything where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2450
01:53:57.430 --> 01:54:01.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have soreness and inflammation and </v>

2451
01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:01.780
<v Speaker 1>apparently for people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>arthritis,</v>

2452
01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:03.410
<v Speaker 1>it offers a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of help,</v>

2453
01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:05.390
<v Speaker 1>a lot of assistance for people that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2454
01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:06.440
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking love it.</v>

2455
01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:11.700
<v Speaker 4>You have never taken an ice bath though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't supposed to be just as good </v>

2456
01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:11.730
<v Speaker 4>or better jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's better.</v>

2457
01:54:11.970 --> 01:54:16.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't think ice baths or really easy </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a lot of people just to do because </v>

2458
01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:17.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll just have it at the gym list.</v>

2459
01:54:17.881 --> 01:54:20.270
<v Speaker 4>They have a hold on their spotlight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're starting to have for cryotherapy</v>

2460
01:54:20.410 --> 01:54:23.110
<v Speaker 1>for everyone to have an ice bath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's 15 minutes to.</v>

2461
01:54:23.111 --> 01:54:28.111
<v Speaker 1>That's what you supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people do 20 shop says it's </v>

2462
01:54:28.111 --> 01:54:29.440
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says the ice bath gives him like more</v>

2463
01:54:29.441 --> 01:54:34.441
<v Speaker 1>relief than the tank and also a wim Hoff</v>
<v Speaker 1>said the ice bath has some benefits of </v>

2464
01:54:36.731 --> 01:54:41.731
<v Speaker 1>the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't have because you learn how to </v>

2465
01:54:41.731 --> 01:54:44.611
<v Speaker 1>breathe in those 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a long time as opposed to like the </v>

2466
01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:45.070
<v Speaker 1>three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

2467
01:54:45.150 --> 01:54:48.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cooling tanks,</v>

2468
01:54:48.341 --> 01:54:49.660
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd,</v>

2469
01:54:49.661 --> 01:54:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Janet Chambers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get in them right as they start</v>

2470
01:54:52.571 --> 01:54:53.500
<v Speaker 1>to soc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over,</v>

2471
01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:59.220
<v Speaker 1>but when you get that ice bath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that sucks from the jump and I </v>

2472
01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:02.530
<v Speaker 1>think learning how to calm yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sock is what's what it's all about.</v>

2473
01:55:02.531 --> 01:55:07.531
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the same Epinephrin I bet maybe </v>

2474
01:55:07.531 --> 01:55:10.611
<v Speaker 1>you get more because you're in that tank</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time with that ice water in </v>

2475
01:55:10.611 --> 01:55:10.990
<v Speaker 1>there for 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so who knows?</v>

2476
01:55:10.990 --> 01:55:15.990
<v Speaker 1>You might get a bigger purse of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Epinephrin and from people that have </v>

2477
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:17.740
<v Speaker 1>done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that it's more relief from like</v>

2478
01:55:17.741 --> 01:55:20.140
<v Speaker 1>soreness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Brendan swears.</v>

2479
01:55:20.170 --> 01:55:24.100
<v Speaker 1>That's more relief and make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done it so I can't comment.</v>

2480
01:55:24.190 --> 01:55:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I should probably do it just so I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference.</v>

2481
01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:28.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll just probably do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should probably have a good workout,</v>

2482
01:55:29.070 --> 01:55:32.230
<v Speaker 1>like lift some weights or something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then go do it and see if periscope it.</v>

2483
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should.</v>

2484
01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably should because I do the tank </v>

2485
01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:38.920
<v Speaker 1>so often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should probably know,</v>

2486
01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:43.290
<v Speaker 1>but I know that the first time I started</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing people talk about how you feel </v>

2487
01:55:43.921 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 1>when</v>

2488
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.340
<v Speaker 2>you get out though was when people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the sensory deprivation tank.</v>

2489
01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:52.820
<v Speaker 2>I never heard about people saying they </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt good when they got out of the ice </v>

2490
01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:53.640
<v Speaker 2>bath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like happy it was over,</v>

2491
01:55:53.970 --> 01:55:55.920
<v Speaker 2>but I don't remember people saying they </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt good.</v>

2492
01:55:56.070 --> 01:55:58.620
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it requires a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature.</v>

2493
01:55:58.621 --> 01:56:03.621
<v Speaker 2>You experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She probably already talked about this </v>

2494
01:56:03.621 --> 01:56:03.621
<v Speaker 2>and we forgot it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2495
01:56:03.621 --> 01:56:05.100
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine she had a temperature in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2496
01:56:05.101 --> 01:56:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2497
01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:08.670
<v Speaker 2>She fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too much fucking information.</v>

2498
01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:11.280
<v Speaker 2>They can't keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She does it with no notes either.</v>

2499
01:56:11.281 --> 01:56:16.281
<v Speaker 2>By the way folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll have like a notebook that she </v>

2500
01:56:16.281 --> 01:56:17.580
<v Speaker 2>never looks at and she's rattling off </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that information with no notes.</v>

2501
01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:22.640
<v Speaker 2>She said one of the few people that I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever met that makes me feel really </v>

2502
01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:22.640
<v Speaker 2>fucking stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2503
01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:26.130
<v Speaker 2>I think I asked her three times </v>
<v Speaker 2>separately after that podcast like,</v>

2504
01:56:26.131 --> 01:56:27.910
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please explain to me like I'm five,</v>

2505
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:28.980
<v Speaker 2>this sauna thing.</v>

2506
01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it right.</v>

2507
01:56:29.980 --> 01:56:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2508
01:56:30.690 --> 01:56:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Ten minutes is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2509
01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:37.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a few people that have </v>

2510
01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:40.161
<v Speaker 2>talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like really fucking stupid while </v>

2511
01:56:40.161 --> 01:56:40.161
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to them where I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to like,</v>

2512
01:56:40.410 --> 01:56:40.850
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2513
01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:45.390
<v Speaker 2>what is it like on your planet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you time travel?</v>

2514
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:48.840
<v Speaker 2>What do you know about us and did you </v>
<v Speaker 2>create us?</v>

2515
01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Your questions are valid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will answer them now.</v>

2516
01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who else makes me feel that stupid?</v>

2517
01:56:56.720 --> 01:56:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Nailed a cross tastes and he makes me </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel that stupid.</v>

2518
01:56:59.270 --> 01:57:00.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Schiff,</v>

2519
01:57:00.001 --> 01:57:02.500
<v Speaker 2>he made me feel pretty stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2520
01:57:02.610 --> 01:57:03.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who made me feel pretty stupid.</v>

2521
01:57:03.841 --> 01:57:05.250
<v Speaker 2>I still don't understand what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>he said.</v>

2522
01:57:05.610 --> 01:57:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Was that physicists dude?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met cost Goswami?</v>

2523
01:57:08.131 --> 01:57:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2524
01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:11.760
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goswami man.</v>

2525
01:57:11.761 --> 01:57:16.761
<v Speaker 2>To this day I will have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put on that podcast is try to grab </v>

2526
01:57:16.761 --> 01:57:20.871
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to figure out what he was saying he </v>

2527
01:57:20.871 --> 01:57:21.990
<v Speaker 2>was talking about like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a quantum physicist.</v>

2528
01:57:21.991 --> 01:57:26.991
<v Speaker 2>Is that how you describe them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or string of quantum theory and string </v>

2529
01:57:26.991 --> 01:57:27.840
<v Speaker 2>theory and whoa man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That stuff is like,</v>

2530
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:32.280
<v Speaker 2>hold the fuck on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you even saying like that stuff</v>

2531
01:57:32.281 --> 01:57:36.510
<v Speaker 2>is so far out the deep band as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>like how to grasp it.</v>

2532
01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:39.120
<v Speaker 2>You hear that guy describing things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2533
01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:41.030
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

2534
01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:47.460
<v Speaker 2>He's a little too smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's cool and he doesn't give a fuck who</v>

2535
01:57:47.461 --> 01:57:49.800
<v Speaker 2>wear a hat with a tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's when it's kangaroo hats,</v>

2536
01:57:49.801 --> 01:57:51.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like run DMC.</v>

2537
01:57:51.181 --> 01:57:56.181
<v Speaker 2>Shit can go over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy is like giving a speech at a </v>

2538
01:57:56.181 --> 01:57:57.180
<v Speaker 2>college and he's got a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a sock hat on.</v>

2539
01:57:58.790 --> 01:58:03.180
<v Speaker 2>What a weird hat to have as a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think those dudes,</v>

2540
01:58:03.181 --> 01:58:08.181
<v Speaker 2>they don't give a fuck like their </v>
<v Speaker 2>version of reality is so it's so,</v>

2541
01:58:10.290 --> 01:58:15.290
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're looking at the universe on this </v>

2542
01:58:15.290 --> 01:58:19.880
<v Speaker 2>almost impossible to measure level and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only a few of them that </v>

2543
01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:24.321
<v Speaker 2>understand the mathematics involved when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started drawing all that </v>

2544
01:58:24.321 --> 01:58:28.431
<v Speaker 2>mathematical stuff for quantum theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they started drawing on those </v>

2545
01:58:28.431 --> 01:58:29.670
<v Speaker 2>yellow legal pads and they sit in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>park and do it.</v>

2546
01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:35.010
<v Speaker 2>If you left that there and you gave the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next 400 people a million dollars,</v>

2547
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:40.030
<v Speaker 2>tell you what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's going to know what the fuck </v>

2548
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.030
<v Speaker 2>that is.</v>

2549
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.110
<v Speaker 2>You could write in Japanese and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could say,</v>

2550
01:58:40.290 --> 01:58:42.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone can read this,</v>

2551
01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:47.400
<v Speaker 2>you get a million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to show up almost </v>

2552
01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:49.711
<v Speaker 2>immediately and read that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that speak </v>

2553
01:58:49.711 --> 01:58:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This very few people understand what the</v>

2554
01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:54.960
<v Speaker 2>fuck those guys are writing when they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing all those crazy numbers and </v>

2555
01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:57.420
<v Speaker 2>letters and squeal lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I watched Brian Cox and um,</v>

2556
01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:01.150
<v Speaker 2>I forget who the other scientists was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I did Brian Cox,</v>

2557
01:59:01.151 --> 01:59:06.151
<v Speaker 2>his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's another one that makes me feel </v>

2558
01:59:06.151 --> 01:59:06.151
<v Speaker 2>stupid as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this,</v>

2559
01:59:06.151 --> 01:59:11.040
<v Speaker 2>these guys were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were talking about like those </v>

2560
01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:12.070
<v Speaker 2>equations and they were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity and I was like,</v>

2561
01:59:12.071 --> 01:59:14.500
<v Speaker 2>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you even doing up there?</v>

2562
01:59:14.501 --> 01:59:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2563
01:59:16.110 --> 01:59:17.740
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea.</v>

2564
01:59:17.741 --> 01:59:19.570
<v Speaker 2>They're making these squiggles and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these lines.</v>

2565
01:59:19.571 --> 01:59:22.000
<v Speaker 2>And to them it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course course,</v>

2566
01:59:22.150 --> 01:59:23.760
<v Speaker 2>don't forget the little squiggle with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the a,</v>

2567
01:59:23.761 --> 01:59:26.330
<v Speaker 2>like that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know you had a pod.</v>

2568
01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:32.460
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious because they enjoy doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it too because it's like a cool little </v>

2569
01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:33.400
<v Speaker 2>language that they know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So few people know,</v>

2570
01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:36.880
<v Speaker 2>like the language of that complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those equations.</v>

2571
01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:39.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like some crazy foreign</v>

2572
01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:44.840
<v Speaker 2>alien language like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only a few people know how to speak.</v>

2573
01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Like they're doing all these equations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to prove that at its smallest</v>

2574
01:59:49.911 --> 01:59:54.911
<v Speaker 2>level the universe is made out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's like strings and they </v>

2575
01:59:55.521 --> 01:59:59.720
<v Speaker 2>vibrate at different frequencies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what creates matter.</v>

2576
01:59:59.721 --> 02:00:01.830
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2577
02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:04.520
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you guys talking about?</v>

2578
02:00:04.521 --> 02:00:09.521
<v Speaker 2>And then they started talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>subatomic particles and how they react </v>

2579
02:00:09.521 --> 02:00:13.781
<v Speaker 2>when being viewed or not viewed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what the fuck are you saying?</v>

2580
02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:21.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why that guy doesn't give </v>

2581
02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:21.520
<v Speaker 2>a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wear a sock hat.</v>

2582
02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Like who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all just strings.</v>

2583
02:00:22.881 --> 02:00:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Like you guys don't even know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know what you're involved</v>

2584
02:00:26.031 --> 02:00:28.040
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys are playing this game.</v>

2585
02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:33.300
<v Speaker 2>You know you're sitting here wondering </v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's going to be Donald Trump or ted </v>

2586
02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Cruz to the Republican nomination and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody the,</v>

2587
02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:40.260
<v Speaker 2>the balance of the country that this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>is studying strings that we can't see.</v>

2588
02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:42.810
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they're the biggest bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 5>artists.</v>

2589
02:00:42.811 --> 02:00:47.811
<v Speaker 5>And they were just so confused that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't question like they all decided to </v>

2590
02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:52.080
<v Speaker 5>keep their mouth shut.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's been going on forever.</v>

2591
02:00:52.081 --> 02:00:54.510
<v Speaker 5>Like Einstein with created this like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2592
02:00:54.511 --> 02:00:56.730
<v Speaker 5>I figured out a way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't really have to have real jobs.</v>

2593
02:00:56.731 --> 02:00:58.440
<v Speaker 5>We just talked crazy shit about strings.</v>

2594
02:00:59.370 --> 02:01:01.240
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything's possible.</v>

2595
02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:04.780
<v Speaker 2>But I have a feeling that's not what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

2596
02:01:05.410 --> 02:01:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching it still.</v>

2597
02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:08.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>

2598
02:01:08.650 --> 02:01:13.650
<v Speaker 2>no more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just gonna just between you and I </v>

2599
02:01:13.650 --> 02:01:13.950
<v Speaker 2>know it's going to die with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2600
02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:16.750
<v Speaker 2>they teach it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that those high level equations</v>

2601
02:01:16.751 --> 02:01:21.751
<v Speaker 2>and that kind of physics and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's available at universities at the </v>

2602
02:01:21.751 --> 02:01:22.750
<v Speaker 2>highest level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's got to be a real thing.</v>

2603
02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:25.010
<v Speaker 5>What if they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just to arguments sake,</v>

2604
02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:26.690
<v Speaker 5>what if they found one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be wrong?</v>

2605
02:01:26.691 --> 02:01:27.670
<v Speaker 5>They have to stop teaching it.</v>

2606
02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:32.870
<v Speaker 2>It's the right thing with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has happened since we've been in </v>

2607
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.870
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2608
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:33.150
<v Speaker 2>they've taught us things that they found</v>
<v Speaker 2>out weren't true.</v>

2609
02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2610
02:01:34.471 --> 02:01:37.910
<v Speaker 2>But that's because they get new data and</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason why they get new data</v>

2611
02:01:37.911 --> 02:01:39.770
<v Speaker 2>is because they were going over these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

2612
02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2613
02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:45.880
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the whole idea that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly so beautiful is that </v>

2614
02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:50.680
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is like self correcting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when more knowledge comes about,</v>

2615
02:01:50.751 --> 02:01:55.751
<v Speaker 1>when we learn new things and we have new</v>
<v Speaker 1>discoveries and we have new information </v>

2616
02:01:55.751 --> 02:01:58.010
<v Speaker 1>that we add to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of changes the view of how we're</v>

2617
02:01:58.011 --> 02:02:00.170
<v Speaker 1>looking at things like it's self </v>
<v Speaker 1>correcting,</v>

2618
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:01.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2619
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:07.030
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a problem if someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>resisting it because they don't want to </v>

2620
02:02:07.030 --> 02:02:07.320
<v Speaker 1>appear that they were incorrect all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these years,</v>

2621
02:02:07.321 --> 02:02:10.700
<v Speaker 1>that that's a giant problem and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an ego problem that humans have.</v>

2622
02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just have that problem.</v>

2623
02:02:13.461 --> 02:02:18.461
<v Speaker 1>Even if they were teaching to the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their ability and their are doing an </v>

2624
02:02:18.471 --> 02:02:20.900
<v Speaker 1>amazing job with what information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had.</v>

2625
02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:23.810
<v Speaker 1>If something comes out that contradicts </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone's been teaching,</v>

2626
02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:26.420
<v Speaker 1>boy they fucking resist the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2627
02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:29.540
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a problem like archeology a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

2628
02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Seen it with some of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2629
02:02:31.850 --> 02:02:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Egypt guys like as they try to introduce</v>
<v Speaker 1>the possibilities of civilizations that </v>

2630
02:02:37.521 --> 02:02:40.760
<v Speaker 1>were very complex and building giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone structures like deep,</v>

2631
02:02:40.761 --> 02:02:42.650
<v Speaker 1>deep into our past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 14,000</v>

2632
02:02:42.651 --> 02:02:47.651
<v Speaker 1>plus years ago when they started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the mall of this evidence starts </v>

2633
02:02:47.651 --> 02:02:50.951
<v Speaker 1>coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still resisting the idea that </v>

2634
02:02:50.951 --> 02:02:50.951
<v Speaker 1>Egypt is older than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than what it is.</v>

2635
02:02:50.951 --> 02:02:54.020
<v Speaker 1>And this is kind of John Anthony West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we've had them on that guy.</v>

2636
02:02:54.050 --> 02:02:58.090
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't heard this subject before</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not interested or you are not</v>

2637
02:02:58.100 --> 02:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>educated about Egypt and its history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its guys get this insane documentary </v>

2638
02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:03.720
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2639
02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:05.880
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously it's,</v>

2640
02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:10.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a DVD and it's only a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour or couple hours long and there's</v>

2641
02:03:10.701 --> 02:03:13.430
<v Speaker 1>six of them though and it's a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>series of them.</v>

2642
02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:16.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean the way this guy did it is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2643
02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:22.420
<v Speaker 1>He's so good at explaining it and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so passionate about Egypt and he's so </v>

2644
02:03:22.420 --> 02:03:26.831
<v Speaker 1>passionate about the architecture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing like how much complexity there </v>

2645
02:03:26.831 --> 02:03:29.840
<v Speaker 1>is and it's six fucking hours or more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than six hours.</v>

2646
02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Six Dvds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2647
02:03:30.921 --> 02:03:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each one and our magical Egypt?</v>

2648
02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

2649
02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:37.430
<v Speaker 1>I think he's got an magical Egypt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2650
02:03:37.431 --> 02:03:42.230
<v Speaker 1>He just came out with two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy is just obsessed with Egypt</v>

2651
02:03:42.231 --> 02:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>and he knows so much about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of his evidence that they tried</v>

2652
02:03:47.021 --> 02:03:52.021
<v Speaker 1>to show to these archeologists to open </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the possibility that we're not just </v>

2653
02:03:52.021 --> 02:03:56.831
<v Speaker 1>looking when they're looking at Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not just looking at one </v>

2654
02:03:56.831 --> 02:03:57.860
<v Speaker 1>civilization that was advanced that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>making these incredible structures.</v>

2655
02:03:57.861 --> 02:04:02.861
<v Speaker 1>You might be looking at like several </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations that are separated by </v>

2656
02:04:02.861 --> 02:04:06.611
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this might have been an area where </v>

2657
02:04:06.611 --> 02:04:10.631
<v Speaker 1>there's been like a one construction </v>
<v Speaker 1>style that went on for thousands of </v>

2658
02:04:10.631 --> 02:04:11.840
<v Speaker 1>years and they had another one after </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2659
02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:17.000
<v Speaker 1>It might have been new people took over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of crazy shit </v>

2660
02:04:17.241 --> 02:04:22.241
<v Speaker 1>happened in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the face of the Pharaoh is </v>

2661
02:04:22.241 --> 02:04:25.340
<v Speaker 1>apparently an African face and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the new bins.</v>

2662
02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Conquered that part of Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens when the New Orleans </v>

2663
02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:35.261
<v Speaker 1>came up and conquered Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided to take that Sphinx and </v>

2664
02:04:35.261 --> 02:04:38.130
<v Speaker 1>carbon African head into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they made the Pharaoh,</v>

2665
02:04:38.131 --> 02:04:40.620
<v Speaker 1>whoever the pharaohs the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some bad motherfucker,</v>

2666
02:04:40.621 --> 02:04:42.240
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the ultimate pimp.</v>

2667
02:04:42.450 --> 02:04:44.670
<v Speaker 1>He turned alliance faces like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2668
02:04:44.671 --> 02:04:46.860
<v Speaker 1>the line that's been here for about </v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

2669
02:04:46.861 --> 02:04:48.780
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dog man,</v>

2670
02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I think my face look better update and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that line,</v>

2671
02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>he had carved his face into a giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>existing statue and the existing statute</v>

2672
02:04:58.170 --> 02:05:01.590
<v Speaker 1>might have been there as long as like </v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

2673
02:05:01.591 --> 02:05:06.591
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they think that statute might be </v>

2674
02:05:06.591 --> 02:05:09.381
<v Speaker 1>old as fuck and that this guy carved his</v>
<v Speaker 1>head into it like way after it had been </v>

2675
02:05:10.801 --> 02:05:13.650
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of cool evidence about</v>

2676
02:05:13.651 --> 02:05:18.651
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two men that people are reluctant to </v>

2677
02:05:18.651 --> 02:05:20.390
<v Speaker 1>consider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it is these Fisher marks in </v>

2678
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.390
<v Speaker 1>these canyon walls.</v>

2679
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:23.720
<v Speaker 1>It's only been created by only could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been created by thousands of years </v>

2680
02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:27.171
<v Speaker 1>of rainfall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's this guy from Boston </v>

2681
02:05:27.171 --> 02:05:30.590
<v Speaker 1>University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Robert Schoch who started proposing </v>

2682
02:05:30.590 --> 02:05:31.590
<v Speaker 1>all these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have anybody's ever interested in</v>

2683
02:05:31.591 --> 02:05:36.591
<v Speaker 1>this kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>magical Egypt is the shit I'm telling </v>

2684
02:05:36.591 --> 02:05:36.591
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2685
02:05:36.591 --> 02:05:38.880
<v Speaker 1>I watched nothing bet that for months </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>

2686
02:05:38.910 --> 02:05:42.520
<v Speaker 1>I watched it several times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good dude.</v>

2687
02:05:42.521 --> 02:05:45.540
<v Speaker 1>They were so advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

2688
02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were making some crazy shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they are right,</v>

2689
02:05:50.371 --> 02:05:54.990
<v Speaker 1>even if the egyptologists are 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent correct that we're still talking</v>

2690
02:05:54.991 --> 02:05:58.110
<v Speaker 1>about 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

2691
02:05:58.140 --> 02:06:00.570
<v Speaker 1>4,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus years ago,</v>

2692
02:06:00.810 --> 02:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about like 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC and they were making some insane </v>

2693
02:06:05.810 --> 02:06:10.491
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if John Anthony West is wrong </v>

2694
02:06:10.491 --> 02:06:12.861
<v Speaker 1>and it all comes from the same era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still in fucking insane how much </v>

2695
02:06:13.290 --> 02:06:18.290
<v Speaker 1>information is available right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could see like how mathematically </v>

2696
02:06:18.290 --> 02:06:22.881
<v Speaker 1>complex structures where these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing this and they're making these </v>

2697
02:06:22.881 --> 02:06:27.680
<v Speaker 1>immensely complicated structures at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very earliest or the very most recent </v>

2698
02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:31.350
<v Speaker 1>2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>

2699
02:06:32.070 --> 02:06:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that.</v>

2700
02:06:34.670 --> 02:06:39.670
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy and they think the African </v>
<v Speaker 1>faces even more recent than that student</v>

2701
02:06:41.211 --> 02:06:46.211
<v Speaker 1>came along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just jack that town and put his fucking </v>

2702
02:06:46.211 --> 02:06:47.370
<v Speaker 1>face on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that happens to see the statue of</v>

2703
02:06:47.371 --> 02:06:52.371
<v Speaker 1>Liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If what if our statue of Liberty gets </v>

2704
02:06:52.371 --> 02:06:52.800
<v Speaker 1>blacked out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could if Kanye,</v>

2705
02:06:52.801 --> 02:06:55.770
<v Speaker 1>because president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll demand to be the new face on Mount</v>

2706
02:06:55.770 --> 02:06:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Rushmore for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

2707
02:06:57.060 --> 02:06:58.200
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent,</v>

2708
02:06:58.320 --> 02:06:59.910
<v Speaker 1>100 percent Tommaso,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll,</v>

2709
02:06:59.970 --> 02:07:04.970
<v Speaker 1>she'll want to be on that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's when we'll know that the </v>

2710
02:07:04.970 --> 02:07:05.040
<v Speaker 1>human race is a giant failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just didn't work out.</v>

2711
02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:10.460
<v Speaker 1>We got to capable before we got smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the really capable people,</v>

2712
02:07:11.580 --> 02:07:16.580
<v Speaker 1>the people that have figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow us to manipulate matter and </v>

2713
02:07:16.580 --> 02:07:18.270
<v Speaker 1>exchange information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that earn that,</v>

2714
02:07:18.330 --> 02:07:19.950
<v Speaker 1>they were super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super intelligent,</v>

2715
02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:24.240
<v Speaker 1>but then they took that and they gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>that power to us.</v>

2716
02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:27.240
<v Speaker 1>They gave it to the masses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag Dick.</v>

2717
02:07:27.241 --> 02:07:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Game strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say what they did was they.</v>

2718
02:07:32.430 --> 02:07:34.950
<v Speaker 1>They made something that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve.</v>

2719
02:07:35.530 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 1>We don't</v>

2720
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:38.560
<v Speaker 2>deserve this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too good.</v>

2721
02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:40.360
<v Speaker 2>It's too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2722
02:07:40.361 --> 02:07:43.360
<v Speaker 2>it's like we're not ready for this level</v>
<v Speaker 2>of power.</v>

2723
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:49.000
<v Speaker 2>That's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtags going to find a way onto our </v>

2724
02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.020
<v Speaker 2>currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At one point,</v>

2725
02:07:50.021 --> 02:07:52.080
<v Speaker 2>pretty soon there's going to be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag Dick,</v>

2726
02:07:52.090 --> 02:07:53.950
<v Speaker 2>game stress Kanye or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2727
02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag feel the burn that's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2728
02:07:57.280 --> 02:08:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag make America great again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So trump is,</v>

<v Speaker 2>1:40.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You want to keep America great again or </v>
<v Speaker 2>make America great again.</v>

2731
02:08:09.670 --> 02:08:11.620
<v Speaker 2>So many hashtags are too many letters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2732
02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Too many characters who you vote for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

2733
02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:17.350
<v Speaker 2>burning man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burning all the way.</v>

2734
02:08:17.351 --> 02:08:22.351
<v Speaker 2>I just think he represents common sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the one thing that I like </v>

2735
02:08:22.351 --> 02:08:26.491
<v Speaker 2>about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just seems like a normal person </v>

2736
02:08:26.491 --> 02:08:26.491
<v Speaker 2>talking like you're talking to Ari or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2737
02:08:26.491 --> 02:08:26.491
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exit.</v>

2738
02:08:26.491 --> 02:08:27.190
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2739
02:08:27.660 --> 02:08:31.000
<v Speaker 2>And I also think like the fact that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not taking money from banks.</v>

2740
02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was asking Hillary to give a </v>

2741
02:08:36.570 --> 02:08:39.721
<v Speaker 2>transcript,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the speeches that she gave when she was </v>

2742
02:08:39.721 --> 02:08:39.870
<v Speaker 2>getting paid a quarter million bucks to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to these bankers.</v>

2743
02:08:40.210 --> 02:08:42.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a reasonable request.</v>

2744
02:08:42.850 --> 02:08:45.640
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to be the president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a reasonable request.</v>

2745
02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:46.840
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2746
02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:51.860
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you all the transcripts from </v>

2747
02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:55.040
<v Speaker 2>what I spoke in front of those bankers </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are non.</v>

2748
02:08:57.150 --> 02:08:58.480
<v Speaker 2>He's good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

2749
02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Did you see Larry David Play Him Bernie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're identical twins.</v>

2752
02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:07.330
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>

2753
02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Larry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>David's a genius.</v>

2754

<v Speaker 2>We were talking about before the </v>

<v Speaker 2>driveway.</v>

2761
02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Didn't report on TMZ that said that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had missed.</v>

2762
02:09:25.870 --> 02:09:29.910
<v Speaker 2>He had like was feeling sick the night </v>
<v Speaker 2>before called a doctor friend of his had</v>

<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>

2765
02:09:31.721 --> 02:09:32.140
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but before that car had picked them up.</v>

2768
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:42.590
<v Speaker 2>He had already had to call nine one one </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was distressed and then.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know that that was not.</v>

2771
02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:55.900
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't thought about him being sick or</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know him.</v>

2772
02:09:56.250 --> 02:09:57.880
<v Speaker 2>I only met him once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very nice.</v>

<v Speaker 2>show and that's the show that got Paul </v>

2778
02:10:09.031 --> 02:10:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Sim started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the executive producer of news </v>

<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I had it for a while.</v>

2887
02:15:18.721 --> 02:15:21.440
<v Speaker 4>It might've been more than a week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might've been two weeks because I had</v>

2888
02:15:21.441 --> 02:15:26.441
<v Speaker 4>it for.</v>

<v Speaker 4>this is a deceptive cold.</v>

2892
02:15:29.841 --> 02:15:32.070
<v Speaker 4>Like it's taken a long time to kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2893
02:15:32.071 --> 02:15:37.071

02:15:37.071 --> 02:15:38.670
<v Speaker 4>goobers for like a week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a good one.</v>

2897
02:15:45.710 --> 02:15:46.290
<v Speaker 4>because I still don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe today I feel 100 percent,</v>

2898
02:15:46.291 --> 02:15:48.960
<v Speaker 4>but I still haven't been 100 percent for</v>
<v Speaker 4>awhile.</v>

2899
02:15:49.220 --> 02:15:49.950
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2900
02:15:49.951 --> 02:15:51.620
<v Speaker 4>When you start feeling Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

2901
02:15:51.740 --> 02:15:56.740
<v Speaker 4>It's really important to give your body </v>
<v Speaker 4>a break and let your body rehabilitate </v>

2902
02:15:56.740 --> 02:16:01.550
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have this idea of sweating it out </v>

2903
02:16:01.550 --> 02:16:02.700
<v Speaker 4>maybe a little bit like a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>exercise.</v>

2904
02:16:02.701 --> 02:16:04.710
<v Speaker 4>We'll get your blood pumping and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there'll be.</v>

2905
02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:07.620
<v Speaker 4>As long as you're not putting it under </v>
<v Speaker 4>stress and strain,</v>

2906
02:16:08.310 --> 02:16:11.580
<v Speaker 4>but when you start thinking you're going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to work your way out of a cold,</v>

2907
02:16:11.581 --> 02:16:13.420
<v Speaker 4>you just going to make your body sicker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2908
02:16:13.810 --> 02:16:16.170
<v Speaker 4>I just been sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just underestimated it.</v>

2909
02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:18.220
<v Speaker 4>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was just a minor cold.</v>

2910
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:23.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to lift a little weights </v>

2911
02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:23.390
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

2912
02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:23.400
<v Speaker 4>the next day I was like woo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it had a little bit of,</v>

2913
02:16:23.730 --> 02:16:28.050
<v Speaker 4>almost every symptom like it came back </v>
<v Speaker 4>where I threw up like the flu,</v>

2914
02:16:28.190 --> 02:16:29.770
<v Speaker 4>Zika,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Zika virus.</v>

2915
02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:35.760
<v Speaker 4>So don't get pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My little head baby dude.</v>

2916
02:16:36.730 --> 02:16:39.670
<v Speaker 4>Like this poor little head babies are </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2917
02:16:39.730 --> 02:16:41.860
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the babies that get affected by it.</v>

2918
02:16:41.861 --> 02:16:42.730
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how dare you.</v>

2919
02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:43.830
<v Speaker 4>Not all of them that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2920
02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:49.380
<v Speaker 4>I thought you were saying you were head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what you're talking about </v>

2921
02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:52.081
<v Speaker 4>the baby born to the Zika virus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but are they going to be 100 percent </v>

2922
02:16:52.081 --> 02:16:52.081
<v Speaker 4>brain functional?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2923
02:16:52.081 --> 02:16:52.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2924
02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:55.720
<v Speaker 2>It's real dangerous apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2925
02:16:55.990 --> 02:16:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough to really comment on</v>

2926
02:16:58.241 --> 02:17:00.250
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much of it is,</v>

2927
02:17:00.251 --> 02:17:02.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medically proven fact.</v>

2928
02:17:02.770 --> 02:17:05.170
<v Speaker 2>But I think when women get pregnant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have it,</v>

2929
02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:08.080
<v Speaker 2>it's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2930
02:17:08.081 --> 02:17:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what people are scared of.</v>

2931
02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:13.540
<v Speaker 2>I've heard people say they won't travel </v>
<v Speaker 2>now because of the Zika virus.</v>

2932
02:17:13.570 --> 02:17:15.010

2949
02:18:03.310 --> 02:18:06.410
<v Speaker 4>Polynesia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like some always what you need.</v>

2950
02:18:06.510 --> 02:18:08.750
<v Speaker 4>You mean Samoan would've been a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>example.</v>

2951
02:18:08.751 --> 02:18:12.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about are normal sized people.</v>

2952
02:18:12.910 --> 02:18:14.200
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess you're right there.</v>

2953
02:18:14.330 --> 02:18:16.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's some big Hawaiians like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Rock,</v>

2954
02:18:17.090 --> 02:18:18.500
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2955
02:18:18.710 --> 02:18:19.720
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2956
02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:21.640
<v Speaker 4>samoans are giant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2957
02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:23.580
<v Speaker 4>So if it's a Mo and fucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

2958
02:18:23.690 --> 02:18:26.630
<v Speaker 4>a woman with is like a virus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will they have a normal size?</v>

2959
02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:28.580
<v Speaker 4>That would be a normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it works that way.</v>

2960
02:18:28.910 --> 02:18:29.540
<v Speaker 4>I would like to see.</v>

2961
02:18:29.810 --> 02:18:33.030
<v Speaker 2>I think someones just have better brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>

2962
02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:38.270
<v Speaker 2>jaw structure and like head structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a more sound frame to hold the</v>

2963
02:18:38.521 --> 02:18:39.830
<v Speaker 2>brain in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2964
02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:41.610
<v Speaker 2>I think the fucking brain shrinks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

2965
02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I think it's some real issues.</v>

2966
02:18:44.270 --> 02:18:45.810
<v Speaker 4>You just said the rocky made me think of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2967
02:18:45.811 --> 02:18:50.811
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's making the Baywatch movie right </v>

2968
02:18:50.811 --> 02:18:50.811
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2969
02:18:50.811 --> 02:18:53.170
<v Speaker 4>A ZAC Efron's in it with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen the pictures of Zac Efron </v>

2970
02:18:53.170 --> 02:18:54.930
<v Speaker 4>going around right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about all of that happened</v>

2971
02:18:54.931 --> 02:18:55.840
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what about them?</v>

2972
02:18:56.190 --> 02:18:57.840
<v Speaker 4>Is that steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think?</v>

2973
02:18:58.140 --> 02:18:59.400
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>

2974
02:18:59.730 --> 02:19:00.280
<v Speaker 4>Can you get that?</v>

2975
02:19:00.510 --> 02:19:02.340
<v Speaker 2>You can definitely get that big without </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids.</v>

2976
02:19:02.370 --> 02:19:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a young guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But hold on a second.</v>

2977
02:19:04.170 --> 02:19:06.990
<v Speaker 2>He's a young guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been lifting weights for years.</v>

2978
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:09.900
<v Speaker 2>He had a six pack just a couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

2979
02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2980
02:19:11.130 --> 02:19:16.130
<v Speaker 2>he was shredded and if you just steady </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight lifted weights for a long time </v>

2981
02:19:17.310 --> 02:19:19.500
<v Speaker 2>without doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2982
02:19:19.890 --> 02:19:20.730
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2983
02:19:20.731 --> 02:19:22.560
<v Speaker 2>you've seen that video of me from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2984
02:19:22.590 --> 02:19:26.370
<v Speaker 2>NBC from that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vh one fashion awards thing.</v>

2985
02:19:26.820 --> 02:19:27.860
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

2986
02:19:27.870 --> 02:19:28.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2987
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:33.130
<v Speaker 1>where I was naked and when I was in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing I barely lifted weights.</v>

2988
02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did like Chin ups and I did some </v>

2989
02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:41.340
<v Speaker 1>weightlifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly it was just doing kickboxing and </v>

2990
02:19:41.340 --> 02:19:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I had never taken anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No testosterone,</v>

2991
02:19:43.071 --> 02:19:44.750
<v Speaker 1>no steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no nothing.</v>

2992
02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:49.900
<v Speaker 1>And I had quite a bit of muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's certain people that are </v>

2993
02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:54.161
<v Speaker 1>more prone to being muscular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you've been doing </v>

2994
02:19:54.161 --> 02:19:57.140
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really young in life or wrestling.</v>

2995
02:19:57.141 --> 02:20:02.141
<v Speaker 1>A lot of wrestlers get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me it was kickboxing and a lot </v>

2996
02:20:02.141 --> 02:20:05.660
<v Speaker 1>of calisthenics and some weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not even that much.</v>

2997
02:20:05.661 --> 02:20:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not like,</v>

2998
02:20:06.501 --> 02:20:08.860
<v Speaker 1>like a serious bodybuilder would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it if I,</v>

2999
02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:12.380
<v Speaker 1>if I lifted once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very,</v>

3000
02:20:12.381 --> 02:20:16.490
<v Speaker 1>it was very rare for me to stay steady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would lift like for a few months,</v>

3001
02:20:16.491 --> 02:20:21.491
<v Speaker 1>then I would stop and I'd go back to at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some point was I was dedicated way more </v>

3002
02:20:21.491 --> 02:20:23.960
<v Speaker 1>to kick boxing that I was to anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else and I still put on a lot of muscle.</v>

3003
02:20:24.090 --> 02:20:29.090
<v Speaker 4>I take that back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen Zac is always at the comedy </v>

3004
02:20:29.090 --> 02:20:31.791
<v Speaker 4>store and when he's wearing normal </v>
<v Speaker 4>clothes he just doesn't look that </v>

3005
02:20:31.791 --> 02:20:35.001
<v Speaker 4>muscular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just looked back 2010 and he's </v>

3006
02:20:35.001 --> 02:20:36.030
<v Speaker 4>been ripped since then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So swimmer,</v>

3007
02:20:36.090 --> 02:20:36.780
<v Speaker 4>swimmer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

3008
02:20:36.810 --> 02:20:38.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's got a trainer.</v>

3009
02:20:38.220 --> 02:20:40.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure if you've got a trainer,</v>

3010
02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:42.920
<v Speaker 1>trainer makes you work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get more muscle.</v>

3011
02:20:43.310 --> 02:20:48.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like you get to a certain level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like like if you see a guy like me who's</v>

3012
02:20:48.651 --> 02:20:53.651
<v Speaker 1>48 and you see that he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He still has a good amount of muscle and</v>

3013
02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:59.030
<v Speaker 1>it looks thick most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's taking testosterone,</v>

3014
02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:01.340
<v Speaker 1>especially today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's Day.</v>

3015
02:21:01.341 --> 02:21:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Like the benefits of it are just so </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>

3016
02:21:03.631 --> 02:21:08.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could not take it and just be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a regular 60 year old guy and just </v>

3017
02:21:09.441 --> 02:21:12.740
<v Speaker 1>feel frail or you see these guys who </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't taking it.</v>

3018
02:21:12.741 --> 02:21:14.630
<v Speaker 1>They're 60 years old that are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>shredded,</v>

3019
02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:18.890
<v Speaker 1>like you go to the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to like I'm fucking Maui or something</v>

3020
02:21:18.891 --> 02:21:20.140
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to the four seasons.</v>

3021
02:21:20.180 --> 02:21:25.180
<v Speaker 1>You'll see some businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like in his sixties with six pack </v>

3022
02:21:25.180 --> 02:21:29.141
<v Speaker 1>and giant traps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some 60 year old guy with a personal </v>

3023
02:21:29.141 --> 02:21:29.860
<v Speaker 1>trainers taking testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3024
02:21:29.970 --> 02:21:31.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be way better than to</v>

3025
02:21:31.941 --> 02:21:32.420
<v Speaker 1>be like</v>

3026
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:36.440
<v Speaker 4>burt reynolds character look terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is 63.</v>

3027
02:21:36.470 --> 02:21:41.470
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That he's using placement of that </v>

3028
02:21:41.470 --> 02:21:43.900
<v Speaker 4>floating device.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hasselhoff was a very nice guy and he </v>

3029
02:21:43.900 --> 02:21:44.570
<v Speaker 4>was unfair factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I will cease comment.</v>

3030
02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:49.840
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a gigantic difference between </v>

3031
02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:53.070
<v Speaker 4>the left and the man on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The man on the left hand screen is the </v>

3032
02:21:53.070 --> 02:21:57.710
<v Speaker 4>fucking rock and Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a stud.</v>

3033
02:21:57.711 --> 02:22:02.711
<v Speaker 4>That guy is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the size of him and he's a huge </v>

3034
02:22:02.711 --> 02:22:04.820
<v Speaker 4>guy on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

3035
02:22:04.821 --> 02:22:06.410
<v Speaker 4>the rock is like six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>

3036
02:22:06.411 --> 02:22:07.580
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3037
02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:08.900
<v Speaker 4>Is He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's six three.</v>

3038
02:22:09.010 --> 02:22:13.010
<v Speaker 4>That sounds about right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably to 72 gigantic.</v>

3039
02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:16.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean just shredded and dedicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gets up every morning</v>

3040
02:22:16.940 --> 02:22:18.200
<v Speaker 1>worn out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

3041
02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:22.940
<v Speaker 1>if I had to guess like the rock is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that much younger than me.</v>

3042
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:24.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm 48.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that guy?</v>

3043
02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Is he 44?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old is he?</v>

3044
02:22:28.170 --> 02:22:29.560
<v Speaker 1>How it guest Brian Take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3045
02:22:29.840 --> 02:22:30.750
<v Speaker 1>hit the rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3046
02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:35.780
<v Speaker 1>I would say is if you're age 49,</v>
<v Speaker 1>43.</v>

3047
02:22:36.220 --> 02:22:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But point being,</v>

3048
02:22:39.090 --> 02:22:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's technically possible to be that big</v>

3049
02:22:43.620 --> 02:22:46.290
<v Speaker 1>without steroids and he does have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane work ethic,</v>

3050
02:22:46.650 --> 02:22:50.200
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine he's taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone and it has to.</v>

3051
02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:55.680
<v Speaker 1>There's no shame in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's people weird about like </v>

3052
02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:58.820
<v Speaker 1>hiding that it's these are chemical </v>
<v Speaker 1>components of our body that we can </v>

3053
02:22:58.820 --> 02:23:00.450
<v Speaker 1>manipulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not talking about taking massive amounts</v>

3054
02:23:00.451 --> 02:23:02.550
<v Speaker 1>of it because that's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not smart.</v>

3055
02:23:02.551 --> 02:23:04.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll,</v>

3056
02:23:04.430 --> 02:23:07.890
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when when guys go too deep with it,</v>

3057
02:23:07.891 --> 02:23:08.730
<v Speaker 1>it's going to fuck you up.</v>

3058
02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:13.470
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that like low </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of it aren't possibly helpful.</v>

3059
02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the alternative is your body </v>

3060
02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:18.720
<v Speaker 1>just stops working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

3061
02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody wants.</v>

3062
02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:22.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a pride thing involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

3063
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Like where people don't want to admit </v>
<v Speaker 1>they need it.</v>

3064
02:23:24.901 --> 02:23:27.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When do you think is the,</v>

3065
02:23:28.140 --> 02:23:29.360
<v Speaker 1>or not the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's.</v>

3066
02:23:29.370 --> 02:23:31.680
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is a good way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide when you should take.</v>

3067
02:23:31.730 --> 02:23:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Go to a doctor for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

3068
02:23:34.051 --> 02:23:39.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should go to a doctor who really </v>

3069
02:23:39.051 --> 02:23:41.391
<v Speaker 1>understands what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he's on top of the latest as far </v>

3070
02:23:41.391 --> 02:23:46.110
<v Speaker 1>as replacing hormones and what are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits of doing it naturally,</v>

3071
02:23:46.111 --> 02:23:51.111
<v Speaker 1>where the benefits of augmenting it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a synthetic hormone and </v>

3072
02:23:51.111 --> 02:23:52.140
<v Speaker 1>have a guy who's kind of a long history </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

3073
02:23:52.141 --> 02:23:57.141
<v Speaker 1>who does blood work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extensive blood work and wants to find </v>

3074
02:23:57.141 --> 02:23:58.110
<v Speaker 1>out how healthy you are and the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing they're going to do if he's good,</v>

3075
02:23:58.410 --> 02:24:00.870
<v Speaker 1>first thing they're going to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate your diet.</v>

3076
02:24:01.170 --> 02:24:03.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing they all do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all want to look at your blood work</v>

3077
02:24:03.721 --> 02:24:04.170
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3078
02:24:04.171 --> 02:24:09.171
<v Speaker 1>you're really low in d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three this you that you needed to start </v>

3079
02:24:09.171 --> 02:24:10.470
<v Speaker 1>taking Niacin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what kind of foods are you eating?</v>

3080
02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Because you're just doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just lowering your sugar intake and all </v>

3081
02:24:16.021 --> 02:24:18.270
<v Speaker 1>your bullshit that you didn't and </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>

3082
02:24:18.271 --> 02:24:23.271
<v Speaker 1>Just that alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can minimize alcohol and lower </v>

3083
02:24:23.271 --> 02:24:23.271
<v Speaker 1>your sugar and take like really lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3084
02:24:23.271 --> 02:24:25.080
<v Speaker 1>you'll have a big impact on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones.</v>

3085
02:24:25.140 --> 02:24:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Just that it'll have a big impact on all</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of your body.</v>

3086
02:24:28.681 --> 02:24:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Your body will just work better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your insulin won't be so fucking spiked.</v>

3087
02:24:32.551 --> 02:24:37.551
<v Speaker 1>It just gets real weird when you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>chugging mountain dew all day and you </v>

3088
02:24:37.551 --> 02:24:42.381
<v Speaker 1>get like insane levels of sugar that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people get and I know people are </v>

3089
02:24:42.381 --> 02:24:43.170
<v Speaker 1>going to get all of this focus sugar </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

3090
02:24:43.640 --> 02:24:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Talk about sugar too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3091
02:24:45.500 --> 02:24:46.710
<v Speaker 1>I know you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

3092
02:24:47.310 --> 02:24:50.100
<v Speaker 1>But that's the part is they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll work on your diet first.</v>

3093
02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:52.410
<v Speaker 1>So what they would do is they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would check your blood,</v>

3094
02:24:52.590 --> 02:24:55.140
<v Speaker 1>they'd find out where your levels are of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

3095
02:24:55.141 --> 02:24:59.250
<v Speaker 1>including your thyroid hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have thyroid issues.</v>

3096
02:24:59.251 --> 02:25:01.890
<v Speaker 1>It might not even know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put my shit's all fucked up.</v>

3097
02:25:01.891 --> 02:25:06.891
<v Speaker 1>I bet all ABC and d probably you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it checked out and then you should </v>

3098
02:25:06.891 --> 02:25:06.891
<v Speaker 1>totally do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3099
02:25:07.500 --> 02:25:09.960
<v Speaker 1>but if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be like willing to listen to</v>

3100
02:25:09.961 --> 02:25:12.930
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they say you have to drink water,</v>

3101
02:25:12.931 --> 02:25:14.880
<v Speaker 1>you have to take nice and you have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3102
02:25:14.881 --> 02:25:18.900
<v Speaker 1>you have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to limit your amount of fried</v>

3103
02:25:18.901 --> 02:25:20.430
<v Speaker 1>foods,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

3105
02:25:22.351 --> 02:25:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Besides like maybe just a question </v>
<v Speaker 1>asker.</v>

3106
02:25:24.490 --> 02:25:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Backpage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>

<v Speaker 2>intelligent about how they approach it </v>

3112
02:25:37.810 --> 02:25:38.830
<v Speaker 2>and hopefully a doctor that's older than</v>

3113
02:25:38.831 --> 02:25:42.010
<v Speaker 2>that's on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like best case scenario.</v>

3114
02:25:42.250 --> 02:25:44.650
<v Speaker 2>If your doctor's not taking hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hm,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's bananas.</v>

3124
02:26:12.410 --> 02:26:13.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they're pretending to be</v>

3125
02:26:13.731 --> 02:26:15.170
<v Speaker 2>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that works.</v>

3126
02:26:15.230 --> 02:26:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Are they allowed to do whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want?</v>

3127
02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:18.050
<v Speaker 2>But I was watching these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>these guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in their sixties and they're </v>

3129
02:26:23.530 --> 02:26:25.300
<v Speaker 2>power lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking like massive amounts of </v>

3130
02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:25.300
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five,</v>

3134
02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:32.320
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how old are these guys?</v>

3135
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:36.740
<v Speaker 2>And they're dead lifting 500 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>600 pounds.</v>

3136
02:26:36.741 --> 02:26:37.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

3137
02:26:37.780 --> 02:26:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people didn't exist.</v>

3138
02:26:39.581 --> 02:26:43.180
<v Speaker 2>There was no 60 year old dead lifters 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

3139
02:26:43.470 --> 02:26:45.130
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't even think about doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3140
02:26:46.850 --> 02:26:48.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of those guys at my gym,</v>

3141
02:26:48.610 --> 02:26:53.610
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the old guys that you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is this guy still going to the </v>

3142
02:26:53.610 --> 02:26:57.020
<v Speaker 2>academy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his body's crazy looking because </v>

3143
02:26:57.020 --> 02:26:57.740
<v Speaker 2>when you have an old body mixed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles,</v>

3144
02:26:57.800 --> 02:26:59.690
<v Speaker 2>it's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3145
02:27:00.170 --> 02:27:03.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a big difference between a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who's not doing well.</v>

3146
02:27:04.050 --> 02:27:07.790
<v Speaker 2>How old is that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Arnold Classic Europe.</v>

3147
02:27:07.940 --> 02:27:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over 60 posedown over 60 guys over 60.</v>

3148
02:27:13.250 --> 02:27:14.780
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

3149
02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:20.260
<v Speaker 2>that looks like Cgi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't that look fake since saying yes </v>

3150
02:27:20.260 --> 02:27:21.350
<v Speaker 2>with that guy's old man face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

3151
02:27:21.351 --> 02:27:23.420
<v Speaker 2>That looks like it looks like Jay Leno </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

3152
02:27:23.450 --> 02:27:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Especially as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll look at him.</v>

3153
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:29.450
<v Speaker 2>He's dancing terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His skin is kind of wrinkly and he's got</v>

3154
02:27:29.451 --> 02:27:31.550
<v Speaker 2>a cop mustache.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got It all going on.</v>

3155
02:27:31.970 --> 02:27:33.890
<v Speaker 2>It's got a big enough tub with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

3156
02:27:34.430 --> 02:27:39.430
<v Speaker 2>He's got the John Stossel over 60 </v>
<v Speaker 2>shredded fuck.</v>

3157
02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:45.070
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the difference between being a </v>

3158
02:27:45.070 --> 02:27:47.051
<v Speaker 2>man and being a woman too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think that a woman </v>

3159
02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:52.480
<v Speaker 2>couldn't take some shit that will like </v>
<v Speaker 2>give her like a more feminine body as </v>

3160
02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:53.510
<v Speaker 2>she gets older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3161
02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the guy like these guys were </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously taken some shit and they're in</v>

3162
02:27:57.411 --> 02:28:01.400
<v Speaker 2>their sixties and they have all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle and they look like,</v>

3163
02:28:01.450 --> 02:28:04.340
<v Speaker 2>like fucking super athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what these guys look like.</v>

3164
02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:09.880
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy Definitely looks.</v>

3165
02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:12.100
<v Speaker 2>It definitely looks crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

3166
02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:17.150
<v Speaker 2>didn't look right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that guy right there with the red </v>

3167
02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:17.420
<v Speaker 2>shorts and the far left like that guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like he will be 30 years old.</v>

3168
02:28:17.450 --> 02:28:22.450
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that that guy is 60 something </v>

3169
02:28:22.450 --> 02:28:23.990
<v Speaker 2>that's the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point being,</v>

3170
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:26.780
<v Speaker 2>there's not anything like this available</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a woman.</v>

3171
02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:30.950
<v Speaker 2>A woman can't take something that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes her as she gets older,</v>

3172
02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:33.860
<v Speaker 2>look more like a younger woman.</v>

3173
02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:41.260
<v Speaker 2>Why do they all have to be that color?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make it look better or </v>

3174
