00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.170
<v Speaker 1>He need to be a Ponzi Niebuhr.</v>

108
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.393
<v Speaker 1>Is he from Brazil?</v>

109
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.253
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is going to be a,</v>

110
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of people from Brazil because this card is live from Brazil.</v>

111
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.280
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>

112
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>if you're tuning in and you're trying to figure out how the fuck do we sync it</v>

113
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>up because the internet is always going to be a few seconds slower than live</v>

114
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:55.501
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

115
00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:56.950
<v Speaker 1>So what we're seeing and what you're,</v>

116
00:02:56.951 --> 00:02:57.481
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing,</v>

117
00:02:57.481 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a little different.</v>

118
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>So pause your TV.</v>

119
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 2>That's the best way.</v>

120
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Pause your TV and like maybe counted 10 and I'm going to tell you exactly when I</v>

121
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 2>see five minutes on the first round.</v>

122
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 2>It's about to start now.</v>

123
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 2>It says four 58 right now.</v>

124
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 2>45074506455 there you go.</v>

125
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:16.931
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

126
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 2>We're sinked up ponds,</v>

127
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>an Ebu and Strickland.</v>

128
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Remember there was only three or four Brazilian fighters and now there's</v>

129
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands.</v>

130
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how many fighters are in the UFC roster now?</v>

131
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 2>They guess,</v>

<v Speaker 2>500 wow.</v>

136
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.103

137
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

138
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 2>500 yeah.</v>

139
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 2>And that really ponds and Nivo with a right hand that expanded that Joe's</v>

140
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:41.231
<v Speaker 2>stricken one.</v>

141
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:42.064
<v Speaker 2>The Nice uppercut.</v>

142
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 2>How do they have fun?</v>

143
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 2>I thought they had like maybe a hundred people on the roster period.</v>

144
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.851
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

145
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:46.031
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

146
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 2>They've had a few hundred for a while.</v>

147
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:52.711
<v Speaker 2>They've had like two 5,300 but now you know also I think that with Bella tour</v>

<v Speaker 2>why don't we take that?</v>

295
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.523
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't,</v>

296
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 2>because we know triple g,</v>

297
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:28.100
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think triple g's that big of a star.</v>

298
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 2>The triple t make all sold a lot.</v>

299
00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Like he's not,</v>

303
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:32.511

00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:33.010
<v Speaker 2>he's not.</v>

305
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.410
<v Speaker 2>It's shut the fuck up cause Kovalev was the one who is going to find you're out</v>

306
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 2>of your 160160170 five that's three different weight classes.</v>

307
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:41.451
<v Speaker 2>They all right.</v>

308
00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:46.451
<v Speaker 2>Andre Ward one 68 Golovkin one 60 called 1175 [inaudible] 75 were you guys</v>

309
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:48.014

310
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:48.921
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

311
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:51.110
<v Speaker 2>I thought he's applied to every way.</v>

312
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

313
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

314
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.860
<v Speaker 2>He wants to fight Miguel Cotto that's what he wants.</v>

315
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Kovalev does.</v>

316
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

317
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.083
<v Speaker 2>Andre Ward does.</v>

318
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Triple g wants to fight.</v>

319
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 2>You guys are really into boxing like yeah man.</v>

320
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:01.611
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

321
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 2>I should probably say that on the podcast because a bunch of people asked me,</v>

322
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.650
<v Speaker 2>cause I,</v>

323
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 2>a long time ago I'd gotten this debate on ESPN with that fucking Lou Dibella</v>

324
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:09.963
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

325
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why I went on that guy like that to raise one is UFC wanted me</v>

326
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:15.960
<v Speaker 2>to play too.</v>

327
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.510
<v Speaker 2>They sicked me all this guy cause they knew this guy talks a lot of shit about</v>

328
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:23.570
<v Speaker 2>the UFC and he just started doing all the dos Joe.</v>

329
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

330
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:28.821
<v Speaker 2>Joe Goes,</v>

331
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:30.530
<v Speaker 2>I guess on that interview juggles.</v>

332
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that boxing is getting swallowed.</v>

333
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.040
<v Speaker 2>It's getting swallowed.</v>

334
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.780
<v Speaker 2>He's getting smelled by more dynamic sport,</v>

335
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:40.581
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

336
00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 2>But I've always been a boxing fan,</v>

337
00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:43.910
<v Speaker 2>just like I'm a kickboxing Fran,</v>

338
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 2>just like I'm a straight Jujitsu fan.</v>

339
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan of Walmart,</v>

340
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 2>fan of dummies.</v>

341
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.220

<v Speaker 2>said I'm going to make $1 billion.</v>

347

<v Speaker 2>Well go off gets old enough.</v>

348
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating guy because he's one of the best fighters in the world and very few</v>

349
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 2>people know who he is.</v>

350

<v Speaker 2>That's the side of like hardcore MMA fans.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Let's just be honest about some shit.</v>

386
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Russians are different white people.</v>

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.103
<v Speaker 2>tougher.</v>

391
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.830
<v Speaker 2>Their environment is tougher.</v>

392
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.510
<v Speaker 2>They live in a harsher climate.</v>

393
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Their history is tougher.</v>

394
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.560
<v Speaker 2>They have a war torn history did.</v>

395
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 2>They were conquered by the Mongols for 200 plus fucking years.</v>

396
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:35.641
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

397

398
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.500
<v Speaker 2>you have a flag concern.</v>

399
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:48.610
<v Speaker 2>The Asian Chinese looking guys were ruling over the white guys in the north.</v>

400
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.400
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people in Russia,</v>

401
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.720
<v Speaker 2>in certain parts of Russia,</v>

402
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:52.321
<v Speaker 2>look Chinese.</v>

403
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:54.690
<v Speaker 2>That's right on the border.</v>

406
00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:56.754

00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:43.010
<v Speaker 2>the other day they had this,</v>

584
00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:43.251
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

585
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:47.600
<v Speaker 2>this news clipping of these wild pigs were tearing up these people's lawns in</v>

586
00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:48.434
<v Speaker 2>the suburbs.</v>

587
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.560
<v Speaker 2>I'd make him just ripping the,</v>

588
00:15:50.561 --> 00:15:52.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm ripping the lawn apart,</v>

589
00:15:52.581 --> 00:15:54.530
<v Speaker 2>looking for something to eat.</v>

590
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:55.970
<v Speaker 2>And they're pretty gnarly.</v>

591
00:15:55.971 --> 00:15:56.241
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

592
00:15:56.241 --> 00:15:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>

593
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.550
<v Speaker 2>for a kid that's incredible.</v>

594
00:15:58.551 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 2>For California and Fresno,</v>

595
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a big problem and it's that weird San hose</v>

596
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.940
<v Speaker 2>and like a real issue.</v>

597
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

598
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:08.780
<v Speaker 2>It's real issue.</v>

599
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.030
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

600
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.440
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

601
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.273
<v Speaker 2>I'm hunters.</v>

602
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.150
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>

603
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

604
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.620
<v Speaker 2>a huge,</v>

605
00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:13.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

606
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's a problem,</v>

607
00:16:14.271 --> 00:16:18.710
<v Speaker 2>but we got raccoons everywhere at families of raccoons,</v>

608
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:20.330
<v Speaker 2>little babies traveling together,</v>

609
00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.670
<v Speaker 2>coming to try to open our door screen door.</v>

610
00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:24.390
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

611
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Babe.</v>

612
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:25.543
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

613
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.810
<v Speaker 2>It's trickling on top.</v>

614
00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:27.644
<v Speaker 2>Swarming on them.</v>

615
00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

616
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean the pig problem is mitigated slightly by the fact that they're not</v>

617
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:35.930
<v Speaker 2>allowed to hunt from mountain lions.</v>

618
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Some mountain lions eat some of the pigs.</v>

619
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.030
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say what's their natural predator?</v>

620
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:41.600
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

621
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Just no,</v>

622
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.730
<v Speaker 2>there's no natural predator.</v>

623
00:16:43.731 --> 00:16:44.361
<v Speaker 2>They're not from here.</v>

624
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:47.300
<v Speaker 2>They're Eurasian wild boars there.</v>

625
00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:48.590
<v Speaker 2>The a long time ago,</v>

626
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:51.320
<v Speaker 2>they believe that a lot of them came from William Randolph Hearst</v>

627
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.780
<v Speaker 2>when we ran off.</v>

628
00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Hearst had that Hearst castle up in northern California.</v>

629
00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.150
<v Speaker 2>That crazy fuck kept a bunch of wild boars out there,</v>

630
00:16:59.151 --> 00:16:59.600
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

631
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.840
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of them got loose tanks hers and then they just run up fucking and</v>

632
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:04.521
<v Speaker 2>breeding.</v>

633
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:07.250
<v Speaker 2>And then of course on top of that there's just wild pigs,</v>

634
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.870
<v Speaker 2>domestic pigs that you know became Pharell and they start breeding out in the</v>

635
00:17:11.871 --> 00:17:14.240
<v Speaker 2>wild and then they become a totally different kind of pig.</v>

636
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.850
<v Speaker 2>But there's so many of the northern California,</v>

637
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.530
<v Speaker 2>you could shoot as many as you want.</v>

638
00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:19.611
<v Speaker 2>You could go like,</v>

639
00:17:19.611 --> 00:17:23.450
<v Speaker 2>you could get all your meat from pigs and just go up there like once every</v>

640
00:17:23.451 --> 00:17:23.991
<v Speaker 2>couple months,</v>

641
00:17:23.991 --> 00:17:25.400
<v Speaker 2>shoot four or five pigs,</v>

642
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.540
<v Speaker 2>bring them back with you.</v>

643
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:28.370
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't cost very much to get a pink tag,</v>

644
00:17:28.371 --> 00:17:29.900
<v Speaker 2>so it should be easy to kill him up.</v>

645
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

646
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Got to take out some of these pigs.</v>

647
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.063
<v Speaker 2>I killed him.</v>

648
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.580
<v Speaker 2>I killed one of the first day we went.</v>

649
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

650
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

651
00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.753
<v Speaker 2>I kill the pig.</v>

652
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:41.480
<v Speaker 2>It was like it got dark at five o'clock I killed the pig at four 15 I just liked</v>

653
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:41.570
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

654
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be freezing this.</v>

655
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we just go up there?</v>

656
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.740
<v Speaker 2>Some machine guns do a gangster style.</v>

657
00:17:45.741 --> 00:17:47.220
<v Speaker 2>You could do it that way on the copter.</v>

658
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any restriction.</v>

659
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.790
<v Speaker 2>They use it from a helicopter in Texas.</v>

660
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.691
<v Speaker 2>In Texas.</v>

661
00:17:51.691 --> 00:17:53.480
<v Speaker 2>They have these shows about them where they are.</v>

662
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.361
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

663
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:56.370
<v Speaker 2>You think that's all Henry Rollins do it right now?</v>

664
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.060
<v Speaker 2>Ted Nugent.</v>

665
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.630
<v Speaker 2>The opposite.</v>

666
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.051
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

667
00:17:58.051 --> 00:17:58.470
<v Speaker 2>My bad.</v>

668
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.303
<v Speaker 2>My bad.</v>

669
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Just some loud white guy.</v>

670
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

671
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.193
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

672
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:03.241
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

673
00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:04.260
<v Speaker 2>they do it out of helicopters.</v>

674
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:05.190
<v Speaker 2>They call it a pork lips.</v>

675
00:18:05.191 --> 00:18:09.630
<v Speaker 2>Now is the most fucked up thing to watch up there were colliding it just gunning</v>

676
00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:12.630
<v Speaker 2>down these packs of pigs in Fresno.</v>

677
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.610
<v Speaker 2>This is Texas in Texas.</v>

678
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:16.160
<v Speaker 2>They allow them to hunt with Halifax.</v>

679
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.970
<v Speaker 2>They cost millions.</v>

680
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Reminds me neither.</v>

681
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared there's,</v>

682
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.810
<v Speaker 2>there is millions of feral pigs in California.</v>

683
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:25.680
<v Speaker 2>Dom million.</v>

684
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.200
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen,</v>

685
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:26.881
<v Speaker 2>you know what else,</v>

686
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:31.050
<v Speaker 2>what else did William Randolph Hearst cause like he caused the peg problem but</v>

687
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.060
<v Speaker 2>the wheat problem.</v>

688
00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

689
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.580
<v Speaker 2>He was also responsible for weed being illegal.</v>

690
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.180
<v Speaker 2>He's a whoa head kick.</v>

691
00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:42.210
<v Speaker 2>He was responsible for distributing the propaganda and even possibly risk one of</v>

692
00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:45.540
<v Speaker 2>the people responsible for using the name marijuana.</v>

693
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.720
<v Speaker 2>So it was like a real asshole or you have chosen that because of dupont and</v>

694
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.960
<v Speaker 2>there as well as well as his,</v>

695
00:18:51.961 --> 00:18:52.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

696
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.820
<v Speaker 2>paper factories apparently.</v>

697
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:54.751
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

698
00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:54.901
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

699
00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:58.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the reason why William Randolph Hearst was the subject of a,</v>

700
00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 2>that Orson Welles movie.</v>

701
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was the whole Rosebud citizen Kane.</v>

702
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.320
<v Speaker 2>It's about William Randolph Hearst.</v>

703
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.240
<v Speaker 2>William Randolph Hearst was a gangster when you had control of the newspaper</v>

704
00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:11.360
<v Speaker 2>back when there was only one newspaper kill me.</v>

705
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:12.310
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

706
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like is we're running stories.</v>

707
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.460
<v Speaker 2>They were running stories.</v>

708
00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:20.340
<v Speaker 2>I like that one store where woman smokes weed,</v>

709
00:19:20.341 --> 00:19:24.510
<v Speaker 2>throws her kids out the building and then a commit suicide for madness,</v>

710
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.553
<v Speaker 2>all that shit.</v>

711
00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.570
<v Speaker 2>But I mean they really wrote that in paper.</v>

712
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:28.710
<v Speaker 2>They made shit up.</v>

713
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Some people were terrified of weed and they should be,</v>

714
00:19:31.681 --> 00:19:33.860
<v Speaker 2>they should be wanting to scare everybody.</v>

715
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Took them 10 years of scaring people into making it illegal.</v>

716
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:37.921
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

717
00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:40.190
<v Speaker 2>this is after the fucking great depression,</v>

718
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:42.420
<v Speaker 2>so people were cautious as it is,</v>

719
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.231
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

720
00:19:43.231 --> 00:19:45.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was a crazy time.</v>

721
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Easy to brainwash people.</v>

722
00:19:46.231 --> 00:19:47.790
<v Speaker 2>Back then everyone was getting the radio.</v>

723
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:48.990
<v Speaker 2>There's one radio station,</v>

724
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.750
<v Speaker 2>they go to the movies to watch a Newsreel,</v>

725
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.220
<v Speaker 2>total propaganda,</v>

726
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:54.203
<v Speaker 2>newsreels.</v>

727
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.680
<v Speaker 2>You never got the truth.</v>

728
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.960
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's never any truth in that.</v>

729
00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.180
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he's just starting to get a good rap right.</v>

730
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Just now starting to come down to the dock.</v>

731
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.770
<v Speaker 2>That's how long cause as a kid,</v>

732
00:20:04.771 --> 00:20:05.371
<v Speaker 2>I remember as a kid,</v>

733
00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:06.270
<v Speaker 2>even in high school,</v>

734
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're smoking weed,</v>

735
00:20:07.531 --> 00:20:08.590
<v Speaker 2>you're an idiot.</v>

736
00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:09.923
<v Speaker 2>That's how I felt.</v>

737
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I felt that way until I met Eddie.</v>

738
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.860
<v Speaker 2>I felt that way until I was 28 I felt that way.</v>

739
00:20:13.861 --> 00:20:15.690
<v Speaker 2>About six months ago I started hanging out with you guys.</v>

740
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.490
<v Speaker 2>I gotta be honest.</v>

741
00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:19.850
<v Speaker 2>Pretty cool.</v>

742
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Well anybody that tells you that people on weed or lazy,</v>

743
00:20:22.531 --> 00:20:23.281
<v Speaker 2>it's like you.</v>

744
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:24.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

745
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 2>you got to pay attention to all the shit I'm doing.</v>

746
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.090
<v Speaker 2>There's no way I'm lazy.</v>

747
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:27.480
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

748
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:27.871
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

749
00:20:27.871 --> 00:20:29.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm a lot of things lazy.</v>

750
00:20:29.341 --> 00:20:30.174
<v Speaker 2>He's not one of them.</v>

751
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Duke,</v>

752
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.190
<v Speaker 2>it might've gotten more intense with weed.</v>

753
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.220
<v Speaker 2>People who are lazy are lazy and people when you're,</v>

754
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.370
<v Speaker 2>the one thing about the,</v>

755
00:20:36.371 --> 00:20:40.440
<v Speaker 2>the marijuana is the paranoia that it gives you about if you're doing the wrong</v>

756
00:20:40.441 --> 00:20:41.100
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

757
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.150
<v Speaker 2>These guys wanting to war,</v>

758
00:20:42.151 --> 00:20:43.020
<v Speaker 2>I fight really good.</v>

759
00:20:43.021 --> 00:20:44.940
<v Speaker 2>Fight a fight.</v>

760
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.350
<v Speaker 2>I think that paranoia makes you work harder.</v>

761
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.930
<v Speaker 3>You try to keep that paranoia at bay.</v>

762
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:50.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like a wolf.</v>

763
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.180
<v Speaker 3>You want to do everything you can to fight off whatever the fuck that thing's</v>

764
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.180
<v Speaker 3>warning you against.</v>

765
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.590
<v Speaker 3>Cover your bases.</v>

766
00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.980
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's so easy to get high and go on stage cause he's done comedy a</v>

767
00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:01.210
<v Speaker 3>million fucking times.</v>

768
00:21:01.211 --> 00:21:01.850
<v Speaker 3>It's easy.</v>

769
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:02.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

770
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.850
<v Speaker 3>It's not something you're scared of doing.</v>

771
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:05.500
<v Speaker 3>Something you own is high.</v>

772
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:07.870
<v Speaker 3>When you're on stage 99.9% of the time,</v>

773
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:08.763
<v Speaker 3>that'd be a yes.</v>

774
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:09.491
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's fine,</v>

780
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.420
<v Speaker 3>but you prefer to be like being high when I'm coming up with shit,</v>

781
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.680
<v Speaker 3>that's when I especially like being high because I don't know what I'm going to</v>

785
00:21:28.091 --> 00:21:30.700
<v Speaker 3>you're not there anymore and things just come out of nowhere and sometimes they</v>

<v Speaker 3>come out of nowhere and right after it comes out of your mouth,</v>

806
00:22:01.751 --> 00:22:04.330
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're saying something that's profound or whatever,</v>

819
00:22:18.851 --> 00:22:19.750

823
00:22:23.891 --> 00:22:27.340
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a benefit to not being high.</v>

824
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:28.450
<v Speaker 3>You get high for a tournament.</v>

825
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:30.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

826

833
00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:37.720
<v Speaker 3>It just makes you feel way more of what you're feeling.</v>

834
00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:39.040
<v Speaker 3>So they're going to be nervous.</v>

835
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:40.960
<v Speaker 3>If you're gonna do something that's gonna make you nervous,</v>

836
00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.150
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't suggest you smoking it.</v>

837
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:43.540

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:46.520
<v Speaker 3>It could,</v>

841
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.430
<v Speaker 3>it could,</v>

842
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:48.580
<v Speaker 3>it can get paranoid.</v>

843
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:49.480
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

844
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:49.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

845
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.980
<v Speaker 3>but when you,</v>

846
00:22:50.981 --> 00:22:54.520
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to do something that is not going to give you that you love,</v>

847
00:22:54.521 --> 00:22:56.800
<v Speaker 3>like he's just going to go do Jujitsu and you're just going to have fun.</v>

848
00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:57.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

849
00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.451
<v Speaker 3>Then you smoke.</v>

850
00:22:58.451 --> 00:23:01.170
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have more fun because that's what you're feeling and like,</v>

851
00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:01.421
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

852
00:23:01.421 --> 00:23:02.021
<v Speaker 3>this is awesome.</v>

853
00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:02.620

00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:04.360
<v Speaker 3>you're not nervous or anything.</v>

856
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:05.450
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>

857
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:10.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried if I got into weed I would just become like 320 pounds cookie</v>

858
00:23:10.241 --> 00:23:10.750
<v Speaker 3>monster.</v>

859
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:11.351
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't do that.</v>

860
00:23:11.351 --> 00:23:12.184
<v Speaker 3>Why would you do that?</v>

861
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.650
<v Speaker 3>Cause I love to eat,</v>

862
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.460
<v Speaker 3>so to say.</v>

863
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:15.771
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

864
00:23:15.771 --> 00:23:16.780
<v Speaker 3>do you know how much I eat?</v>

865
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.180
<v Speaker 3>I eat so much when we go to restaurants,</v>

866
00:23:19.181 --> 00:23:20.260
<v Speaker 3>people think I'm joking.</v>

867
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.930
<v Speaker 3>Like when I go to restaurants after shows,</v>

868
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.510
<v Speaker 3>I ordered two meals and they'll go,</v>

869
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.310
<v Speaker 3>do you still want the steak?</v>

870
00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:27.571
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

871
00:23:27.571 --> 00:23:28.404
<v Speaker 3>I want that too.</v>

872
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:29.470
<v Speaker 3>And they're like this too much food.</v>

873
00:23:29.471 --> 00:23:30.550
<v Speaker 3>And like it's not too much food.</v>

874
00:23:30.551 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Just bring it,</v>

875
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.380
<v Speaker 3>you're pretty lean too though.</v>

876
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:32.891
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

877
00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:33.724
<v Speaker 3>Genetics,</v>

878
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:34.361
<v Speaker 3>good genetics.</v>

879
00:23:34.361 --> 00:23:35.260
<v Speaker 3>But I also work out,</v>

880
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:36.281
<v Speaker 3>I work out,</v>

881
00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:36.730
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

882
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.170
<v Speaker 3>You gotta you gotta you gotta do it.</v>

883
00:23:38.171 --> 00:23:38.890
<v Speaker 3>You've got to work out.</v>

884
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:39.011
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

885
00:23:39.011 --> 00:23:39.470
<v Speaker 3>no I wouldn't.</v>

886
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:40.540
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm not you.</v>

887
00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:41.374
<v Speaker 3>Of course you do.</v>

888
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.450
<v Speaker 3>But I'm saying for people that complain about it,</v>

889
00:23:43.451 --> 00:23:43.780
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

890
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:44.740
<v Speaker 3>it's just that simple.</v>

891
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 3>If you like to eat,</v>

892
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:46.491
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

893
00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:47.540
<v Speaker 3>you better burn that shit off.</v>

894
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

895
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.520
<v Speaker 3>But I definitely have good genetics too.</v>

896
00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.160
<v Speaker 3>There's some people that they could look at a cake and they get fat.</v>

897
00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

898
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.930
<v Speaker 3>But you do get the munchies though.</v>

899
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.390
<v Speaker 3>You do get the munchies and it does for me,</v>

900
00:23:56.391 --> 00:23:59.090
<v Speaker 3>cause I got a sweet dude.</v>

901
00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.780
<v Speaker 3>You work out so hard and if you've got high and got paranoid about getting fat,</v>

902
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.960
<v Speaker 3>you probably can try to work out even harder.</v>

903
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.981
<v Speaker 3>He's probably like,</v>

904
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:09.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's an extra sessions just to lean up.</v>

905
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.963
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

906
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:11.201
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

913
00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:19.940
<v Speaker 3>You look,</v>

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:26.330

918
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.751

920
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.453
<v Speaker 3>No carbs,</v>

921
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.713
<v Speaker 3>no carbs at all.</v>

922
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.490
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

923
00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:34.730
<v Speaker 3>Eddie did that shit for years.</v>

924
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.080
<v Speaker 3>Really low carb.</v>

925
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:36.770
<v Speaker 3>Low carb.</v>

926
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:36.921
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.060
<v Speaker 3>And you stopped doing it?</v>

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.360
<v Speaker 3>I hung in there and hung in there,</v>

937
00:24:50.361 --> 00:24:50.720

939
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.430
<v Speaker 3>You have to have under 30 carbs a day.</v>

940
00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:58.040
<v Speaker 3>If you could do that under 30 carbs a day,</v>

941
00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.470
<v Speaker 3>then on one out of the seven days,</v>

942
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:04.220
<v Speaker 3>Sunday you can eat whatever the fuck you want for just one meal or the whole</v>

943
00:25:04.221 --> 00:25:04.321
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

944

<v Speaker 3>The whole day you have a cheat day,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you just slept.</v>

946
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.070
<v Speaker 3>So I was living my life just for Sunday.</v>

947
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.560
<v Speaker 3>I was just trying to get the fucking Sunday.</v>

948
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.260
<v Speaker 3>I didn't care about Friday we went out.</v>

949
00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:16.580
<v Speaker 3>I just want her to get the fuck.</v>

950
00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.820
<v Speaker 3>I was just thinking about bread and how it's going.</v>

951
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:22.160
<v Speaker 3>And then Sunday I couldn't wait for the sun to come up.</v>

952
00:25:22.161 --> 00:25:23.120
<v Speaker 3>When the sun came up.</v>

953
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.360
<v Speaker 3>I would just tear shit up and then I would get too full and I go,</v>

954
00:25:26.361 --> 00:25:27.161
<v Speaker 3>here's my deck at the end.</v>

955
00:25:27.161 --> 00:25:28.010
<v Speaker 3>Anything now I can't,</v>

956
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:29.263
<v Speaker 3>and I smelled smoke.</v>

957
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.051
<v Speaker 3>I smoke a lot of,</v>

958
00:25:30.051 --> 00:25:31.270
<v Speaker 3>we try and get the munchies going,</v>

959
00:25:31.271 --> 00:25:32.620
<v Speaker 3>well fuck the sun's going down.</v>

960
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:33.483
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even hungry.</v>

961
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:34.363
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

962
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying.</v>

963
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Then I,</v>

964
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.070
<v Speaker 3>I I because live in like a crazy man.</v>

965
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.393
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

966
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

967
00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.020
<v Speaker 3>now I'm starting to tell you how crazy was he used to.</v>

968
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:45.740
<v Speaker 3>We used to go to restaurants and eat and he would take the bread and he would</v>

969
00:25:45.741 --> 00:25:47.420
<v Speaker 3>break the bread apart and smell it.</v>

970
00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.570
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't eat the bread and everybody would want bread.</v>

971
00:25:50.571 --> 00:25:50.781
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

972
00:25:50.781 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on with the bread?</v>

973
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Eddie had taken like every piece of bread and broken apart.</v>

974
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:55.970
<v Speaker 3>So it's often,</v>

975
00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.810
<v Speaker 3>did you get good results from it or just,</v>

976
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.950
<v Speaker 3>I was really lean and uh,</v>

977
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:05.660
<v Speaker 3>I'd never been that muscular or anything,</v>

978
00:26:05.661 --> 00:26:08.450
<v Speaker 3>but I was losing and I was single.</v>

979
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.991
<v Speaker 3>It was right.</v>

980
00:26:08.991 --> 00:26:09.560
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

981
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:14.360
<v Speaker 3>I was a single as hell and the leaner I got the uh,</v>

982
00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:15.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

983
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.930
<v Speaker 3>easier meeting members of the opposite,</v>

984
00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.010
<v Speaker 3>the opposite sex where,</v>

985
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.903
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

986
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

987
00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.890
<v Speaker 3>definitely right away everything changed.</v>

988
00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:25.243
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

989
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.140
<v Speaker 3>I was starving my brain.</v>

990
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.320
<v Speaker 3>But then that Sunday,</v>

991
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.450
<v Speaker 3>that Sunday eventually turned into,</v>

992
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:34.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start Saturday night now let's see what have I tested?</v>

993
00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:34.551
<v Speaker 3>It would,</v>

994
00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:36.560
<v Speaker 3>my body is still change cause you know,</v>

995
00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:37.820
<v Speaker 3>if you've got 30 grams a day,</v>

996
00:26:37.821 --> 00:26:39.380
<v Speaker 3>Monday through Saturday,</v>

997
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:44.080
<v Speaker 3>somehow your body is fixed in a way that you could trash on Sunday and</v>

998
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:44.181
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

999
00:26:44.181 --> 00:26:45.810
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't make any difference with your weight.</v>

1000
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.300
<v Speaker 1>It'll reject everything and now you live on,</v>

1001
00:26:48.301 --> 00:26:50.160
<v Speaker 1>so now I'm on Saturday night,</v>

1002
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.810
<v Speaker 1>late Saturday night I'd say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop.</v>

1005
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:54.120
<v Speaker 1>And I'd go six months and I go,</v>

1006
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:54.954
<v Speaker 1>that was my thing.</v>

1007
00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:55.440
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't,</v>

1008
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.610
<v Speaker 1>my weight hasn't changed.</v>

1009
00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you could actually take it into that night before.</v>

1010
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.430
<v Speaker 1>So Saturday nights I couldn't wait Saturday during the day,</v>

1142
00:30:58.321 --> 00:31:03.321
<v Speaker 4>dude because Uriah came at him guns blazing like within the first couple of</v>

1143
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:07.230
<v Speaker 4>seconds and then like literally 15 seconds into the fight,</v>

00:31:12.151 --> 00:31:13.380
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of ground and pound going on,</v>

1149
00:31:13.381 --> 00:31:16.950
<v Speaker 4>but you're right towards the end of the round gets out of the position and then</v>

00:31:16.951 --> 00:31:21.330
<v Speaker 4>it just coming after him for the end of that second round,</v>

<v Speaker 4>started off so bad.</v>

1158
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.150
<v Speaker 4>I think Alcantara had his back.</v>

1159
00:31:39.151 --> 00:31:40.210
<v Speaker 4>I know he mounted him and,</v>

1160
00:31:40.211 --> 00:31:40.451
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

1161
00:31:40.451 --> 00:31:40.980
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1162
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.040
<v Speaker 4>he got him in a very compromising position very early in the fight when</v>

1163
00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:46.680
<v Speaker 4>everybody's dry and everybody's at full strength.</v>

1164
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:51.680
<v Speaker 4>Trump got out of it and gave it your all men and I'll beat the brakes off of it.</v>

1165
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.520
<v Speaker 4>One of the coolest things ever,</v>

1166
00:31:53.521 --> 00:31:55.920
<v Speaker 4>I heard a fight or say came from your eye favors mouth.</v>

1167
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.550
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1168
00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:57.271
<v Speaker 4>someone's beat him.</v>

1169
00:31:57.271 --> 00:31:58.320
<v Speaker 4>It was a close decision.</v>

1170
00:31:58.321 --> 00:31:59.760
<v Speaker 4>One of those epic battles.</v>

1171
00:31:59.761 --> 00:32:00.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1172
00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:00.893
<v Speaker 4>I forget who it was.</v>

1173
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.750
<v Speaker 4>He's only lost title fights by decision.</v>

1174
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.350
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1175
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:05.100
<v Speaker 4>And he,</v>

1176
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.840
<v Speaker 4>he said after one of those fights,</v>

1177
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:08.820
<v Speaker 4>because I don't feel that bad.</v>

1178
00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1179
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:10.010
<v Speaker 4>I was a close fight.</v>

1180
00:32:10.011 --> 00:32:10.920
<v Speaker 4>Could have gone either way.</v>

1181
00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:11.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm right there in the mix.</v>

1182
00:32:11.971 --> 00:32:12.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the top.</v>

1183
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm mixing it up.</v>

1184
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.431
<v Speaker 4>Even though I lost,</v>

1185
00:32:14.431 --> 00:32:15.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm like right there.</v>

1186
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:15.931
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

1187
00:32:15.931 --> 00:32:17.520
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm a smidgen off.</v>

1188
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:18.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1189
00:32:18.201 --> 00:32:18.781
<v Speaker 4>So that's like,</v>

1190
00:32:18.781 --> 00:32:20.340
<v Speaker 4>he has such a great attitude.</v>

1191
00:32:20.341 --> 00:32:24.320
<v Speaker 4>He's always one one loss away or one went away from title shot always.</v>

1192
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.460
<v Speaker 4>Well he's going to go to 45 now,</v>

1193
00:32:26.461 --> 00:32:27.510
<v Speaker 4>which is very interesting.</v>

1194
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:27.931
<v Speaker 4>Frankie.</v>

1195
00:32:27.931 --> 00:32:28.111
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1196
00:32:28.111 --> 00:32:29.160
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy fight,</v>

1197
00:32:29.161 --> 00:32:29.431
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1198
00:32:29.431 --> 00:32:32.790
<v Speaker 4>Him and Frankie hunger 45 because he wants to fight Frankie.</v>

1199
00:32:32.791 --> 00:32:33.810
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't want to fight Tj.</v>

1200
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.160
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

1201
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:35.993
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

1202
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:36.601
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1203
00:32:36.601 --> 00:32:37.740
<v Speaker 4>I think he feels that,</v>

1204
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:38.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1205
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 4>it's not necessarily fight his teammate</v>

1206
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.843
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1207
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:44.660
<v Speaker 3>I think he probably would like to take a break off that fucking horrible weight</v>

1208
00:32:44.661 --> 00:32:46.880
<v Speaker 3>cut to get done in one 40 get smart.</v>

1209
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:48.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bad idea at all.</v>

1210
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.110
<v Speaker 3>In a super fight with Frankie is fuck way better for him than Tj.</v>

1211
00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:52.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1212
00:32:52.281 --> 00:32:53.210
<v Speaker 3>And if he does lose,</v>

1213
00:32:53.211 --> 00:32:53.361
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1214
00:32:53.361 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 3>it's not even as division apparently.</v>

1215
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:55.490
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1216
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:56.680
<v Speaker 3>apparently he's a,</v>

1217
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.610
<v Speaker 3>an amazing businessman.</v>

1218
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.650
<v Speaker 3>Owns a lot of properties.</v>

1219
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1220
00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:07.420
<v Speaker 3>It's [inaudible] it,</v>

1221
00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:08.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1222
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Speaker 3>He's a beast when it comes to business.</v>

1223
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.270
<v Speaker 3>And we talked about that before,</v>

1224
00:33:11.271 --> 00:33:12.270
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1225
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.153
<v Speaker 3>I apologize.</v>

1226
00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1227
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:14.631
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1228
00:33:14.631 --> 00:33:15.620
<v Speaker 3>he's an ambitious dude,</v>

1229
00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:15.860
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1230
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1231
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.671
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

1232
00:33:16.671 --> 00:33:17.504
<v Speaker 3>He's the most,</v>

1233
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.720
<v Speaker 3>for sure the most famous and the most popular guy that has not won a UFC title</v>

1234
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.330
<v Speaker 3>has been in the mix for as long as he's been in the mix.</v>

1235
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.190
<v Speaker 3>When he was a WEC champion,</v>

1236
00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.530
<v Speaker 3>was it like 2006 there's a while ago.</v>

1237
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:30.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1238
00:33:30.731 --> 00:33:33.500
<v Speaker 3>I remember he broke both his hands against Mike Brown.</v>

1239
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1240
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:36.441
<v Speaker 3>Throwing elbows.</v>

1241
00:33:36.441 --> 00:33:36.591
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1242
00:33:36.591 --> 00:33:37.700
<v Speaker 3>and I actually talked to him,</v>

1243
00:33:37.701 --> 00:33:38.230
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1244
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.961
<v Speaker 3>do you practice that?</v>

1245
00:33:38.961 --> 00:33:39.141
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1246
00:33:39.141 --> 00:33:39.974
<v Speaker 3>no man,</v>

1247
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:40.910
<v Speaker 3>no I didn't.</v>

1248
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.100
<v Speaker 3>I've just like started throwing my elbows cause I was like,</v>

1249
00:33:43.101 --> 00:33:44.480
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing else I could do at that point.</v>

1250
00:33:44.481 --> 00:33:47.120
<v Speaker 3>I was like crazy when an is after,</v>

1251
00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:47.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1252
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.580
<v Speaker 3>the first fight where Mike Brown caught him.</v>

1253
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:50.540
<v Speaker 3>He got too aggressive.</v>

1254
00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:52.220
<v Speaker 3>My Brown Mike Brown caught him on the chin.</v>

1255
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.750
<v Speaker 3>He used to be known for his insane ground and pound where he would do something</v>

1256
00:33:56.751 --> 00:33:58.670
<v Speaker 3>that no one has ever done.</v>

1257
00:33:58.671 --> 00:33:59.570
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anybody,</v>

1258
00:33:59.571 --> 00:34:00.980
<v Speaker 3>but I guess it's cause he's light.</v>

1259
00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.720
<v Speaker 3>He would get in someone's guard.</v>

1260
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.260
<v Speaker 3>You takes,</v>

1261
00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.790
<v Speaker 3>take them all down in the beginning of his career,</v>

1262
00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:09.230
<v Speaker 3>getting the guard and then he would like raise up and lift them up,</v>

1263
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.060
<v Speaker 3>slammed them down.</v>

1264
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.730
<v Speaker 3>And at the same time ricochet and to elbows.</v>

1265
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:15.470
<v Speaker 3>Nobody else has ever done that.</v>

1266
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:16.370
<v Speaker 3>He would be in the guard.</v>

1267
00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:17.450
<v Speaker 3>Holian pick them up,</v>

1268
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:18.141
<v Speaker 3>slam them,</v>

1269
00:34:18.141 --> 00:34:18.974
<v Speaker 3>and then boom,</v>

1270
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:19.881
<v Speaker 3>land elbows.</v>

1271
00:34:19.881 --> 00:34:21.320
<v Speaker 3>He's got like a crazy little move.</v>

1272
00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Know what I'm talking about?</v>

1274
00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:23.060

1275
00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.100
<v Speaker 3>Smart Dude Man.</v>

1276
00:34:24.101 --> 00:34:24.741

1277
00:34:24.741 --> 00:34:25.191

1278

1279
00:34:26.571 --> 00:34:27.200
<v Speaker 3>And then he just,</v>

1280
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.460
<v Speaker 3>he liked standing up explosive man.</v>

1281
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:29.870
<v Speaker 3>He like,</v>

1282
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:31.670
<v Speaker 3>he started getting really good at finishing too.</v>

1283
00:34:31.671 --> 00:34:34.160
<v Speaker 3>That's when you know you're I favor was a wrestler.</v>

1284
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:35.030
<v Speaker 3>He did,</v>

1285
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1286
00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:35.781

1288
00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:38.690
<v Speaker 3>he went against bowel and being a black belt.</v>

1289
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:40.280
<v Speaker 3>He was a blue belt at the time,</v>

1290
00:34:40.281 --> 00:34:41.690
<v Speaker 3>but he was at an amazing wrestler.</v>

1291
00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Stalemated Ballymena stalemate can beat him cause he was on top.</v>

1292
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.530
<v Speaker 3>He just bounced me and I couldn't get on top of MS is raising two boys.</v>

1293
00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:52.970
<v Speaker 3>I saw,</v>

1294
00:34:52.971 --> 00:34:53.781
<v Speaker 3>I won't say who he was,</v>

1295
00:34:53.781 --> 00:34:55.340
<v Speaker 3>who he was wrestling with,</v>

1296
00:34:55.341 --> 00:34:56.090
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1297
00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:57.380
<v Speaker 3>I watched Henner Gracie.</v>

1298
00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:00.500
<v Speaker 3>I'd never seen Jujitsu on that level where I was white clothes.</v>

1299
00:35:00.501 --> 00:35:01.011
<v Speaker 3>I just had,</v>

1300
00:35:01.011 --> 00:35:05.090

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.480
<v Speaker 3>how could they not talk to them?</v>

1321
00:35:31.481 --> 00:35:34.120
<v Speaker 3>That's what they've been doing it since they were in.</v>

1322
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:36.140
<v Speaker 3>And I talked to him about that and I said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1324

00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:43.320
<v Speaker 1>you've already been there.</v>

1374
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.740
<v Speaker 3>if it worked for sure and they saw it and they didn't have to search for it and</v>

1375
00:37:04.741 --> 00:37:07.560
<v Speaker 3>do the research and it was just in their face that it worked and everyone's</v>

<v Speaker 3>in the time.</v>

1442
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:55.000
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1443
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.200
<v Speaker 4>why are you practicing that shit?</v>

1444
00:38:56.201 --> 00:38:56.890
<v Speaker 4>It's a waste of your time.</v>

1445
00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:57.280
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

1446
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:57.710
<v Speaker 4>Nobody would,</v>

1447
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:58.730
<v Speaker 4>nobody was practicing it,</v>

1448
00:38:58.900 --> 00:38:59.150
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1449
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.770
<v Speaker 4>Now they are.</v>

1450
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:04.390
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what opened it up a lot in MMA as opposed to in kickboxing is the,</v>

1451
00:39:04.391 --> 00:39:09.160
<v Speaker 4>the takedowns and the worry about the sprawl and a lowered stance.</v>

1452
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:09.971
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

1453
00:39:09.971 --> 00:39:13.750
<v Speaker 4>there's a different approach because guys are always worried about both things.</v>

1454
00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:17.140
<v Speaker 4>You worried about possible takedowns so you're training in a different way.</v>

1455
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.580
<v Speaker 4>You're not throwing a lot of the same techniques.</v>

1456
00:39:20.581 --> 00:39:22.570
<v Speaker 4>So you're catching a guy that's like,</v>

1457
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.910
<v Speaker 4>might be leaning forward a little bit more,</v>

1458
00:39:24.911 --> 00:39:25.960
<v Speaker 4>might be of a lower bay,</v>

1459
00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:30.700
<v Speaker 4>might not be able to move back and forth out of the way is easy because you're</v>

1460
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:32.500
<v Speaker 4>not seeing it that much in kickboxing.</v>

1461
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:36.250
<v Speaker 4>You're seeing like a front push kicks to the face a little bit and some of the</v>

1462
00:39:36.251 --> 00:39:37.960
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing bouts and tie bouts,</v>

1463
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.600
<v Speaker 4>you're seeing some of that and they really don't land right.</v>

1464
00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:41.350
<v Speaker 4>They kind of just,</v>

1465
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:42.600
<v Speaker 4>they just kind of push back because they're,</v>

1466
00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:43.600
<v Speaker 4>they have a different stance.</v>

1467
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:44.920
<v Speaker 4>They'll lean way back,</v>

1468
00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:47.410
<v Speaker 4>they'll lean back light on their feet.</v>

1469
00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:48.101
<v Speaker 4>It's a different,</v>

1470
00:39:48.101 --> 00:39:49.090
<v Speaker 4>it's a different style.</v>

1471
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.130
<v Speaker 4>The MMA fighters,</v>

1472
00:39:51.131 --> 00:39:52.960
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them are,</v>

1473
00:39:52.961 --> 00:39:53.141
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1474
00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:53.420
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1475
00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:54.191
<v Speaker 4>they're positioning them.</v>

1476
00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:58.420
<v Speaker 4>So like Vitara squares off more because Vituro is always worried about the</v>

1477
00:39:58.421 --> 00:39:59.020
<v Speaker 4>takedowns.</v>

1478
00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:04.020
<v Speaker 4>And he actually used to teach that at Carlson Gracie's whose taste the different</v>

1479
00:40:04.451 --> 00:40:05.200
<v Speaker 4>stance.</v>

1480
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:05.441
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1481
00:40:05.441 --> 00:40:06.100
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>

1482
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:06.890
<v Speaker 4>you know a lot of these guys,</v>

1483
00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:09.940
<v Speaker 4>he was actually talking about Maury Smith at the time who was a,</v>

1484
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.730
<v Speaker 4>I think he was the UFC heavyweight champion.</v>

1485
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:12.161
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>

1486
00:40:12.161 --> 00:40:12.580
<v Speaker 4>Take tea.</v>

1487
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:13.960
<v Speaker 4>I think it would be Mark Coleman.</v>

1488
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:14.833
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1489
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.120
<v Speaker 4>right there on his back.</v>

1490
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.320
<v Speaker 4>Willy slip off,</v>

1491
00:40:17.321 --> 00:40:18.630
<v Speaker 4>look at the grease slips right off.</v>

1492
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:19.750
<v Speaker 4>He's way off.</v>

1493
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:20.700
<v Speaker 4>That's all grease.</v>

1494
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:23.170
<v Speaker 4>What kind of lost it.</v>

1495
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.233
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1496
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.001
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

1497
00:40:25.001 --> 00:40:29.730
<v Speaker 4>Vitto was explaining how Maury still stands like a kickboxer and that he had a</v>

1498
00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.390
<v Speaker 4>square off more and he's like,</v>

1499
00:40:31.391 --> 00:40:34.870
<v Speaker 4>you have to learn how to throw all your punches from almost like a horse dance.</v>

1500
00:40:34.871 --> 00:40:36.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean a square stance,</v>

1501
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.960
<v Speaker 4>much less sideways.</v>

1502
00:40:37.961 --> 00:40:39.760
<v Speaker 4>And if you look at a guy like Floyd Mayweather,</v>

1503
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's coming at you like Tony Sideways,</v>

1504
00:40:42.371 --> 00:40:45.340
<v Speaker 4>completely sideways and it makes a small target like that,</v>

1505
00:40:45.341 --> 00:40:48.700
<v Speaker 4>but get your leg and your leg kicked out or that's true.</v>

1506
00:40:48.701 --> 00:40:50.860
<v Speaker 4>But you could also get taken down and put the ties.</v>

1507
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.510
<v Speaker 4>Understand where,</v>

1508
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.690
<v Speaker 4>so it's more available and MMA because of the way people stand.</v>

1509
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:56.021
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1510
00:40:56.021 --> 00:40:56.650
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>

1511
00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:57.490
<v Speaker 4>Kickboxing there too.</v>

1512
00:40:57.491 --> 00:40:58.300
<v Speaker 4>Sideways,</v>

1513
00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.640
<v Speaker 4>too sideways and they move back to easy.</v>

1514
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:02.460
<v Speaker 4>They're moving like too upright.</v>

1515
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:07.650
<v Speaker 4>They moved like watch like someone like a like like a real high level Thai guy</v>

1516
00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:14.340
<v Speaker 4>like watch like you know one of those dudes from like from Gloria what?</v>

1517
00:41:14.981 --> 00:41:15.700
<v Speaker 4>Blue cow,</v>

1518
00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:16.211
<v Speaker 4>bull cow.</v>

1519
00:41:16.211 --> 00:41:18.820
<v Speaker 4>Poor promac that guy watch that guy wouldn't.</v>

1520
00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:22.840
<v Speaker 4>When people throw kicks at him and it's fucking moves back like a snake,</v>

1521
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.460
<v Speaker 4>like the kicks coming towards me,</v>

1522
00:41:24.461 --> 00:41:29.280
<v Speaker 4>leanings way back like a snake and then comes back to your fucking legs out</v>

1523
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.640
<v Speaker 4>money to take you down.</v>

1524
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.410
<v Speaker 4>Then it becomes even more effective.</v>

1525
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.210
<v Speaker 4>Now he's coming in Boone</v>

1526
00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:35.001
<v Speaker 2>so you're going to catch him.</v>

1527
00:41:35.001 --> 00:41:35.870
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be open for it.</v>

1528
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.470
<v Speaker 2>If you throw in like if you're,</v>

1529
00:41:37.471 --> 00:41:41.210
<v Speaker 2>you're leaning back like the way a lot of those guys will do and moving back and</v>

1530
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:41.391
<v Speaker 2>forth,</v>

1531
00:41:41.391 --> 00:41:44.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's like guys all time that figuring out when to take you down.</v>

1532
00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:45.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1533
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.810
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're committing forward guys,</v>

1534
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.570
<v Speaker 2>but when you don't have to worry about strike or you don't have to worry about</v>

1535
00:41:50.571 --> 00:41:52.220
<v Speaker 2>takedowns you change your state,</v>

1536
00:41:52.221 --> 00:41:54.770
<v Speaker 2>you change your stance and it changes what's available.</v>

1537
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Plus with Victor.</v>

1538
00:41:55.761 --> 00:41:55.891
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1539
00:41:55.891 --> 00:42:00.891
<v Speaker 2>he was more like a wide stance because vittores a power guy.</v>

1540
00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.630
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to knock dudes out second,</v>

1541
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:04.341
<v Speaker 2>shut up.</v>

1542
00:42:04.341 --> 00:42:05.510
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to knock a dude out.</v>

1543
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:07.250
<v Speaker 2>You know what's interesting about the tour man,</v>

1544
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:09.200
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have big hands at all.</v>

1545
00:42:09.201 --> 00:42:10.400
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have been a small fee.</v>

1546
00:42:10.401 --> 00:42:11.730
<v Speaker 2>It's got like an I eight size eight.</v>

1547
00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:13.540
<v Speaker 2>They're not this,</v>

1548
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.470
<v Speaker 2>they're not big and uh,</v>

1549
00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:15.790
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1550
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:19.250
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how much power he's able to generate.</v>

1551
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Like if you watch his fight with like Scott for Roseau back in the day when he</v>

1552
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:24.410
<v Speaker 2>was 19 school,</v>

1553
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:29.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean he is throwing punches that you have never seen in his or did he find his</v>

1554
00:42:29.601 --> 00:42:31.660
<v Speaker 2>own Gonzaga and fight?</v>

1555
00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:32.081
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1556
00:42:32.081 --> 00:42:33.290
<v Speaker 2>he didn't fight either one of those guys.</v>

1557
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.650
<v Speaker 2>He fought back in the day trade talisman men.</v>

1558
00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:42.260
<v Speaker 2>That was his first fight in the UFC and then right after that he foot's got</v>

1559
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 2>frozen.</v>

1560
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:43.491
<v Speaker 2>He won the tournament.</v>

1561
00:42:43.491 --> 00:42:45.080
<v Speaker 2>He calls it like a heavyweight title,</v>

1562
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.180
<v Speaker 2>but it's not really everyone.</v>

1563
00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.010
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy he just machine and got with the high level kick back.</v>

1564
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Vandelay Silva he just charged across.</v>

1565
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1566
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:53.990
<v Speaker 2>he hit him with a powder left hand.</v>

1567
00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1568
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:55.580
<v Speaker 2>He was just so much faster than,</v>

1569
00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:55.791
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1570
00:42:55.791 --> 00:42:56.830
<v Speaker 2>that was a big head kick by.</v>

1571
00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I'll um,</v>

1572
00:42:59.090 --> 00:42:59.923
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1573
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:00.620
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1574
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:05.620
<v Speaker 2>he's his hand speed is so goddamn blazing fast that if he catches you with one,</v>

1575
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:06.711
<v Speaker 2>we'd just,</v>

1576
00:43:06.711 --> 00:43:06.960
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

1577
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:10.340
<v Speaker 2>we'll it to you with 40 more behind it before you can react.</v>

1578
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.630
<v Speaker 2>That's what he did to van Italy.</v>

1579
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.130
<v Speaker 2>He literally ran out.</v>

1580
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:15.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm like chain punched style right across the,</v>

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.150
<v Speaker 1>who invented it?</v>

1641
00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.233
<v Speaker 1>I said Japanese.</v>

1642
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:57.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a position that existed as long as catch wrestling and all that shit</v>

1643
00:44:57.391 --> 00:44:57.811
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>

1644
00:44:57.811 --> 00:44:58.644
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing new.</v>

1645
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:59.623
<v Speaker 1>Why did I just learned?</v>

1646

<v Speaker 1>I just learned the proper name.</v>

1647
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:02.363
<v Speaker 1>Why is it ashy?</v>

1648
00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:03.751
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1649
00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:04.021
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1650
00:45:04.021 --> 00:45:04.854
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

1651
00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Is it a judo thing or is it a,</v>

1652
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:08.280
<v Speaker 1>what's the origin?</v>

1653
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:09.143
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1654
00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Cause all those Hari Goshi and decided I'm going to learn those names one of</v>

1655
00:45:14.341 --> 00:45:16.650
<v Speaker 1>these days and be a beast.</v>

1656
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what I'm more excited for than even Pacquiao Mayweather is.</v>

1657
00:45:20.581 --> 00:45:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking Shit to count about his taekwondo days for years now.</v>

1658
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:25.680
<v Speaker 1>His wife has proof,</v>

1659
00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:26.820
<v Speaker 1>I guess of what?</v>

1660
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:27.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1661
00:45:27.001 --> 00:45:27.241
<v Speaker 1>look at.</v>

1662
00:45:27.241 --> 00:45:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Look at the past.</v>

1663
00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.320
<v Speaker 1>We had our pictures of me.</v>

1664
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1665
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.770
<v Speaker 1>she has pictures of him probably flying through the air.</v>

1666
00:45:34.771 --> 00:45:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Killing a cow.</v>

1667
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:36.450
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing to be proud of.</v>

1668
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Probably failing is tiny with one hand.</v>

1669
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.193
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1670
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:41.610
<v Speaker 1>It sure isn't by the way.</v>

1671
00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:42.751
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1672
00:45:42.751 --> 00:45:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I been calling him a liar for years now and then is my bad.</v>

1673
00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:48.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything really.</v>

1674
00:45:48.361 --> 00:45:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Taekwondo though.</v>

1675
00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:50.041
<v Speaker 1>What did you,</v>

1676
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:51.090
<v Speaker 1>did you really get a black belt?</v>

1677
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:52.140
<v Speaker 1>I was a master.</v>

1678
00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:53.363
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

1679
00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:54.413
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

1680
00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what his rank master.</v>

1681
00:45:57.691 --> 00:45:58.524
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1682
00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:00.061
<v Speaker 1>Let me back.</v>

1683
00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:02.210
<v Speaker 1>I went back to like how long did you train?</v>

1684
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Probably seven years straight.</v>

1685
00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Seven years straight.</v>

1686
00:46:06.211 --> 00:46:07.500
<v Speaker 1>And where were you living with your colleagues?</v>

1687
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Is College all through college?</v>

1688
00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:13.140
<v Speaker 1>You must have been training when I met you then and then three years after it</v>

1689
00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:14.370
<v Speaker 1>probably just just stop.</v>

1690
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:14.790
<v Speaker 1>But I wasn't,</v>

1691
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:15.720
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't sparring then.</v>

1692
00:46:15.721 --> 00:46:17.190
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably stop just then.</v>

1693
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:19.680
<v Speaker 1>So when do you get your black belt?</v>

1694
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:24.680
<v Speaker 1>A 1987 so how many years are we training before you got your buck up?</v>

1695
00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Two and a half.</v>

1696
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:26.910
<v Speaker 1>That sounds ridiculous.</v>

1697
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1698
00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.651
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty fast.</v>

1699
00:46:28.651 --> 00:46:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1700
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.090
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even sound logical.</v>

1701
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.680
<v Speaker 1>You're the Bj Penn at Taekwondo,</v>

1702
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1703
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:32.603
<v Speaker 1>Now Tech,</v>

1704
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.260
<v Speaker 1>you get your back up pretty quick.</v>

1705
00:46:34.261 --> 00:46:34.821
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where you are.</v>

1706
00:46:34.821 --> 00:46:35.011
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1707
00:46:35.011 --> 00:46:36.370
<v Speaker 1>But a lot faster.</v>

1708
00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.060
<v Speaker 1>You get a 14 year olds.</v>

1709
00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.650
<v Speaker 1>But that's kind of the idea is that</v>

1710
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:42.421
<v Speaker 1>when you get your black belt,</v>

1711
00:46:42.421 --> 00:46:43.500
<v Speaker 1>then you're a student.</v>

1712
00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:43.891
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1713
00:46:43.891 --> 00:46:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Now you're ready to learn.</v>

1714
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.860
<v Speaker 1>I actually got mine in two years.</v>

1715
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:48.623
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1716
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:49.830
<v Speaker 1>I knew you were masking it with me.</v>

1717
00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1718
00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:52.470
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>

1719
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're 15 when I was 15 I got my,</v>

1720
00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:56.760
<v Speaker 1>before I was 17 I had mine.</v>

1721
00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:02.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing you pay for it in advance to pay for the black belt course.</v>

1722
00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Three years you pay for it,</v>

1723
00:47:03.691 --> 00:47:04.800

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:09.190
<v Speaker 2>It's these schools,</v>

1765
00:48:09.191 --> 00:48:09.670
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1766
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:13.570
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's a lot of them that are just maximizing their in their income,</v>

1767
00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:16.720
<v Speaker 2>but just trying to get as many students as they can and they're not teaching the</v>

1768
00:48:16.721 --> 00:48:20.230
<v Speaker 2>style that was a taekwondo originally was,</v>

1769
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.640
<v Speaker 2>which most people will quit.</v>

1770
00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:23.230
<v Speaker 2>They'll quit because he got hard.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1772
00:48:23.651 --> 00:48:24.484
<v Speaker 2>It's too hard.</v>

1773
00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:25.643
<v Speaker 2>It's too hard.</v>

1774
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:26.550
<v Speaker 2>You get kicked.</v>

1775
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Getting kicked.</v>

1776
00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.393
<v Speaker 2>Sucks.</v>

1777
00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Most,</v>

1778
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:29.861
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1779
00:48:29.861 --> 00:48:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Most of what you're doing is getting kicked.</v>

1780
00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Dudes went to sleep in my school all the time.</v>

1781
00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:37.750
<v Speaker 2>You always nervous every time you thought accidentally people would knock people</v>

1782
00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:39.850
<v Speaker 2>out accidentally on purpose too,</v>

1783
00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.980
<v Speaker 2>but accidentally friends would knock friends out.</v>

1784
00:48:41.981 --> 00:48:43.120
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it happen many times.</v>

1785
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:48.670
<v Speaker 2>When I pass the test for my first green stripe on my white belt in karate.</v>

1786
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:50.710
<v Speaker 2>The remark on the test,</v>

1787
00:48:50.711 --> 00:48:55.711
<v Speaker 2>I passed the test and they said that a fantastic overhand knife strike like that</v>

1788
00:48:56.051 --> 00:48:59.020
<v Speaker 2>was my shit and that my story and I'm thinking,</v>

1789
00:48:59.021 --> 00:48:59.530
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1790
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling my friends that I got to fucking</v>

1791
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:05.740
<v Speaker 2>actually thought someone fucked with me.</v>

1792
00:49:05.741 --> 00:49:07.390
<v Speaker 2>I got to go to my go to first.</v>

1793
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:09.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go.</v>

1794
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Did you use it in the sparring?</v>

1795
00:49:13.061 --> 00:49:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Did use it in spar?</v>

1796
00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Spar?</v>

1797
00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:15.773
<v Speaker 2>It was karate.</v>

1798
00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.790
<v Speaker 2>She say nothing at all.</v>

1799
00:49:18.791 --> 00:49:19.570
<v Speaker 2>No sparring.</v>

1800
00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make an assumption here.</v>

1801
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:26.170
<v Speaker 2>I would assume because you guys are in taekwondo,</v>

1802
00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:27.120
<v Speaker 2>you guys weren't,</v>

1803
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.260
<v Speaker 2>don't take the wrong way,</v>

1804
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.160
<v Speaker 2>but you guys weren't good at other sports.</v>

1805
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:30.910
<v Speaker 2>How does,</v>

1806
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:31.631
<v Speaker 2>that's adorable.</v>

1807
00:49:31.631 --> 00:49:32.050
<v Speaker 2>How's it good?</v>

1808
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:32.740
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>

1809
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:32.981
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1810
00:49:32.981 --> 00:49:33.611
<v Speaker 2>it was good at everything.</v>

1811
00:49:33.611 --> 00:49:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I did really good football,</v>

1812
00:49:35.111 --> 00:49:35.651
<v Speaker 2>basketball,</v>

1813
00:49:35.651 --> 00:49:36.071
<v Speaker 2>baseball,</v>

1814
00:49:36.071 --> 00:49:36.511
<v Speaker 2>baseball.</v>

1815
00:49:36.511 --> 00:49:37.810
<v Speaker 2>I played baseball as good at baseball.</v>

1816
00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:41.200
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I got into taekwondo is cause I was at Fenway Park to see a</v>

1817
00:49:41.201 --> 00:49:42.034
<v Speaker 2>baseball game.</v>

1818
00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:42.550
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>

1819
00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Leaving and yeah,</v>

1820
00:49:43.541 --> 00:49:44.620
<v Speaker 2>I was obsessed with baseball.</v>

1821
00:49:44.621 --> 00:49:45.100
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>

1822
00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Played all the time when I was a kid,</v>

1823
00:49:46.151 --> 00:49:47.050
<v Speaker 2>little league and all that shit.</v>

1824
00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:48.430
<v Speaker 2>And then when I was leaving,</v>

1825
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:49.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1826
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.230
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1827
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I could hit a ball fucking far dude.</v>

1828
00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:55.810
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid I had like good,</v>

1829
00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.730
<v Speaker 2>like home run power as a little,</v>

1830
00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:58.573
<v Speaker 2>is that right</v>

1831
00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:01.580
<v Speaker 2>with his hips?</v>

1832
00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Like it all,</v>

1833
00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.900
<v Speaker 2>it's translated into kicking and punching.</v>

1834
00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:05.561
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

1835
00:50:05.561 --> 00:50:05.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1836
00:50:05.891 --> 00:50:08.200
<v Speaker 2>like I was obsessed with hitting home runs.</v>

1837
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:09.980
<v Speaker 2>I struck out or I hit home runs,</v>

1838
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Babe Ruth,</v>

1839
00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.420
<v Speaker 2>a single fucking coach ever got into my head.</v>

1840
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:14.200
<v Speaker 2>They're all like,</v>

1841
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:14.471
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

00:50:14.471 --> 00:50:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I need to get on first base.</v>

1843
00:50:15.821 --> 00:50:16.121

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1847
00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:20.560
<v Speaker 2>Pitch comes swinging for the fucking moon every time.</v>

1848
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:23.710
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care if I struck out and cause I was a terrible team player.</v>

1849
00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1850
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I didn't give a fuck if we lost,</v>

1851
00:50:25.241 --> 00:50:26.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm hitting a home run.</v>

1852
00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:30.410
<v Speaker 2>That one is home right now.</v>

1853
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:31.251
<v Speaker 2>My coach,</v>

1854
00:50:31.251 --> 00:50:32.180
<v Speaker 2>they would pull me aside.</v>

1855
00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:32.421
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1856

1858
00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:37.163
<v Speaker 2>That's what I,</v>

1861
00:50:41.811 --> 00:50:42.680
<v Speaker 2>but when I hit it,</v>

1862
00:50:42.681 --> 00:50:42.951
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1863
00:50:42.951 --> 00:50:43.491

1866
00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:48.410
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1867
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:49.960
<v Speaker 2>So he played baseball it til when?</v>

1868
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.800
<v Speaker 2>A 15.</v>

1869
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:52.910
<v Speaker 2>Because when I was,</v>

1870
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:56.720
<v Speaker 2>when I was realizing that I could hit the ball harder than most people my size,</v>

1871
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:57.583
<v Speaker 2>it became my thing.</v>

1872
00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:58.850
<v Speaker 2>I get so excited about it.</v>

1873
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:03.500
<v Speaker 2>So it a practice obsessive Lee and then coming home from a baseball game,</v>

1874
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:05.690
<v Speaker 2>we went to see the red sox at Fenway Park.</v>

1875
00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:08.480
<v Speaker 2>There was the line for the teeth because it was a summertime.</v>

1876
00:51:08.481 --> 00:51:09.560
<v Speaker 2>There's always people walk in,</v>

1877
00:51:09.561 --> 00:51:11.930
<v Speaker 2>everybody took the t and it was a long line.</v>

1878
00:51:11.931 --> 00:51:14.480
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to wait like 45 minutes to get on the fucking train.</v>

1879
00:51:14.481 --> 00:51:15.960
<v Speaker 2>Just piles of people.</v>

1880
00:51:15.961 --> 00:51:19.580
<v Speaker 2>All these drunks piling out of Fenway Park Cause Fenway Park is right down the</v>

1881
00:51:19.581 --> 00:51:21.140
<v Speaker 2>street from the a the t stop.</v>

1882
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:25.670
<v Speaker 2>So we were walking home and we'd pass by the j Hunt Kim Taekwondo Institute.</v>

1883
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:26.751
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1884
00:51:26.751 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1885
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:28.280
<v Speaker 2>I was already taking karate.</v>

1886
00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:32.750
<v Speaker 2>I was taking karate at a Joe Esposito's in Newton,</v>

1887
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts.</v>

1888
00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:34.551
<v Speaker 2>But it's hard to get there.</v>

1889
00:51:34.551 --> 00:51:34.791
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>

1890
00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:36.580
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't good public transportation there.</v>

1891
00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:37.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1892
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:40.970
<v Speaker 2>I get to the top of the stairs as we're walking up,</v>

1893
00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.073
<v Speaker 2>I'm hearing</v>

1894
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.510
<v Speaker 2>like these change,</v>

1895
00:51:44.511 --> 00:51:45.344
<v Speaker 2>Chink,</v>

1896
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:49.190
<v Speaker 2>like cause the bag's going in the air and then the chain is like stopping it</v>

1897
00:51:49.191 --> 00:51:54.191
<v Speaker 2>from swinging lump and I go up and as just total synchronicity,</v>

1898
00:51:56.150 --> 00:52:00.200
<v Speaker 2>the time I show up at the school was the time that John Lee,</v>

1899
00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.131
<v Speaker 2>who was at the time,</v>

1900
00:52:01.131 --> 00:52:05.780
<v Speaker 2>the most devastating student that Mr. Kim hat as far as like knockout power,</v>

1901
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:09.560
<v Speaker 2>he was this really tall black dude from a really bad neighborhood.</v>

1902
00:52:09.561 --> 00:52:12.770
<v Speaker 2>He was like a street guy who learn martial arts learning to fight.</v>

1903
00:52:12.771 --> 00:52:16.400
<v Speaker 2>He had a spinning back kick that was unhealthy.</v>

1904
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.940
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

1905
00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.170
<v Speaker 2>This Day people say,</v>

1906
00:52:18.171 --> 00:52:18.470
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1907
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:19.850
<v Speaker 2>my spinning backaches really good.</v>

1908
00:52:19.851 --> 00:52:20.684
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

1909
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:22.610
<v Speaker 2>if you saw this motherfucker kicked the bag,</v>

1910
00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:23.390
<v Speaker 2>you would go,</v>

1911
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:24.560
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1912
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:25.640
<v Speaker 2>that's where I got it from.</v>

1913
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I got it from my first impressions.</v>

1914
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Well he taught me to,</v>

1915
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:29.780
<v Speaker 2>he taught me a lot of shit.</v>

1916
00:52:29.781 --> 00:52:31.070
<v Speaker 2>John taught me a lot of shit.</v>

1917
00:52:31.071 --> 00:52:31.380
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1918
00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:31.690
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1919
00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I went to a lot of tournaments with them actually when I was young,</v>

1920
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:34.603
<v Speaker 2>when I was older,</v>

1921
00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:38.930
<v Speaker 2>but I walked up when he was prepared was the national champion at the time and</v>

1922
00:52:38.931 --> 00:52:40.370
<v Speaker 2>he was preparing for the World Cup.</v>

1923
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:45.760
<v Speaker 2>So as I walked up the stairs it was like him and his final preparations for the</v>

1924
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:47.120
<v Speaker 2>World Cup and it was just boom,</v>

1925
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:49.100
<v Speaker 2>just fucking this bag up.</v>

1926
00:52:49.101 --> 00:52:53.870
<v Speaker 2>This hundred pound bag was flying through the air and bending in half.</v>

1927
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:55.011
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking,</v>

1928
00:52:55.011 --> 00:52:56.360
<v Speaker 2>I never saw anybody do anything.</v>

1929
00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:57.291
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1930
00:52:57.291 --> 00:52:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anybody do anything like this before.</v>

1931
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:04.750
<v Speaker 2>And it was all about bag work cause Mr. Kim was like adamant about bag work and</v>

1932
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.700
<v Speaker 2>he's like everybody throws kicks in the area that you've got to build</v>

1933
00:53:07.701 --> 00:53:08.534
<v Speaker 2>resistance,</v>

1934
00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.700
<v Speaker 2>you have to hit things heavy things.</v>

1935
00:53:10.701 --> 00:53:15.590
<v Speaker 2>He had a 200 pound bag know a series of hundred pound bags and it's 200 pound</v>

1936
00:53:15.591 --> 00:53:19.770
<v Speaker 2>bag that was like as big around as Joey Diaz and it was like seven feet telling</v>

1937
00:53:19.771 --> 00:53:21.590
<v Speaker 2>you to kick the shit out of this fucking thing.</v>

1938
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:22.880
<v Speaker 2>And that was his thing man.</v>

1939
00:53:22.881 --> 00:53:24.230
<v Speaker 2>It's just building power.</v>

1940
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 2>So I became</v>

1941
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:26.610
<v Speaker 1>obsessed.</v>

1942
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:27.540
<v Speaker 1>So you saw that and said,</v>

1943
00:53:27.541 --> 00:53:27.901
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Bay,</v>

1944
00:53:27.901 --> 00:53:28.620
<v Speaker 1>quit risks,</v>

1945
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:29.453
<v Speaker 1>wrestling,</v>

1946
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:30.780
<v Speaker 1>quit baseball,</v>

1947
00:53:30.781 --> 00:53:31.381
<v Speaker 1>quit everything.</v>

1948
00:53:31.381 --> 00:53:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I was doing a bunch of sports,</v>

1949
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:34.260
<v Speaker 1>but how dare you think I wasn't good at sports?</v>

1950
00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:34.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1951
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:35.723
<v Speaker 1>it's not that I,</v>

1952
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.800
<v Speaker 1>it was more like in my neighborhood,</v>

1953
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:38.790
<v Speaker 1>if he did taekwondo,</v>

1954
00:53:38.791 --> 00:53:41.200
<v Speaker 1>you weren't good at anything else because it was a,</v>

1955
00:53:41.201 --> 00:53:41.911
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1956
00:53:41.911 --> 00:53:42.691
<v Speaker 1>Cause you,</v>

1957
00:53:42.691 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 1>it's not a team sport.</v>

1958
00:53:43.801 --> 00:53:44.940
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get picked on.</v>

1959
00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:45.481
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

1960
00:53:45.481 --> 00:53:45.900
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1961
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.920
<v Speaker 1>well what can he do?</v>

1962
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Let's put this little bastard in Taekwondo Denver.</v>

1963
00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Denver's like taekwondo.</v>

1964
00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Not exactly heartland.</v>

1965
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:57.390
<v Speaker 1>It all depends.</v>

1966
00:53:57.391 --> 00:53:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Every martial art depends on what school you go to.</v>

1967
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:01.950
<v Speaker 1>You can go to a dog shit Jujitsu school and it's,</v>

1968
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:02.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1969
00:54:02.161 --> 00:54:03.060
<v Speaker 1>it's better than nothing,</v>

1970
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:06.180
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to learn some shitty technique a lot of the times.</v>

1971
00:54:06.181 --> 00:54:06.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1972
00:54:06.291 --> 00:54:07.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same with karate.</v>

1973
00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:08.791
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same way we talk.</v>

1974
00:54:08.791 --> 00:54:08.911
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1975
00:54:08.911 --> 00:54:09.061
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1976
00:54:09.061 --> 00:54:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I just got stupid lucky man.</v>

1977
00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I was in the right place at the right time.</v>

1978
00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1979
00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:14.970
<v Speaker 1>you can't get a better time.</v>

1980
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:18.990
<v Speaker 1>This guy was kicking up the fucking shit out of this bag and I just stood.</v>

1981
00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:19.421
<v Speaker 1>The way the,</v>

1982
00:54:19.421 --> 00:54:20.251
<v Speaker 1>the gym is set up,</v>

1983
00:54:20.251 --> 00:54:24.180
<v Speaker 1>you'd get to the top of the stairs is an area where you'd take her shoes off and</v>

1984
00:54:24.181 --> 00:54:28.440
<v Speaker 1>that area was right where the heavy bags where it was by design because Mr. Kim</v>

1985
00:54:28.441 --> 00:54:32.550
<v Speaker 1>wanted people to walk up the stairs and see someone murdering the bag and sign</v>

1986
00:54:32.551 --> 00:54:33.100
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1987
00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.230
<v Speaker 1>The desk is right there.</v>

1988
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.910
<v Speaker 1>So that's where John was working out.</v>

1989
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:37.140
<v Speaker 1>And like you'd go,</v>

1990
00:54:37.141 --> 00:54:37.471
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1991
00:54:37.471 --> 00:54:38.930
<v Speaker 1>you see a guy who's a black poly like boy,</v>

1992
00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:39.720
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking black.</v>

1993
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:40.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1994
00:54:40.001 --> 00:54:40.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1995
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:44.190
<v Speaker 1>But you see a black was actually doing real black belt shit that you expect a</v>

1996
00:54:44.191 --> 00:54:46.270
<v Speaker 1>black belt to do that.</v>

1997
00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:49.770
<v Speaker 1>So that was how I got hooked with one because if I came up there and it's some</v>

1998
00:54:49.771 --> 00:54:51.780
<v Speaker 1>fucking kid's class and they're like,</v>

1999
00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:52.683
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2000
00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:54.830
<v Speaker 1>that was my experience.</v>

2001
00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I would have been later.</v>

2002
00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.730
<v Speaker 1>I would have been so close and make a lot of money.</v>

2003
00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Teach just forms and 0.5 because you know you can,</v>

2004
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:04.650
<v Speaker 1>you can have a lot of money.</v>

2005
00:55:04.651 --> 00:55:05.760
<v Speaker 1>You can get your black button right away.</v>

2006
00:55:05.761 --> 00:55:06.060
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but when,</v>

2008
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:07.920
<v Speaker 1>when we were hitting each other,</v>

2009
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:09.630
<v Speaker 1>those gyms have a hard time.</v>

2010
00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.760
<v Speaker 1>John didn't remember any of his forms.</v>

2011
00:55:11.761 --> 00:55:12.990
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that I've learned.</v>

2012
00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Like John Leaks,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You remember that Shit.</v>

2019
00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:23.390
<v Speaker 1>He would laugh about it.</v>

2020
00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:26.730
<v Speaker 1>It was like total street guy.</v>

2021
00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Like he's a good dude man.</v>

2022
00:55:28.201 --> 00:55:29.820
<v Speaker 1>He had a lot of you played sports.</v>

2023
00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.030
<v Speaker 1>I played sports on my street.</v>

2024
00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2025
00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:39.523
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2026
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:44.490
<v Speaker 1>I played football all the goddamn time on the streets with other Mexican people,</v>

2027
00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:46.650
<v Speaker 1>my size and the older and stuff.</v>

2028
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:48.023
<v Speaker 1>But then once,</v>

2029
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:48.810
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2030
00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:51.870
<v Speaker 1>and I played little league or junior all American football.</v>

2031
00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:56.850
<v Speaker 1>So when I was nine I played middle linebacker and defense event.</v>

2032
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Dope.</v>

2033
00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Actually thought I was going to grow up to be a football player and play,</v>

2034
00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:03.030
<v Speaker 1>maybe Middle Linebacker,</v>

2035
00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.140
<v Speaker 1>maybe quarterback,</v>

2036
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:06.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe defensive and like I was so delusional as a kid,</v>

2037
00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:07.380
<v Speaker 1>junior,</v>

2038
00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:08.670
<v Speaker 1>all American football does that.</v>

2039
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:10.430
<v Speaker 1>It makes you think like it took off.</v>

2040
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I tried to play football my freshman year.</v>

2041
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I get into pads,</v>

2042
00:56:14.401 --> 00:56:15.121
<v Speaker 1>I'm in New England,</v>

2043
00:56:15.121 --> 00:56:16.440
<v Speaker 1>it's so cold and I just,</v>

2044
00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:17.400
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a football player.</v>

2045
00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:19.650
<v Speaker 1>I literally was a hundred and what?</v>

2046
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Literally 110 pounds and my father was so huge,</v>

2047
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to grow up to</v>

2048
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.431
<v Speaker 3>be like him.</v>

2049
00:56:24.431 --> 00:56:25.264
<v Speaker 3>So it's just a question of,</v>

2050
00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:25.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2051
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:27.140
<v Speaker 3>growing into that and I,</v>

2052
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:27.910
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2053
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:30.040
<v Speaker 3>I was getting hit and it was so cold in my head.</v>

2054
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:34.360
<v Speaker 3>I was running away from the place and then a guy carry lane came to me and he</v>

<v Speaker 3>you have to rustle.</v>

2057

<v Speaker 3>You're just wrestle people your size.</v>

2058
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:40.030
<v Speaker 3>What are you do on our foot?</v>

2059
00:56:40.031 --> 00:56:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Change in my life was our football coach was the assistant wrestling coach and</v>

2060
00:56:43.901 --> 00:56:45.850
<v Speaker 3>this mother fucker would always try to recruit people.</v>

2096
00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:24.070
<v Speaker 3>That's another different kind of white dude.</v>

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:27.040
<v Speaker 3>Israel Martinez is that guy that Donald Serone head kicked.</v>

2100
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.551

00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:29.200
<v Speaker 3>This was his last fight,</v>

2103
00:57:29.201 --> 00:57:29.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2104

<v Speaker 3>I believe so.</v>

2105
00:57:30.251 --> 00:57:33.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if Martine's is fought on one of the undercards I wasn't aware of.</v>

2106
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:36.040
<v Speaker 3>There's so many fights going on as we were talking about.</v>

2107

<v Speaker 3>the prelims on Fox sports one and all that.</v>

2113
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:51.550
<v Speaker 3>He's responsible for two of the most stomach churning submissions in the history</v>

2114
00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:52.384
<v Speaker 3>of the UFC.</v>

2115
00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:52.920
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2116
00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:53.501
<v Speaker 3>What's the other one?</v>

2117
00:57:53.501 --> 00:57:55.630
<v Speaker 3>Tim Silvia snapped this fucking forearm.</v>

2118
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Half Demon.</v>

2119
00:57:56.891 --> 00:57:57.610
<v Speaker 3>No it right.</v>

2120
00:57:57.610 --> 00:58:00.910
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to keep going and then on people that knew something was wrong.</v>

2121
00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:01.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2122
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:04.690
<v Speaker 3>he did that crazy Americana from the guard kind of thing.</v>

2123
00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:05.763
<v Speaker 3>That was awesome.</v>

2124
00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Frank Mir is one of the reasons I started fighting.</v>

2125
00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:09.430
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever done that again.</v>

2126
00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:10.750
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever pulled that off?</v>

2127
00:58:10.751 --> 00:58:12.610
<v Speaker 3>That Americana from full guard?</v>

2128
00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:13.030
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2129
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:15.010
<v Speaker 3>No guys did it after that.</v>

2130
00:58:15.011 --> 00:58:16.330
<v Speaker 3>They were fucking around with it.</v>

2131
00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:17.441
<v Speaker 3>I remember guys,</v>

2132
00:58:17.441 --> 00:58:20.650
<v Speaker 3>we're fucking around with it in class like right after that fight.</v>

2133

<v Speaker 3>I mean from full good.</v>

2134
00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:25.990
<v Speaker 3>It'd be tough to a very complex setup.</v>

2135
00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:30.370
<v Speaker 3>He paid someone who did more good when it sold it off.</v>

2136
00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:30.941
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2137
00:58:30.941 --> 00:58:32.560
<v Speaker 3>you don't think a wrist locks work.</v>

2138
00:58:32.561 --> 00:58:33.830
<v Speaker 3>You think wrist locks or Ooh,</v>

2139

00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:37.920
<v Speaker 3>But Fred [inaudible],</v>

2141
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:40.960
<v Speaker 3>he put lock or a wrist locks you from full guard.</v>

2142
00:58:40.961 --> 00:58:41.531

<v Speaker 3>this is real shit.</v>

2146
00:58:47.471 --> 00:58:51.270
<v Speaker 3>Wrist locks sound like something doesn't make fun of and no one really tells him</v>

2147
00:58:51.271 --> 00:58:51.500
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

2148
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:52.740
<v Speaker 3>There are certain girls,</v>

<v Speaker 3>there's a wizard a wizard.</v>

2173
00:59:26.661 --> 00:59:27.494
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

2174
00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:29.870
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of high level guys now man.</v>

2175
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 3>I was so impressed watching Gary Tone and Havi so I'm so impressed with the</v>

2176
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:34.910
<v Speaker 3>hobby.</v>

2177
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:35.331
<v Speaker 3>Hobbies.</v>

2178
00:59:35.331 --> 00:59:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Defense is incredible.</v>

2179
00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.450
<v Speaker 3>How relaxed he is.</v>

2180
00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.790
<v Speaker 3>And that guy's mounting him and going after leg locks,</v>

2181
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:42.230
<v Speaker 3>but he's bigger than Havi.</v>

2182
00:59:42.231 --> 00:59:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Right by quite a bit.</v>

2183
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:47.120
<v Speaker 3>They were saying we're announcing the weigh ins.</v>

2184
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:51.260
<v Speaker 3>They were saying one 45 and one 70 I don't know if that's accurate though.</v>

2185
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:56.950
<v Speaker 3>I would say hobby would hobby was not one 45 I would say it was one 65 one 70</v>

2186
00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.890
<v Speaker 3>somebody must've just erroneously stated that.</v>

2187
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:04.900
<v Speaker 3>I would say since I wasn't a weight limit and and Gary Tone and cuts down to 70</v>

2188
01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:06.883
<v Speaker 3>for some fights,</v>

2189
01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.660
<v Speaker 3>I would say he might've been,</v>

2190
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:11.990
<v Speaker 3>he could have been one 75 one 80 maybe.</v>

2191
01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:12.501
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2192
01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:13.610
<v Speaker 3>He so he's looked big.</v>

2193
01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.990
<v Speaker 3>It looked a lot bigger than a hobby,</v>

2194
01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:15.771
<v Speaker 3>but God damn,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dying to get the word flutist out all mine if it right in my throat all year.</v>

2292
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.660
<v Speaker 1>How many times on here do you use flowers?</v>

2293
01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I had a good year.</v>

2294
01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>A crazy flout filled year.</v>

2295
01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:47.800
<v Speaker 1>I bet he said you say it every time on your own podcast.</v>

2296
01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:48.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2297
01:02:48.081 --> 01:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>

2298
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>

2299
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I started my own buck as everything because it's really,</v>

2300
01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:51.620
<v Speaker 1>unless I go,</v>

2301
01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:52.291
<v Speaker 1>I have to say,</v>

2302
01:02:52.291 --> 01:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I've always fantasized about being a flutist and now the Prime Kevin?</v>

2303
01:02:55.831 --> 01:02:55.981
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2304
01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:56.850
<v Speaker 1>If you had to be honest,</v>

2305
01:02:56.851 --> 01:02:59.670
<v Speaker 1>like how many times a year do you think you break out the word flutist?</v>

2306
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2307
01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.840
<v Speaker 1>it is a word that I think about a lot and I just never have time to really</v>

2308
01:03:03.841 --> 01:03:04.950
<v Speaker 1>working in until just now.</v>

2309
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Cause I don't have sophisticated company.</v>

2310
01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:10.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that that's the only time I've ever said it is repeating.</v>

2311
01:03:10.531 --> 01:03:11.364
<v Speaker 1>You just know.</v>

2312
01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2313
01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it'd be on flowers,</v>

2314
01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:18.270
<v Speaker 1>but I expect that with a guy that came in with a scarf.</v>

2315
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Cashmere is 100% we went deer hunting.</v>

2316
01:03:21.121 --> 01:03:22.020
<v Speaker 1>He was wearing cashmere,</v>

2317
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.150
<v Speaker 1>he just called himself the cashmere killer.</v>

2318
01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:26.790
<v Speaker 1>He's in Montana tested killer.</v>

2319
01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:32.660
<v Speaker 1>He killed her to really one of the most desolate spots in North America.</v>

2320
01:03:33.421 --> 01:03:33.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2321
01:03:33.691 --> 01:03:34.800
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking wilderness.</v>

2322
01:03:34.801 --> 01:03:35.730
<v Speaker 1>There's no one out there.</v>

2323
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.160
<v Speaker 1>He's wearing cashmere can't,</v>

2324
01:03:38.161 --> 01:03:39.090
<v Speaker 1>you can't grow anything.</v>

2325
01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:42.180
<v Speaker 1>You get to the top of a mountain and you know when you looked at for deer and</v>

2326
01:03:42.181 --> 01:03:42.950
<v Speaker 1>you look off,</v>

2327
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:43.340
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

2328
01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:45.300
<v Speaker 1>like how remote you are,</v>

2329
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:46.320
<v Speaker 1>like the area you're in.</v>

2330
01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.970
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty cool.</v>

2331
01:03:47.971 --> 01:03:48.960
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

2332
01:03:48.961 --> 01:03:51.000
<v Speaker 1>And then you look over and there's county Kashmir,</v>

2333
01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Kashmir and his cell phone.</v>

2334
01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:55.083
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah</v>

2335
01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:56.360
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2336
01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:57.151
<v Speaker 1>You're in the middle of nowhere.</v>

2337
01:03:57.151 --> 01:03:57.811
<v Speaker 1>You can't grow anything.</v>

2338
01:03:57.811 --> 01:03:58.920
<v Speaker 1>You're in clay to,</v>

2339
01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:00.840
<v Speaker 1>you walk around in clay.</v>

2340
01:04:00.841 --> 01:04:01.674
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2341
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:02.543
<v Speaker 1>Cat Mud,</v>

2342
01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:03.390
<v Speaker 1>clay,</v>

2343
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:05.280
<v Speaker 1>cactus clay and like Rye.</v>

2344
01:04:05.281 --> 01:04:06.180
<v Speaker 1>We'd grow there.</v>

2345
01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Well you know why it's,</v>

2346
01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:07.681
<v Speaker 1>it's clay.</v>

2347
01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:10.290
<v Speaker 1>It's literally the bottom of an ancient sea.</v>

2348
01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:12.960
<v Speaker 1>It's the great western inland sea.</v>

2349
01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:17.130
<v Speaker 1>These of dinosaurs fucking rolling around that you find like shells,</v>

2350
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.180
<v Speaker 1>you find like,</v>

2351
01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:19.200
<v Speaker 1>like seashells.</v>

2352
01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:20.940
<v Speaker 1>They're millions of years ago.</v>

2353
01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:21.774
<v Speaker 1>That was an ocean.</v>

2354
01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:22.591
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

2355
01:04:22.591 --> 01:04:23.280
<v Speaker 1>you don't hunt.</v>

2356
01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't go with these guys hunting.</v>

2357
01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:25.680
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2358
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

2359
01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:27.400
<v Speaker 1>you're saying it's too big,</v>

2360
01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:29.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2361
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:29.843
<v Speaker 1>It should be.</v>

2362
01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2363
01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:31.630
<v Speaker 1>you just never tried.</v>

2364
01:04:31.631 --> 01:04:33.000
<v Speaker 1>It goes down.</v>

2365
01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2366
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:34.710
<v Speaker 1>guys didn't know how to hunt.</v>

2367
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Those are the guys you want to be though.</v>

2368
01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.040
<v Speaker 1>When you're hunting.</v>

2369
01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:41.460
<v Speaker 1>The hunting is the fun is actually the amount.</v>

2370
01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:46.470
<v Speaker 1>You laugh together like you and I laugh more when we hunt because a lot of times</v>

2371
01:04:46.861 --> 01:04:48.390
<v Speaker 1>it's cold and a little bit miserable.</v>

2372
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Well and then they don't know anybody like us.</v>

2373
01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't know.</v>

2374
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.340
<v Speaker 1>They don't ever have comedians come hunting with them.</v>

2375
01:04:53.341 --> 01:04:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Other hunters truths of Joe and I had a captive audience.</v>

2376
01:04:55.951 --> 01:04:56.910
<v Speaker 1>They have nowhere to go.</v>

2377
01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.050
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

2378
01:04:58.050 --> 01:04:58.883
<v Speaker 1>In all fairness,</v>

2379
01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.630
<v Speaker 1>I have a captive,</v>

2380

2382
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Plus we can talk,</v>

2383

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2384
01:05:06.841 --> 01:05:09.900
<v Speaker 1>we could have like real conversations like especially that first day I'm like,</v>

2385
01:05:09.901 --> 01:05:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know where these guys are going to fucking get this key.</v>

2386
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:12.870

<v Speaker 1>who knows.</v>

2388
01:05:13.351 --> 01:05:14.150
<v Speaker 1>This could be,</v>

2389
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:15.200
<v Speaker 1>this could be a disaster.</v>

2390
01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what kind of guys were going with.</v>

01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:33.760
<v Speaker 1>They had a five day Brian Cowen comedy show.</v>

2402
01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:34.961
<v Speaker 1>By the end of it,</v>

2403

<v Speaker 1>they knew the rhythm too.</v>

2404
01:05:36.161 --> 01:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>They knew it was all gay stuff.</v>

2405
01:05:37.690 --> 01:05:38.560
<v Speaker 1>So anytime,</v>

2406
01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:42.130
<v Speaker 1>anytime they would bend over to pick up firewood.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's a nice,</v>

2435
01:06:17.591 --> 01:06:18.424
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful,</v>

2436
01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.090
<v Speaker 1>the scanner to scan it,</v>

2437
01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:21.521
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2438
01:06:21.521 --> 01:06:21.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2439
01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>it's very satisfying.</v>

2440
01:06:22.971 --> 01:06:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeti.</v>

2441
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.810
<v Speaker 1>You would enjoy.</v>

2442
01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:24.641
<v Speaker 1>You love meat,</v>

2443
01:06:24.641 --> 01:06:25.120
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2444
01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:25.700
<v Speaker 1>It'd be,</v>

2445
01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:27.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't love meat that much.</v>

2446
01:06:27.461 --> 01:06:28.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't like any game.</v>

2447
01:06:28.331 --> 01:06:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Me like elk and I don't like or you don't know.</v>

2448
01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I never had to say that.</v>

2449
01:06:31.361 --> 01:06:34.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't know at Fuddruckers and they got all that shit.</v>

2450
01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Just stop right now.</v>

2451
01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.800
<v Speaker 1>That's like saying karate doesn't work.</v>

2452
01:06:38.801 --> 01:06:41.500
<v Speaker 1>I saw Fred Volare but Eddie,</v>

2453
01:06:41.501 --> 01:06:41.711
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

2454
01:06:41.711 --> 01:06:41.921
<v Speaker 1>Eddie.</v>

2455
01:06:41.921 --> 01:06:42.631
<v Speaker 1>That's first of all,</v>

2456
01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:45.060
<v Speaker 1>it's farm raised where it's farm raised.</v>

2457
01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Alchemize via cow that grow those fucking things in cages in New Zealand.</v>

2458
01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:50.710
<v Speaker 1>They cut the meat up and they ship it over here.</v>

2459
01:06:50.711 --> 01:06:54.880
<v Speaker 1>You're not getting wild elk from North America because wild elk from North</v>

2460
01:06:54.881 --> 01:06:55.241
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

2461
01:06:55.241 --> 01:06:56.050
<v Speaker 1>you can't sell.</v>

2462
01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:56.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't like Cam.</v>

2463
01:06:56.730 --> 01:06:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Try dated.</v>

2464
01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:58.173
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>

2465
01:06:58.270 --> 01:06:59.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to camp.</v>

2466
01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:00.190
<v Speaker 1>You could stay on the lodges.</v>

2467
01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.241
<v Speaker 1>Stand lodges.</v>

2468
01:07:01.241 --> 01:07:03.640
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times you've done it hardcore,</v>

2469
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:06.460
<v Speaker 1>but we've also done it where we stay in a house that's different.</v>

2470
01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.720
<v Speaker 1>We've done a hardcore twice,</v>

2471
01:07:07.721 --> 01:07:08.554
<v Speaker 1>like hardcore</v>

2472
01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.260
<v Speaker 1>jungle Rinella.</v>

2473
01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:12.094
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2474
01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:15.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in the jungles where you go to a gentleman and hug like leopards.</v>

2475
01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I been to prom is no,</v>

2476
01:07:17.681 --> 01:07:18.730
<v Speaker 1>I've been to a jungle.</v>

2477
01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:19.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be in.</v>

2478
01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:20.410
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be in the jungle.</v>

2479
01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:21.071
<v Speaker 1>And I've been in the gym.</v>

2480
01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:21.821
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather do that.</v>

2481
01:07:21.821 --> 01:07:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I've been in the rain forest.</v>

2482
01:07:22.831 --> 01:07:23.970
<v Speaker 1>You like general listening.</v>

2483
01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:28.360
<v Speaker 1>He got to hear this because he actually was working as a bug scientist.</v>

2484
01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:28.871
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

2485
01:07:28.871 --> 01:07:31.660
<v Speaker 1>I went to Indonesia and went and tracked orangutans.</v>

2486
01:07:31.661 --> 01:07:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

2487
01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.640
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you why you never want to go in the jungle.</v>

2488
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:34.211
<v Speaker 1>Ever,</v>

2489
01:07:34.211 --> 01:07:34.810
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

2490
01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

2491
01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Bugs.</v>

2492
01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.300
<v Speaker 1>You'll get eaten by mosquitoes.</v>

2493
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:39.460
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to carry a sulfur coil,</v>

2494
01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:41.110
<v Speaker 1>not just bug spray,</v>

2495
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:42.370
<v Speaker 1>a sulfur coil.</v>

2496
01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:43.780
<v Speaker 1>You have to sit in your hammock.</v>

2497
01:07:43.781 --> 01:07:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Please don't lie on the ground because if you're laying the ground,</v>

2498
01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:46.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2499
01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:46.871
<v Speaker 1>leeches,</v>

2500
01:07:46.871 --> 01:07:47.621
<v Speaker 1>we'll get into your skin.</v>

2501
01:07:47.621 --> 01:07:50.080
<v Speaker 1>And not to mention those wonderful ants and wasps.</v>

2502
01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:54.370
<v Speaker 1>What about you at the story you told about putting the Turpentine on the posts</v>

2503
01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:54.711
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

2504
01:07:54.711 --> 01:07:55.050
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2505
01:07:55.050 --> 01:07:55.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2506
01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:56.770
<v Speaker 1>you have to put per turpentine.</v>

2507
01:07:56.950 --> 01:08:00.520
<v Speaker 1>So every house there is raised up and you put Turpentine,</v>

2508
01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:01.570
<v Speaker 1>you soak the,</v>

2509
01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.040
<v Speaker 1>the wood in terms of why?</v>

2510
01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't want to be in the way of the soldier ants when they're</v>

2511
01:08:07.331 --> 01:08:07.661
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>

2512
01:08:07.661 --> 01:08:08.494
<v Speaker 1>If they're foraging,</v>

2513
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:09.910
<v Speaker 1>they'll walk right over you.</v>

2514
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.350
<v Speaker 1>If they're hunting,</v>

2515
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:13.690
<v Speaker 1>they will come up those posts.</v>

2516
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:18.870
<v Speaker 1>They will come into a hut and kill you and they'll jump on you.</v>

2517
01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:21.600
<v Speaker 1>They'll basically cover you and sting you in your,</v>

2518
01:08:21.690 --> 01:08:23.550
<v Speaker 1>the normal thinking that happens too.</v>

2519
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:25.420
<v Speaker 1>They kill elephants.</v>

2520
01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>What they climb in Indonesia and Africa as well.</v>

2521
01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:35.150
<v Speaker 1>They climb into an an elephant's ear and they'll start eating it's fucking</v>

2522
01:08:35.151 --> 01:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

2523
01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.250
<v Speaker 1>You can hear them coming there.</v>

2524
01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:38.101
<v Speaker 1>That's how many there are.</v>

2525
01:08:38.101 --> 01:08:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm from real.</v>

2526
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:39.950
<v Speaker 1>You can hear a buzz.</v>

2527
01:08:39.951 --> 01:08:40.784
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2528
01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:42.770
<v Speaker 1>you want to hear a crazy statistic?</v>

2529
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Here's a crazy statistic about ants.</v>

2530
01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.880
<v Speaker 1>The body mass,</v>

2531
01:08:46.881 --> 01:08:49.430
<v Speaker 1>like the weight of ants on earth,</v>

2532
01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:53.540
<v Speaker 1>the amount of ants is exactly the same or close to it as the weight of people.</v>

2533
01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2534
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:55.790
<v Speaker 1>That's how many ants there are.</v>

2535
01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:56.420
<v Speaker 1>So shitload.</v>

2536
01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:58.430
<v Speaker 1>And now why is,</v>

2537
01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:03.440
<v Speaker 1>how do these Amazon Indian survive these bugs saying is that the Dayak who I was</v>

2538
01:09:04.131 --> 01:09:04.550
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2539
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:05.600
<v Speaker 1>they don't sweat.</v>

2540
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Even though you're sweating,</v>

2541
01:09:06.621 --> 01:09:07.340
<v Speaker 1>losing counselor,</v>

2542
01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.030
<v Speaker 1>they don't sweat.</v>

2543
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.360
<v Speaker 1>They there.</v>

2544
01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:12.590
<v Speaker 1>They've adapted to their environment so they can and bugs don't.</v>

2545
01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.120
<v Speaker 1>The mosquitoes don't really bite them.</v>

2546
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2547
01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Because they over millennia,</v>

2548
01:09:16.671 --> 01:09:17.570
<v Speaker 1>they developed a,</v>

2549
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.240
<v Speaker 1>they evolve to develop resistance to bugs,</v>

2550
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.650
<v Speaker 1>to the bugs of that area.</v>

2551
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:24.590
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

2552
01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Totally makes sense.</v>

2553
01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:30.350
<v Speaker 1>But there's some bugs is still get them like Rinella was in Bolivia.</v>

2554
01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.500
<v Speaker 1>You know Rinella just got back from Bolivia where he ate a monkey.</v>

2555
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh my shot and cooked and ate a monkey.</v>

2556
01:09:35.751 --> 01:09:36.261
<v Speaker 1>Not Him,</v>

2557
01:09:36.261 --> 01:09:37.340
<v Speaker 1>but the people in the tribe.</v>

2558
01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:37.521
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2559
01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:38.151
<v Speaker 1>he didn't get sick,</v>

2560
01:09:38.151 --> 01:09:39.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's disturbing.</v>

2561
01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2562
01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Watching them throw this monkey on the fire.</v>

2563
01:09:42.230 --> 01:09:43.160
<v Speaker 1>It looks very,</v>

2564
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:48.370
<v Speaker 1>very fucking human monkey like a chimpanzee or hail.</v>

2565
01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:51.950
<v Speaker 1>You want a little monkey with a tail.</v>

2566
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.380
<v Speaker 1>But he got stung by a bullet ant.</v>

2567
01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:56.960
<v Speaker 1>He was there and he was in agony.</v>

2568
01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:57.410
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

2569
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:58.243
<v Speaker 4>the worst.</v>

2570
01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:58.940
<v Speaker 4>But these,</v>

2571
01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:01.640
<v Speaker 4>those guys get stung to as a part of their coming of age ritual.</v>

2572
01:10:01.641 --> 01:10:02.900
<v Speaker 4>They're not immune to that shit now.</v>

2573
01:10:02.901 --> 01:10:03.560
<v Speaker 4>They're not.</v>

2574
01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.620
<v Speaker 4>WASPS could give a shit how long you've lived in the area.</v>

2575
01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:10.790
<v Speaker 4>It's going to hurt just as much hobby lobby and our Martine's is an interesting</v>

2576
01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:11.120
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>

2577
01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:11.690
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2578
01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:14.300
<v Speaker 4>His hobby lobby's coming off that loss to Benson Henderson.</v>

2579
01:10:14.301 --> 01:10:15.140
<v Speaker 4>It was a close fight.</v>

2580
01:10:15.190 --> 01:10:15.770
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2581
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:16.880
<v Speaker 4>Got pulled into deep water.</v>

2582
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:18.150
<v Speaker 4>He's beaten good guys.</v>

2583
01:10:18.151 --> 01:10:19.520
<v Speaker 4>He beat Jorge Mosbey Dolly.</v>

2584
01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:20.990
<v Speaker 4>Remember he hit him with that weird,</v>

2585
01:10:20.991 --> 01:10:22.550
<v Speaker 4>we'll kick really awkward.</v>

2586
01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:23.384
<v Speaker 4>We'll kick.</v>

2587
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:25.280
<v Speaker 4>It's a really good grappler.</v>

2588
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2589
01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.190
<v Speaker 4>Real world champion Samba.</v>

2590
01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:29.720
<v Speaker 4>I think he was correct.</v>

2591
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:30.910
<v Speaker 4>And His uh,</v>

2592
01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:33.080
<v Speaker 4>suplexes are off the charts.</v>

2593
01:10:33.081 --> 01:10:34.040
<v Speaker 4>Throw you on your head.</v>

2594
01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:34.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2595
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:37.250
<v Speaker 4>But Martine's is high level Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</v>

2596
01:10:37.251 --> 01:10:38.900
<v Speaker 4>Black belt could kick boxer.</v>

2597
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:41.660
<v Speaker 4>He was holding his own with cowboy mean he was getting,</v>

2598
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:43.860
<v Speaker 4>he was hanging in there until he got head kicks.</v>

2599
01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.560
<v Speaker 4>Cowboy was setting him up,</v>

2600
01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:47.660
<v Speaker 4>but he was doing well up to that moment.</v>

2601
01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:48.650
<v Speaker 4>He's a good fighter.</v>

2602
01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:50.400
<v Speaker 4>Cowboy.</v>

2603
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.201
<v Speaker 4>She's so fast.</v>

2604
01:10:51.201 --> 01:10:54.560
<v Speaker 4>Those head kicks and he's not afraid to fight off his back.</v>

2605
01:10:54.561 --> 01:10:56.060
<v Speaker 4>So he's not scared throwing that,</v>

2606
01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:56.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2607
01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.770
<v Speaker 4>he's not worried about anything.</v>

2608
01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:58.790
<v Speaker 4>Having a good guard.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's a weird fight.</v>

2617
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:13.650
<v Speaker 4>That's a real weird fight.</v>

2618
01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:14.160

2669
01:12:18.201 --> 01:12:19.034
<v Speaker 2>in grappling.</v>

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:18.733
<v Speaker 2>No bullshit.</v>

2722
01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:21.430
<v Speaker 2>So a continent killer really?</v>

2723
01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:21.911
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2724
01:13:21.911 --> 01:13:23.420
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck isn't seen Antonio?</v>

2725
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:23.910
<v Speaker 2>This dude,</v>

2726
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:24.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2727
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.720
<v Speaker 2>it's Whoa.</v>

2728
01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Nice kicked right by Martine's.</v>

2729
01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:29.290
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

2730
01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:31.360
<v Speaker 2>what they call a Caldera volcano,</v>

2731
01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:35.680
<v Speaker 2>which is a volcano that's so violent that it starts out as like a mountain.</v>

2732
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:40.950
<v Speaker 2>The mountain explodes and what you're left with is a crater that they have to</v>

2733
01:13:41.051 --> 01:13:43.420
<v Speaker 2>look at it from satellites to even recognize what it is.</v>

2734
01:13:43.570 --> 01:13:46.590
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even know it was a volcano until Mike,</v>

2735
01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:51.600
<v Speaker 2>the two thousands like when when they started looking at the area with a</v>

2736
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.870
<v Speaker 2>satellite imagery,</v>

2737
01:13:52.871 --> 01:13:53.501
<v Speaker 2>they started going,</v>

2738
01:13:53.501 --> 01:13:53.801
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2739
01:13:53.801 --> 01:13:54.010
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

2740
01:13:54.010 --> 01:13:54.460
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

2741
01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:54.870
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

2742
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:55.151
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2743
01:13:55.151 --> 01:13:55.361
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2744
01:13:55.361 --> 01:13:56.740
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are we looking at here?</v>

2745
01:13:57.190 --> 01:13:57.760
<v Speaker 2>And then they went,</v>

2746
01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh gee,</v>

2747
01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:00.040
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

2748
01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:04.510
<v Speaker 2>I realize it's 600 kilometers wide.</v>

2749
01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.550
<v Speaker 2>That's why there's nothing we can do.</v>

2750
01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:07.031
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2751
01:14:07.031 --> 01:14:11.920
<v Speaker 2>not only these isn't nothing that goes off every six eight Yellowstone</v>

2752
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:14.920
<v Speaker 4>goes off every six to 800,000 years.</v>

2753
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.910
<v Speaker 4>When's the last time went off?</v>

2754
01:14:15.911 --> 01:14:18.940
<v Speaker 4>600,000 so we got 200,000 we're good.</v>

2755
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:19.751
<v Speaker 4>If we're lucky,</v>

2756
01:14:19.751 --> 01:14:20.920
<v Speaker 4>it could go off tomorrow.</v>

2757
01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:21.581
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2758
01:14:21.581 --> 01:14:24.820
<v Speaker 4>they've had thousands of earthquakes every year for a long time.</v>

2759
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.280
<v Speaker 4>They have thousands of earthquakes every year.</v>

2760
01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:28.870
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you go to Yellowstone.</v>

2761
01:14:28.890 --> 01:14:29.440
<v Speaker 4>Hmm?</v>

2762
01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.900
<v Speaker 4>Almost every day you're going to have a fucking earthquake.</v>

2763
01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.610
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes multiple.</v>

2822
01:15:58.950 --> 01:16:00.030
<v Speaker 4>When Yellowstone,</v>

2823

<v Speaker 4>the super volcano explodes and kills everybody in North America.</v>

2826
01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.700
<v Speaker 4>Australia is a strong possibility.</v>

2827
01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.920
<v Speaker 4>I feel like you just broke news on that.</v>

2828
01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:08.540
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You knew only through Joe,</v>

2833
01:16:12.031 --> 01:16:12.864
<v Speaker 4>only through Joe,</v>

2834
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:13.980
<v Speaker 4>but it's one of the things that,</v>

2835
01:16:13.981 --> 01:16:14.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2836
01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.300
<v Speaker 4>if it does blow,</v>

2837
01:16:15.330 --> 01:16:16.050
<v Speaker 4>don't worry,</v>

01:16:17.911 --> 01:16:22.280
<v Speaker 4>you might die slow if you're anywhere like outside of the perimeter of them die</v>

2841
01:16:22.290 --> 01:16:23.280
<v Speaker 4>or it's not that bad.</v>

01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:31.620
<v Speaker 4>it went fully live on the beach.</v>

2847
01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:32.873
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be</v>

2848
01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:36.690
<v Speaker 4>people jumping in the ocean,</v>

2849
01:16:36.691 --> 01:16:37.950
<v Speaker 4>so you're dying by lava.</v>

2850
01:16:37.951 --> 01:16:38.341
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry.</v>

2851
01:16:38.341 --> 01:16:39.890
<v Speaker 4>It's just I live in stone.</v>

2852
01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:40.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2853
01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:40.661

2857
01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:47.453
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

2858
01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:52.990
<v Speaker 4>what would probably happen is that the son would get completely blotted out.</v>

2859
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:53.833
<v Speaker 4>That's what,</v>

<v Speaker 4>No more vicious animals would die.</v>

2863
01:16:56.701 --> 01:16:58.410
<v Speaker 4>Rotten meat everywhere.</v>

2864
01:16:58.411 --> 01:16:59.131

<v Speaker 1>it's one of the main reasons why there's like when you teach trace the genetic</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2937
01:19:04.921 --> 01:19:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there's 10 super volcanoes that can destroy the world.</v>

2938
01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:12.860
<v Speaker 1>10 Jesus Christ is the one in Japan.</v>

2939
01:19:12.861 --> 01:19:14.030
<v Speaker 1>There's one in Columbia,</v>

2940
01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:15.380
<v Speaker 1>the conspiracy theorists,</v>

2941
01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:16.930
<v Speaker 1>a geologist.</v>

2942

2946
01:19:21.591 --> 01:19:22.880
<v Speaker 1>They have one in Mexico.</v>

2947
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Most scientists are saying,</v>

2948
01:19:24.381 --> 01:19:24.861
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

2949
01:19:24.861 --> 01:19:25.420
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck.</v>

2950
01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:26.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2951
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:28.460
<v Speaker 1>he's still got a couple of million years down.</v>

2952
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Happens Mount Vesuvius.</v>

2953
01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:31.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2954
01:19:31.251 --> 01:19:31.631
<v Speaker 1>it's kid.</v>

2955
01:19:31.631 --> 01:19:33.230
<v Speaker 1>They've killed a fuck load of people.</v>

2956
01:19:33.231 --> 01:19:34.760
<v Speaker 1>The Alex Jones of volcanoes.</v>

2957
01:19:34.761 --> 01:19:35.594
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine?</v>

2958
01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.880
<v Speaker 1>What about Alex Jones got into volcanoes?</v>

2959
01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Forget the economy.</v>

2960
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:41.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not about the economy anymore.</v>

2961
01:19:41.970 --> 01:19:42.251
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

2962
01:19:42.251 --> 01:19:47.251
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the chances of it ending America of volcano is pretty low.</v>

2963
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2964
01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:51.710
<v Speaker 1>it's only pretty low because our lifetimes are very short.</v>

2965
01:19:51.711 --> 01:19:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2966
01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:53.390
<v Speaker 1>You haven't seen Dante speak.</v>

2967
01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:54.180
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2968
01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:56.410
<v Speaker 1>it's chances of ending America hold.</v>

2969
01:19:56.590 --> 01:20:01.590
<v Speaker 1>It's chances of ending America are 100% it's 100% over the course of the entire,</v>

2970
01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:06.020
<v Speaker 1>over the course of the next 200 plus thousand years,</v>

2971
01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:07.740
<v Speaker 1>it's 100% that makes sense.</v>

2972
01:20:07.741 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 1>So it's</v>

2973
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:10.500
<v Speaker 2>not whether or not it's going to end America.</v>

2974
01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:11.790
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking going on in America.</v>

2975
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:15.000
<v Speaker 2>It's just whether or not you're going to be alive to see it happen 100% or</v>

2976
01:20:15.001 --> 01:20:17.580
<v Speaker 2>whether or not there'll be society at that point.</v>

2977
01:20:17.581 --> 01:20:21.900
<v Speaker 2>And whether or not we've been hit by an asteroid already all be on Mars by that</v>

2978
01:20:21.901 --> 01:20:22.530
<v Speaker 2>could be,</v>

2979
01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:23.070
<v Speaker 2>could be on,</v>

2980
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:25.460
<v Speaker 2>I never know why.</v>

2981
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Why do you choose Mars?</v>

2982
01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:27.351
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2983
01:20:27.351 --> 01:20:29.660
<v Speaker 2>it's the only one I hear that we're exploring right now.</v>

2984
01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:35.040
<v Speaker 2>So the one in Indonesia is the one I think that they believe killed.</v>

2985
01:20:35.041 --> 01:20:36.600
<v Speaker 2>So many fucking people did.</v>

2986
01:20:36.601 --> 01:20:39.180
<v Speaker 2>That's why when they do like a genetic lineage,</v>

2987
01:20:39.210 --> 01:20:40.080
<v Speaker 2>when they test,</v>

2988
01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:44.760
<v Speaker 2>you know people's genes and try to find the unique origin of mankind,</v>

2989
01:20:44.761 --> 01:20:49.260
<v Speaker 2>they believe it all comes back to this one group of people that survived the</v>

2990
01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Super Volcano that blew 70,000 years ago.</v>

2991
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:53.930
<v Speaker 2>So sleep tight there.</v>

2992

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:01.080
<v Speaker 2>What happened with South Africa being the cradle of civilization?</v>

2996
01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:02.101
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2997
01:21:02.101 --> 01:21:03.750
<v Speaker 2>that's where people started for sure,</v>

2998
01:21:03.751 --> 01:21:04.350
<v Speaker 2>but they move.</v>

2999

3007
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Keto is about the bloating.</v>

3008
01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:16.471
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling them,</v>

3009
01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:17.304
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

3010
01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Even if you get your shit together,</v>

3011
01:21:18.751 --> 01:21:20.310
<v Speaker 2>if you live in America and it happens,</v>

3012
01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:21.420
<v Speaker 2>most people are dead.</v>

3013
01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:22.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a continent</v>

3014
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:22.670
<v Speaker 1>killer.</v>

3015
01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

3016
01:21:23.010 --> 01:21:24.470
<v Speaker 1>my father used to ruin everybody's Day.</v>

3017
01:21:24.471 --> 01:21:26.120
<v Speaker 1>We'd be opening presents at Christmas.</v>

3018
01:21:26.121 --> 01:21:27.350
<v Speaker 1>He looked up from his book and Go,</v>

3019
01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:28.970
<v Speaker 1>and the 1930s,</v>

3020
01:21:28.971 --> 01:21:32.000
<v Speaker 1>13 million people died of starvation in the Ukraine.</v>

3021
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.903
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy yourself.</v>

3022
01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Go back to his book.</v>

3023
01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:34.671
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3024
01:21:34.671 --> 01:21:34.791
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3025
01:21:34.791 --> 01:21:35.421
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>

3026
01:21:35.421 --> 01:21:36.254
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real number?</v>

3027
01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.170
<v Speaker 1>It would just make dot.</v>

3028
01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:38.323
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3029
01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:43.620
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the greater area of an before World War Two,</v>

3030
01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.120
<v Speaker 1>when Stalin starved the Ukraine,</v>

3031
01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:48.920
<v Speaker 1>the number is crazy high.</v>

3032
01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:50.323
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3033
01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:52.010
<v Speaker 1>and I think overall,</v>

3034
01:21:52.011 --> 01:21:54.380
<v Speaker 1>if you consider Latvia and all those areas of Baltic states,</v>

3035
01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:55.610
<v Speaker 1>it's about 13 mil.</v>

3036
01:21:56.170 --> 01:21:57.003
<v Speaker 2>John Wayne Park,</v>

3037
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:57.730
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

3038
01:21:57.730 --> 01:21:58.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to change subjects here,</v>

3039
01:21:58.961 --> 01:22:02.770
<v Speaker 2>but when you're watching MMA and you're watching like striking,</v>

3040
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:03.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3041
01:22:03.670 --> 01:22:05.440
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about this earlier with Eddie Bravo,</v>

3042
01:22:05.441 --> 01:22:07.030
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about Jujitsu positions.</v>

3043
01:22:07.031 --> 01:22:07.241
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3044
01:22:07.241 --> 01:22:08.060
<v Speaker 2>do you see these,</v>

3045
01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:10.000
<v Speaker 2>these positions that people don't capitalize on?</v>

3046
01:22:10.330 --> 01:22:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Like what level do you think like MMA striking is at now?</v>

3047
01:22:14.110 --> 01:22:14.710
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

3048
01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:17.680
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously not the level of the highest level Moy Tai,</v>

3049
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:18.361
<v Speaker 2>but like what,</v>

3050
01:22:18.361 --> 01:22:20.140
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about MMA striking?</v>

3051
01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:20.411
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3052
01:22:20.411 --> 01:22:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it's amazing.</v>

3053
01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3054
01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:22.510
<v Speaker 1>some of the guys that,</v>

3055
01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Luxor,</v>

3056
01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Ronnie,</v>

3057
01:22:23.770 --> 01:22:25.420
<v Speaker 1>I left [inaudible] he said he's so good.</v>

3058
01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3059
01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:27.580
<v Speaker 1>and then yeah,</v>

3060
01:22:27.581 --> 01:22:30.140
<v Speaker 1>it's just different because you guys can't stand and trade.</v>

3061
01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:32.950
<v Speaker 1>They can't go to toe to toe and he kind of just keep letting the bombs go.</v>

3062
01:22:32.951 --> 01:22:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you get taken down.</v>

3063
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3064
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:35.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3065
01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:36.460
<v Speaker 1>but I respect these guys so much.</v>

3066
01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:36.731
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3067
01:22:36.731 --> 01:22:37.564
<v Speaker 1>of course you do.</v>

3068
01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

3069
01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:41.470
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to compete in MMA.</v>

3070
01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.220
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

3071
01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:44.800
<v Speaker 1>And then I broke my finger and then that's why I came up with my,</v>

3072
01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:48.820
<v Speaker 1>a new promotion with the Cajun Way Tinier because a Jaeger finger grappling,</v>

3073
01:22:48.850 --> 01:22:48.971
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3074
01:22:48.971 --> 01:22:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

3075
01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I did my very first class and I broke my finger 120 more.</v>

3076
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:53.623
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>

3077
01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I do wonder gt class and burnt my finger.</v>

3078
01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:59.790
<v Speaker 1>So it's like how can I put in the cage but not dude,</v>

3079
01:22:59.791 --> 01:23:01.630
<v Speaker 1>you did to cause I don't want to break any more fingers.</v>

3080
01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.280
<v Speaker 1>And then now that's hilarious.</v>

3081
01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:03.851
<v Speaker 1>That's when I thought,</v>

3082
01:23:03.851 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 1>well stuff it I'll do an occasional times they'd</v>

3083
01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:07.323
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>

3084
01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.520
<v Speaker 2>And you've never wanted to go back to MMA?</v>

3085
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Well now I've got my,</v>

3086
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:11.583
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3087
01:23:11.770 --> 01:23:13.350
<v Speaker 2>that desire to fight in the cage.</v>

3088
01:23:13.351 --> 01:23:14.260
<v Speaker 2>True what I'm doing now.</v>

3089
01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:16.770
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm not going to be good at it too because I'm not doing bad at more</v>

3090
01:23:16.771 --> 01:23:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Thai.</v>

3091
01:23:17.170 --> 01:23:20.080
<v Speaker 2>What's that difference between fighting in the cage and fighting your ring?</v>

3092
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:21.520
<v Speaker 2>If you could just going to keep it on your feet.</v>

3093
01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

3094
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:24.460
<v Speaker 2>I've also incorporated the MMA gloves as well.</v>

3095
01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

3096
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.781
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3097
01:23:25.781 --> 01:23:26.050
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3098
01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:26.711
<v Speaker 2>it's everything.</v>

3099
01:23:26.711 --> 01:23:28.330
<v Speaker 2>It's everything MMA.</v>

3100
01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:30.820
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as you go to the ground,</v>

3101
01:23:30.821 --> 01:23:32.650
<v Speaker 2>you'll stop and stand back up and then you start banging it again.</v>

3102
01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.930
<v Speaker 2>She got down in the Clinton,</v>

3103
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.870
<v Speaker 2>thrown in there like a,</v>

3104
01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:38.731
<v Speaker 2>you can in the moist.</v>

3105
01:23:38.731 --> 01:23:39.131
<v Speaker 2>Why clinch,</v>

3106
01:23:39.131 --> 01:23:40.360
<v Speaker 2>but you can't sort of suplex.</v>

3107
01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:41.673
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3108
01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:42.970
<v Speaker 2>And there's a cancer as well,</v>

3109
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:43.481
<v Speaker 2>so we let it,</v>

3110
01:23:43.481 --> 01:23:43.811
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

3111
01:23:43.811 --> 01:23:44.940
<v Speaker 2>So if you get knocked down,</v>

3112
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:46.750
<v Speaker 2>there's still a chance you can still come back and still win.</v>

3113
01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:48.041
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

3114
01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:49.060
<v Speaker 2>But it's very violent.</v>

3115
01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:49.281
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3116
01:23:49.281 --> 01:23:50.230
<v Speaker 2>I looked it up on youtube.</v>

3117
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:52.720
<v Speaker 2>The guys are fighting in the cage with boxing gloves on and looked very</v>

3118
01:23:52.721 --> 01:23:53.231
<v Speaker 2>peculiar.</v>

3119
01:23:53.231 --> 01:23:53.621
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>

3120
01:23:53.621 --> 01:23:54.454
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

3121
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I have to be in such a big fan of the UFC for so long.</v>

3122
01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:59.200
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't put big gloves on.</v>

3123
01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:00.070
<v Speaker 2>I have to do it properly.</v>

3124
01:24:00.071 --> 01:24:03.660
<v Speaker 2>So what would you think about guys fighting bare knuckle and MMA?</v>

3125
01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that makes any sense at all?</v>

3126
01:24:05.230 --> 01:24:05.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3127
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:06.850
<v Speaker 2>too dangerous hands.</v>

3128
01:24:06.851 --> 01:24:08.110
<v Speaker 2>My hands is break your hands.</v>

3129
01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.010
<v Speaker 2>My hands are screwed.</v>

3130
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:09.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3131
01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:11.380
<v Speaker 2>But for like for realism,</v>

3132
01:24:11.890 --> 01:24:12.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3133
01:24:12.221 --> 01:24:15.730
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of the reasons why people were able to just on low with a bunch of</v>

3134
01:24:15.731 --> 01:24:17.200
<v Speaker 2>punches is because they have gloves on.</v>

3135
01:24:17.201 --> 01:24:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3136
01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:17.980
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

3137
01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:18.410
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

3138
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:19.243
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3139
01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:19.541
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3140
01:24:19.541 --> 01:24:20.010
<v Speaker 2>the damage.</v>

3141
01:24:20.010 --> 01:24:22.000
<v Speaker 2>But to be sustained and to try and get insured,</v>

3142
01:24:22.001 --> 01:24:26.080
<v Speaker 2>would it be quite difficult because the hands and the hand doctor on staff?</v>

3143
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:26.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3144
01:24:26.411 --> 01:24:28.630
<v Speaker 2>And just in case of somebody dying too,</v>

3145
01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:30.220
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't want to see someone dying.</v>

3146
01:24:30.221 --> 01:24:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Then your promotion,</v>

3147
01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.050
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're the promoter,</v>

3148
01:24:32.051 --> 01:24:34.960
<v Speaker 2>had he put your head on the pillow at night time knowing that someone's died on</v>

3149
01:24:34.961 --> 01:24:35.794
<v Speaker 2>your show,</v>

3150
01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:39.580
<v Speaker 2>when you think that would make people die more often with no gloves,</v>

3151
01:24:39.581 --> 01:24:42.270
<v Speaker 2>I would think that would cause more decrement.</v>

3152
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:45.430
<v Speaker 2>The grand and Pam would with no gloves on them could be quite severe.</v>

3153
01:24:45.850 --> 01:24:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

3154
01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:46.961
<v Speaker 2>I wonder man,</v>

3155
01:24:46.961 --> 01:24:51.080
<v Speaker 2>cause I feel like you can shin kick someone in the head with no pads on and need</v>

3156
01:24:51.081 --> 01:24:53.820
<v Speaker 2>someone in the head with no pads on elbows with no pads.</v>

3157
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000
<v Speaker 2>They mentioned it true.</v>

3158
01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think that it would.</v>

3159
01:24:56.980 --> 01:24:58.630
<v Speaker 2>I think I track,</v>

3160
01:24:58.690 --> 01:24:59.930
<v Speaker 2>I retract my last segment.</v>

3161
01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:02.750
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

3162
01:25:03.570 --> 01:25:06.520
<v Speaker 2>no glove on your Shin right to the face and that's okay.</v>

3163
01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.320
<v Speaker 2>I've seen you can't do it with your fist.</v>

3164
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:09.430
<v Speaker 2>I've seen you kicked dudes.</v>

3166
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just ridiculous.</v>

3167
01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:16.540
<v Speaker 2>The idea that anybody can punch as hard as you can care is ridiculous.</v>

3168
01:25:16.541 --> 01:25:20.140
<v Speaker 2>There's not a man alive that punches as hard as you kick that they don't exist</v>

3169
01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.760
<v Speaker 2>yet and you're crying,</v>

3170

3320
01:29:14.521 --> 01:29:15.180
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

3321
01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:16.013
<v Speaker 1>Push my agenda,</v>

3322
01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:18.220
<v Speaker 1>my balls into my body wouldn't,</v>

3323
01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:22.680
<v Speaker 1>it was all Dick we remember that were guys who would say they could do that.</v>

3324
01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:24.240
<v Speaker 1>They would take ball kicks.</v>

3325
01:29:25.410 --> 01:29:25.951
<v Speaker 1>Well there's still,</v>

3326
01:29:25.951 --> 01:29:29.550
<v Speaker 1>there's like videos out there of guys taking ball kicks and it's like scientific</v>

3327
01:29:29.551 --> 01:29:32.280
<v Speaker 1>attempts to analyze like how they're able to take ball kicks.</v>

3328
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Well they did the one on fight science</v>

3329
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:36.130
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

3330
01:29:36.130 --> 01:29:38.050
<v Speaker 1>He's telling the story screen or something.</v>

3331
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:39.161
<v Speaker 1>I think Morrie's created,</v>

3332
01:29:39.161 --> 01:29:40.770
<v Speaker 1>someone just gave them like a full kick.</v>

3333
01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know it was,</v>

3334
01:29:41.701 --> 01:29:46.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's all and apparently it's the exact same thing where your balls become</v>

3335
01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:48.660
<v Speaker 1>like stones,</v>

3336
01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:50.810
<v Speaker 1>like basically front of your mind.</v>

3337
01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:55.680
<v Speaker 1>What kind of kids do you make with balls that had been kicked off in practice</v>

3338
01:29:55.681 --> 01:29:56.514
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly?</v>

3339
01:29:56.810 --> 01:29:58.470
<v Speaker 1>I heard a rumor.</v>

3340
01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:02.820
<v Speaker 1>It's the equivalent of a woman giving birth is when a man gets kicked in the</v>

3341
01:30:02.821 --> 01:30:03.250
<v Speaker 1>balls.</v>

3342
01:30:03.250 --> 01:30:04.260
<v Speaker 1>That's now don't kill me,</v>

3343
01:30:04.261 --> 01:30:07.100
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I heard for that quick instant.</v>

3344
01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a different kind of bank has been in the balls.</v>

3345
01:30:08.911 --> 01:30:11.300
<v Speaker 1>You get like a sick sick.</v>

3346
01:30:11.301 --> 01:30:12.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not just pain.</v>

3347
01:30:14.770 --> 01:30:16.470
<v Speaker 1>You got kicked in the stomach,</v>

3348
01:30:16.471 --> 01:30:16.800
<v Speaker 1>you got,</v>

3349
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.030
<v Speaker 1>you got kicked in the liver.</v>

3350
01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.250
<v Speaker 1>It's that more than pain.</v>

3351
01:30:20.251 --> 01:30:21.270
<v Speaker 1>It sounds emotional.</v>

3352
01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen a woman giving birth?</v>

3353
01:30:22.481 --> 01:30:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Because I've been,</v>

3354
01:30:22.890 --> 01:30:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I've been up close and personal pussy tears apart like a moose that got caught</v>

3355
01:30:27.181 --> 01:30:28.110
<v Speaker 1>in a meat grinder.</v>

3356
01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:28.993
<v Speaker 1>Machine</v>

3357

<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

3358
01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Babies' heads are giant.</v>

3359
01:30:35.161 --> 01:30:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Vaginas are small.</v>

3360
01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:37.200

3399
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.903
<v Speaker 3>glove cage.</v>

01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:04.710
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing with that?</v>

3403
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:05.590
<v Speaker 3>I'd watch.</v>

3404
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:06.730
<v Speaker 3>What is that shirt you're wearing?</v>

3405
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:08.070
<v Speaker 3>That's a friend of mine and he's a,</v>

3406
01:32:08.071 --> 01:32:09.190
<v Speaker 3>he's plugging it in.</v>

3407
01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3408
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:10.833
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>

3409
01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Can you,</v>

3410
01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:14.500
<v Speaker 3>can you get in the clinch as long as you want a knee.</v>

3411
01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:15.130
<v Speaker 3>Can you do that?</v>

3412
01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

3413
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

3414
01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:16.870
<v Speaker 3>Let's break it up.</v>

3415
01:32:16.871 --> 01:32:17.860
<v Speaker 3>Ever when they clench,</v>

3416
01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:18.753
<v Speaker 3>when it's done,</v>

3417
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:21.310
<v Speaker 3>it's getting stale and they look us as active.</v>

3418
01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:22.920
<v Speaker 3>But they'll let you work in the clinch.</v>

3419
01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:23.200
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3420
01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:25.930
<v Speaker 3>That's a beautiful thing because I think k one you can't work on the collection</v>

3421
01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:26.380
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

3422
01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:26.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3423
01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:29.160
<v Speaker 3>That's where they can find Gloria.</v>

3424
01:32:29.170 --> 01:32:30.060
<v Speaker 3>They give him like five seconds.</v>

3425
01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Why are they doing that?</v>

3426
01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:35.140
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't it seem like it sort of water the damn boy toy and they try it.</v>

3427
01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:38.710
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to make it entertaining for the fans because getting in clinch</v>

3428
01:32:38.711 --> 01:32:40.090
<v Speaker 3>fighting is not as boring.</v>

3429
01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:43.480
<v Speaker 3>I guess the guys who are in the k one is change the rules.</v>

3430
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:46.510
<v Speaker 3>But since more cow came the Kois and he started dominating people.</v>

3431
01:32:46.511 --> 01:32:49.450
<v Speaker 3>So the thing and now how can we make it even for the western as a vista toys.</v>

3432
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:53.540
<v Speaker 3>I know we'll make it like the three second rule war when he rule well it</v>

3433
01:32:53.541 --> 01:32:55.450
<v Speaker 3>incorporates a lot of grappling.</v>

3434

01:36:34.011 --> 01:36:34.850
<v Speaker 3>And then um,</v>

3578
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:37.280
<v Speaker 3>and then I want to speak English today you'd have to do everything by hand</v>

3579
01:36:37.281 --> 01:36:37.941
<v Speaker 3>signals first.</v>

3580
01:36:37.941 --> 01:36:39.170
<v Speaker 3>But I had an aide or asleep.</v>

3581
01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:39.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

3582
01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:43.760
<v Speaker 3>And how different is Dutch kickboxing from Moitai that you learned?</v>

3583
01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:45.950
<v Speaker 3>More and more hands and more leg kicks.</v>

3584
01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:48.710
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the ties and more body kicks in and more knees and elbows.</v>

3585
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think that is a different scoring system?</v>

3586
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:55.640
<v Speaker 3>The toys don't school punching the dance school they kicks.</v>

3587
01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.473
<v Speaker 3>They cause it's harder.</v>

3588
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:57.270
<v Speaker 3>It's harder to throw.</v>

3589
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Body kicked in is a leg kick.</v>

3590
01:36:58.191 --> 01:37:02.450
<v Speaker 3>Anyone can throw laky so that and the toys in the clinching as well,</v>

3591
01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:02.841
<v Speaker 3>the clinching,</v>

3592
01:37:02.841 --> 01:37:03.890
<v Speaker 3>it would be good high score as well.</v>

3593
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:06.330
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that an interesting that we don't think about that at all.</v>

3594
01:37:06.331 --> 01:37:07.400
<v Speaker 3>It was a scoring position.</v>

3595
01:37:07.401 --> 01:37:10.940
<v Speaker 3>We think of the clenches of almost being a stale stalemate position.</v>

3596
01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:15.650
<v Speaker 3>How do you score who get whoever can hold a plum clinch the longest live a</v>

3597
01:37:15.651 --> 01:37:16.520
<v Speaker 3>three's the last knee.</v>

3598
01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:20.240
<v Speaker 3>Say if you've got two guys try and 50 knees and the evening and even the unit,</v>

3599
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:22.090
<v Speaker 3>the one who scores the last needs score is that,</v>

3600
01:37:22.150 --> 01:37:22.490
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3601
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:23.323
<v Speaker 3>that rally.</v>

3602
01:37:23.450 --> 01:37:24.140
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

3603
01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:24.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3604
01:37:24.501 --> 01:37:26.180
<v Speaker 3>So you see that you can be there for 10 minutes,</v>

3605
01:37:26.181 --> 01:37:29.900
<v Speaker 3>nee nee nee nee nee nee trying to break each other and the referee goes stop.</v>

3606
01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:30.681
<v Speaker 3>And that he's one.</v>

3607
01:37:30.681 --> 01:37:31.310
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

3608
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:32.143
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3609
01:37:32.230 --> 01:37:33.860
<v Speaker 3>But what if a guy knocks a guy out with punches?</v>

3610
01:37:33.861 --> 01:37:34.694
<v Speaker 3>It says,</v>

3611
01:37:35.110 --> 01:37:38.780
<v Speaker 3>if it's an lockout then then you're winning boxes them up and the guy is still</v>

3612
01:37:38.781 --> 01:37:39.920
<v Speaker 3>standing after three rounds,</v>

3613
01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:44.480
<v Speaker 3>10 punches and one body keep the body kick will win every time.</v>

3614
01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:45.890
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3615
01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Unless you Raymond Deca and then be that there's a different story.</v>

3616
01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:50.930
<v Speaker 3>So they're really,</v>

3617
01:37:51.130 --> 01:37:54.110
<v Speaker 3>they're really must be into body kicks.</v>

3618
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:55.350
<v Speaker 3>Like to them,</v>

3619
01:37:55.351 --> 01:37:56.310
<v Speaker 3>that's the</v>

3620
01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:57.330
<v Speaker 4>most important kick.</v>

3621
01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:57.541
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3622
01:37:57.541 --> 01:37:57.910
<v Speaker 4>Your body.</v>

3623
01:37:57.910 --> 01:37:59.670
<v Speaker 4>Can you go to Thailand?</v>

3624
01:37:59.710 --> 01:38:03.090
<v Speaker 4>It's a completely different contrasts of what you see here in America or in</v>

3625
01:38:03.091 --> 01:38:03.924
<v Speaker 4>Australia.</v>

3626
01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:04.740
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3627
01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:07.800
<v Speaker 4>but it's so beautiful to watch two or what do you think about a guy like Simon?</v>

3628
01:38:07.801 --> 01:38:09.240
<v Speaker 4>Marcus is a really famous,</v>

3629
01:38:09.241 --> 01:38:09.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3630
01:38:09.570 --> 01:38:13.050
<v Speaker 4>like really high level Muy Thai fighter and then he fights for glory.</v>

3631
01:38:13.290 --> 01:38:14.670
<v Speaker 4>They take away that clench,</v>

3632
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:15.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3633
01:38:15.091 --> 01:38:18.300
<v Speaker 4>they take away like what percentage of his game do you think gets eliminated</v>

3634
01:38:18.301 --> 01:38:19.230
<v Speaker 4>when they take that away?</v>

3635
01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:21.780
<v Speaker 4>You have to get back into the gym and readjust as well.</v>

3636
01:38:21.781 --> 01:38:23.400
<v Speaker 4>Cause I had the same as me when I went to Kaitlin.</v>

3637
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.780
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3638
01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:25.380
<v Speaker 4>always thought of doing okay.</v>

3639
01:38:25.381 --> 01:38:25.700
<v Speaker 4>But it was,</v>

3640
01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:29.730
<v Speaker 4>I was losing it as well because I'd fight the Thai style and then I'd lose the</v>

3641
01:38:29.731 --> 01:38:31.380
<v Speaker 4>guys that are punching and it'd be like 30,</v>

3642
01:38:31.381 --> 01:38:32.340
<v Speaker 4>27 and it's quite,</v>

3643
01:38:32.341 --> 01:38:32.760
<v Speaker 4>hasn't hit me.</v>

3644
01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:33.120
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man,</v>

3645
01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:33.953
<v Speaker 4>I've kicked the shit out of him.</v>

3646
01:38:34.170 --> 01:38:34.530
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3647
01:38:34.530 --> 01:38:35.250
<v Speaker 4>And then I was lost.</v>

3648
01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:36.660
<v Speaker 4>What the hell man,</v>

3649
01:38:36.690 --> 01:38:37.411
<v Speaker 4>Nathan Corbett,</v>

3650
01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:39.420
<v Speaker 4>he also fought in glory.</v>

3651
01:38:39.421 --> 01:38:41.010
<v Speaker 4>He fought Tyrone Spong and again,</v>

3652
01:38:41.011 --> 01:38:42.760
<v Speaker 4>they take away your clan should take away.</v>

3653
01:38:42.761 --> 01:38:42.871
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3654
01:38:42.871 --> 01:38:44.130
<v Speaker 4>they'll be a lot of his weapons.</v>

3655
01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:45.670
<v Speaker 4>He's main thing is the elbow,</v>

3656
01:38:46.250 --> 01:38:47.020
<v Speaker 4>the elbow Kyla,</v>

3657
01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:49.110
<v Speaker 4>he's handling 55.</v>

3658
01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:49.430
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

3659
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:50.350
<v Speaker 4>probably 60 fights.</v>

3660
01:38:50.370 --> 01:38:55.320
<v Speaker 4>50 50 or 45 knockouts and then 30th third of them are by elbow and then all of a</v>

3661
01:38:55.321 --> 01:38:56.020
<v Speaker 4>sudden they take us.</v>

3662
01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:56.361
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3663
01:38:56.361 --> 01:38:57.290
<v Speaker 4>that's so crazy.</v>

3664
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:58.183
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3665
01:38:58.190 --> 01:38:58.710
<v Speaker 4>This guy,</v>

3666
01:38:58.710 --> 01:38:59.431
<v Speaker 4>Nathan Corbett,</v>

3667
01:38:59.431 --> 01:39:01.440
<v Speaker 4>you never heard anything bad motherfucker,</v>

3668
01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:04.020
<v Speaker 4>but he looked a little like a little,</v>

3669
01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:07.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean not out of his element because obviously he's fought that style before.</v>

3670
01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:10.860
<v Speaker 4>But you know when you watch him with the elbows and the clinch and everything</v>

3671
01:39:10.861 --> 01:39:11.160
<v Speaker 4>and you,</v>

3672
01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:12.120
<v Speaker 4>it was really comfortable.</v>

3673
01:39:12.121 --> 01:39:12.481
<v Speaker 4>It feels,</v>

3674
01:39:12.481 --> 01:39:17.300
<v Speaker 4>but it feels odd seeing that that aspect removed cause it's still standing up.</v>

3675
01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:18.121
<v Speaker 4>It's still striking.</v>

3676
01:39:18.121 --> 01:39:19.470
<v Speaker 4>Like why would they remove?</v>

3677
01:39:19.630 --> 01:39:20.940
<v Speaker 4>That's like saying no opera cuts.</v>

3678
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:21.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3679
01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:22.111
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

3680
01:39:22.111 --> 01:39:23.220
<v Speaker 4>No body punches.</v>

3681
01:39:23.221 --> 01:39:24.230
<v Speaker 4>You only punched a white guy.</v>

3682
01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:25.730
<v Speaker 4>If there was no body punching,</v>

3683
01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:27.330
<v Speaker 4>everybody would just come out like this.</v>

3684
01:39:27.570 --> 01:39:29.880
<v Speaker 4>You know like everybody would have like super high hands.</v>

3685
01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:31.260
<v Speaker 4>Nobody would ever worry about their body.</v>

3686
01:39:31.261 --> 01:39:34.740
<v Speaker 4>You'd have a totally different thing and then you will let in body punching and</v>

3687
01:39:34.741 --> 01:39:36.840
<v Speaker 4>some guy's gonna come over and rip a left hook to your liver.</v>

3688
01:39:36.841 --> 01:39:37.191
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

3689
01:39:37.191 --> 01:39:38.130
<v Speaker 4>Oh he wasn't ready for it.</v>

3690
01:39:38.131 --> 01:39:41.460
<v Speaker 4>He didn't know cause cause you don't allow them to do it and that's what you're</v>

3691
01:39:41.461 --> 01:39:45.210
<v Speaker 4>seeing with like glory and not allowing these guys to do like one of the best</v>

3692
01:39:45.211 --> 01:39:46.500
<v Speaker 4>aspects of striking.</v>

3693
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.390
<v Speaker 4>And then with [inaudible] in general too,</v>

3694
01:39:48.391 --> 01:39:50.880
<v Speaker 4>like this is so hard to find a full Moitai show these days,</v>

3695
01:39:50.881 --> 01:39:51.900
<v Speaker 4>like full toy,</v>

3696
01:39:51.901 --> 01:39:52.620
<v Speaker 4>like five rounds.</v>

3697
01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:53.340
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the guys are gone,</v>

3698
01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:54.900
<v Speaker 4>three threes now for the promotions.</v>

3699
01:39:55.230 --> 01:39:58.440
<v Speaker 4>And then I think their main concern is if I do an elbow fight,</v>

3700
01:39:58.470 --> 01:40:01.890
<v Speaker 4>I bring someone from Thailand or Australia to America and the fight last 30</v>

3701
01:40:01.891 --> 01:40:02.940
<v Speaker 4>seconds and the guy gets cut.</v>

3702
01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.120
<v Speaker 4>I've just wasted 10 grand on a plane tickets.</v>

3703
01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:06.530
<v Speaker 4>And I say,</v>

3704
01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:08.130
<v Speaker 4>I said it's one of the big concerns.</v>

3705
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:09.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man,</v>

3706
01:40:09.421 --> 01:40:10.141
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

3707
01:40:10.141 --> 01:40:11.490
<v Speaker 4>But still just it's,</v>

3708
01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:15.810
<v Speaker 4>I think if you're representing martial arts like on television,</v>

3709
01:40:15.811 --> 01:40:16.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean they can do whatever they want.</v>

3710
01:40:16.861 --> 01:40:18.420
<v Speaker 4>The Japanese had their ideas.</v>

3711
01:40:18.570 --> 01:40:22.020
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to keep the same ideas as the Japanese with glory.</v>

3712
01:40:22.021 --> 01:40:23.040
<v Speaker 4>I think they should go with,</v>

3713
01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:24.330
<v Speaker 4>that's why I like lion fight.</v>

3714
01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:25.470
<v Speaker 4>I really like what they're doing,</v>

3715
01:40:25.471 --> 01:40:25.681

3728
01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:38.611
<v Speaker 4>John,</v>

3729
01:40:38.611 --> 01:40:41.790
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about the multiple fights in a night?</v>

3730
01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:42.490
<v Speaker 4>Single night.</v>

3731
01:40:42.490 --> 01:40:42.670
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

3732
01:40:42.670 --> 01:40:43.411
<v Speaker 4>I used to do it.</v>

3733
01:40:43.411 --> 01:40:44.130
<v Speaker 4>You're a fan of it.</v>

3734
01:40:44.130 --> 01:40:45.150
<v Speaker 4>I've done a couple of them before.</v>

3735
01:40:45.151 --> 01:40:46.620
<v Speaker 4>I want a big one in Thailand.</v>

3736
01:40:46.650 --> 01:40:47.483
<v Speaker 4>In Bangkok.</v>

3737
01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:48.413
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3738
01:40:48.690 --> 01:40:49.830
<v Speaker 4>when I was younger I used to love him,</v>

3739
01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:50.310
<v Speaker 4>but now,</v>

3740
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:51.540
<v Speaker 4>now I'm a bit older and the body doesn't,</v>

3741
01:40:51.541 --> 01:40:53.970
<v Speaker 4>repairs is fast in the breaks</v>

3742
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:56.530
<v Speaker 3>anymore because when I was watching glory,</v>

3743
01:40:56.531 --> 01:40:59.920
<v Speaker 3>that's the main thing I was thinking about this guys who would have a battle</v>

3744
01:40:59.921 --> 01:41:03.640
<v Speaker 3>that first fight and have to back out and like Damn Joe Schilling.</v>

3745
01:41:03.641 --> 01:41:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Joe Schilling fought four rounds of Simon Marcus.</v>

3746
01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:07.450
<v Speaker 3>They go to the third round.</v>

3747
01:41:07.451 --> 01:41:08.111
<v Speaker 3>It's a draw.</v>

3748
01:41:08.111 --> 01:41:09.310
<v Speaker 3>They have to fight a fourth round.</v>

3749
01:41:09.311 --> 01:41:13.780
<v Speaker 3>He's got two fights after that knocks mark is out in the fourth fucking round.</v>

3750
01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Then he's got to fight Wayne Barrett and he's got to fight our Tim 11 and the</v>

3751
01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:19.780
<v Speaker 3>final fuck too much.</v>

3752
01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3753
01:41:19.970 --> 01:41:20.530
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>

3754
01:41:20.530 --> 01:41:21.050
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

3755
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:24.340
<v Speaker 3>Hud sees our Ferrara and Sam Alvey this a good fight.</v>

3756
01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:25.690
<v Speaker 3>The good fight.</v>

3757
01:41:25.690 --> 01:41:26.680
<v Speaker 3>What do you know about Alvey?</v>

3758
01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:29.320
<v Speaker 3>A Alvie was a contestant on,</v>

3759
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:31.720
<v Speaker 3>he was on a team Carwyn on the ultimate fighter.</v>

3760
01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:32.673
<v Speaker 3>And I gotta be honest,</v>

3761
01:41:33.010 --> 01:41:35.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm surprised the kids here now because when he was on the ultimate fighter,</v>

3762
01:41:35.681 --> 01:41:36.580
<v Speaker 3>I was a guest coach.</v>

3763
01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:38.153
<v Speaker 3>He would quit.</v>

3764
01:41:38.530 --> 01:41:40.060
<v Speaker 3>He quit all the time and I was real.</v>

3765
01:41:40.061 --> 01:41:40.990
<v Speaker 3>This kid doesn't have it.</v>

3766
01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:42.400
<v Speaker 3>He got his training,</v>

3767
01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:43.480
<v Speaker 3>he got injured,</v>

3768
01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:47.260
<v Speaker 3>and then he came back for a little bit and he was their first pick.</v>

3769
01:41:47.710 --> 01:41:49.090
<v Speaker 3>He was the very first picking.</v>

3770
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:50.680
<v Speaker 3>It did not work out on the show.</v>

3771
01:41:51.230 --> 01:41:51.610
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3772
01:41:51.610 --> 01:41:51.731
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

3773
01:41:51.731 --> 01:41:52.451
<v Speaker 3>The kid doesn't have it.</v>

3774
01:41:52.451 --> 01:41:52.650
<v Speaker 3>Soon.</v>

3775
01:41:52.650 --> 01:41:54.160
<v Speaker 3>Went to MFC in Canada,</v>

3776
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.730

01:41:54.730 --> 01:41:55.451
<v Speaker 3>did great there,</v>

3778
01:41:55.451 --> 01:41:57.010
<v Speaker 3>and then got back into the UFC.</v>

3779
01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.970
<v Speaker 3>He won his last fight against Tom Watson and now Caesar,</v>

3780
01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:00.813
<v Speaker 3>the guy he's fighting,</v>

3781
01:42:01.090 --> 01:42:01.451

<v Speaker 3>He's like little beat door.</v>

3788
01:42:06.401 --> 01:42:08.110
<v Speaker 3>So this guy's a freak.</v>

3789
01:42:08.111 --> 01:42:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Athletically.</v>

3790
01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:11.170
<v Speaker 3>He trained under Anderson Silva for two years.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He trained with Leo Machida and now he's Veit tours like pro DJ and he's such a</v>

01:42:16.541 --> 01:42:17.380
<v Speaker 3>good athlete man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3794
01:42:18.041 --> 01:42:19.730

3799
01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:23.720
<v Speaker 3>for the title,</v>

3800
01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:24.820
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate fighter Brazil.</v>

3801
01:42:25.250 --> 01:42:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Sergio.</v>

3802

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3803
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:26.290
<v Speaker 3>it was him.</v>

3804
01:42:26.290 --> 01:42:27.101
<v Speaker 3>He looks thinner.</v>

3805
01:42:27.101 --> 01:42:28.900
<v Speaker 3>He looks a lot thinner than he did in the ultimate fighter.</v>

3806
01:42:28.901 --> 01:42:30.080
<v Speaker 3>This guy and I said,</v>

3807
01:42:30.670 --> 01:42:30.911
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3808
01:42:30.911 --> 01:42:31.744
<v Speaker 3>we went down.</v>

3809
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:32.703
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>

3810
01:42:33.490 --> 01:42:33.971
<v Speaker 3>He's fighting one,</v>

3811
01:42:33.971 --> 01:42:34.111
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

3812

3814
01:42:37.630 --> 01:42:38.350
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

3815
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:39.183
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>

3816
01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3817

01:42:42.690 --> 01:42:43.523
<v Speaker 3>They go,</v>

3822
01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:45.280
<v Speaker 3>we've got to come up with something for them.</v>

3823

<v Speaker 3>he's on tits.</v>

3825
01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:48.460
<v Speaker 3>They're going to start throwing tens up.</v>

3826
01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:49.990
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

3827
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.711
<v Speaker 3>His fighting style.</v>

01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:52.571

3831
01:42:52.571 --> 01:42:54.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the ginger has a chance here.</v>

3832
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:55.420
<v Speaker 3>Big.</v>

3833
01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:56.530
<v Speaker 3>The ginger is tough though.</v>

3834
01:42:56.531 --> 01:42:59.380
<v Speaker 3>The man really sharp and his last couple of fights he beat Tom Watson.</v>

3835
01:42:59.381 --> 01:43:00.130
<v Speaker 3>You know Tom,</v>

3836
01:43:00.130 --> 01:43:03.790
<v Speaker 3>he did be Tom Watson on that different Amad though.</v>

3837
01:43:03.790 --> 01:43:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Caesar's a different animal.</v>

3843
01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:12.730
<v Speaker 3>Cesar is one of the best athletes in the UFC that I've seen more.</v>

3844
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:14.230
<v Speaker 3>I choked out crone.</v>

3845
01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.400
<v Speaker 3>It was like the first guy to beat him when he,</v>

3846
01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.120
<v Speaker 3>when he got his black belt.</v>

01:49:23.231 --> 01:49:25.210
<v Speaker 2>where she in peds is so controlled and then you know,</v>

01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:27.040
<v Speaker 2>you can place your Shin across.</v>

4106
01:49:27.041 --> 01:49:28.870
<v Speaker 2>You're going to go out fast and then last I can pull it.</v>

4107
01:49:29.210 --> 01:49:32.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like being a martial artist says how do that to pull a shot the just to let</v>

4108
01:49:32.351 --> 01:49:33.180

<v Speaker 2>no bruises.</v>

4114
01:49:38.891 --> 01:49:39.581
<v Speaker 2>You're not limping.</v>

4115
01:49:39.581 --> 01:49:40.450
<v Speaker 2>And then you're still friends.</v>

4116
01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:42.450
<v Speaker 2>Damn Dude,</v>

4117
01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:42.941
<v Speaker 2>I had to,</v>

4118
01:49:42.941 --> 01:49:43.631
<v Speaker 2>I feel like though,</v>

4119
01:49:43.631 --> 01:49:44.021
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

4120
01:49:44.021 --> 01:49:46.210
<v Speaker 2>when you up the pace in a real fight,</v>

4121
01:49:46.570 --> 01:49:46.901
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

4122
01:49:46.901 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 2>it isn't it hard</v>

4123
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:51.290
<v Speaker 4>to kind of make that adjustment because you're going so hot on the peds and,</v>

4124
01:49:51.291 --> 01:49:52.310
<v Speaker 4>and when I box spa,</v>

4125
01:49:52.311 --> 01:49:56.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting my workout because I'm trying to really hit my mate who I spoke with</v>

4126
01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:57.700
<v Speaker 4>regularly and um,</v>

4127
01:49:58.200 --> 01:49:58.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4128
01:49:58.630 --> 01:49:58.840
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

4129
01:49:58.840 --> 01:49:59.040
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

4130
01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:00.640
<v Speaker 4>and there's no hard feelings and when we box,</v>

4131
01:50:00.641 --> 01:50:01.330
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know,</v>

4132
01:50:01.330 --> 01:50:02.021
<v Speaker 4>just the Thai style,</v>

4133
01:50:02.021 --> 01:50:02.860
<v Speaker 4>it's just the way they do it.</v>

4134
01:50:02.861 --> 01:50:03.410
<v Speaker 4>And it's just you,</v>

4135
01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:04.660
<v Speaker 4>you don't say much on the pads and,</v>

4136
01:50:04.661 --> 01:50:07.810
<v Speaker 4>and the bag and then the clinching that you used to working with technique by</v>

4137
01:50:07.811 --> 01:50:09.370
<v Speaker 4>the time you get to the spine pot.</v>

4138
01:50:09.610 --> 01:50:10.443
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

4139
01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:11.830
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting man.</v>

4140
01:50:12.130 --> 01:50:14.860
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a smart strategy for someone who fights a lot too.</v>

4141
01:50:14.861 --> 01:50:16.930
<v Speaker 4>Cause the ties would fight pretty much every week.</v>

4142
01:50:17.250 --> 01:50:18.160
<v Speaker 4>And I've had longevity.</v>

4143
01:50:18.161 --> 01:50:18.990
<v Speaker 4>I have no injuries.</v>

4144
01:50:18.990 --> 01:50:20.140
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to get tougher.</v>

4145
01:50:20.141 --> 01:50:21.640
<v Speaker 4>You know how to spar and take kits.</v>

4146
01:50:21.641 --> 01:50:21.821
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4147
01:50:21.821 --> 01:50:23.260
<v Speaker 4>you're tough enough when you get to that level.</v>

4148
01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:25.150
<v Speaker 4>So it's just about repetition,</v>

4149
01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:26.113
<v Speaker 4>getting comfortable.</v>

4150
01:50:26.630 --> 01:50:27.790
<v Speaker 4>The erroneous assumption,</v>

4151
01:50:27.791 --> 01:50:28.031
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4152
01:50:28.031 --> 01:50:29.870
<v Speaker 4>They'd like fighting training hard.</v>

4153
01:50:29.871 --> 01:50:30.730
<v Speaker 4>He's going to make you tougher.</v>

4154
01:50:30.770 --> 01:50:31.120
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4155
01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:32.290
<v Speaker 4>you're at that level.</v>

4156
01:50:32.291 --> 01:50:33.520
<v Speaker 4>You're already pretty tough.</v>

4157
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:35.340
<v Speaker 4>We don't need the challenges that,</v>

4158
01:50:35.341 --> 01:50:36.670
<v Speaker 4>that train since then when they buy it,</v>

4159
01:50:36.671 --> 01:50:38.110
<v Speaker 4>they get pretty crazy and then,</v>

4160
01:50:38.290 --> 01:50:39.070
<v Speaker 4>but they think of it,</v>

4161
01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:41.080
<v Speaker 4>well if I get hit in the spring like this,</v>

4162
01:50:41.081 --> 01:50:41.560
<v Speaker 4>when I fight,</v>

4163
01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:42.790
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be new in the shock.</v>

4164
01:50:43.050 --> 01:50:43.990
<v Speaker 4>But the Dutch go harder.</v>

4165
01:50:43.991 --> 01:50:46.450
<v Speaker 4>The legs and the body and they kind of lay off the head a little bit.</v>

4166
01:50:46.451 --> 01:50:47.620
<v Speaker 4>And some camps,</v>

4167
01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:48.160
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

4168
01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:49.420
<v Speaker 4>And then like Mike's gym,</v>

4169
01:50:49.421 --> 01:50:51.000
<v Speaker 4>they're known for knocking each other out.</v>

4170
01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:51.790
<v Speaker 4>Jim Cole,</v>

4171
01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:52.840
<v Speaker 4>Mike's Jane Golden Glory,</v>

4172
01:50:52.841 --> 01:50:53.110
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4173
01:50:53.110 --> 01:50:53.651
<v Speaker 4>Golden Glory.</v>

4174
01:50:53.651 --> 01:50:54.490
<v Speaker 4>They knock each other out.</v>

4175
01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:55.513
<v Speaker 4>Not Bad.</v>

4176
01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:56.141
<v Speaker 4>Well there's,</v>

4177
01:50:56.141 --> 01:50:56.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4178
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:57.460
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with,</v>

4179
01:50:57.460 --> 01:50:59.890
<v Speaker 4>you got 18 murders in a room together.</v>

4180
01:51:00.290 --> 01:51:00.790
<v Speaker 4>All do.</v>

4181
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:01.810
<v Speaker 4>They're all padded out.</v>

4182
01:51:01.811 --> 01:51:03.580
<v Speaker 4>It just takes a little bit of education.</v>

4183
01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:04.560
<v Speaker 4>Like whoa,</v>

4184
01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:06.610
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to work on some of those dudes.</v>

4185
01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:08.830
<v Speaker 4>God just got here from Morocco.</v>

4186
01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:11.620
<v Speaker 4>Leader is if we don't play that game,</v>

4187
01:51:11.621 --> 01:51:12.020
<v Speaker 4>son.</v>

4188
01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:12.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4189
01:51:12.490 --> 01:51:13.870
<v Speaker 4>And then I'm running a family gym too.</v>

4190
01:51:13.871 --> 01:51:15.500
<v Speaker 4>So I want kids to come in.</v>

4191
01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:18.310
<v Speaker 4>I like the parents are watching on what and then the feel comfortable with,</v>

4192
01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:19.500
<v Speaker 4>I can walk away with it.</v>

4193
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:22.450
<v Speaker 4>The kids getting knocked out cause so when you have young kids spar,</v>

4194
01:51:22.451 --> 01:51:23.740
<v Speaker 4>when they first learned how to spar,</v>

4195
01:51:23.741 --> 01:51:24.550
<v Speaker 4>what do you,</v>

4196
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:27.560
<v Speaker 4>how do you emphasize like the playful aspect of it.</v>

4197
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:30.310
<v Speaker 4>They see us doing that and they just want to copy and I tell him to okay before</v>

4198
01:51:30.311 --> 01:51:30.701
<v Speaker 4>we start,</v>

4199
01:51:30.701 --> 01:51:34.420
<v Speaker 4>everyone's going 10 15% they're higher than 20% otherwise you can sit out and</v>

4200
01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:35.254
<v Speaker 4>not play.</v>

4201
01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:36.550
<v Speaker 4>And then um,</v>

4202
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:38.410
<v Speaker 4>and then I'll just keep keeping on him as well.</v>

4203
01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:41.710
<v Speaker 4>He just make sure he 10 15% no harder than 20% that's beautiful.</v>

4204
01:51:41.710 --> 01:51:43.000
<v Speaker 4>And then when they want to go hard,</v>

4205
01:51:43.001 --> 01:51:43.691
<v Speaker 4>you hit the bag,</v>

4206
01:51:43.691 --> 01:51:44.441
<v Speaker 4>you hit the pads.</v>

4207
01:51:44.441 --> 01:51:44.740
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4208
01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:45.071
<v Speaker 4>Your work,</v>

4209
01:51:45.071 --> 01:51:45.701
<v Speaker 4>your technique,</v>

4210
01:51:45.701 --> 01:51:47.410
<v Speaker 4>you understand your timing and your confidence.</v>

4211
01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:49.990
<v Speaker 4>And then he still looking at timing with aspiring to,</v>

4212
01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:51.190
<v Speaker 4>he's still for hundred fast.</v>

4213
01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:52.213
<v Speaker 4>These still,</v>

4214
01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:53.410
<v Speaker 4>you can again just go slow.</v>

4215
01:51:53.411 --> 01:51:55.530
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to name your shot so you're still a bit and then just said</v>

4216
01:51:55.531 --> 01:51:57.850
<v Speaker 4>you're laying on the ribs are their thought or even across their neck.</v>

4217
01:51:57.930 --> 01:52:00.460
<v Speaker 4>Just pull it back but just landed there and leave it there for a second.</v>

4218
01:52:00.490 --> 01:52:02.290
<v Speaker 4>Make sure everyone sees first and then take it down.</v>

4219
01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:04.810
<v Speaker 4>That's a smart way to do it.</v>

4220
01:52:04.811 --> 01:52:07.880
<v Speaker 4>But do you think they could do that with MMA because you're dealing with take</v>

4221
01:52:07.881 --> 01:52:10.870
<v Speaker 4>downs and you have to be really quick with your sprawl.</v>

4222
01:52:10.871 --> 01:52:14.140
<v Speaker 4>You have to be quick with the transitions between grappling and striking.</v>

4223
01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:15.720
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it's possible to do that too?</v>

4224
01:52:15.721 --> 01:52:17.980
<v Speaker 4>We were just still just pulling back on everything.</v>

4225
01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:18.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4226
01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:21.610
<v Speaker 4>I've got to work with George Saint Pierre for two weeks and then that's a weird</v>

4227
01:52:21.611 --> 01:52:22.090
<v Speaker 4>play.</v>

4228
01:52:22.090 --> 01:52:24.730
<v Speaker 4>We wouldn't go any higher than 30% maybe,</v>

4229
01:52:25.150 --> 01:52:25.781
<v Speaker 4>but we were just,</v>

4230
01:52:25.781 --> 01:52:26.200
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4231
01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:26.461
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4232
01:52:26.461 --> 01:52:28.060
<v Speaker 4>the whole time we've been than control</v>

4233
01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:30.550
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing,</v>

4234
01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:35.050
<v Speaker 4>remote control robot that had punches that had like balloons,</v>

4235
01:52:35.051 --> 01:52:37.440
<v Speaker 4>like when they land there was a balloon fucking and,</v>

4236
01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:40.810
<v Speaker 4>and you can really hit the what not seriously.</v>

4237
01:52:41.230 --> 01:52:42.370
<v Speaker 4>And you can hit this,</v>

4238
01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:43.330
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

4239
01:52:43.330 --> 01:52:45.070
<v Speaker 4>this robot is hard as you can.</v>

4240
01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:47.780
<v Speaker 4>So you're throwing hard punches and it's throwing legit.</v>

4241
01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:49.820
<v Speaker 4>It's legit.</v>

4242
01:52:49.821 --> 01:52:50.270
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4243
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:51.470
<v Speaker 4>not as legit as Megan right here,</v>

4244
01:52:51.471 --> 01:52:51.801
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

4245
01:52:51.801 --> 01:52:53.240
<v Speaker 4>But it's going to happen.</v>

4246
01:52:53.241 --> 01:52:56.470
<v Speaker 4>Probably some really good trainers.</v>

4247
01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:57.560
<v Speaker 4>The guy who controls it,</v>

4248
01:52:57.800 --> 01:52:58.460
<v Speaker 4>that would be like,</v>

4249
01:52:58.460 --> 01:52:59.630
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to be really good at it.</v>

4250
01:52:59.830 --> 01:53:00.620
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4251
01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:02.070
<v Speaker 4>video games to be a great child.</v>

4252
01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:05.540
<v Speaker 4>Like you could take someone who could never kick your ass,</v>

4253
01:53:05.541 --> 01:53:07.730
<v Speaker 4>but they get pilot a robot that can kick your ass.</v>

4254
01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:09.790
<v Speaker 4>So you'd go in there and have to do,</v>

4255
01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:13.280
<v Speaker 4>and then they would seek out to be guys with the best robots and the</v>

4256
01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:16.970
<v Speaker 4>robots way before they mfi robots.</v>

4257
01:53:17.370 --> 01:53:20.270
<v Speaker 4>There'll be sparring robots.</v>

4258
01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:20.791
<v Speaker 4>Think about it.</v>

4259
01:53:20.791 --> 01:53:21.381
<v Speaker 4>How cool would that,</v>

4260
01:53:21.381 --> 01:53:22.490
<v Speaker 4>isn't is the movie already</v>

4261
01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:25.881
<v Speaker 4>Jack?</v>

4262
01:53:25.881 --> 01:53:26.211
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

4263
01:53:26.211 --> 01:53:27.290
<v Speaker 4>They're sparring robot.</v>

4264
01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:27.491
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4265
01:53:27.491 --> 01:53:29.750
<v Speaker 4>they were giant robot each other.</v>

4266
01:53:29.751 --> 01:53:30.650
<v Speaker 4>They didn't fight people.</v>

4267
01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:33.760
<v Speaker 4>When you're talking about sparring robots,</v>

4268
01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:36.110
<v Speaker 4>keep it real and mixed martial arts for boxing,</v>

4269
01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:38.960
<v Speaker 4>for kickboxing up for the striking arts in general</v>

4270
01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:45.110
<v Speaker 4>coming out and what's going on with his facial hair.</v>

4271
01:53:45.870 --> 01:53:50.330
<v Speaker 4>I like it some this is that really his twin brother might be faking it is Edson</v>

4272
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:51.220
<v Speaker 4>face his face.</v>

4273
01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:52.011
<v Speaker 4>He looks so different.</v>

4274
01:53:52.011 --> 01:53:53.770
<v Speaker 4>I never seen him do look so different with a beer.</v>

4275
01:53:55.050 --> 01:53:56.030
<v Speaker 4>Harry looks first.</v>

4276
01:53:56.031 --> 01:53:58.870
<v Speaker 4>We'll kick Kao ever in MMA history Edson,</v>

4277
01:53:58.900 --> 01:53:59.201
<v Speaker 4>but well,</v>

4278
01:53:59.201 --> 01:54:03.920
<v Speaker 4>at least in UFC Johnson he started as a wrestler or was he,</v>

4279
01:54:03.921 --> 01:54:05.630
<v Speaker 4>if I kick her first wrestler first,</v>

4280
01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:08.420
<v Speaker 4>it was crazy about that cat knockout was,</v>

4281
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:13.000
<v Speaker 4>I kind of called it and I said that if he's the only way he's gonna he's gonna</v>

4282
01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:14.030
<v Speaker 4>have to take some risks,</v>

4283
01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:14.951
<v Speaker 4>but if it takes a rest,</v>

4284
01:54:14.951 --> 01:54:16.970
<v Speaker 4>he runs the risk of getting knocked out.</v>

4285
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.481
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4286
01:54:17.481 --> 01:54:18.830
<v Speaker 4>as I said out,</v>

4287
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:20.060
<v Speaker 4>he was out cold.</v>

4288
01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:21.710
<v Speaker 4>Like literally as I was saying,</v>

4289
01:54:21.711 --> 01:54:22.580
<v Speaker 4>knocked out.</v>

4290
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:23.511
<v Speaker 4>He's dead,</v>

4291
01:54:23.511 --> 01:54:25.970
<v Speaker 4>stiff flying through the air on his back.</v>

4292
01:54:25.971 --> 01:54:26.930
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy timing.</v>

4293
01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:30.530
<v Speaker 4>Crazy ridiculous timing to say that total dumb luck.</v>

4294
01:54:30.531 --> 01:54:31.980
<v Speaker 4>But what a wheel care.</v>

4295
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.230
<v Speaker 4>Who the fucks all of that coming.</v>

4296
01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:36.290
<v Speaker 4>Probably the best knockdown in UFC history right up there.</v>

4297
01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:36.621
<v Speaker 4>Cro,</v>

4298
01:54:36.621 --> 01:54:37.101
<v Speaker 4>cop,</v>

01:54:37.101 --> 01:54:39.330
<v Speaker 4>Gonzaga Pedis.</v>

4300
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:40.510
<v Speaker 4>Joe Lozan.</v>

4301
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:41.833

4303
01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:44.510
<v Speaker 4>that was fucking sensational head kick.</v>

4304
01:54:44.690 --> 01:54:46.760
<v Speaker 4>But I'm talking about Edson and Terry.</v>

4305
01:54:46.761 --> 01:54:47.080
<v Speaker 4>Adam,</v>

4306
01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.170
<v Speaker 4>just when Terry,</v>

4307
01:54:48.171 --> 01:54:49.004
<v Speaker 4>Adam was just,</v>

4308
01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:49.311
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh shit that's in killed the guy dead stiff.</v>

4310
01:54:52.250 --> 01:54:53.083
<v Speaker 4>I thought he killed her.</v>

4311
01:54:53.660 --> 01:54:55.820
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of cro cop Gonzaga.</v>

4312
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:56.421
<v Speaker 4>So crazy.</v>

4313
01:54:56.421 --> 01:54:58.370
<v Speaker 4>Cause no one thought Gonzaga would win that way.</v>

4314
01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:01.190
<v Speaker 4>How's Gonzaga gonna head kick cro cop.</v>

4315
01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:04.490
<v Speaker 4>He think of all the cro cop highlight reel head kicks.</v>

4316
01:55:04.491 --> 01:55:05.350
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck has guns?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

4320
01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:13.670
<v Speaker 4>He's fighting Gonzaga and Poland rematch.</v>

4321
01:55:13.730 --> 01:55:14.960
<v Speaker 4>He's back.</v>

01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:16.370
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

4325
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:20.180
<v Speaker 4>Because they were talking to him was Bella Bella toes talking.</v>

4326
01:55:20.181 --> 01:55:20.650
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4327
01:55:20.650 --> 01:55:22.520
<v Speaker 4>and the UFC said not so fast.</v>

4328
01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:23.931
<v Speaker 4>Not so fast.</v>

4329
01:55:23.931 --> 01:55:25.640
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe that relationship,</v>

4330
01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:27.880
<v Speaker 4>what's called copy talking about</v>

01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:34.730
<v Speaker 4>Rebelling.</v>

4335
01:55:34.730 --> 01:55:35.960
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus Christ came,</v>

4336
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.840
<v Speaker 4>he scared the shit.</v>

4337
01:55:37.730 --> 01:55:38.300
<v Speaker 4>I would like,</v>

4338
01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:38.511
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

4339
01:55:38.511 --> 01:55:38.701
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

4340
01:55:38.701 --> 01:55:39.171
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

4341
01:55:39.171 --> 01:55:39.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4342
01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:40.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4343
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:41.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm loyal to the UFC,</v>

4344
01:55:41.241 --> 01:55:43.760
<v Speaker 4>but I would not be angry if they sign fade or,</v>

4345
01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:44.603
<v Speaker 4>and Brock,</v>

4346
01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:47.880
<v Speaker 4>have they signed fado versus Brian Browse on Bellator.</v>

4347
01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:48.953
<v Speaker 4>That'd be,</v>

4348
01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:51.180
<v Speaker 4>I heard Bob talking about concussions though.</v>

4349
01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:51.661
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4350
01:55:51.661 --> 01:55:53.370
<v Speaker 4>he's talking about concussion supposedly.</v>

4351
01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:57.150
<v Speaker 4>But that's according to like the pro wrestling guys who knows what angle they're</v>

4352
01:55:57.151 --> 01:55:57.900
<v Speaker 4>plan.</v>

4353
01:55:57.900 --> 01:55:59.610
<v Speaker 4>You know those guys are always,</v>

4354
01:55:59.870 --> 01:56:03.510
<v Speaker 4>there's so much showmanship and craziness in the world of pro wrestling.</v>

4355
01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:05.010
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm starting to understand that better.</v>

4356
01:56:05.011 --> 01:56:08.700
<v Speaker 4>Being friends with Tony Hinchcliffe cause he fucking loves pro wrestling and he</v>

4357
01:56:08.701 --> 01:56:09.750
<v Speaker 4>never stops talking about it.</v>

4358
01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:13.950
<v Speaker 4>I kind of just tend like they play things out in advance like way in advance for</v>

4359
01:56:13.951 --> 01:56:16.740
<v Speaker 4>like long periods of times we'd have these timelines.</v>

4360
01:56:16.741 --> 01:56:19.200
<v Speaker 4>You storylines they follow like soap operas.</v>

4361
01:56:19.230 --> 01:56:19.531
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4362
01:56:19.531 --> 01:56:20.071
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

4363
01:56:20.071 --> 01:56:20.904
<v Speaker 4>So when he says,</v>

4364
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:22.050
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4365
01:56:22.050 --> 01:56:23.610
<v Speaker 4>Brock's worried about concussions,</v>

4366
01:56:23.730 --> 01:56:27.180
<v Speaker 4>they might have some crazy match that they're setting up.</v>

4367
01:56:27.181 --> 01:56:29.580
<v Speaker 4>We're Brock is scared to get hit in the head and they start talking,</v>

4368
01:56:29.581 --> 01:56:32.760
<v Speaker 4>he's scared to get hit in the head and they and Brock runs away like holding his</v>

4369
01:56:32.761 --> 01:56:33.594
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>

4370
01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:37.100
<v Speaker 4>You kept anything those guys don't scripted.</v>

4371
01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:38.200
<v Speaker 4>It's so weird to me</v>

4372
01:56:39.740 --> 01:56:40.980
<v Speaker 4>how grown men get into,</v>

4373
01:56:40.981 --> 01:56:41.880
<v Speaker 4>they get into it.</v>

4374
01:56:41.881 --> 01:56:42.210
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

4375
01:56:42.210 --> 01:56:45.610
<v Speaker 4>I dated a girl who was super into it and it's hard to take her serious tip.</v>

4376
01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:48.350
<v Speaker 4>It's off fee after you did it grow,</v>

4377
01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:54.090
<v Speaker 4>do you throw wheel kicks,</v>

4378
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:55.380
<v Speaker 4>jumping,</v>

4379
01:56:55.380 --> 01:56:55.681
<v Speaker 4>jumping,</v>

4380
01:56:55.681 --> 01:56:55.981
<v Speaker 4>spinning.</v>

4381
01:56:55.981 --> 01:56:56.814
<v Speaker 4>Becky's,</v>

4382
01:56:57.090 --> 01:57:01.570
<v Speaker 4>there's sort of like a look like I only if I'm running buddy,</v>

4383
01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:03.540
<v Speaker 4>it's an inside joke.</v>

4384
01:57:03.810 --> 01:57:04.643
<v Speaker 4>It's all right.</v>

4385
01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:05.640
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy inside.</v>

4386
01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:06.533
<v Speaker 4>If I'm winning</v>

4387
01:57:08.590 --> 01:57:10.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to lose sort of thing.</v>

4388
01:57:10.770 --> 01:57:12.240
<v Speaker 4>They're not throw it just for show for the fans.</v>

4389
01:57:12.241 --> 01:57:13.051
<v Speaker 4>But if not,</v>

4390
01:57:13.051 --> 01:57:13.861
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't throw it.</v>

4391
01:57:13.861 --> 01:57:14.700
<v Speaker 4>I make sure I'm running for this.</v>

4392
01:57:15.230 --> 01:57:15.720
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4393
01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:18.570
<v Speaker 4>So that's something if you're beating the guys asked you might throat like a</v>

4394
01:57:18.571 --> 01:57:19.111
<v Speaker 4>slam dunk.</v>

4395
01:57:19.111 --> 01:57:22.560
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't only do it if you know that you can easier to pull off like stuff</v>

4396
01:57:22.561 --> 01:57:25.860
<v Speaker 4>like wheel kicks when you're adding and all the other shit like take downs and</v>

4397
01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:27.570
<v Speaker 4>all the other things like so it makes,</v>

4398
01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:30.330
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's so many variables then maybe get it off.</v>

4399
01:57:30.330 --> 01:57:33.390
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like if you're fighting and Moyie Thai and he got all the,</v>

4400
01:57:33.391 --> 01:57:36.960
<v Speaker 4>the leg kicks and all the things you could do much quicker and faster to land,</v>

4401
01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:39.270
<v Speaker 4>but it's like less high percentage that way.</v>

4402
01:57:39.370 --> 01:57:39.571
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

4403
01:57:39.571 --> 01:57:41.820
<v Speaker 4>the main train is just trying to stay away from him.</v>

4404
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:43.200
<v Speaker 4>That ties would never do it.</v>

4405
01:57:44.090 --> 01:57:44.640
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

4406
01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:44.881
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4407
01:57:44.881 --> 01:57:46.020
<v Speaker 4>they never throw wheel kit.</v>

4408
01:57:46.830 --> 01:57:47.663
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

4409
01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:51.240
<v Speaker 4>they Manson Gibson used to throw them right back in the day.</v>

4410
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:55.050
<v Speaker 4>That mother fucker out of vicious we'll kick but maybe they didn't throw him</v>

4411
01:57:55.051 --> 01:57:55.884
<v Speaker 4>because uh,</v>

4412
01:57:56.130 --> 01:57:59.310
<v Speaker 4>just because they didn't throw him doesn't mean they can't be really effective.</v>

4413
01:57:59.311 --> 01:57:59.610
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4414
01:57:59.610 --> 01:58:02.870
<v Speaker 4>I came from that background and then we used to do them all the time and turn it</v>

4415
01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:03.800
<v Speaker 4>back when I was like 11,</v>

4416
01:58:03.810 --> 01:58:06.840
<v Speaker 4>12 and then I want to got to keep books and they said,</v>

4417
01:58:06.841 --> 01:58:07.240
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4418
01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:08.910
<v Speaker 4>this ain't throwing any of these spinning kicks anymore.</v>

4419
01:58:08.910 --> 01:58:09.511
<v Speaker 4>It's too dangerous.</v>

4420
01:58:09.511 --> 01:58:11.440
<v Speaker 4>You got to stay front of him the whole time and keep it,</v>

4421
01:58:11.550 --> 01:58:13.080
<v Speaker 4>keep it basic and Rancic front.</v>

4422
01:58:13.130 --> 01:58:15.420
<v Speaker 4>People getting knocked out when they started spinning.</v>

4423
01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:15.811
<v Speaker 4>Is that what,</v>

4424
01:58:15.811 --> 01:58:16.260
<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>

4425
01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:16.551
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4426
01:58:16.551 --> 01:58:17.371
<v Speaker 4>What did you see?</v>

4427
01:58:17.371 --> 01:58:17.610
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4428
01:58:17.610 --> 01:58:19.160

<v Speaker 3>unorthodox tie guys.</v>

4533
02:00:59.831 --> 02:01:03.610
<v Speaker 3>A few of them that are throwing a lot of spinning crazy kicks that are not</v>

4534
02:01:03.611 --> 02:01:04.120
<v Speaker 3>traditional.</v>

4535
02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:04.750
<v Speaker 3>It was a guy called,</v>

4536
02:01:04.750 --> 02:01:05.583
<v Speaker 3>some of that comes in.</v>

4537
02:01:05.890 --> 02:01:08.890
<v Speaker 3>He went in the first ever gold medal in the Olympics for boxing.</v>

4538
02:01:09.190 --> 02:01:10.120
<v Speaker 3>And before he went to boxing,</v>

4539
02:01:10.121 --> 02:01:12.640
<v Speaker 3>he was a boy and he was a spinner.</v>

4540
02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:13.371
<v Speaker 3>He'd spin the oboe.</v>

4541
02:01:13.371 --> 02:01:13.901
<v Speaker 3>He's been back.</v>

4542
02:01:13.901 --> 02:01:14.950
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't a very successful,</v>

4543
02:01:14.980 --> 02:01:16.600
<v Speaker 3>he was assessed with the back elbows,</v>

4544
02:01:16.601 --> 02:01:17.020
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>

4545
02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:18.550
<v Speaker 3>the backings of the ties was him coming.</v>

4546
02:01:18.990 --> 02:01:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Just didn't keep them in the bomb and push him over and teach them in the bum.</v>

4547
02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4548
02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:22.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4549
02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:23.393
<v Speaker 3>Frankie.</v>

4550
02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:24.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4551
02:01:24.130 --> 02:01:26.300
<v Speaker 3>It just takes too long and just spin.</v>

4552
02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Spin is just,</v>

4553
02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:28.670
<v Speaker 3>you just see it common.</v>

4554
02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:28.961
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

4555
02:01:28.961 --> 02:01:29.300
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

4556
02:01:29.300 --> 02:01:30.130
<v Speaker 3>you got to spend.</v>

4557
02:01:30.130 --> 02:01:31.930
<v Speaker 3>He was hands on how fast it wasn't.</v>

4558
02:01:31.931 --> 02:01:33.990
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like a proper taekwondo in Spain.</v>

4559
02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:35.110
<v Speaker 3>It was a tight spin.</v>

4560
02:01:35.111 --> 02:01:36.670
<v Speaker 3>So is there a big difference?</v>

4561
02:01:36.730 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 3>A lot of taekwondo spins or were used as defense as are coming into</v>

4562
02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:42.033
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

4563
02:01:43.150 --> 02:01:44.900
<v Speaker 1>your spin on Youtube and yours is insane.</v>

4564
02:01:44.901 --> 02:01:45.591
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

4565
02:01:45.591 --> 02:01:47.150
<v Speaker 1>yours would be a lot different to the ties,</v>

4566
02:01:47.210 --> 02:01:48.320
<v Speaker 1>but if you saw Brian's,</v>

4567
02:01:48.321 --> 02:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>you would agree with the ties.</v>

4568
02:01:49.730 --> 02:01:51.800
<v Speaker 1>I was just saying that shit ain't going to work.</v>

4569
02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4570
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:56.690
<v Speaker 1>don't do that shit because on youtube you guys and I was wearing a wig.</v>

4571
02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to that style dude.</v>

4572
02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:01.250
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing a lot of guys do.</v>

4573
02:02:01.251 --> 02:02:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Is that at that point styles?</v>

4574
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:03.240
<v Speaker 1>No power to it.</v>

4575
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:04.103
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

4576
02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:06.080
<v Speaker 1>So loose.</v>

4577
02:02:06.450 --> 02:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

4578
02:02:06.750 --> 02:02:08.390
<v Speaker 1>my nickname in MMA,</v>

4579
02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:11.520
<v Speaker 1>they called me butter guys like him away.</v>

4580
02:02:11.570 --> 02:02:16.570
<v Speaker 1>He hits the bag and he falls away from it like of the bag.</v>

4581
02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Faint forces his body away.</v>

4582
02:02:19.850 --> 02:02:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I pulled my route balance,</v>

4583
02:02:21.021 --> 02:02:21.711
<v Speaker 1>same inbox in,</v>

4584
02:02:21.711 --> 02:02:23.810
<v Speaker 1>they'll right love those Olympic guys who are gold medalists,</v>

4585
02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:25.400
<v Speaker 1>they don't translate to the,</v>

4586
02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:29.540
<v Speaker 1>to the pros because they have a kind of a point scoring system and these pros</v>

4587
02:02:29.541 --> 02:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>are knocking mother.</v>

4588
02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:33.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to do to all about hitting the bag when it comes to kicking,</v>

4589
02:02:33.891 --> 02:02:35.090
<v Speaker 1>it's all about hitting the bag.</v>

4590
02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:38.330
<v Speaker 1>All those karate guys that you see throwing kicks in the air and they never</v>

4591
02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:39.173
<v Speaker 1>heard anything.</v>

4592
02:02:39.380 --> 02:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>They never developed the,</v>

4593
02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:42.200
<v Speaker 1>the ability to shift your weight.</v>

4594
02:02:42.230 --> 02:02:42.740
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

4595
02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:44.930
<v Speaker 1>you know when he's throwing a punch and you like,</v>

4596
02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:47.510
<v Speaker 1>you know at the end of that punch,</v>

4597
02:02:47.511 --> 02:02:48.170
<v Speaker 1>you fucking,</v>

4598
02:02:48.170 --> 02:02:49.790
<v Speaker 1>you're hitting things all the time.</v>

4599
02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:50.833
<v Speaker 1>You're hitting me,</v>

4600
02:02:51.110 --> 02:02:52.130
<v Speaker 1>you're hitting the bag.</v>

4601
02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:53.540
<v Speaker 1>These guys are throwing kicks.</v>

4602
02:02:53.541 --> 02:02:54.680
<v Speaker 1>They're not hitting anything.</v>

4603
02:02:54.890 --> 02:02:58.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the number one problem with a lot of these traditional martial artists.</v>

4604
02:02:58.610 --> 02:02:59.180
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

4605
02:02:59.180 --> 02:03:00.260
<v Speaker 1>they don't hit things.</v>

4606
02:03:00.261 --> 02:03:00.560
<v Speaker 1>You man,</v>

4607
02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:01.560
<v Speaker 1>why he appointed me Bro.</v>

4608
02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I had him kicked my bag and I lived.</v>

4609
02:03:06.330 --> 02:03:07.163
<v Speaker 1>I almost,</v>

4610
02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:08.053
<v Speaker 1>I almost cried.</v>

4611
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:09.201
<v Speaker 1>I fell over.</v>

4612
02:03:09.201 --> 02:03:10.034
<v Speaker 1>I fainted.</v>

4613
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:11.600
<v Speaker 1>I shut down.</v>

4614
02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:13.100
<v Speaker 1>He's not allowed in there anymore,</v>

4615
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:15.650
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't grow up kicking things.</v>

4616
02:03:15.651 --> 02:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

4617
02:03:16.150 --> 02:03:19.700
<v Speaker 1>He grew up in a terrible taekwondo school that had him like throwing flippy</v>

4618
02:03:19.701 --> 02:03:20.534
<v Speaker 1>things in the air.</v>

4619
02:03:23.530 --> 02:03:24.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not range a statement.</v>

4620
02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:25.511
<v Speaker 1>Tell Him Brian.</v>

4621
02:03:25.511 --> 02:03:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I never saw him compete.</v>

4622
02:03:26.990 --> 02:03:27.823
<v Speaker 1>I was competing.</v>

4623
02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:30.500
<v Speaker 1>I have to find my library of video.</v>

4624
02:03:31.060 --> 02:03:32.810
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you all my trophies.</v>

4625
02:03:34.110 --> 02:03:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Well actually Chitchat.</v>

4626

<v Speaker 1>Keep.</v>

4627
02:03:35.451 --> 02:03:36.830
<v Speaker 1>I gave my truck to Chairman</v>

4628
02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:39.933
<v Speaker 1>Mao,</v>

4629

4632
02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.640
<v Speaker 1>we were probably in the same wing classes,</v>

4633
02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:48.650
<v Speaker 1>which is so confusing.</v>

4634
02:03:48.651 --> 02:03:50.150
<v Speaker 1>I traveled all over the world.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Cause I was fun.</v>

4640

<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

4684
02:05:05.821 --> 02:05:07.220
<v Speaker 1>this reminds me of the ways to find tech,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think he's lost.</v>

4716
02:05:47.610 --> 02:05:48.800
<v Speaker 1>He beat Pete.</v>

4717
02:05:48.850 --> 02:05:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Tony.</v>

4718
02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:50.290
<v Speaker 1>He broke Tony's on.</v>

4719
02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:50.930
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

4720
02:05:50.930 --> 02:05:51.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4721
02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:52.250
<v Speaker 1>he checked the kick,</v>

4722
02:05:52.330 --> 02:05:55.650
<v Speaker 1>broke his forum for over a year.</v>

4723
02:05:56.010 --> 02:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he'll write the steel plate.</v>

4724
02:05:58.131 --> 02:05:58.330
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

4725
02:05:58.330 --> 02:05:59.260
<v Speaker 1>he had a lot of problems with this.</v>

4726
02:05:59.270 --> 02:06:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Put a steel plate in it.</v>

4727
02:06:00.330 --> 02:06:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4728
02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:01.381
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of problems.</v>

4729
02:06:01.381 --> 02:06:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Did he have the plate removed or a d keep it in there?</v>

4730
02:06:03.721 --> 02:06:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on with that,</v>

4731
02:06:04.891 --> 02:06:07.680
<v Speaker 1>but he's back 100% more ferocious than ever.</v>

4732
02:06:07.730 --> 02:06:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Our boats was mainly more,</v>

4733
02:06:10.610 --> 02:06:11.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4734
02:06:11.010 --> 02:06:13.260
<v Speaker 1>that's a great reason against Tony Ferguson.</v>

4735
02:06:13.261 --> 02:06:14.094
<v Speaker 1>That's a great fine.</v>

4736
02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:14.971
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4737
02:06:14.971 --> 02:06:16.770
<v Speaker 1>That is great to be crazy.</v>

4738
02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:17.611
<v Speaker 1>Tony's train,</v>

4739
02:06:17.611 --> 02:06:18.660
<v Speaker 1>so goddamn hard.</v>

4740
02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Of course he is.</v>

4741
02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:20.310
<v Speaker 1>He's an animal.</v>

4742
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:21.001
<v Speaker 1>I really loved that.</v>

4743
02:06:21.001 --> 02:06:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Able to Hilo fight,</v>

4744
02:06:21.901 --> 02:06:23.210
<v Speaker 1>that was a strong fight for him,</v>

4745
02:06:23.211 --> 02:06:23.431
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4746
02:06:23.431 --> 02:06:24.780
<v Speaker 1>It really showed us closure.</v>

4747
02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Tamp.</v>

4748
02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Michael Johnson's got some fast fucking hands.</v>

4749
02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:29.570
<v Speaker 1>He's really pressuring him,</v>

4750
02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:29.761
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4751
02:06:29.761 --> 02:06:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so smart.</v>

4752
02:06:30.691 --> 02:06:32.250
<v Speaker 1>But the pace man for three rounds,</v>

4753
02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:36.330
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy that in my opinion has come up the most striking wise since he</v>

4754
02:06:36.331 --> 02:06:37.470
<v Speaker 1>joined the black zillions.</v>

4755
02:06:37.710 --> 02:06:39.450
<v Speaker 1>If you watch him from the ultimate fighter though,</v>

4756
02:06:39.451 --> 02:06:40.500
<v Speaker 1>the Michael Johnson,</v>

4757
02:06:40.501 --> 02:06:42.600
<v Speaker 1>you see tag up Joe Lowe's on,</v>

4758
02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:44.790
<v Speaker 1>he's just a different striker now.</v>

4759
02:06:44.850 --> 02:06:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

4760
02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:46.073
<v Speaker 1>Hit him or Mitro.</v>

4761
02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:47.653
<v Speaker 1>Barboza</v>

4762
02:06:50.250 --> 02:06:50.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4763
02:06:50.660 --> 02:06:52.490
<v Speaker 1>I'd say Johnson or mitre and with the black tea,</v>

4764
02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:53.370
<v Speaker 1>the trail.</v>

4765
02:06:53.370 --> 02:06:54.630
<v Speaker 1>And it's come a long way as well.</v>

4766
02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:57.540
<v Speaker 1>They have some rumble Johnson.</v>

4767
02:06:57.600 --> 02:06:58.021
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

4768
02:06:58.021 --> 02:06:58.350

4770
02:06:59.281 --> 02:06:59.971
<v Speaker 1>What are we talking about?</v>

4771
02:06:59.971 --> 02:07:01.830

02:07:06.001 --> 02:07:07.800
<v Speaker 1>That right hook tagged him on a tempo.</v>

4777
02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:09.230
<v Speaker 1>He might be hurt.</v>

4778

02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:21.670
<v Speaker 2>He's got that shit.</v>

4861
02:09:21.670 --> 02:09:22.870
<v Speaker 2>He's also his movement,</v>

4862
02:09:22.871 --> 02:09:25.730
<v Speaker 2>his liquor and a finish you in a sec.</v>

4863
02:09:25.731 --> 02:09:29.680
<v Speaker 2>He's fluid and he's a perfect example of a guy who learned taekwondo first and</v>

4864
02:09:29.681 --> 02:09:34.681
<v Speaker 2>then went to a guy like Duke Roufus who just is a Moitai encyclopedia who's also</v>

4865
02:09:34.841 --> 02:09:38.560
<v Speaker 2>been training MMA fighters for a long fucking time and knows how to put it on</v>

4866
02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:40.180
<v Speaker 2>his hand on cm punk.</v>

4867
02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:47.200
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard some of the people,</v>

4868
02:09:47.950 --> 02:09:48.701
<v Speaker 2>some of those fighters?</v>

4869
02:09:48.701 --> 02:09:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

4870
02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:49.241
<v Speaker 2>Kelly,</v>

4871
02:09:49.241 --> 02:09:50.074
<v Speaker 2>could you beat?</v>

4872
02:09:50.670 --> 02:09:53.980
<v Speaker 2>They still haven't decided who they're going to give them the timeline either.</v>

4873
02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:55.330
<v Speaker 2>I figured it out.</v>

4874
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:57.010
<v Speaker 2>He wants a timeline.</v>

4875
02:09:57.011 --> 02:09:59.500
<v Speaker 2>I think he wants her to learn how to work really smart,</v>

4876
02:09:59.560 --> 02:09:59.891
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4877
02:09:59.891 --> 02:10:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I think what he's doing is the right way to do it.</v>

4878
02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:02.591
<v Speaker 2>Officially,</v>

4879
02:10:02.591 --> 02:10:03.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

4880
02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:06.790
<v Speaker 2>He's training with Duke until he's ready to compete and he's saying,</v>

4881
02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about shit until just trying to,</v>

4882
02:10:08.770 --> 02:10:13.510
<v Speaker 2>that could be a couple of years I think be after you get a couple of years.</v>

4883
02:10:13.540 --> 02:10:13.721
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4884
02:10:13.721 --> 02:10:13.981
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>

4885
02:10:13.981 --> 02:10:14.501
<v Speaker 2>He's not like,</v>

4886
02:10:14.501 --> 02:10:14.711
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4887
02:10:14.711 --> 02:10:16.240
<v Speaker 2>let's sign you and you'll fight in three years.</v>

4888
02:10:16.510 --> 02:10:17.980
<v Speaker 2>No son giving him six months.</v>

4889
02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:18.511
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

4890
02:10:18.511 --> 02:10:19.344
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

4891
02:10:20.410 --> 02:10:21.370
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a timeline.</v>

4892
02:10:22.030 --> 02:10:22.170
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

4893
02:10:22.170 --> 02:10:22.631
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>

4894
02:10:22.631 --> 02:10:24.880
<v Speaker 2>he said he wants to make a big deal out of it.</v>

4895
02:10:24.881 --> 02:10:25.151
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4896
02:10:25.151 --> 02:10:29.590
<v Speaker 2>they did this little announcement and he said he wants to train until he's</v>

4897
02:10:29.591 --> 02:10:30.250
<v Speaker 2>ready.</v>

4898
02:10:30.250 --> 02:10:31.210
<v Speaker 2>That's not three years.</v>

4899
02:10:31.390 --> 02:10:33.620
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you the UFC is gonna be three years.</v>

4900
02:10:33.621 --> 02:10:34.454
<v Speaker 2>Do what?</v>

02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:36.441
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

02:10:36.441 --> 02:10:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Eric Soda.</v>

4904
02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:38.173
<v Speaker 1>Rashad Evans.</v>

4905
02:10:39.170 --> 02:10:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's not,</v>

4906
02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:44.930
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's an a month going Paris,</v>

4907
02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong with a real name.</v>

4908
02:10:46.311 --> 02:10:47.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean a guy with no long time.</v>

4909
02:10:47.871 --> 02:10:48.021
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4910
02:10:48.021 --> 02:10:51.020
<v Speaker 1>they're going to pair a cm punk up with a guy who should never be in the UFC.</v>

4911
02:10:52.190 --> 02:10:52.551
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

4912
02:10:52.551 --> 02:10:53.750
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be in the UFC.</v>

4913
02:10:53.751 --> 02:10:55.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean it shouldn't be in the UFC yet.</v>

4914
02:10:55.310 --> 02:10:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I bet you know the guy with like one.</v>

4915
02:10:56.960 --> 02:10:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh you think?</v>

4916
02:10:58.430 --> 02:11:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I bet they give him like a old washed up guy who's been in the UFC,</v>

4917
02:11:01.161 --> 02:11:02.820
<v Speaker 1>so we recognize the navy out of bed.</v>

4918
02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Everything owned right now.</v>

4919
02:11:03.951 --> 02:11:06.290
<v Speaker 1>And it was in the cm punk versus fallen Fox.</v>

4920
02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:07.183
<v Speaker 1>Who would you bet on?</v>

4921
02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Everything you own right now?</v>

4922
02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Sam punk over Fallen Fox.</v>

4923
02:11:13.041 --> 02:11:13.874
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4924
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Destroying class.</v>

4925
02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4926
02:11:15.590 --> 02:11:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4927
02:11:16.150 --> 02:11:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4928
02:11:16.590 --> 02:11:16.761
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4929
02:11:16.761 --> 02:11:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4930
02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I would've picked a Sam punk too.</v>

4931
02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:21.831
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

4932
02:11:21.831 --> 02:11:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Michael Johnson is still going hard in this second round.</v>

4933
02:11:23.821 --> 02:11:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Two massive man,</v>

4934
02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:25.161
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4935
02:11:25.161 --> 02:11:25.994
<v Speaker 1>He looks good.</v>

4936
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4937
02:11:26.541 --> 02:11:26.871
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>

4938
02:11:26.871 --> 02:11:28.850
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have a strategic approach to this fight at all.</v>

4939
02:11:28.851 --> 02:11:30.800
<v Speaker 1>He's just trying to test Barboza.</v>

4940
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:32.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it's smart man.</v>

4941
02:11:32.091 --> 02:11:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Trying to break his will.</v>

4942
02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:34.780
<v Speaker 1>I like it and he's,</v>

4943
02:11:34.850 --> 02:11:35.710
<v Speaker 1>he's already kept it.</v>

4944
02:11:35.711 --> 02:11:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Light kicks away because Barboza has been real careful about those counters.</v>

4945
02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:42.980
<v Speaker 1>He's hesitant landing nearly as many leg kicks is.</v>

4946
02:11:42.981 --> 02:11:46.670
<v Speaker 1>He has some really smart man and a South Pole to south park too.</v>

4947
02:11:48.230 --> 02:11:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Do you like when when you see south paws and MMA and it opens up that inside leg</v>

4948
02:11:52.521 --> 02:11:52.880
<v Speaker 1>kick?</v>

4949
02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:53.713
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4950
02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:54.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4951
02:11:54.381 --> 02:11:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Got to stay really basic when you're putting this up.</v>

4952
02:11:56.021 --> 02:11:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

4953
02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:57.021
<v Speaker 1>he's right.</v>

4954
02:11:57.021 --> 02:11:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Kicks in the right hands,</v>

4955
02:11:57.921 --> 02:11:58.754
<v Speaker 1>right hand left hooks.</v>

4956
02:11:59.150 --> 02:12:01.330
<v Speaker 1>You can't do the flashy stuff against says [inaudible].</v>

4957
02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:06.300
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work really I believe saying no one you have of the Orthodox fighting</v>

4958
02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:08.550
<v Speaker 1>the south part opens up the back leg power kicked.</v>

4959
02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:08.871
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>

4960
02:12:08.871 --> 02:12:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Because it's that soft side.</v>

4961
02:12:10.101 --> 02:12:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4962
02:12:10.570 --> 02:12:11.480
<v Speaker 1>set it to the back.</v>

4963
02:12:11.870 --> 02:12:12.380
<v Speaker 1>But you can't,</v>

4964
02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:13.230
<v Speaker 1>you can't rely on you.</v>

4965
02:12:13.231 --> 02:12:13.621
<v Speaker 1>Sweet.</v>

4966
02:12:13.621 --> 02:12:15.350
<v Speaker 1>You can't use your front teeth as much anymore.</v>

4967
02:12:15.810 --> 02:12:17.050
<v Speaker 1>It's taken away a little weapons.</v>

4968
02:12:17.110 --> 02:12:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Who good body kick capture most body.</v>

4969
02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Why can't do damn he heard him with that left hand.</v>

4970
02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you use the uh,</v>

4971
02:12:22.730 --> 02:12:23.880
<v Speaker 1>the front teeth this month?</v>

4972
02:12:24.710 --> 02:12:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4973
02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:26.811
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

4974
02:12:26.811 --> 02:12:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Sitting down those punches that was taking the shine nasty.</v>

4975
02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh Damn.</v>

4976
02:12:31.311 --> 02:12:32.420
<v Speaker 1>That was a quick switch.</v>

4977
02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:36.740
<v Speaker 1>If Johnson slows down Barboza and start letting loose and letting loose of those</v>

4978
02:12:36.741 --> 02:12:38.510
<v Speaker 1>kicks because he good late in the fight.</v>

4979
02:12:38.700 --> 02:12:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Proposer Cardio.</v>

4980
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:44.450
<v Speaker 1>It's better be better of Cardio Frankie Edgar and for the record,</v>

4981
02:12:44.451 --> 02:12:48.980
<v Speaker 1>cm punk would kick my motherfucking line had fallen thought if it went to the</v>

4982
02:12:48.981 --> 02:12:49.814
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>

4983
02:12:49.890 --> 02:12:52.430
<v Speaker 1>don't get twist and I don't know that there's punches involved.</v>

4984
02:12:52.431 --> 02:12:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Anything can happen and we are the on the record.</v>

4985
02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Cm punk would fuck me up and he's got way bigger balls than me for stepping in</v>

4986
02:12:58.341 --> 02:12:58.671
<v Speaker 1>the cage.</v>

4987
02:12:58.671 --> 02:12:59.360
<v Speaker 1>If it's what I did.</v>

4988
02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I was just doing jokes on stage.</v>

4989
02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Big Guy.</v>

4990
02:13:02.610 --> 02:13:04.500

02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Slash.</v>

4999
02:13:08.450 --> 02:13:09.560

<v Speaker 2>not leaning as much.</v>

5066
02:14:23.981 --> 02:14:24.641
<v Speaker 2>If you keep leaning,</v>

5067
02:14:24.641 --> 02:14:25.180
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you,</v>

5073
02:14:28.541 --> 02:14:29.150
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as you start,</v>

5074
02:14:29.150 --> 02:14:30.780
<v Speaker 2>lose the confidence gives you care.</v>

5075
02:14:30.781 --> 02:14:32.140
<v Speaker 2>As soon as she was just not missing anything.</v>

5076
02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:32.711
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

5077
02:14:32.711 --> 02:14:33.544
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired.</v>

5078
02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:36.250
<v Speaker 2>But why Atlanta every time you rock him too.</v>

5079
02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:37.313
<v Speaker 2>It's a purple belt.</v>

5080
02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:40.660
<v Speaker 2>Really pro Bono Jujitsu.</v>

5081
02:14:41.690 --> 02:14:44.590
<v Speaker 2>He works with Ricardo Almeida down there in New Jersey.</v>

5082
02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:51.340
<v Speaker 2>He's looking for that cake man who set up that head kicks.</v>

5083
02:14:55.950 --> 02:14:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dang.</v>

5084
02:14:57.181 --> 02:14:58.710
<v Speaker 2>Johnson's just common man.</v>

5085
02:14:59.220 --> 02:15:00.960
<v Speaker 2>Johnson's wearing the same John,</v>

5086
02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:01.960
<v Speaker 2>how come you,</v>

5087
02:15:01.961 --> 02:15:06.360
<v Speaker 2>you never saw Superman is oh damn.</v>

5088
02:15:06.361 --> 02:15:08.160
<v Speaker 2>That was a nice right hand too.</v>

5089
02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:11.250
<v Speaker 2>How come he never saw superman punches in Moitai very,</v>

5090
02:15:11.251 --> 02:15:12.084
<v Speaker 2>very rarely.</v>

5091
02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:13.680
<v Speaker 2>But you see it so much in MMA.</v>

5092
02:15:13.681 --> 02:15:14.191
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

5093
02:15:14.191 --> 02:15:15.060
<v Speaker 2>I think the little gloves,</v>

5094
02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:16.830
<v Speaker 2>the little gloves make a hell of a difference.</v>

5095
02:15:17.250 --> 02:15:17.521
<v Speaker 2>Even,</v>

5096
02:15:17.521 --> 02:15:18.240
<v Speaker 2>even George,</v>

5097
02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:19.150
<v Speaker 2>when George Tourism,</v>

5098
02:15:19.190 --> 02:15:20.460
<v Speaker 2>they seems the rock guys heads back.</v>

5099
02:15:20.461 --> 02:15:22.290
<v Speaker 2>But you do that in 10 ounce gloves and nothing happens.</v>

5100
02:15:22.291 --> 02:15:23.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like boom,</v>

5101
02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:23.480
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

5102
02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5103
02:15:24.090 --> 02:15:24.770
<v Speaker 2>It was funny.</v>

5104
02:15:24.770 --> 02:15:25.350
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

5105
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:26.310
<v Speaker 2>but you do an MMA gloves.</v>

5106

5108

<v Speaker 2>which is not a hard punch.</v>

5109
02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:32.670
<v Speaker 2>You're saying it's just kind of flashy,</v>

5200
02:17:55.450 --> 02:17:55.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5201

02:17:56.311 --> 02:17:56.890
<v Speaker 3>They bought in.</v>

5203
02:17:56.890 --> 02:17:57.281
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

5204
02:17:57.281 --> 02:17:57.551
<v Speaker 3>John,</v>

5205
02:17:57.551 --> 02:17:58.510
<v Speaker 3>I asked you a question.</v>

5206
02:17:58.511 --> 02:17:59.380
<v Speaker 3>I think we cut you off.</v>

5207
02:17:59.381 --> 02:18:00.040
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>

5208
02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:01.090
<v Speaker 3>What about the front leg?</v>

5209
02:18:01.091 --> 02:18:03.750
<v Speaker 3>Tepe what about the southpaw stance takes away the teeth.</v>

5210
02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:07.000
<v Speaker 3>If you all are standing Orthodox and you've got your left leg forward and then</v>

5211
02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:09.070
<v Speaker 3>your orthodox,</v>

5212
02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:09.960
<v Speaker 3>the left leg is going to go through it.</v>

5213
02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:10.480
<v Speaker 3>The center.</v>

5214
02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:11.570
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you going to set up,</v>

5215
02:18:11.571 --> 02:18:13.380
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden this leg is going to check it and you can,</v>

5216
02:18:13.510 --> 02:18:16.630
<v Speaker 3>you can check your stomach because your stomach a lot easier.</v>

5217
02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:18.850
<v Speaker 3>So now everything's got to be off the right leg and said the front leg.</v>

5218
02:18:19.150 --> 02:18:19.983
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

5219
02:18:21.310 --> 02:18:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Atlanta flashy.</v>

5220
02:18:22.010 --> 02:18:24.370
<v Speaker 3>But as soon as I saying he and then all of a sudden I've got this like neon.</v>

5221
02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5222
02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:26.673
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>

5223
02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Do you find that typically a midway?</v>

5224
02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:30.370
<v Speaker 3>I had 72 and a half.</v>

5225
02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:34.090
<v Speaker 3>And what do you walk around at 80 e five 86 oh Geez.</v>

5226
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:35.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5227
02:18:35.490 --> 02:18:37.350
<v Speaker 3>So in 40 [inaudible] you,</v>

5228
02:18:37.351 --> 02:18:37.600
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

5229
02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:39.840
<v Speaker 3>you cut weight that just like a MMA.</v>

5230
02:18:39.850 --> 02:18:42.480
<v Speaker 3>Then I start 10 weeks out and so they go down.</v>

5231
02:18:42.481 --> 02:18:44.940
<v Speaker 3>So they go down and then lose probably the last five or six.</v>

5232
02:18:44.941 --> 02:18:45.900
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

5233
02:18:45.901 --> 02:18:46.850
<v Speaker 3>this is our job.</v>

5234
02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:48.461
<v Speaker 3>This is a war.</v>

5235
02:18:48.461 --> 02:18:49.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean these guys are not fighting.</v>

5236
02:18:49.741 --> 02:18:50.640
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to kill each other.</v>

5237
02:18:50.641 --> 02:18:52.590
<v Speaker 3>This is a Johnson set,</v>

5238
02:18:52.591 --> 02:18:53.790
<v Speaker 3>a very aggressive pace.</v>

5239
02:18:54.550 --> 02:18:55.920
<v Speaker 3>It's still keeping it up.</v>

5240
02:18:56.860 --> 02:18:57.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5241
02:18:57.161 --> 02:19:00.880
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like he's trying to prove a point or make a big statement.</v>

5242
02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:02.800
<v Speaker 3>That was a big kick to the body right there.</v>

5243
02:19:03.100 --> 02:19:03.933
<v Speaker 3>Who's winning so far?</v>

5244
02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:04.630
<v Speaker 3>How are those cases?</v>

5245
02:19:04.630 --> 02:19:06.520
<v Speaker 3>The body Johnson's not to not scored.</v>

5246
02:19:07.490 --> 02:19:09.610
<v Speaker 3>Same as punching you.</v>

5247
02:19:10.980 --> 02:19:14.010
<v Speaker 3>You really think Johnson up in that second round and I wasn't paying enough</v>

5248
02:19:14.011 --> 02:19:16.590
<v Speaker 3>attention when he talks to my two zero and he got that take down.</v>

5249
02:19:17.070 --> 02:19:17.903
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

5250
02:19:18.210 --> 02:19:19.230
<v Speaker 3>We are in Brazil though.</v>

5251
02:19:19.530 --> 02:19:20.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5252
02:19:20.190 --> 02:19:21.570
<v Speaker 3>and he did rock Johnson.</v>

5253
02:19:21.571 --> 02:19:22.470
<v Speaker 3>Would that one punch?</v>

5254
02:19:23.490 --> 02:19:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Johnson rock case control.</v>

5255
02:19:24.660 --> 02:19:27.800
<v Speaker 3>He's pushing easily be Brazilian easily.</v>

5256
02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dang.</v>

5257
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:34.820
<v Speaker 2>That was a beautiful combination to Johnson is on fire.</v>

5258
02:19:34.860 --> 02:19:35.571
<v Speaker 2>Oh Damn.</v>

5259
02:19:35.571 --> 02:19:38.960
<v Speaker 2>So good kick to the body that he's trying to finish out of blood coming out of</v>

5260
02:19:38.961 --> 02:19:39.260
<v Speaker 2>the nose.</v>

5261
02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:40.190
<v Speaker 2>Over both a cam.</v>

5262
02:19:40.191 --> 02:19:41.120
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard kick.</v>

5263
02:19:41.121 --> 02:19:43.110
<v Speaker 2>How's he taking that rose?</v>

5264
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:44.780
<v Speaker 2>That kicks so fast,</v>

5265
02:19:44.781 --> 02:19:45.320
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5266
02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:47.120
<v Speaker 2>There's so little windup.</v>

5267
02:19:48.350 --> 02:19:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's another thing John.</v>

5268
02:19:49.581 --> 02:19:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you think about like,</v>

5269
02:19:51.350 --> 02:19:55.460
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of these guys you've seen in MMA like Liardo they throw karate style</v>

5270
02:19:55.461 --> 02:19:56.330
<v Speaker 2>where there's no warm,</v>

5271
02:19:56.390 --> 02:19:57.920
<v Speaker 2>there's no step is no.</v>

5272

<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

5274
02:19:58.401 --> 02:20:02.750

5275
02:20:02.751 --> 02:20:06.170
<v Speaker 2>that you're starting to see from a lot of these guys and like Thai style?</v>

5276
02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:07.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm loving it.</v>

5277

5282
02:20:14.511 --> 02:20:16.340
<v Speaker 2>is an actual form and he's actually working.</v>

5283
02:20:17.450 --> 02:20:18.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be a one person.</v>

5284
02:20:18.850 --> 02:20:19.321
<v Speaker 2>I'm only toy.</v>

5285
02:20:19.321 --> 02:20:21.770

<v Speaker 2>I like MMA.</v>

5290
02:20:24.540 --> 02:20:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

5291
02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:26.193
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

5292
02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:27.041
<v Speaker 2>If you can throw a,</v>

5293
02:20:27.041 --> 02:20:28.160
<v Speaker 2>an amazing spin kick,</v>

5294
02:20:28.780 --> 02:20:31.160
<v Speaker 2>I reckon it's amazing instead of the traditional,</v>

5295
02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:32.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5296
02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:33.420
<v Speaker 2>if you can do the cool stuff a</v>

5297
02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:35.953
<v Speaker 2>couple of way.</v>

5298
02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Well you know that opened minded probably one of the reasons why you became a</v>

5299
02:20:40.101 --> 02:20:41.180
<v Speaker 2>great fighter in the first place.</v>

5300
02:20:41.181 --> 02:20:42.014
<v Speaker 2>You were thinking,</v>

5301
02:20:42.050 --> 02:20:42.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5302
02:20:42.380 --> 02:20:43.213
<v Speaker 2>Oh damn.</v>

5303
02:20:43.430 --> 02:20:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Barboza has some really fucking fast kicks man.</v>

5304
02:20:46.131 --> 02:20:46.964
<v Speaker 2>Super fast.</v>

5305
02:20:46.970 --> 02:20:48.080
<v Speaker 2>Like from the chamber,</v>

5306
02:20:48.081 --> 02:20:50.420
<v Speaker 2>like right from the launch,</v>

5307
02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:52.160
<v Speaker 2>he's throwing some,</v>

5308
02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:56.570
<v Speaker 2>not really land in Johnson's very aware and ready pressure man pressures.</v>

5309
02:20:56.600 --> 02:20:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

5310
02:20:57.230 --> 02:21:00.680
<v Speaker 2>And the ones that have landed Johnson's eating them well and countering,</v>

5311
02:21:00.780 --> 02:21:01.613
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

5312
02:21:01.650 --> 02:21:02.950
<v Speaker 2>take some crazy shots.</v>

5313
02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:10.510
<v Speaker 2>This just shows you like how high level MMA as these guys have dedicated like</v>

5314
02:21:10.551 --> 02:21:13.670
<v Speaker 2>their heart and soul for years to get to this point.</v>

5315
02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:15.980
<v Speaker 2>And both of them would get lit up.</v>

5316
02:21:16.010 --> 02:21:16.970
<v Speaker 2>But Cardio,</v>

5317
02:21:19.130 --> 02:21:21.580
<v Speaker 2>is there anyone take down attempt as well as the whole fight is?</v>

5318
02:21:21.900 --> 02:21:23.660
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty much pretty much um,</v>

5319
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:24.590
<v Speaker 2>mostly stand up.</v>

5320
02:21:24.591 --> 02:21:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5321
02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:25.880
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing that a lot,</v>

5322
02:21:25.881 --> 02:21:26.480
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5323
02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:27.350
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing that a lot.</v>

5324
02:21:27.351 --> 02:21:27.861
<v Speaker 2>There's many,</v>

5325
02:21:27.861 --> 02:21:29.090
<v Speaker 2>many fights ago by now.</v>

5326
02:21:29.091 --> 02:21:32.310
<v Speaker 2>It used to be very unusual if there was no grappling at all in a fight.</v>

5327
02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Now it's pretty common.</v>

5328
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5329
02:21:34.490 --> 02:21:38.570
<v Speaker 2>I think that's because of the pressure from the fancy takes him down.</v>

5330
02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:39.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a number of things.</v>

5331
02:21:40.250 --> 02:21:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a number of things though.</v>

5332
02:21:42.800 --> 02:21:43.340
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

5333
02:21:43.340 --> 02:21:44.180
<v Speaker 2>if you're a grappler,</v>

5334
02:21:44.181 --> 02:21:46.700
<v Speaker 2>it's frowned upon John's Kallan was he kicking around this?</v>

5335
02:21:46.701 --> 02:21:47.534
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5336
02:21:47.930 --> 02:21:48.830
<v Speaker 2>I would agree.</v>

5337
02:21:49.820 --> 02:21:54.820
<v Speaker 2>But as that master wheel kicker was kind of in a national national championships</v>

5338
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:56.743
<v Speaker 2>national,</v>

5339
02:21:56.900 --> 02:21:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was kind of a national,</v>

5340
02:21:57.921 --> 02:21:58.431
<v Speaker 2>we can't just,</v>

5341
02:21:58.431 --> 02:22:00.050
<v Speaker 2>if you read the tech one of the times,</v>

5342
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.920
<v Speaker 2>cause that,</v>

5343
02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:01.551
<v Speaker 2>and if you do,</v>

5344
02:22:01.551 --> 02:22:02.384
<v Speaker 2>you're a loser</v>

5345
02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Johnson one that Johnson won that fight.</v>

5346
02:22:07.870 --> 02:22:08.391
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

5347
02:22:08.391 --> 02:22:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

5348
02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:09.951
<v Speaker 2>At least two or three.</v>

5349
02:22:09.951 --> 02:22:10.670
<v Speaker 2>Nothing really.</v>

5350
02:22:10.670 --> 02:22:11.540
<v Speaker 2>I think three nothing,</v>

5351
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:12.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's Brazil.</v>

5352
02:22:12.650 --> 02:22:14.840
<v Speaker 2>It might be a very impressive performance.</v>

5353
02:22:14.841 --> 02:22:16.880
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you that he went after Chad.</v>

5354
02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Some of my hardest fights have been doing the cutter.</v>

5355
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:22.543
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>

5356
02:22:26.910 --> 02:22:28.690
<v Speaker 4>Is anyone taking myself?</v>

5357
02:22:29.230 --> 02:22:30.810
<v Speaker 4>So that's not as very personal.</v>

5358
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:33.180
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5359
02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:34.410
<v Speaker 4>So what took that seriously?</v>

5360
02:22:34.411 --> 02:22:35.101
<v Speaker 4>What can I ask you this?</v>

5361
02:22:35.101 --> 02:22:37.890
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever use Open Eagle Claw here?</v>

5362
02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:38.940
<v Speaker 4>Look at that right there.</v>

5363
02:22:38.941 --> 02:22:39.990
<v Speaker 4>I did the Mac.</v>

5364
02:22:40.290 --> 02:22:41.850
<v Speaker 4>What do you guys think about the,</v>

5365
02:22:41.851 --> 02:22:42.031
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5366
02:22:42.031 --> 02:22:43.020
<v Speaker 4>the main event here?</v>

5367
02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:44.180
<v Speaker 4>Frank Mir and big foot.</v>

5368
02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:47.640
<v Speaker 4>I think when there's only one guy needs to win more than I do.</v>

5369
02:22:47.641 --> 02:22:48.460
<v Speaker 4>It's Frank Mir.</v>

5370
02:22:48.460 --> 02:22:49.520
<v Speaker 4>Big Foot needs a win too.</v>

5371
02:22:49.530 --> 02:22:50.430
<v Speaker 4>He just got knocked out by her.</v>

5372
02:22:50.460 --> 02:22:51.840
<v Speaker 4>Lawsky here's my question.</v>

5373
02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:54.150
<v Speaker 4>Should be allowed to do in Brazil.</v>

5374
02:22:54.620 --> 02:22:54.920
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5375
02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:56.310
<v Speaker 4>both foot lost a cane.</v>

5376
02:22:56.350 --> 02:22:57.183
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5377
02:22:57.330 --> 02:22:58.290
<v Speaker 4>He lost a cane.</v>

5378
02:22:58.410 --> 02:22:59.930
<v Speaker 4>He had a draw,</v>

5379
02:23:00.250 --> 02:23:01.270
<v Speaker 4>but then they took it away.</v>

5380
02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:01.891
<v Speaker 4>Tested,</v>

5381
02:23:01.891 --> 02:23:03.940
<v Speaker 4>positive sounding,</v>

5382
02:23:03.980 --> 02:23:05.160
<v Speaker 4>been tested positive.</v>

5383
02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:07.800
<v Speaker 4>He had a license to take testosterone.</v>

5384
02:23:07.801 --> 02:23:09.420
<v Speaker 4>They tested him before the fight.</v>

5385
02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:10.590
<v Speaker 4>He was one level.</v>

5386
02:23:10.750 --> 02:23:12.330
<v Speaker 4>They tested them after the fight.</v>

5387
02:23:12.450 --> 02:23:13.500
<v Speaker 4>He was off the charts.</v>

5388
02:23:13.770 --> 02:23:15.300
<v Speaker 4>So that means in the locker room,</v>

5389
02:23:15.301 --> 02:23:18.240
<v Speaker 4>hang it hat pride styles.</v>

5390
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:20.840
<v Speaker 4>He's getting sued by his doctor because he's,</v>

5391
02:23:20.930 --> 02:23:24.210
<v Speaker 4>he tried to say that this was the doctor's fault that was doctor suing him.</v>

5392
02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:25.320
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5393
02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:26.190
<v Speaker 4>so he's really,</v>

5394
02:23:26.191 --> 02:23:27.240
<v Speaker 4>Oh and three mirrors.</v>

5395
02:23:27.241 --> 02:23:27.601
<v Speaker 4>Owen?</v>

5396
02:23:27.601 --> 02:23:28.710
<v Speaker 4>Four oh five.</v>

5397
02:23:28.711 --> 02:23:30.450
<v Speaker 4>Oh and for uh,</v>

5398
02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:30.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5399
02:23:30.781 --> 02:23:34.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you'd say he's so in three after that fight with big foot or with</v>

5400
02:23:34.051 --> 02:23:36.210
<v Speaker 4>a Mark Hunt rather cause all due respect.</v>

5401
02:23:36.530 --> 02:23:37.130
<v Speaker 4>That was amazing.</v>

5402
02:23:37.130 --> 02:23:38.430
<v Speaker 4>It was such a fucking war.</v>

5403
02:23:38.580 --> 02:23:38.791
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5404
02:23:38.791 --> 02:23:40.770
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he was on some chemical assistance,</v>

5405
02:23:41.130 --> 02:23:42.060
<v Speaker 4>but God damn,</v>

5406
02:23:42.061 --> 02:23:43.320
<v Speaker 4>that was a fucking war for sure.</v>

5407
02:23:43.321 --> 02:23:44.190
<v Speaker 4>But it wasn't a win.</v>

5408
02:23:44.191 --> 02:23:44.970
<v Speaker 4>So I would say,</v>

5409
02:23:44.970 --> 02:23:45.690
<v Speaker 4>oh in two.</v>

5410
02:23:45.690 --> 02:23:46.261
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5411
02:23:46.261 --> 02:23:46.890
<v Speaker 4>two and one.</v>

5412
02:23:46.890 --> 02:23:49.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say it's so fucking hard to tell him it's,</v>

5413
02:23:49.740 --> 02:23:50.250
<v Speaker 4>what do you,</v>

5414
02:23:50.250 --> 02:23:51.083
<v Speaker 4>what do you call that?</v>

5415
02:23:51.270 --> 02:23:54.450
<v Speaker 4>You either gotta say the fight never happened or you say was what it was,</v>

5416
02:23:54.451 --> 02:23:55.380
<v Speaker 4>which was a draw.</v>

5417
02:23:55.410 --> 02:23:56.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we sang it.</v>

5418
02:23:57.180 --> 02:23:57.961
<v Speaker 4>You celebrate it.</v>

5419
02:23:57.961 --> 02:23:58.470
<v Speaker 4>Celebrate it.</v>

5420
02:23:58.470 --> 02:23:59.010
<v Speaker 4>You can't sell it.</v>

5421
02:23:59.010 --> 02:24:02.190
<v Speaker 4>Well you could celebrate it as a performance though cause got down.</v>

5422
02:24:02.191 --> 02:24:03.720
<v Speaker 4>That was a performance by both guys.</v>

5423
02:24:03.721 --> 02:24:04.620
<v Speaker 4>So much so that I have a,</v>

5424
02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:05.910
<v Speaker 4>I have a roots of fight,</v>

5433
02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:24.420
<v Speaker 4>And then when it turned out they got the drug test back and they found out that</v>

5434
02:24:24.421 --> 02:24:25.500
<v Speaker 4>big foot was through the roof.</v>

5435
02:24:25.530 --> 02:24:26.700
<v Speaker 4>It was so disappointed.</v>

5436
02:24:27.150 --> 02:24:28.380
<v Speaker 4>He was just so depressed.</v>

5437
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:29.810
<v Speaker 4>He had these jackets.</v>

5438
02:24:30.010 --> 02:24:31.020
<v Speaker 4>It the classic.</v>

5439
02:24:31.021 --> 02:24:31.321
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5440
02:24:31.321 --> 02:24:33.600
<v Speaker 4>it was a jazz make foot hunt too.</v>

5441
02:24:33.810 --> 02:24:34.970
<v Speaker 4>I was ringside</v>

5442
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:37.560
<v Speaker 4>medio away from it.</v>

5443
02:24:37.970 --> 02:24:38.803
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5444
02:24:39.460 --> 02:24:41.220
<v Speaker 4>steroid problem and kickboxing.</v>

5445
02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:42.920
<v Speaker 4>Did we talk?</v>

5446
02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:43.753
<v Speaker 4>We didn't test.</v>

5447
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:48.720
<v Speaker 4>But in Thailand that's not a problem then you've got a problem.</v>

5448
02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:49.530
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

5449
02:24:49.530 --> 02:24:52.350
<v Speaker 4>Then you don't have a problem because you're not really caring.</v>

5450
02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:55.760
<v Speaker 4>I would say it's an issue you say.</v>

5451
02:24:55.770 --> 02:24:57.060
<v Speaker 4>Would you say in your opinion,</v>

5452
02:24:57.530 --> 02:24:58.363
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5453
02:24:58.590 --> 02:24:59.160
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

5454
02:24:59.160 --> 02:24:59.993
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>

5455
02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:03.030
<v Speaker 4>Let's say pride or the pride biters and all the pride fights.</v>

5456
02:25:03.031 --> 02:25:08.031
<v Speaker 4>Would you say the number would be 70% of pride fighters were on something 80 90</v>

5457
02:25:09.060 --> 02:25:10.470
<v Speaker 4>or a hundred what would you say?</v>

5458
02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:11.100
<v Speaker 4>What would you say it?</v>

5459
02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:13.020
<v Speaker 4>I can't say I did a pri back then.</v>

5460
02:25:13.021 --> 02:25:16.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you had to guess based on the things you hear when I talk to</v>

5461
02:25:16.141 --> 02:25:16.921
<v Speaker 4>ensign anyway,</v>

5462
02:25:16.921 --> 02:25:18.840
<v Speaker 4>who fought in pride and didn't do shit,</v>

5463
02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:19.920
<v Speaker 4>he didn't take anything.</v>

5464
02:25:20.220 --> 02:25:21.120
<v Speaker 4>Have you talked to him?</v>

5465
02:25:21.180 --> 02:25:21.990
<v Speaker 4>I bet.</v>

5466
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:24.190
<v Speaker 4>I bet he's right and most people,</v>

5467
02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:28.900
<v Speaker 4>so probably most seen means like 70 60 70 something like that.</v>

5468
02:25:28.901 --> 02:25:31.990
<v Speaker 4>But he said it was in the contract that they don't test for steroids.</v>

5469
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:34.060
<v Speaker 4>They wrote it down in the contract.</v>

5470
02:25:34.090 --> 02:25:34.780
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

5471
02:25:34.780 --> 02:25:38.740
<v Speaker 4>I think MONTCO was a prime example of someone that might've done something</v>

5472
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:43.490
<v Speaker 4>to dissolve my nose.</v>

5473
02:25:43.540 --> 02:25:44.920
<v Speaker 4>All positive thinking.</v>

5474
02:25:45.410 --> 02:25:47.040
<v Speaker 4>Mark [inaudible].</v>

5475
02:25:47.470 --> 02:25:48.370
<v Speaker 4>I dunno about Kirk.</v>

5476
02:25:48.371 --> 02:25:49.210
<v Speaker 4>If he woulda did stories,</v>

5477
02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:50.073
<v Speaker 4>he would have been huge.</v>

5478
02:25:51.910 --> 02:25:52.840
<v Speaker 4>Same with Ken shamrock.</v>

5479
02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:54.753
<v Speaker 4>Mark Coleman.</v>

5480
02:25:55.240 --> 02:25:56.073
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5481
02:25:57.880 --> 02:25:58.260
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5482
02:25:58.260 --> 02:26:01.810
<v Speaker 4>so the reality is the reality,</v>

5483
02:26:01.811 --> 02:26:02.800
<v Speaker 4>as we know,</v>

5484
02:26:02.980 --> 02:26:06.010
<v Speaker 4>probably pretty certain if you had a bet,</v>

5485
02:26:06.011 --> 02:26:06.581
<v Speaker 4>all the money you had,</v>

5486
02:26:06.581 --> 02:26:06.941
<v Speaker 4>you would go,</v>

5487
02:26:06.941 --> 02:26:07.451
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

5488
02:26:07.451 --> 02:26:08.710
<v Speaker 4>Most of the pride fighters,</v>

5489
02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:12.190
<v Speaker 4>maybe 90% maybe you'd have to go with that.</v>

5490
02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:15.940
<v Speaker 4>And no one's questioning their legacies exactly at all.</v>

5491
02:26:15.970 --> 02:26:16.151
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5492
02:26:16.151 --> 02:26:16.540
<v Speaker 4>it's quick.</v>

5493
02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:17.950
<v Speaker 4>And we know they were,</v>

5494
02:26:18.250 --> 02:26:18.971
<v Speaker 4>they promoted it,</v>

5495
02:26:18.971 --> 02:26:19.920
<v Speaker 4>they put it in their contract,</v>

5496
02:26:19.930 --> 02:26:21.050
<v Speaker 4>but it does.</v>

5497
02:26:21.070 --> 02:26:22.450
<v Speaker 4>No one tested positive.</v>

5498
02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:23.920
<v Speaker 4>Once people test positive,</v>

5499
02:26:23.921 --> 02:26:24.880
<v Speaker 4>then people get angry,</v>

5500
02:26:24.881 --> 02:26:26.050
<v Speaker 4>then the trolls come out.</v>

5501
02:26:26.051 --> 02:26:27.430
<v Speaker 4>Then people share their opinions.</v>

5502
02:26:27.610 --> 02:26:31.510
<v Speaker 4>Then people write all these fucking pieces about it and then then it becomes</v>

5503
02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:32.230
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

5504
02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:33.250
<v Speaker 4>it becomes a real thing.</v>

5505
02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:36.700
<v Speaker 4>Nerds that sucked at sports that are talking shit.</v>

5506
02:26:36.850 --> 02:26:37.241
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5507
02:26:37.241 --> 02:26:38.590
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot of people that are like,</v>

5508
02:26:38.591 --> 02:26:38.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5509
02:26:38.861 --> 02:26:39.790
<v Speaker 4>they're purists.</v>

5510
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:41.110
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to see that shit,</v>

5511
02:26:41.140 --> 02:26:43.210
<v Speaker 4>but it's always been in,</v>

5512
02:26:43.211 --> 02:26:44.410
<v Speaker 4>in every major sport.</v>

5513
02:26:44.410 --> 02:26:47.340
<v Speaker 4>We're pretending that it's not around sports.</v>

5514
02:26:47.350 --> 02:26:49.300
<v Speaker 4>Going to be more accepting of it.</v>

5515
02:26:49.301 --> 02:26:49.871
<v Speaker 4>Like you're gonna be like,</v>

5516
02:26:49.871 --> 02:26:50.010
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

5517
02:26:50.010 --> 02:26:50.771
<v Speaker 4>the guys on shit,</v>

5518
02:26:50.771 --> 02:26:50.991
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

5519
02:26:50.991 --> 02:26:52.000
<v Speaker 4>He's still a great athlete.</v>

5520
02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:54.850
<v Speaker 4>If you've never compete in sports and you stick behind a computer and eat</v>

5521
02:26:54.851 --> 02:26:55.684
<v Speaker 4>Cheetos all day,</v>

5522
02:26:55.690 --> 02:26:55.991
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

5523
02:26:55.991 --> 02:26:57.160
<v Speaker 4>this is ridiculous.</v>

5524
02:26:57.520 --> 02:26:58.780
<v Speaker 4>That's why they're better than me.</v>

5525
02:26:59.620 --> 02:27:01.900
<v Speaker 4>It could have been the NFL if I did the same shit.</v>

5526
02:27:01.930 --> 02:27:02.321
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

5527
02:27:02.321 --> 02:27:03.850
<v Speaker 4>Go take the same shit and trying to get baseball.</v>

5528
02:27:03.860 --> 02:27:04.280
<v Speaker 4>Like baby.</v>

5529
02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:05.113
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

5530
02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:07.450
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's pretending,</v>

5531
02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:08.170
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5532
02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:08.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5533
02:27:08.380 --> 02:27:08.940
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of,</v>

5534
02:27:08.940 --> 02:27:09.640
<v Speaker 4>that's what's going on.</v>

5535
02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:10.510
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's gone.</v>

5536
02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:11.171
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

5537
02:27:11.171 --> 02:27:12.540
<v Speaker 4>let's pretend test.</v>

5538
02:27:12.670 --> 02:27:14.620
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have a pretend press conference.</v>

5539
02:27:14.740 --> 02:27:18.010
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have a pretend news fucking media thing.</v>

5540
02:27:18.190 --> 02:27:22.030
<v Speaker 4>Everything's pretend testing is fucking for real.</v>

5541
02:27:22.031 --> 02:27:23.320
<v Speaker 4>They're spending a shitload of money.</v>

5542
02:27:23.330 --> 02:27:24.131
<v Speaker 4>The conferences,</v>

5543
02:27:24.131 --> 02:27:25.060
<v Speaker 4>the press conferences,</v>

5544
02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:29.050
<v Speaker 4>but everybody that's testing everybody's involved.</v>

5545
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:30.280
<v Speaker 4>They know the reality.</v>

5546
02:27:30.460 --> 02:27:34.000
<v Speaker 4>The testing is just to somehow make it look like they care.</v>

5547
02:27:34.330 --> 02:27:35.163
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5548
02:27:35.290 --> 02:27:35.680
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

5549
02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:37.570
<v Speaker 4>The testing is to try to eliminate it.</v>

5550
02:27:37.571 --> 02:27:41.170
<v Speaker 4>The trusting is try to bus people and now they're going to give them huge fines.</v>

5551
02:27:41.171 --> 02:27:43.030
<v Speaker 4>Now they're going to kick them out for like two years,</v>

5552
02:27:43.031 --> 02:27:43.930
<v Speaker 4>two or four years.</v>

5553
02:27:43.931 --> 02:27:44.231
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5554
02:27:44.231 --> 02:27:44.891
<v Speaker 4>Like Dana said,</v>

5555
02:27:44.891 --> 02:27:47.050
<v Speaker 4>I want my four years and let's make man,</v>

5556
02:27:47.051 --> 02:27:48.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about any of that.</v>

5557
02:27:49.300 --> 02:27:50.200
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're doing,</v>

5558
02:27:50.230 --> 02:27:51.120
<v Speaker 4>but nothing's,</v>

5559
02:27:51.140 --> 02:27:54.070
<v Speaker 4>because I hear they have to kind of do it and have to kind of say it.</v>

5560
02:27:54.090 --> 02:27:54.380
<v Speaker 4>They have to.</v>

5561
02:27:54.380 --> 02:27:55.091
<v Speaker 4>They have to do.</v>

5562
02:27:55.091 --> 02:27:56.260
<v Speaker 4>Everybody want to do it.</v>

5563
02:27:56.261 --> 02:27:57.520
<v Speaker 4>They want to clean up the sport.</v>

5564
02:27:57.521 --> 02:27:58.840
<v Speaker 4>I know this from the top down.</v>

5565
02:27:59.140 --> 02:28:02.530
<v Speaker 4>They do want to get the steroids at a sport because it's bad for their business.</v>

5566
02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:06.730
<v Speaker 4>If these guys can get tested positive for steroids and it keeps showing up and</v>

5567
02:28:06.731 --> 02:28:07.360
<v Speaker 4>all these new,</v>

5568
02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:11.080
<v Speaker 4>it becomes a part of the store that makes it unattractive to advertisers and</v>

5569
02:28:11.081 --> 02:28:13.960
<v Speaker 4>makes it look like what the worst stereotype is.</v>

5570
02:28:14.170 --> 02:28:19.060
<v Speaker 4>This thuggish sport that's filled with criminals and people doing unethical</v>

5571
02:28:19.061 --> 02:28:22.700
<v Speaker 4>things and the Lance Armstrong and and all that Barry bonds,</v>

5572
02:28:22.730 --> 02:28:24.410
<v Speaker 4>yet everyone's still doing more cycling.</v>

5573
02:28:24.430 --> 02:28:25.970
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's still doing it right,</v>

5574
02:28:25.971 --> 02:28:27.770
<v Speaker 4>but that's what they're trying to eliminate.</v>

5575
02:28:27.771 --> 02:28:30.140
<v Speaker 4>How else would you have him eliminated with random testing?</v>

5576
02:28:30.740 --> 02:28:33.870
<v Speaker 4>The time to catch then everybody isn't there.</v>

5577
02:28:34.010 --> 02:28:37.820
<v Speaker 4>What do you send that Victor content but wasn't he saying when he said that they</v>

5578
02:28:37.821 --> 02:28:40.700
<v Speaker 4>got steroids now that get out of your system really quick and that's what</v>

5579
02:28:40.701 --> 02:28:44.510
<v Speaker 4>everyone's really on is the shit that gets out of your system within days.</v>

5580
02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:46.490
<v Speaker 4>And they're just taking chavy Lance Armstrong.</v>

5581
02:28:47.020 --> 02:28:48.370
<v Speaker 4>He just said like on,</v>

5582
02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:49.490
<v Speaker 4>isn't that what he's saying?</v>

5583
02:28:49.491 --> 02:28:51.410
<v Speaker 4>And His podcast or maybe I heard wrong,</v>

5584
02:28:51.411 --> 02:28:54.340
<v Speaker 4>but apparently podcast with me.</v>

5585
02:28:55.490 --> 02:28:58.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was yours over it again and listen cause we talked about a</v>

5586
02:28:58.371 --> 02:28:59.470
<v Speaker 4>lot of parents.</v>

5587
02:28:59.510 --> 02:29:00.231
<v Speaker 4>Have you heard of this?</v>

5588
02:29:00.231 --> 02:29:02.630
<v Speaker 4>Have you heard that there's like steroids,</v>

5589
02:29:02.690 --> 02:29:05.180
<v Speaker 4>they get in and out of your system really quick,</v>

5590
02:29:05.181 --> 02:29:05.710
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5591
02:29:05.710 --> 02:29:06.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5592
02:29:06.370 --> 02:29:06.680
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

5593
02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:08.660
<v Speaker 4>But I don't think financially guys,</v>

5594
02:29:08.690 --> 02:29:10.630
<v Speaker 4>a lot of guys in the UFC and beat afford those.</v>

5595
02:29:10.631 --> 02:29:13.490
<v Speaker 4>That's like at a high level you're talking about Lance Armstrong talking about</v>

5596
02:29:13.491 --> 02:29:14.680
<v Speaker 4>NFL guys probably deal.</v>

5597
02:29:14.690 --> 02:29:15.101
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>

5598
02:29:15.101 --> 02:29:18.950
<v Speaker 4>there are different steroids and get out of your system really quick that are</v>

5599
02:29:18.951 --> 02:29:19.850
<v Speaker 4>super expensive.</v>

5600
02:29:20.230 --> 02:29:21.350
<v Speaker 4>That's what I've heard like,</v>

5601
02:29:22.260 --> 02:29:23.620
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

5602
02:29:23.621 --> 02:29:26.870
<v Speaker 4>like there's steroids that they're ahead of the testing.</v>

5603
02:29:27.070 --> 02:29:27.210
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5604
02:29:27.210 --> 02:29:31.340
<v Speaker 4>you know when I feel like he was a guy that would know because he was a part of</v>

5605
02:29:31.341 --> 02:29:32.720
<v Speaker 4>that whole thing with the clean,</v>

5606
02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:33.711
<v Speaker 4>they would put that,</v>

5607
02:29:33.711 --> 02:29:34.450
<v Speaker 4>that would,</v>

5608
02:29:34.450 --> 02:29:37.580
<v Speaker 4>it's like a gel they would put on these guys and they would,</v>

5609
02:29:37.690 --> 02:29:41.870
<v Speaker 4>they would pass all their tests and that's what's what the balco scandal was all</v>

5610
02:29:41.871 --> 02:29:42.170
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

5611
02:29:42.170 --> 02:29:44.130
<v Speaker 4>Was it designer steroids that they create it.</v>

5612
02:29:44.330 --> 02:29:45.650
<v Speaker 4>So if that's what he's saying,</v>

5613
02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:47.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean that makes sense that this,</v>

5614
02:29:47.890 --> 02:29:49.010
<v Speaker 4>you know what's going to eliminate it?</v>

5615
02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:50.780
<v Speaker 4>The UFC doing random testing.</v>

5616
02:29:50.781 --> 02:29:52.330
<v Speaker 4>He's going to fuck guys Brendan.</v>

5617
02:29:52.331 --> 02:29:52.550
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

5618
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.941
<v Speaker 4>but listen,</v>

5619
02:29:52.941 --> 02:29:53.780
<v Speaker 4>it's great what they're doing.</v>

5620
02:29:53.781 --> 02:29:54.440
<v Speaker 4>They still,</v>

5621
02:29:54.440 --> 02:29:55.490
<v Speaker 4>in your opinion,</v>

5622
02:29:55.491 --> 02:29:58.100
<v Speaker 4>do you think professional football players,</v>

5623
02:29:58.340 --> 02:29:58.790
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5624
02:29:58.790 --> 02:30:01.580
<v Speaker 4>do steroids don't eat into the microphone.</v>

5625
02:30:02.210 --> 02:30:05.060
<v Speaker 4>You think they do social after all this shit,</v>

5626
02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:09.590
<v Speaker 4>you still have professional athletes still doing it after all the time.</v>

5627
02:30:09.591 --> 02:30:10.770
<v Speaker 4>He's going to be a part of cycling.</v>

5628
02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:11.510
<v Speaker 4>Are they still doing it?</v>

5629
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:12.230
<v Speaker 4>100%.</v>

5630
02:30:12.230 --> 02:30:14.240
<v Speaker 4>So how are they going to clean it up in MMA?</v>

5631
02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:18.860
<v Speaker 4>Technology's going to just possible technologies is always going to be ahead of</v>

5632
02:30:18.861 --> 02:30:19.340
<v Speaker 4>the testing.</v>

5633
02:30:19.340 --> 02:30:20.600
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say it's impossible,</v>

5634
02:30:20.601 --> 02:30:21.800
<v Speaker 4>but you can catch guys.</v>

5635
02:30:21.801 --> 02:30:22.634
<v Speaker 4>What are these?</v>

5636
02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:23.900
<v Speaker 4>I think they're,</v>

5637
02:30:24.050 --> 02:30:25.010
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

5638
02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:25.391
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

5639
02:30:25.391 --> 02:30:25.651
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

5640
02:30:25.651 --> 02:30:27.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody should be trying.</v>

5641
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.950
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just a show.</v>

5642
02:30:28.010 --> 02:30:28.251
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

5643
02:30:28.251 --> 02:30:29.840
<v Speaker 4>but now is it a show Eddie?</v>

5644
02:30:29.841 --> 02:30:31.270
<v Speaker 4>Cause now if you get caught dancing,</v>

5645
02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:32.510
<v Speaker 4>you're out two to four years.</v>

5646
02:30:32.720 --> 02:30:34.360
<v Speaker 4>If you're a uh,</v>

5647
02:30:34.430 --> 02:30:37.490
<v Speaker 4>Roy Nelson or Brendan Schaub and they tell you out for two or four years,</v>

5648
02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:38.260
<v Speaker 4>you're done.</v>

5649
02:30:38.260 --> 02:30:39.290
<v Speaker 4>You're done fighting.</v>

5650
02:30:39.350 --> 02:30:40.910
<v Speaker 4>So are you going to risk taking steroids?</v>

5651
02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:42.440
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

5652
02:30:42.440 --> 02:30:43.380
<v Speaker 4>if you know your,</v>

5653
02:30:43.490 --> 02:30:45.710
<v Speaker 4>he's the harshest laws and professional sports,</v>

5654
02:30:45.890 --> 02:30:49.640
<v Speaker 4>that's what they're trying to get done as that what's going on at that point?</v>

5655
02:30:49.641 --> 02:30:50.250
<v Speaker 4>How can,</v>

5656
02:30:50.250 --> 02:30:51.770
<v Speaker 4>how come I never got to that point in football,</v>

5657
02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:52.753
<v Speaker 4>they're still in it.</v>

5658
02:30:52.940 --> 02:30:57.710
<v Speaker 4>A true [inaudible] doesn't have a state athletic commission behind him.</v>

5659
02:30:57.711 --> 02:30:58.400
<v Speaker 4>Like Nevada.</v>

5660
02:30:58.400 --> 02:30:59.233
<v Speaker 4>Is that what's going on?</v>

5661
02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:00.130
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

5662
02:31:00.130 --> 02:31:02.180
<v Speaker 4>100% so football doesn't have a state.</v>

5663
02:31:02.210 --> 02:31:05.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to have a state athletic commission or fights.</v>

5664
02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:06.950
<v Speaker 4>They self test.</v>

5665
02:31:07.070 --> 02:31:07.571
<v Speaker 4>They like to,</v>

5666
02:31:07.571 --> 02:31:10.190
<v Speaker 4>why the NFL or the NBA doesn't test for pot.</v>

5667
02:31:10.460 --> 02:31:12.260
<v Speaker 4>They may make it in their contracts.</v>

5668
02:31:12.480 --> 02:31:12.900
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

5669
02:31:12.900 --> 02:31:14.010
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to deal with the athletics.</v>

5670
02:31:14.310 --> 02:31:16.430
<v Speaker 4>They figured out a way to get around it.</v>

5671
02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:17.780
<v Speaker 4>No sports,</v>

5672
02:31:17.780 --> 02:31:19.140
<v Speaker 4>they don't have anybody to answer to.</v>

5673
02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:20.130
<v Speaker 4>Well they didn't have anybody</v>

5674
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:20.761
<v Speaker 1>to answer to that.</v>

5675
02:31:20.761 --> 02:31:21.121
<v Speaker 1>You didn't.</v>

5676
02:31:21.121 --> 02:31:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Nevada state athletic commission sanctioned to UFC to make it legitimate cause</v>

5677
02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:28.620
<v Speaker 1>have was this crazy sport that was actually outlawed.</v>

5678
02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Football's never outlawed.</v>

5679
02:31:30.690 --> 02:31:35.310
<v Speaker 1>So football didn't need to be cleaned up to the point of where some regulatory</v>

5680
02:31:35.311 --> 02:31:38.580
<v Speaker 1>body consents to having them performing their state.</v>

5681
02:31:38.610 --> 02:31:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Also [inaudible] NFL,</v>

5682
02:31:40.351 --> 02:31:42.810
<v Speaker 1>those guys aren't punching and kicking each other in the face.</v>

5683
02:31:43.020 --> 02:31:43.853
<v Speaker 1>So there's a little bit,</v>

5684
02:31:44.250 --> 02:31:47.400
<v Speaker 1>there should be stricter punishment when it comes to fighting until you're</v>

5685
02:31:47.401 --> 02:31:49.420
<v Speaker 1>getting into punching and kicking in the face.</v>

5686
02:31:49.430 --> 02:31:50.490
<v Speaker 1>And I got it.</v>

5687
02:31:50.810 --> 02:31:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I didn't sign up for extra punching hard in the face.</v>

5688
02:31:53.971 --> 02:31:56.070
<v Speaker 1>I signed up for medium punching.</v>

5689
02:31:56.280 --> 02:31:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to get punched really hard.</v>

5690
02:31:58.650 --> 02:31:59.550
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

5691
02:31:59.551 --> 02:32:01.110
<v Speaker 1>You're getting in a fight in the cage.</v>

5692
02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:02.610
<v Speaker 1>You guys are throwing down.</v>

5693
02:32:05.690 --> 02:32:06.210
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

5694
02:32:06.210 --> 02:32:07.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what you're saying.</v>

5695
02:32:07.410 --> 02:32:09.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that I think it's a big show.</v>

5696
02:32:09.450 --> 02:32:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody knows everyone's doing shit.</v>

5697
02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:13.140
<v Speaker 1>You're saying they shouldn't do anything about it.</v>

5698
02:32:13.490 --> 02:32:17.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying all I'm saying they should if it worked for pride,</v>

5699
02:32:17.400 --> 02:32:17.930
<v Speaker 1>let them do.</v>

5700
02:32:17.930 --> 02:32:19.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying they have pride rules,</v>

5701
02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:20.400
<v Speaker 1>pride format,</v>

5702
02:32:20.490 --> 02:32:21.120
<v Speaker 1>pride.</v>

5703
02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:22.200
<v Speaker 1>A pride regulation.</v>

5704
02:32:22.201 --> 02:32:22.771
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

5705
02:32:22.771 --> 02:32:23.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's bad for the sport.</v>

5706
02:32:24.510 --> 02:32:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Was it bad for prime?</v>

5707
02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:26.250
<v Speaker 1>It did.</v>

5708
02:32:26.250 --> 02:32:27.083
<v Speaker 1>Did Pride</v>

5709
02:32:30.130 --> 02:32:30.840
<v Speaker 1>advertisements.</v>

5710
02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:31.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5711
02:32:31.051 --> 02:32:31.321
<v Speaker 1>Pride.</v>

5712
02:32:31.321 --> 02:32:34.290
<v Speaker 1>One under dodge and Harley Davidson jumping on board,</v>

5713
02:32:35.070 --> 02:32:39.720
<v Speaker 1>but did it have to do with the steroid use the steroids made pride crumble.</v>

5714
02:32:40.500 --> 02:32:41.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it was a part of it.</v>

5715
02:32:41.581 --> 02:32:43.290
<v Speaker 1>You can't have guys Jerusalem the Gills,</v>

5716
02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:44.580
<v Speaker 1>but how did that have to,</v>

5717
02:32:44.730 --> 02:32:48.300
<v Speaker 1>how did that correlate with the demise of pride?</v>

5718
02:32:48.570 --> 02:32:49.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

5719
02:32:49.340 --> 02:32:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Cause guys have traps hanging out of their fucking airs,</v>

5720
02:32:51.760 --> 02:32:52.800
<v Speaker 1>punch each other lives,</v>

5721
02:32:53.100 --> 02:32:54.030
<v Speaker 1>so hardly dance like,</v>

5722
02:32:54.031 --> 02:32:54.160
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5723
02:32:54.160 --> 02:32:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that guy's not natural.</v>

5724
02:32:56.790 --> 02:32:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5725
02:32:57.240 --> 02:33:00.870
<v Speaker 1>This is a false premise was what happened with pride was the Yakuza.</v>

5726
02:33:01.230 --> 02:33:01.831
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>

5727
02:33:01.831 --> 02:33:02.760
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of problems.</v>

5728
02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:03.713
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

5729
02:33:04.470 --> 02:33:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Japanese are different than us and they go in fads,</v>

5730
02:33:06.841 --> 02:33:10.410
<v Speaker 1>they have fans and sometimes those fads are gigantic.</v>

5731
02:33:10.411 --> 02:33:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Huge things like,</v>

5732
02:33:11.371 --> 02:33:11.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5733
02:33:11.611 --> 02:33:11.841
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5734
02:33:11.841 --> 02:33:12.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5735
02:33:12.120 --> 02:33:15.150
<v Speaker 1>they would fill 90,000 seat arenas with kickboxing.</v>

5736
02:33:15.570 --> 02:33:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Not Anymore,</v>

5737
02:33:16.110 --> 02:33:16.740
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5738
02:33:16.740 --> 02:33:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

5739
02:33:17.240 --> 02:33:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5740
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:19.110
<v Speaker 1>And just things happen.</v>

5741
02:33:19.140 --> 02:33:19.973
<v Speaker 1>Things change.</v>

5742
02:33:20.010 --> 02:33:20.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5743
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

5744
02:33:21.540 --> 02:33:21.811
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

5745
02:33:21.811 --> 02:33:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Not until the mic and see how I do that.</v>

5746
02:33:24.580 --> 02:33:25.413
<v Speaker 1>People complained about,</v>

5747
02:33:26.180 --> 02:33:29.790
<v Speaker 1>well what about I promise I'll never do that again.</v>

5748
02:33:30.060 --> 02:33:30.893
<v Speaker 1>Back to him.</v>

5749
02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:32.281
<v Speaker 1>That's a probably.</v>

5750
02:33:32.281 --> 02:33:33.000
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>

5751
02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:34.800
<v Speaker 1>what about Fidor do you reckon he was on something?</v>

5752
02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5753
02:33:36.270 --> 02:33:36.751
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

5754
02:33:36.751 --> 02:33:39.660
<v Speaker 1>until you know for sure you can't say,</v>

5755
02:33:39.940 --> 02:33:40.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5756
02:33:40.980 --> 02:33:43.800
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine the possibility is high.</v>

5757
02:33:43.860 --> 02:33:44.401
<v Speaker 1>He didn't look,</v>

5758
02:33:44.401 --> 02:33:45.181
<v Speaker 1>cause he didn't fuck,</v>

5759
02:33:45.181 --> 02:33:46.014
<v Speaker 1>he didn't,</v>

5760
02:33:46.020 --> 02:33:50.520
<v Speaker 1>he looked big fucking making me go back and look at what he looked like when he</v>

5761
02:33:50.521 --> 02:33:52.770
<v Speaker 1>fought Fujita go back and look at what he looked like.</v>

5762
02:33:52.940 --> 02:33:54.480
<v Speaker 1>It was a thick motherfucker.</v>

5763
02:33:54.720 --> 02:33:57.240
<v Speaker 1>He didn't look anything like you looked when he fought big foot.</v>

5764
02:33:57.241 --> 02:33:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Sova so what happened?</v>

5765
02:33:58.770 --> 02:33:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Did he stop lifting weights?</v>

5766
02:33:59.910 --> 02:34:00.810
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>

5767
02:34:01.140 --> 02:34:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Or did he stop taking whatever the fuck he was tanking?</v>

5768
02:34:04.230 --> 02:34:05.220
<v Speaker 1>That's possible too.</v>

5769
02:34:05.260 --> 02:34:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5770
02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:07.140
<v Speaker 1>When Anderson Silva test positive,</v>

5771
02:34:07.290 --> 02:34:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I would have never guessed.</v>

5772
02:34:08.161 --> 02:34:08.911
<v Speaker 1>I know what it never,</v>

5773
02:34:08.911 --> 02:34:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I would talk.</v>

5774
02:34:09.320 --> 02:34:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5775
02:34:09.450 --> 02:34:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I w I l everyone apology.</v>

5776
02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:14.310
<v Speaker 1>I told people John Fitch would never take steroids</v>

5777
02:34:15.810 --> 02:34:17.770
<v Speaker 1>because John Fisch told me that and I believed him</v>

5778
02:34:19.140 --> 02:34:22.020
<v Speaker 4>in your late thirties you're trying to compete in MMA with the,</v>

5779
02:34:22.050 --> 02:34:23.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's almost impossible.</v>

5780
02:34:25.110 --> 02:34:26.530
<v Speaker 4>Not only even know it ain't easy.</v>

5781
02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:27.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5782
02:34:27.490 --> 02:34:31.030
<v Speaker 4>would you rate Fidor even better than he already is for beating guys at are on</v>

5783
02:34:31.031 --> 02:34:31.864
<v Speaker 4>steroids?</v>

5784
02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:33.161
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

5785
02:34:33.161 --> 02:34:35.800
<v Speaker 4>Unless he was on steroids when you guys were on steroids,</v>

5786
02:34:36.180 --> 02:34:36.520
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>

5787
02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:37.301
<v Speaker 4>you don't know man.</v>

5788
02:34:37.301 --> 02:34:37.900
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

5789
02:34:37.900 --> 02:34:42.900
<v Speaker 4>he's obviously in the pocket of some very wealthy people who would want him to</v>

5790
02:34:43.511 --> 02:34:45.730
<v Speaker 4>do well at all costs.</v>

5791
02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:49.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the ramifications of those conversations,</v>

5792
02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:55.020
<v Speaker 4>but I do know that I had heard unsubstantiated reports of how he got paid and</v>

5793
02:34:55.340 --> 02:34:58.270
<v Speaker 4>who got the actual money and you know,</v>

5794
02:34:58.271 --> 02:35:00.430
<v Speaker 4>he's dealing with some very fucking powerful people.</v>

5795
02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:02.270
<v Speaker 4>It went big when paintings at the show,</v>

5796
02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:03.041
<v Speaker 4>there's something going on.</v>

5797
02:35:03.041 --> 02:35:05.980
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of other people behind the show that also were very wealthy and</v>

5798
02:35:05.981 --> 02:35:06.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5799
02:35:06.550 --> 02:35:07.440
<v Speaker 4>look there's there,</v>

5800
02:35:07.441 --> 02:35:10.840
<v Speaker 4>there he is right there fader that fade or with big foot on top of him smashing</v>

5801
02:35:10.841 --> 02:35:12.150
<v Speaker 4>them as no,</v>

5802
02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:15.130
<v Speaker 4>no relationship whatsoever to the fade or that beat.</v>

5803
02:35:15.130 --> 02:35:16.780
<v Speaker 4>So many guys in pride.</v>

5804
02:35:16.781 --> 02:35:17.770
<v Speaker 4>He's also older though.</v>

5805
02:35:17.900 --> 02:35:21.790
<v Speaker 4>It is kind of personnel there might had his exemption.</v>

5806
02:35:21.820 --> 02:35:22.150
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

5807
02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:23.650
<v Speaker 4>He did have his exemption.</v>

5808
02:35:23.651 --> 02:35:24.820
<v Speaker 4>He was huge back then.</v>

5809
02:35:24.970 --> 02:35:25.520
<v Speaker 4>He is all,</v>

5810
02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:26.680
<v Speaker 4>all those things are correct.</v>

5811
02:35:26.681 --> 02:35:27.490
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

5812
02:35:27.490 --> 02:35:32.490
<v Speaker 4>But I still and mean he was certainly diminished because of just sheer training.</v>

5813
02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:34.120
<v Speaker 4>Trauma fights,</v>

5814
02:35:34.210 --> 02:35:37.930
<v Speaker 4>some high level fights against some big guys for a long career.</v>

5815
02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:38.890
<v Speaker 4>There was all that too.</v>

5816
02:35:38.930 --> 02:35:40.870
<v Speaker 4>I leave and changed his style of,</v>

5817
02:35:41.010 --> 02:35:41.910
<v Speaker 4>of training through.</v>

5818
02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:43.390
<v Speaker 4>He stopped with the weight lift.</v>

5819
02:35:43.391 --> 02:35:45.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't think sometimes guys just getting old,</v>

5820
02:35:45.431 --> 02:35:46.570
<v Speaker 4>they might not be on steroids.</v>

5821
02:35:46.571 --> 02:35:48.550
<v Speaker 4>Just get old washed up.</v>

5822
02:35:48.820 --> 02:35:49.660
<v Speaker 4>That shit happens.</v>

5823
02:35:49.661 --> 02:35:50.650
<v Speaker 4>We get punched in the face.</v>

5824
02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:53.781
<v Speaker 5>That definitely happened.</v>

5825
02:35:53.781 --> 02:35:54.614
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5826
02:35:56.440 --> 02:35:56.771
<v Speaker 4>Can we go,</v>

5827
02:35:56.771 --> 02:35:57.630
<v Speaker 4>do you guys think Frank Mir,</v>

5828
02:35:57.640 --> 02:35:58.473
<v Speaker 4>big foot,</v>

5829
02:35:58.930 --> 02:35:59.763
<v Speaker 4>big foot.</v>

5830
02:36:00.190 --> 02:36:01.180
<v Speaker 4>I've got to go with Frank Mir.</v>

5831
02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:04.650
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like the way big foot went down against our Lawsky looked.</v>

5832
02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:05.650
<v Speaker 4>We looked crazy.</v>

5833
02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:06.590
<v Speaker 4>It looked like his,</v>

5834
02:36:06.590 --> 02:36:07.810
<v Speaker 4>his chin had evaporated.</v>

5835
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:09.340
<v Speaker 4>Also taken frank man.</v>

5836
02:36:09.460 --> 02:36:10.293
<v Speaker 4>Surprisingly.</v>

5837
02:36:10.810 --> 02:36:11.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5838
02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:12.370
<v Speaker 4>You're going Frank Mir from Joe.</v>

5839
02:36:12.970 --> 02:36:13.990
<v Speaker 4>Not For me.</v>

5840
02:36:14.050 --> 02:36:14.883
<v Speaker 4>For Frank.</v>

5841
02:36:14.950 --> 02:36:15.061
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5842
02:36:15.061 --> 02:36:16.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying you're going with,</v>

5843
02:36:16.660 --> 02:36:16.901
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5844
02:36:16.901 --> 02:36:17.734
<v Speaker 4>I'm going with mirror.</v>

5845
02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:19.270
<v Speaker 4>I think miracle win this fight,</v>

5846
02:36:20.200 --> 02:36:23.430
<v Speaker 4>but I wouldn't be surprised if big foot took it to him by submission.</v>

5847
02:36:23.530 --> 02:36:24.363
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5848
02:36:24.850 --> 02:36:28.900
<v Speaker 4>he could win by submission because big foot's never been submitted and he's a</v>

5849
02:36:28.901 --> 02:36:30.370
<v Speaker 4>black belt while he's giant.</v>

5850
02:36:30.730 --> 02:36:31.330
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

5851
02:36:31.330 --> 02:36:33.580
<v Speaker 4>Do you see one fader and went for that leg lock on his laugh?</v>

5852
02:36:33.780 --> 02:36:34.241
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

5853
02:36:34.241 --> 02:36:34.600
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

5854
02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:34.871
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

5855
02:36:34.871 --> 02:36:35.261

5862
02:36:43.810 --> 02:36:44.111
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5863
02:36:44.111 --> 02:36:45.760

5864
02:36:45.790 --> 02:36:46.091

5865
02:36:46.091 --> 02:36:47.170
<v Speaker 4>you worked hard for this.</v>

5866
02:36:47.940 --> 02:36:49.980
<v Speaker 4>He had Vicki Lynn down on his corner and did a lot of,</v>

5867
02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:50.980
<v Speaker 4>a lot of training with him.</v>

5868
02:36:51.370 --> 02:36:52.530
<v Speaker 4>A lot of work on his grappling.</v>

5869
02:36:59.830 --> 02:37:00.700
<v Speaker 4>Fucking hard man.</v>

5870
02:37:00.701 --> 02:37:01.534
<v Speaker 4>At this age,</v>

5871
02:37:02.170 --> 02:37:02.770
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>

5872
02:37:02.770 --> 02:37:04.600
<v Speaker 4>You gotta realize frank was 22,</v>

5873
02:37:04.601 --> 02:37:06.940
<v Speaker 4>he's been fighting the UFC isn't tired life.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5878
02:37:10.691 --> 02:37:12.820
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get a chance to see the early ones in person.</v>

5879
02:37:12.850 --> 02:37:14.320
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get a chance to see him in person.</v>

5880
02:37:14.321 --> 02:37:16.430
<v Speaker 4>And like until</v>

02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:21.021
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

02:37:24.530 --> 02:37:25.520
<v Speaker 3>I saw the,</v>

5889
02:37:26.140 --> 02:37:26.690
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

5890
02:37:26.690 --> 02:37:27.620
<v Speaker 3>Tim Silvia fight.</v>

5891
02:37:27.650 --> 02:37:28.520
<v Speaker 3>I was there for that,</v>

5892
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:32.960
<v Speaker 3>talking to Tim in the octagon and we wanted to keep fighting and then we showed</v>

5893
02:37:32.961 --> 02:37:33.510
<v Speaker 3>them the video,</v>

5894
02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:34.460
<v Speaker 3>his arm getting snapped.</v>

5895
02:37:34.490 --> 02:37:34.850
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

5896
02:37:34.850 --> 02:37:35.181
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5897
02:37:35.181 --> 02:37:35.960
<v Speaker 3>and then you realize like,</v>

5898
02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:36.650
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5899
02:37:36.650 --> 02:37:38.190
<v Speaker 3>and then the shock sets and you're like,</v>

5900
02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:39.110
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get to the hospital.</v>

5901
02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:39.500
<v Speaker 3>He thought,</v>

5902
02:37:39.500 --> 02:37:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

5903
02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:42.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5904
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:45.680
<v Speaker 3>I just appreciate what frank stands for and how long he's been doing it.</v>

5905
02:37:45.681 --> 02:37:46.520
<v Speaker 3>And he's relevant.</v>

5906
02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:50.330
<v Speaker 3>And my favorite UFC fight of all times when he beat Brock Lesner,</v>

5907
02:37:50.390 --> 02:37:55.160
<v Speaker 3>I felt like it was the MMA community against the WWE community when he beat him.</v>

5908
02:37:55.161 --> 02:37:57.050
<v Speaker 3>I never chaired for so and so hard in my life.</v>

5909
02:37:57.080 --> 02:37:57.950
<v Speaker 3>But how crazy is it?</v>

5910
02:37:57.951 --> 02:38:00.380
<v Speaker 3>Take a guy his second pro fight,</v>

5911
02:38:00.650 --> 02:38:03.920
<v Speaker 3>you make them fight a former UFC champion in his prime.</v>

5912
02:38:04.150 --> 02:38:04.670
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

5913
02:38:04.670 --> 02:38:05.301
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous,</v>

5914
02:38:05.301 --> 02:38:06.134
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

5915
02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:06.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5916
02:38:06.650 --> 02:38:10.760
<v Speaker 3>Brock Lesnar got brought along worse than any fucking fighter ever in the</v>

5917
02:38:10.761 --> 02:38:14.660
<v Speaker 3>history of fighting and still managed to outrun the odds.</v>

5918
02:38:14.810 --> 02:38:16.680
<v Speaker 3>I still managed to speak of a freak.</v>

5919
02:38:16.681 --> 02:38:17.120
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

5920
02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:17.690
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>

5921
02:38:17.690 --> 02:38:18.201
<v Speaker 3>Beat Randy.</v>

5922
02:38:18.201 --> 02:38:20.150
<v Speaker 3>Go towards fourth fucking pro fight.</v>

5923
02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:20.811
<v Speaker 3>How?</v>

5924
02:38:20.811 --> 02:38:21.630
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

5925
02:38:21.630 --> 02:38:22.463
<v Speaker 3>Ha.</v>

5926
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:24.650
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] knocked him out.</v>

5927
02:38:24.890 --> 02:38:28.670
<v Speaker 3>Beat heath herring and then he beats Randy coture third and fourth profile.</v>

5928
02:38:28.700 --> 02:38:29.810
<v Speaker 3>Are you fucking kidding me?</v>

5929
02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:31.070
<v Speaker 3>He gets submitted by frank,</v>

5930
02:38:31.071 --> 02:38:31.281
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5931
02:38:31.281 --> 02:38:31.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5932
02:38:31.550 --> 02:38:33.380
<v Speaker 3>Well the second fight with frank.</v>

5933
02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:34.280
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5934
02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:34.561
<v Speaker 3>Frank,</v>

5935
02:38:34.561 --> 02:38:35.394
<v Speaker 3>submit them.</v>

5936
02:38:35.450 --> 02:38:36.260
<v Speaker 3>And then uh,</v>

5937
02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:37.640
<v Speaker 3>after a Frankie fights,</v>

5938
02:38:37.641 --> 02:38:39.680
<v Speaker 3>heath herring steamrolls he heath herring.</v>

5939
02:38:41.270 --> 02:38:43.190
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how he remembers all this shit.</v>

5940
02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:47.750
<v Speaker 3>Got nothing else or now justified.</v>

5941
02:38:47.751 --> 02:38:49.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember anything,</v>

5942
02:38:49.191 --> 02:38:49.400
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5943
02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:50.420
<v Speaker 3>Just a couple of fights.</v>

5944
02:38:50.421 --> 02:38:53.090
<v Speaker 3>But that's not true because if you're talking about Jujitsu submissions,</v>

5945
02:38:53.450 --> 02:38:54.061
<v Speaker 3>positions,</v>

5946
02:38:54.061 --> 02:38:55.430
<v Speaker 3>submission transitions,</v>

5947
02:38:55.431 --> 02:38:56.031
<v Speaker 3>you could remember,</v>

5948
02:38:56.031 --> 02:38:56.650
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

5949
02:38:56.650 --> 02:38:58.880
<v Speaker 3>I see you go over moves and techniques.</v>

5950
02:38:58.881 --> 02:39:00.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm so behind the curve.</v>

5951
02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:01.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5952
02:39:01.700 --> 02:39:02.271
<v Speaker 3>that's different.</v>

5953
02:39:02.271 --> 02:39:02.751
<v Speaker 3>To start taking.</v>

5954
02:39:02.751 --> 02:39:04.670
<v Speaker 3>Like the odds are,</v>

5955
02:39:04.671 --> 02:39:06.470
<v Speaker 3>is bigfoot knocks him out in the first round.</v>

5956
02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:07.220
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

5957
02:39:07.220 --> 02:39:08.150
<v Speaker 3>the highest thoughts.</v>

5958
02:39:08.570 --> 02:39:10.220
<v Speaker 3>Other guys out there that can know,</v>

5959
02:39:10.310 --> 02:39:11.360
<v Speaker 3>they know every,</v>

5960
02:39:11.361 --> 02:39:15.670
<v Speaker 3>like you could do a UFC trivia game or jeopardy where they know you could say u</v>

5961
02:39:15.671 --> 02:39:19.440
<v Speaker 3>of c 152 and that could just rattle off fans,</v>

5962
02:39:19.460 --> 02:39:20.400
<v Speaker 3>not fans for sure.</v>

5963

<v Speaker 3>You're there.</v>

5964
02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:22.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure Joe's probably damn close.</v>

5965
02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:24.410
<v Speaker 3>Kenny Florian is really good too.</v>

5966
02:39:24.411 --> 02:39:25.370
<v Speaker 3>Kenny knows his shit.</v>

5967
02:39:25.430 --> 02:39:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Every UFC,</v>

5968
02:39:26.391 --> 02:39:27.080
<v Speaker 3>the number,</v>

5969
02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:28.630
<v Speaker 3>the headline or the Co headliner.</v>

5970
02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:30.170
<v Speaker 3>I bet there's some fans for sure.</v>

5971
02:39:30.171 --> 02:39:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Easy rain men can go into the prelims and give you that fucking results of the</v>

5972
02:39:34.971 --> 02:39:35.671
<v Speaker 3>prelims.</v>

5973
02:39:35.671 --> 02:39:35.971
<v Speaker 3>The Guy,</v>

5974
02:39:35.971 --> 02:39:37.370
<v Speaker 3>I call him the fight pass king.</v>

5975
02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:40.910
<v Speaker 3>He knows all that bypass guys out there.</v>

5980
02:39:49.350 --> 02:39:50.600
<v Speaker 3>Some guys get mad at me.</v>

5981
02:39:50.900 --> 02:39:53.060
<v Speaker 3>If I'm watching these and I don't know a guy,</v>

5982
02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:54.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Just watch him.</v>

5988
02:39:57.590 --> 02:39:58.640
<v Speaker 3>I used to know him all.</v>

5989
02:39:58.670 --> 02:39:59.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't know shit anymore.</v>

5990

<v Speaker 3>I know big foot though.</v>

5991
02:40:02.430 --> 02:40:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Deal with a giant head.</v>

5992
02:40:04.370 --> 02:40:06.050
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things that I think they fucked up,</v>

5993
02:40:06.051 --> 02:40:06.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5994
02:40:06.690 --> 02:40:07.230
<v Speaker 3>they should have,</v>

5995
02:40:07.230 --> 02:40:10.910
<v Speaker 3>should have kept going was when you were doing those in between rounds,</v>

5996
02:40:11.210 --> 02:40:12.830
<v Speaker 3>you would do your assessment of who won.</v>

5997
02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:14.400
<v Speaker 3>They didn't like it.</v>

5998
02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:15.300
<v Speaker 3>I liked your,</v>

5999

6000
02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:19.080
<v Speaker 3>I really let the commission didn't like it because Eddie's,</v>

6001
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Eddie would have a rationalization.</v>

6002
02:40:20.731 --> 02:40:21.600
<v Speaker 3>He would have a voice,</v>

6003
02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:22.531
<v Speaker 3>he'd have to be,</v>

6004
02:40:22.531 --> 02:40:25.130
<v Speaker 3>he could be speakers mind just like Harold [inaudible].</v>

6005
02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:29.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it makes it exciting for people because Eddie had it broken down.</v>

6006
02:40:29.310 --> 02:40:29.991
<v Speaker 3>I watched him do it.</v>

6007
02:40:29.991 --> 02:40:31.260
<v Speaker 3>He sat next to me during the fights.</v>

6008
02:40:31.590 --> 02:40:32.070
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

6009
02:40:32.070 --> 02:40:35.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was fucking dilligent his shit and he made his own system instead of</v>

6010
02:40:35.701 --> 02:40:39.090
<v Speaker 3>falling instead of just like looking at the scorecard and trying to figure it</v>

6011
02:40:39.091 --> 02:40:39.271
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

6012
02:40:39.271 --> 02:40:41.310
<v Speaker 3>Eddie had a whole breakdown of like kicks,</v>

6013
02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:42.213
<v Speaker 3>takedown,</v>

6014
02:40:42.390 --> 02:40:44.220
<v Speaker 3>shorthand and shorthand.</v>

6015
02:40:44.221 --> 02:40:46.680
<v Speaker 3>Everything had two guys and I'd look at the fight and go,</v>

6016
02:40:46.710 --> 02:40:47.041
<v Speaker 3>kick,</v>

6017
02:40:47.041 --> 02:40:47.431
<v Speaker 3>punch,</v>

6018
02:40:47.431 --> 02:40:47.761
<v Speaker 3>punch,</v>

6019
02:40:47.761 --> 02:40:48.031
<v Speaker 3>punch,</v>

6020
02:40:48.031 --> 02:40:48.570
<v Speaker 3>kick,</v>

6021
02:40:48.570 --> 02:40:49.403
<v Speaker 3>take down,</v>

6022
02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:50.341
<v Speaker 3>take down,</v>

6023
02:40:50.341 --> 02:40:54.570
<v Speaker 3>attempt left knee and then after that round they're giving me 30 seconds to make</v>

6024
02:40:54.571 --> 02:40:55.404
<v Speaker 3>my assessment.</v>

6025
02:40:55.410 --> 02:40:56.790
<v Speaker 3>I got to go back and review.</v>

6026
02:40:56.880 --> 02:40:58.260
<v Speaker 3>If you don't write it down like that,</v>

6027
02:40:58.380 --> 02:40:59.280
<v Speaker 3>you don't remember.</v>

6028
02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:00.570
<v Speaker 3>You don't remember shit.</v>

6029
02:41:00.640 --> 02:41:01.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6030
02:41:01.020 --> 02:41:02.100
<v Speaker 3>You to go back and look at it.</v>

6031
02:41:02.101 --> 02:41:02.820
<v Speaker 3>So now I go,</v>

6032
02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:04.660
<v Speaker 3>I reviewed her that he landed two punches there.</v>

6033
02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:06.090
<v Speaker 3>This guy landed a big knee.</v>

6034
02:41:06.091 --> 02:41:07.890
<v Speaker 3>Which one was more subtle and then Bam.</v>

6035
02:41:07.980 --> 02:41:10.350
<v Speaker 3>I have something to look at when I'm so a lot to look at it.</v>

6036
02:41:10.350 --> 02:41:14.790
<v Speaker 3>So I'd much rather have that than have these three fucking square's judging my</v>

6037
02:41:14.791 --> 02:41:15.240
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

6038
02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:15.870
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous.</v>

6039
02:41:15.870 --> 02:41:16.501
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous,</v>

6040
02:41:16.501 --> 02:41:17.041
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

6041
02:41:17.041 --> 02:41:18.630
<v Speaker 3>Still to this sport.</v>

6042
02:41:18.631 --> 02:41:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I think it's still important to have no,</v>

6043
02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:24.100
<v Speaker 3>those schlubs judging what's important.</v>

6044
02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:24.900
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with it?</v>

6045
02:41:24.900 --> 02:41:25.733
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

6046
02:41:25.820 --> 02:41:26.770
<v Speaker 3>Are you drunk?</v>

6047
02:41:27.860 --> 02:41:28.693
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>

6048
02:41:28.890 --> 02:41:30.370
<v Speaker 3>You got to listen.</v>

6049
02:41:31.290 --> 02:41:31.711
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

6050
02:41:31.711 --> 02:41:34.380
<v Speaker 3>Sam as stars and you don't think you don't think,</v>

6051
02:41:34.381 --> 02:41:35.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6052
02:41:35.100 --> 02:41:37.770
<v Speaker 3>if you were running the casinos and you'll run and all that shit,</v>

6053
02:41:37.771 --> 02:41:38.604
<v Speaker 3>all the bedding,</v>

6054
02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:43.640
<v Speaker 3>you don't think that it's good to have ball guys that judges good to blame the</v>

6055
02:41:46.141 --> 02:41:47.620
<v Speaker 3>stupid judge like kit,</v>

6056
02:41:47.621 --> 02:41:48.454
<v Speaker 3>stupid judge.</v>

6057
02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:54.090
<v Speaker 3>No corruption and casino.</v>

6058
02:41:54.120 --> 02:41:55.010
<v Speaker 3>It's talking about it as me.</v>

6059
02:41:55.430 --> 02:41:57.910
<v Speaker 3>He's going into corruption and this is another level.</v>

6060
02:41:57.930 --> 02:41:58.763
<v Speaker 3>He can't help it.</v>

6061
02:41:59.950 --> 02:42:01.710
<v Speaker 3>I was running the casinos.</v>

6062
02:42:02.010 --> 02:42:04.460
<v Speaker 3>I would want schlubs in there so that if,</v>

6063
02:42:04.590 --> 02:42:06.000
<v Speaker 3>if we looked at the numbers and we're like,</v>

6064
02:42:06.001 --> 02:42:06.360
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

6065
02:42:06.360 --> 02:42:08.070
<v Speaker 3>we need this decision or that decision.</v>

6066
02:42:08.130 --> 02:42:08.940
<v Speaker 3>Brian talked to him.</v>

6067
02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:09.773
<v Speaker 3>I want to say,</v>

6068
02:42:10.310 --> 02:42:10.590
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>

6069
02:42:10.590 --> 02:42:11.423
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you this.</v>

6070
02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:12.593
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you this.</v>

6071
02:42:12.770 --> 02:42:13.050
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6072
02:42:13.050 --> 02:42:13.650
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>

6073
02:42:13.650 --> 02:42:17.550
<v Speaker 3>I've had a judge tell me I'm not gonna say his name and somewhere else.</v>

6074
02:42:17.551 --> 02:42:18.361
<v Speaker 3>I've mentioned his name,</v>

6075
02:42:18.361 --> 02:42:19.570
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not gonna mention his name tonight.</v>

6076
02:42:19.780 --> 02:42:20.700
<v Speaker 3>A judge,</v>

6077
02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:22.020
<v Speaker 3>a very popular,</v>

6078
02:42:22.021 --> 02:42:24.510
<v Speaker 3>popular UFC judge has told me to it.</v>

6079
02:42:24.570 --> 02:42:25.920
<v Speaker 3>I'll say it's judge Judy.</v>

6080
02:42:26.250 --> 02:42:31.250
<v Speaker 3>Judge Judy told me that three separate occasions on three separate occasions,</v>

6081
02:42:31.530 --> 02:42:36.200
<v Speaker 3>he wrote down a score for one fighter and then when Bruce Buffer Reddit,</v>

6082
02:42:36.650 --> 02:42:39.450
<v Speaker 3>it was for the other guy three different times.</v>

6083
02:42:39.660 --> 02:42:42.420
<v Speaker 3>This guy told me to my face three different times.</v>

6084
02:42:42.421 --> 02:42:43.380
<v Speaker 3>He's very funny to me.</v>

6085
02:42:43.381 --> 02:42:44.580
<v Speaker 3>Never want to fight against Eddie.</v>

6086
02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:47.340
<v Speaker 3>He might be an idiot and I don't know.</v>

6087
02:42:47.420 --> 02:42:50.680
<v Speaker 3>He might be looking for a fall guy as the commission being the same.</v>

6088
02:42:50.690 --> 02:42:52.340
<v Speaker 3>That's what I would say judging.</v>

6089
02:42:52.950 --> 02:42:54.870
<v Speaker 3>That's what I would do if I was running the casinos.</v>

6090
02:42:55.750 --> 02:42:57.420
<v Speaker 3>Let's watch the fight we were about to watch.</v>

6091
02:42:57.421 --> 02:42:59.430
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to get fucking killed here.</v>

6092
02:43:00.150 --> 02:43:02.010
<v Speaker 3>These are just my crazy assumptions.</v>

6093
02:43:02.011 --> 02:43:05.010
<v Speaker 3>They're both 35 answering story about big foot Silva.</v>

6094
02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:05.970
<v Speaker 3>When Shane,</v>

6095
02:43:05.970 --> 02:43:10.740
<v Speaker 3>he was like four no five [inaudible] a lead XC had a big foot Silva's contract.</v>

6096
02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:12.520
<v Speaker 3>They offered chain and contract</v>

6097
02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:13.750
<v Speaker 1>to fight big foot Silva.</v>

6098
02:43:13.780 --> 02:43:15.370
<v Speaker 1>That fight would have been insane.</v>

6099
02:43:15.460 --> 02:43:16.293
<v Speaker 1>Kazoos uh,</v>

6100
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Shane car one who's fucking prime?</v>

6101
02:43:18.490 --> 02:43:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Bigfoot silver in his prime.</v>

6102
02:43:20.290 --> 02:43:21.250
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to fight,</v>

6103
02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:22.930
<v Speaker 1>but then the UFC offered Shane.</v>

6104
02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:25.160
<v Speaker 1>So then Shane went to the UFC instead of finding bigfoot.</v>

6105
02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:25.721
<v Speaker 1>So once,</v>

6106
02:43:25.721 --> 02:43:28.510
<v Speaker 1>when Shane was what looked like healthy men,</v>

6107
02:43:28.570 --> 02:43:30.460
<v Speaker 1>healthy human master of the universe.</v>

6108
02:43:31.210 --> 02:43:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Dude coming in at two 61 in this five,</v>

6109
02:43:34.061 --> 02:43:34.421
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

6110
02:43:34.421 --> 02:43:36.970
<v Speaker 1>we're usually walking around at two 45 I believe.</v>

6111
02:43:36.971 --> 02:43:38.090
<v Speaker 1>No two seats.</v>

6112
02:43:38.110 --> 02:43:38.760
<v Speaker 1>A lot of weight.</v>

6113
02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:41.500
<v Speaker 1>He got pretty heavy like right after he fought Brock foot.</v>

6114
02:43:41.501 --> 02:43:42.730
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of acne on his back.</v>

6115
02:43:42.731 --> 02:43:43.550
<v Speaker 1>That's normal.</v>

6116
02:43:43.550 --> 02:43:44.620
<v Speaker 1>That's normal in Brazil.</v>

6132
02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:11.411
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6224
02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:10.160
<v Speaker 1>That combination was just like video game named Mark Cord versus</v>

6225
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Tyron Woodley.</v>

6240
02:46:24.021 --> 02:46:25.820
<v Speaker 2>He looks much fast than they just looked recently.</v>

6241
02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Frank lives light on his feet.</v>

6242
02:46:28.221 --> 02:46:29.240
<v Speaker 2>He's moving around a lot.</v>

6243
02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:30.640
<v Speaker 2>He's moving around like,</v>

6244
02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:31.473
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6245
02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6246
02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:33.230
<v Speaker 2>well that's what he needs,</v>

6247
02:46:33.231 --> 02:46:33.561
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6248
02:46:33.561 --> 02:46:34.700
<v Speaker 2>That's what he was holding him back.</v>

6249
02:46:34.701 --> 02:46:36.830
<v Speaker 2>He was to plotting and he got two big,</v>

6250
02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:40.010
<v Speaker 2>big foot always has to worry about getting hit.</v>

6251
02:46:40.011 --> 02:46:40.340
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

6252
02:46:40.340 --> 02:46:42.770
<v Speaker 2>He knows his chin is just not that good anymore.</v>

6253
02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.100
<v Speaker 2>When our Lawsky clipped him with at one point,</v>

6254
02:46:46.101 --> 02:46:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean it didn't,</v>

6255
02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:49.880
<v Speaker 2>but before that eight punches from the hardest puncher ever.</v>

6256
02:46:49.881 --> 02:46:53.780
<v Speaker 2>Really in the USA when he was Jews to the titty.</v>

6257
02:46:53.781 --> 02:46:54.710
<v Speaker 2>Either way though,</v>

6258
02:46:54.711 --> 02:46:55.131
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

6259
02:46:55.131 --> 02:46:56.150
<v Speaker 2>but that affects you.</v>

6260
02:46:56.151 --> 02:46:56.810
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you.</v>

6261
02:46:56.810 --> 02:46:57.501
<v Speaker 2>That affects you.</v>

6262
02:46:57.501 --> 02:46:58.334
<v Speaker 2>It has to.</v>

6263
02:46:58.580 --> 02:47:00.290
<v Speaker 2>It just only makes sense that it does.</v>

6264
02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:01.340
<v Speaker 2>How ironic.</v>

6265
02:47:01.580 --> 02:47:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it weird?</v>

6266
02:47:02.300 --> 02:47:04.200
<v Speaker 2>His arms look really skinny on.</v>

6267
02:47:04.250 --> 02:47:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

6268
02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:04.881
<v Speaker 2>Hey man,</v>

6269
02:47:04.881 --> 02:47:05.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm going crazy.</v>

6270
02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:05.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6271
02:47:05.780 --> 02:47:06.330
<v Speaker 2>they don't look,</v>

6272
02:47:06.330 --> 02:47:06.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6273
02:47:06.610 --> 02:47:07.443
<v Speaker 2>they don't look big at all.</v>

6274
02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:09.860
<v Speaker 2>They look like Brian Collins arms on a big body</v>

6275
02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:12.800
<v Speaker 2>like coil vipers.</v>

6276
02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:14.900
<v Speaker 2>The bones underneath them.</v>

6277
02:47:14.901 --> 02:47:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I like telephone poles just to make [inaudible] it's over.</v>

6278
02:47:19.520 --> 02:47:20.480
<v Speaker 2>It's over right there</v>

6279
02:47:22.790 --> 02:47:27.790
<v Speaker 2>still Donesville dance and you'll look good,</v>

6280
02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:30.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6281
02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:31.153
<v Speaker 2>The tank.</v>

6282
02:47:31.190 --> 02:47:32.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any American currency.</v>

6283
02:47:32.541 --> 02:47:33.270
<v Speaker 2>What did he say,</v>

6284
02:47:33.270 --> 02:47:34.103
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

6285
02:47:34.220 --> 02:47:35.210
<v Speaker 2>What did he just say?</v>

6286
02:47:36.410 --> 02:47:37.540

02:48:55.860 --> 02:48:56.910
<v Speaker 2>He's not talking to Prague.</v>

6345
02:48:57.320 --> 02:48:57.471
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

02:49:03.710 --> 02:49:04.271
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he'll read.</v>

02:49:04.271 --> 02:49:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Say it in the post interview right here though,</v>

02:49:09.481 --> 02:49:10.111
<v Speaker 1>that's a good point.</v>

6359
02:49:10.111 --> 02:49:10.980
<v Speaker 1>We should let him say it.</v>

6360
02:49:11.010 --> 02:49:11.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6361
02:49:11.281 --> 02:49:12.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe I can read those guys.</v>

6362
02:49:12.960 --> 02:49:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Well that's good news.</v>

6363
02:49:13.740 --> 02:49:13.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I watched you this.</v>

6373
02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:30.840
<v Speaker 1>So was he trying to do,</v>

6374
02:49:30.841 --> 02:49:31.950
<v Speaker 1>he told her I love you baby.</v>

6375
02:49:32.550 --> 02:49:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Don't talk.</v>

6376
02:49:33.150 --> 02:49:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Why would you talk?</v>

6377
02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:35.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing we were waiting for.</v>

6378
02:49:35.190 --> 02:49:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Sorry Buddy.</v>

02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:37.890

6381
02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

6382
02:49:43.270 --> 02:49:43.940
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't DC.</v>

6383
02:49:43.940 --> 02:49:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Daddy's making the money.</v>

6384
02:49:44.990 --> 02:49:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I think something along those lines and get some money.</v>

6385
02:49:47.810 --> 02:49:48.870
<v Speaker 1>That was bringing the bill.</v>

6386
02:49:49.250 --> 02:49:50.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6387
02:49:50.180 --> 02:49:51.500
<v Speaker 1>it's making that money.</v>

6388
02:49:51.530 --> 02:49:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6389
02:49:51.980 --> 02:49:52.850
<v Speaker 1>I love you baby.</v>

6390
02:49:52.851 --> 02:49:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Daddy's making that money.</v>

6391
02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:54.500
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

6392
02:49:54.500 --> 02:49:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

6393
02:49:55.070 --> 02:49:56.240
<v Speaker 1>That's the best thing he could could've said.</v>

6394
02:49:56.270 --> 02:49:59.270
<v Speaker 1>You Look God Damn Good Fucking Jab,</v>

6395
02:49:59.271 --> 02:50:01.280
<v Speaker 1>left hook combination was very pretty.</v>

6396
02:50:01.370 --> 02:50:03.650
<v Speaker 1>What do you do if your big foot retire?</v>

6397
02:50:04.420 --> 02:50:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Damn for him and keeping him apprised.</v>

6398
02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:07.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6399
02:50:08.270 --> 02:50:10.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he can fight without testosterone.</v>

6400
02:50:10.340 --> 02:50:13.580
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think it all the people that were on TRT,</v>

6401
02:50:13.820 --> 02:50:16.340
<v Speaker 1>that guy has the most legitimate reason to be on it.</v>

6402
02:50:16.341 --> 02:50:20.060
<v Speaker 1>He had a god damn cancer of his pituitary gland.</v>

6403
02:50:20.450 --> 02:50:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6404
02:50:20.750 --> 02:50:21.330
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

6405
02:50:21.330 --> 02:50:22.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful comment,</v>

6406
02:50:22.430 --> 02:50:24.080
<v Speaker 1>but if you have to have that to fight,</v>

6407
02:50:24.110 --> 02:50:24.943
<v Speaker 1>don't fight.</v>

6408
02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:25.401
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

6409
02:50:25.401 --> 02:50:26.234
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that noise.</v>

6410
02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:26.690
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

6411
02:50:26.690 --> 02:50:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck what she got.</v>

6412
02:50:28.460 --> 02:50:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

6413
02:50:29.930 --> 02:50:30.321
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

6414
02:50:30.321 --> 02:50:32.090
<v Speaker 1>If you have to be juice to the gills to compete,</v>

6415
02:50:32.480 --> 02:50:33.470
<v Speaker 1>how about you don't do it?</v>

6416
02:50:33.471 --> 02:50:34.390
<v Speaker 1>How would you go find something else?</v>

6417
02:50:34.470 --> 02:50:39.020
<v Speaker 1>But I think is his natural testosterone is absurdly low because of the fact that</v>

6418
02:50:39.021 --> 02:50:40.660
<v Speaker 1>he had a tumor on his butt tour.</v>

6419
02:50:40.690 --> 02:50:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Derek Lam and his coaches were talking about when they eliminated a</v>

6420
02:50:43.881 --> 02:50:44.511
<v Speaker 1>testosterone,</v>

6421
02:50:44.511 --> 02:50:45.980
<v Speaker 1>like how bad it is for him.</v>

6422
02:50:46.310 --> 02:50:47.143
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

6423
02:50:47.300 --> 02:50:47.870
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

6424
02:50:47.870 --> 02:50:48.703
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

6425
02:50:48.980 --> 02:50:49.491
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

6426
02:50:49.491 --> 02:50:50.170
<v Speaker 1>let me do it.</v>

6427
02:50:50.170 --> 02:50:50.391
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

6428
02:50:50.391 --> 02:50:51.081
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you're taking,</v>

6429
02:50:51.081 --> 02:50:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I get to do it.</v>

6430
02:50:51.710 --> 02:50:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it was legal.</v>

6431
02:50:52.581 --> 02:50:53.414
<v Speaker 1>Would you do it?</v>

6432
02:50:54.920 --> 02:50:55.753
<v Speaker 1>I'll say yes for him.</v>

6433
02:51:00.020 --> 02:51:02.730
<v Speaker 1>My client will not speak loud it himself.</v>

6434
02:51:02.740 --> 02:51:03.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit right.</v>

6435
02:51:04.450 --> 02:51:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Creamy just for recovery.</v>

6436
02:51:05.841 --> 02:51:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6437
02:51:06.190 --> 02:51:08.420
<v Speaker 1>And he looked at me and we'll answer your questions or Joe Rogan,</v>

6438
02:51:08.421 --> 02:51:08.991
<v Speaker 1>please look at me.</v>

6439
02:51:08.991 --> 02:51:09.824
<v Speaker 1>Eddie</v>

6440
02:51:10.870 --> 02:51:11.660
<v Speaker 1>saw.</v>

6441
02:51:11.660 --> 02:51:12.493
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>

6442
02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:13.783
<v Speaker 1>that's all I'm saying.</v>

6443
02:51:15.680 --> 02:51:16.440
<v Speaker 1>I really liked you.</v>

6444
02:51:16.440 --> 02:51:18.160
<v Speaker 1>What you said the other day about the um,</v>

6445
02:51:18.260 --> 02:51:19.100
<v Speaker 1>there isn't any negatives.</v>

6446
02:51:19.101 --> 02:51:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Just taking it.</v>

6447
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6448
02:51:20.420 --> 02:51:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6449
02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:22.130
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was a really good read.</v>

6450
02:51:22.760 --> 02:51:23.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6451
02:51:23.121 --> 02:51:24.030
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>

6452
02:51:24.050 --> 02:51:24.883
<v Speaker 1>it's tough man.</v>

6453
02:51:24.890 --> 02:51:27.710
<v Speaker 1>But with these new penalties that Dana White's talking about doing,</v>

6454
02:51:27.711 --> 02:51:28.461
<v Speaker 1>if they actually do it,</v>

6455
02:51:28.461 --> 02:51:31.220
<v Speaker 1>the two to four years suspension guys are,</v>

6456
02:51:31.250 --> 02:51:31.491
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6457
02:51:31.491 --> 02:51:32.690
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to risk it as much,</v>

6458
02:51:32.691 --> 02:51:33.201
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

6459
02:51:33.201 --> 02:51:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6460
02:51:33.380 --> 02:51:35.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the only way to go because when bigfoot got done,</v>

6461
02:51:35.751 --> 02:51:38.490
<v Speaker 1>then he's first fight back is for main of the main event in Brazil.</v>

6462
02:51:38.940 --> 02:51:40.490
<v Speaker 1>What did you guys think when it's,</v>

6463
02:51:40.491 --> 02:51:44.540
<v Speaker 1>for me a and John Jones both had those really weird tests.</v>

6464
02:51:44.930 --> 02:51:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Like they tested them afterwards and they both had a really low testosterone to</v>

6465
02:51:49.341 --> 02:51:50.870
<v Speaker 1>epitestosterone level.</v>

6466
02:51:51.080 --> 02:51:51.920
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing here?</v>

6467
02:51:51.950 --> 02:51:53.290
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>

6468
02:51:53.880 --> 02:51:54.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6469
02:51:54.230 --> 02:51:54.981
<v Speaker 1>you guys talk about,</v>

6470
02:51:54.981 --> 02:51:55.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6471
02:51:55.281 --> 02:51:55.820
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

6472
02:51:55.820 --> 02:51:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything positive.</v>

6473
02:52:00.910 --> 02:52:01.400
<v Speaker 1>I promise.</v>

6474
02:52:01.400 --> 02:52:01.971
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything.</v>

6475
02:52:01.971 --> 02:52:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

6476
02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:03.030
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

6477
02:52:03.030 --> 02:52:04.830
<v Speaker 1>well I shouldn't even ask you right now though,</v>

6478
02:52:04.880 --> 02:52:06.370
<v Speaker 1>isn't true from from</v>

6479
02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:08.920
<v Speaker 2>that when your testosterone is very low like that,</v>

6480
02:52:08.950 --> 02:52:10.180
<v Speaker 2>chances are you were,</v>

6481
02:52:10.810 --> 02:52:11.611
<v Speaker 2>you introduced.</v>

6482
02:52:11.611 --> 02:52:13.330
<v Speaker 2>That's what Victor Conte was saying,</v>

6483
02:52:13.331 --> 02:52:16.000
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's irresponsible to say unless you're,</v>

6484
02:52:16.130 --> 02:52:17.560
<v Speaker 2>you're testing these guys all the time.</v>

6485
02:52:17.740 --> 02:52:18.600
<v Speaker 2>It could be that there were,</v>

6486
02:52:18.610 --> 02:52:18.850
<v Speaker 2>bro,</v>

6487
02:52:18.850 --> 02:52:20.680
<v Speaker 2>I heard a bunch of different variables.</v>

6488
02:52:21.070 --> 02:52:22.380
<v Speaker 2>One of them that could be their,</v>

6489
02:52:22.490 --> 02:52:26.310
<v Speaker 2>their body was broken down because they're exhausted from training so much and</v>

6490
02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:28.840
<v Speaker 2>that their testosterone was low because they caught him in mid camp.</v>

6491
02:52:29.470 --> 02:52:30.610
<v Speaker 2>That could be the case.</v>

6492
02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:32.470
<v Speaker 2>It could be that they were both overtrained,</v>

6493
02:52:32.650 --> 02:52:35.750
<v Speaker 2>which is more likely than not if you want to look at it like,</v>

6494
02:52:36.040 --> 02:52:37.000
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

6495
02:52:37.001 --> 02:52:37.151
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

6496
02:52:37.151 --> 02:52:37.751
<v Speaker 2>I'm an idiot.</v>

6497
02:52:37.751 --> 02:52:40.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand those tests enough to tell you.</v>

6498
02:52:40.301 --> 02:52:44.950
<v Speaker 2>If that would cause someone to have a low testosterone to epitestosterone ratio.</v>

6499
02:52:45.130 --> 02:52:47.080
<v Speaker 2>We would have to bring in like Mark Gordon.</v>

6500
02:52:47.081 --> 02:52:50.050
<v Speaker 2>We have to bring in an endocrinologist to explain and you'd also have to do more</v>

6501
02:52:50.051 --> 02:52:50.770
<v Speaker 2>than one test.</v>

6502
02:52:50.770 --> 02:52:51.640
<v Speaker 2>And based off that,</v>

6503
02:52:51.670 --> 02:52:52.441
<v Speaker 2>that's why I don't come.</v>

6504
02:52:52.441 --> 02:52:52.810
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

6505
02:52:52.810 --> 02:52:55.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know those guys who the fuck knows,</v>

6506
02:52:55.561 --> 02:52:56.560
<v Speaker 2>but I know they uh,</v>

6507
02:52:56.600 --> 02:52:59.230
<v Speaker 2>they had like a legit guy doctor read the thing.</v>

6508
02:52:59.231 --> 02:53:01.750
<v Speaker 2>It was like there's no way their levels should be that low.</v>

6509
02:53:01.840 --> 02:53:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6510
02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:03.670
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know what's going on.</v>

6511
02:53:03.671 --> 02:53:04.001
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

6512
02:53:04.001 --> 02:53:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Maybe D D C in John's levels have always been low.</v>

6513
02:53:06.550 --> 02:53:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Let's crank the volume up so he could hear what Frank Mir also say.</v>

6514
02:53:10.030 --> 02:53:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Huge win for French.</v>

6515
02:53:11.221 --> 02:53:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>

6516
02:53:11.800 --> 02:53:12.611
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>

6517
02:53:12.611 --> 02:53:14.830
<v Speaker 2>but looked fucking great man.</v>

6518
02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:16.010
<v Speaker 2>It's cool to see these guys.</v>

6519
02:53:16.750 --> 02:53:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Your bodybuilding days.</v>

6520
02:53:18.390 --> 02:53:19.750
<v Speaker 2>What was the stove situation?</v>

6521
02:53:19.900 --> 02:53:20.111
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

6522
02:53:20.111 --> 02:53:20.531
<v Speaker 2>Let's hear this.</v>

6523
02:53:20.531 --> 02:53:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Let's say this.</v>

6524
02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:21.990
<v Speaker 2>I work on my lats.</v>

6525
02:53:21.990 --> 02:53:22.823
<v Speaker 2>Mosley.</v>

6526
02:53:26.200 --> 02:53:27.033
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

6527
02:53:27.350 --> 02:53:29.030
<v Speaker 2>No heavyweight is much higher than him.</v>

6528
02:53:36.290 --> 02:53:38.090
<v Speaker 2>I could've swore fracking in English.</v>

6529
02:53:45.930 --> 02:53:47.120
<v Speaker 5>She said to heal my body.</v>

6530
02:53:47.590 --> 02:53:50.390
<v Speaker 5>I got to of some good trainers and break brown.</v>

6531
02:53:51.210 --> 02:53:51.721
<v Speaker 2>How about Ricky?</v>

6532
02:53:51.721 --> 02:53:53.940
<v Speaker 2>Lindale right behind you looking all angry face.</v>

6533
02:53:54.750 --> 02:53:55.583
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

6534
02:54:00.710 --> 02:54:02.240
<v Speaker 5>Obviously it's a three switch to right.</v>

6535
02:54:04.470 --> 02:54:05.303
<v Speaker 2>You switched.</v>

6536
02:54:06.310 --> 02:54:07.240
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even notice that.</v>

6537
02:54:07.390 --> 02:54:07.690
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

6538
02:54:07.690 --> 02:54:08.523
<v Speaker 2>I didn't either.</v>

6539
02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:10.660
<v Speaker 2>That was such a beautiful combination.</v>

6540
02:54:10.661 --> 02:54:11.494
<v Speaker 2>Ma'Am.</v>

6541
02:54:14.250 --> 02:54:16.980
<v Speaker 2>I only move three inches to the beautiful.</v>

6542
02:54:17.580 --> 02:54:18.120
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

6543
02:54:18.120 --> 02:54:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Especially with those little gloves.</v>

6544
02:54:19.231 --> 02:54:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6545
02:54:19.590 --> 02:54:20.423
<v Speaker 2>Big Difference.</v>

6546
02:54:22.680 --> 02:54:24.990
<v Speaker 2>How much adjustment do you have to make defensively,</v>

6547
02:54:24.991 --> 02:54:25.291
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

6548
02:54:25.291 --> 02:54:26.340
<v Speaker 2>when you're working with guys,</v>

6549
02:54:26.350 --> 02:54:26.640
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

6550
02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:30.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've trained with MMA fighters and teaching them Moitai how much of</v>

6551
02:54:30.091 --> 02:54:30.924
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

6552
02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:35.460
<v Speaker 2>an adjustment you have to make because they have less coverage defensively</v>

6553
02:54:35.461 --> 02:54:36.750
<v Speaker 2>because of the smaller gloves.</v>

6554
02:54:36.751 --> 02:54:36.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6555
02:54:36.961 --> 02:54:39.540
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't until I started wearing them for getting ready for the fight that I</v>

6556
02:54:39.541 --> 02:54:41.490
<v Speaker 2>really appreciated how different it is.</v>

6557
02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:43.200
<v Speaker 2>It was like starting all over again.</v>

6558
02:54:43.201 --> 02:54:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Once I put the little ones on,</v>

6559
02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:47.040
<v Speaker 2>I thought I knew how to fight and you thought and you had a punch until I wore</v>

6560
02:54:47.041 --> 02:54:47.600
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

6561
02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:47.821
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

6562
02:54:47.821 --> 02:54:48.451
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

6563
02:54:48.451 --> 02:54:48.961
<v Speaker 2>I'm not punching.</v>

6564
02:54:48.961 --> 02:54:49.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm not punching on my knuckles.</v>

6565
02:54:49.951 --> 02:54:52.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm using my pinky and before I could close my eyes and hit the pads and their</v>

6566
02:54:52.891 --> 02:54:55.770
<v Speaker 2>problem and now I can't hit the pad in the same spot twice.</v>

6567
02:54:55.771 --> 02:54:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Even when I'm fully concentrating.</v>

6568
02:54:57.361 --> 02:54:58.171
<v Speaker 2>It's so difficult.</v>

6569
02:54:58.171 --> 02:54:58.920
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard.</v>

6570
02:54:58.920 --> 02:54:59.221
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6571
02:54:59.221 --> 02:55:00.240
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting man.</v>

6572
02:55:00.660 --> 02:55:00.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6573
02:55:00.931 --> 02:55:01.170
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

6574
02:55:01.170 --> 02:55:02.003
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6575
02:55:02.730 --> 02:55:03.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6576
02:55:03.170 --> 02:55:05.570
<v Speaker 1>completely different stuff from our hooks in Verena idea.</v>

6577
02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:06.591
<v Speaker 1>Great idea.</v>

6578
02:55:06.591 --> 02:55:11.591
<v Speaker 1>Kickboxing with MMA gloves in a [inaudible] it's pretty much MMA,</v>

6579
02:55:13.310 --> 02:55:14.960
<v Speaker 1>but with no ground because you're still at the knees.</v>

6580
02:55:14.961 --> 02:55:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Just do what the elbows,</v>

6581
02:55:15.801 --> 02:55:16.421
<v Speaker 1>you still got the,</v>

6582
02:55:16.421 --> 02:55:17.151
<v Speaker 1>the takedowns.</v>

6583
02:55:17.151 --> 02:55:18.490
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing changes and you get,</v>

6584
02:55:18.500 --> 02:55:21.980
<v Speaker 1>do you find guys press guys are up against the cage and blast him with elbows</v>

6585
02:55:21.981 --> 02:55:24.220
<v Speaker 1>and knees the body and hold them there and yeah,</v>

6586
02:55:24.230 --> 02:55:24.480
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

6587
02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:26.390
<v Speaker 1>what I found with my shows is say it,</v>

6588
02:55:26.391 --> 02:55:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I have 10 fights,</v>

6589
02:55:27.290 --> 02:55:28.340
<v Speaker 1>majority this.</v>

6590
02:55:28.370 --> 02:55:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Usually there will be seven go the distance because the guys are fighting</v>

6591
02:55:30.921 --> 02:55:33.710
<v Speaker 1>smarter as well because they know that they can't stand in the pocket and trade</v>

6592
02:55:33.711 --> 02:55:35.180
<v Speaker 1>anymore because the gloves are so small.</v>

6593
02:55:36.410 --> 02:55:38.210
<v Speaker 1>They're bringing a better a game now.</v>

6594
02:55:41.390 --> 02:55:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that after the fight,</v>

6595
02:55:42.561 --> 02:55:45.320
<v Speaker 1>you can't touch the top of your head if we're about four or five days,</v>

6596
02:55:45.321 --> 02:55:47.600
<v Speaker 1>you can't put your sunglasses on because your head's like a golf ball.</v>

6597
02:55:47.750 --> 02:55:48.583
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

6598
02:55:49.180 --> 02:55:50.013
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

6599
02:55:52.620 --> 02:55:55.220
<v Speaker 1>They're getting hit 50 to a hundred times a fight.</v>

6600
02:55:55.550 --> 02:55:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6601
02:55:56.170 --> 02:55:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6602
02:55:56.540 --> 02:55:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Easily.</v>

6603
02:55:57.030 --> 02:55:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6604
02:55:57.180 --> 02:55:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Tone.</v>

6605
02:55:57.800 --> 02:55:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

6606
02:55:57.980 --> 02:55:58.970
<v Speaker 1>50 Shung.</v>

6607
02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Remember when you described a fight that you had when you were in high school,</v>

6608
02:56:04.370 --> 02:56:07.340
<v Speaker 1>like it was two punches that you,</v>

6609
02:56:07.350 --> 02:56:08.930
<v Speaker 1>you talked about how you landed two punches,</v>

6610
02:56:08.931 --> 02:56:10.610
<v Speaker 1>put your friends like bitch you didn't land.</v>

6611
02:56:11.060 --> 02:56:12.160
<v Speaker 1>It was like two or three,</v>

6612
02:56:12.350 --> 02:56:15.180
<v Speaker 1>three if he didn't believe that shit like,</v>

6613
02:56:15.510 --> 02:56:19.160
<v Speaker 1>but in MMA fights like land 50 to a hundred solid,</v>

6614
02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:23.450
<v Speaker 1>he imagined describing that fight to somebody because you always described your</v>

6615
02:56:23.451 --> 02:56:23.841
<v Speaker 1>fight ride.</v>

6616
02:56:23.841 --> 02:56:24.740
<v Speaker 1>He tried to take me down,</v>

6617
02:56:24.741 --> 02:56:28.920
<v Speaker 1>then I punched him and then the PE teacher pulled us off trying to describe a</v>

6618
02:56:29.100 --> 02:56:33.560
<v Speaker 1>fight with 50 punches cause somebody you can't remember it had to take him</v>

6619
02:56:33.561 --> 02:56:34.394
<v Speaker 1>through the whole thing.</v>

6620
02:56:34.550 --> 02:56:38.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys that have to watch fights after they're over just to see</v>

6621
02:56:38.391 --> 02:56:39.290
<v Speaker 1>what happened to them.</v>

6622
02:56:39.291 --> 02:56:39.860
<v Speaker 1>They don't even remember.</v>

6623
02:56:39.860 --> 02:56:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

6624
02:56:39.860 --> 02:56:40.830
<v Speaker 4>remember what happened.</v>

6625
02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:44.820
<v Speaker 4>How many times have I interviewed fighters and they'll be honest like after the</v>

6626
02:56:44.821 --> 02:56:45.331
<v Speaker 4>second round,</v>

6627
02:56:45.331 --> 02:56:46.350
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea what happened.</v>

6628
02:56:46.770 --> 02:56:47.291
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

6629
02:56:47.291 --> 02:56:49.020
<v Speaker 4>That just woke up and it was the fifth round.</v>

6630
02:56:49.260 --> 02:56:51.270
<v Speaker 4>You know that's happened so many times man,</v>

6631
02:56:51.900 --> 02:56:52.733
<v Speaker 4>so much.</v>

6632
02:56:52.740 --> 02:56:53.251
<v Speaker 4>Most fights,</v>

6633
02:56:53.251 --> 02:56:55.200
<v Speaker 4>like if you asked me like go and have in the second round,</v>

6634
02:56:55.201 --> 02:56:56.640
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell you third round like Cro,</v>

6635
02:56:56.641 --> 02:56:58.290
<v Speaker 4>cop and I don't remember a lot from it.</v>

6636
02:56:58.700 --> 02:57:00.180
<v Speaker 4>And I just remember being in zone.</v>

6637
02:57:00.980 --> 02:57:02.610
<v Speaker 4>What was interesting about the Travis Brown fight,</v>

6638
02:57:03.390 --> 02:57:04.800
<v Speaker 4>I was rocked when,</v>

6639
02:57:04.860 --> 02:57:05.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6640
02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:08.160
<v Speaker 4>I went for a takedown and he wizard I in his hip,</v>

6641
02:57:08.161 --> 02:57:12.330
<v Speaker 4>landed on my head into the octagon and I remember watching it and you're like,</v>

6642
02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:12.541
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

6643
02:57:12.541 --> 02:57:14.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember any of this after this.</v>

6644
02:57:14.580 --> 02:57:15.413
<v Speaker 4>And I remember,</v>

6645
02:57:15.660 --> 02:57:17.160
<v Speaker 4>I just remember watching like,</v>

6646
02:57:17.161 --> 02:57:17.890
<v Speaker 4>Dang,</v>

6647
02:57:17.890 --> 02:57:19.950
<v Speaker 4>like the first time I've ever seen you were just,</v>

6648
02:57:20.100 --> 02:57:20.660
<v Speaker 4>I was more,</v>

6649
02:57:20.660 --> 02:57:21.493
<v Speaker 4>bell was a mess.</v>

6650
02:57:21.930 --> 02:57:22.121
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6651
02:57:22.121 --> 02:57:23.870
<v Speaker 4>I messed up just from his hip check that.</v>

6652
02:57:24.220 --> 02:57:24.380
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6653
02:57:24.380 --> 02:57:26.450
<v Speaker 4>the problem from the Mat.</v>

6654
02:57:26.460 --> 02:57:26.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6655
02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:28.890
<v Speaker 4>When you see a guy like George Saint Pierre,</v>

6656
02:57:28.891 --> 02:57:31.110
<v Speaker 4>that was like the greatest of all time.</v>

6657
02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:31.651
<v Speaker 4>And now,</v>

6658
02:57:31.651 --> 02:57:31.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6659
02:57:31.891 --> 02:57:33.210
<v Speaker 4>since he didn't test positive,</v>

6660
02:57:34.110 --> 02:57:35.790
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people are saying he's the greatest of all time.</v>

6661
02:57:35.791 --> 02:57:36.750
<v Speaker 4>100% person.</v>

6662
02:57:36.930 --> 02:57:37.141
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6663
02:57:37.141 --> 02:57:38.500
<v Speaker 4>he needs to understand how works.</v>

6664
02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:39.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6665
02:57:39.300 --> 02:57:40.530
<v Speaker 4>Well I see that argument.</v>

6666
02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:41.790
<v Speaker 4>It's a very logical argument,</v>

6667
02:57:41.820 --> 02:57:44.310
<v Speaker 4>but when you look at the numbers of times that he was hit,</v>

6668
02:57:44.690 --> 02:57:44.940
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

6669
02:57:44.940 --> 02:57:47.370
<v Speaker 4>we did a thing after his career was over.</v>

6670
02:57:47.371 --> 02:57:49.230
<v Speaker 4>It was over 800 times.</v>

6671
02:57:49.270 --> 02:57:50.670
<v Speaker 4>So Craig just in the octagon.</v>

6672
02:57:50.690 --> 02:57:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6673
02:57:50.950 --> 02:57:54.020
<v Speaker 4>Not Train on changes and not in TK.</v>

6674
02:57:54.021 --> 02:57:54.331
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6675
02:57:54.331 --> 02:57:56.910
<v Speaker 4>and the other organizations he fought for before he came to the UFC.</v>

6676
02:57:57.420 --> 02:58:00.000
<v Speaker 4>And you know what a lot of it was the last few fights,</v>

6677
02:58:00.090 --> 02:58:00.923
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it,</v>

6678
02:58:01.110 --> 02:58:02.040
<v Speaker 4>you got to hit more in</v>

6679
02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:05.280
<v Speaker 3>his last like four fights and all of his other fights.</v>

6680
02:58:05.880 --> 02:58:06.750
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing man.</v>

6681
02:58:07.110 --> 02:58:08.310
<v Speaker 3>Let's watch this again man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6689
02:58:17.340 --> 02:58:21.990

6690
02:58:22.020 --> 02:58:23.430
<v Speaker 3>That is tremendous right there.</v>

6724
02:59:11.011 --> 02:59:12.240
<v Speaker 3>time to recuperate.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's professional,</v>

6860
03:02:20.950 --> 03:02:21.641
<v Speaker 3>he's excellent,</v>

6861
03:02:21.641 --> 03:02:22.750
<v Speaker 3>but he's a sports guy.</v>

6862
03:02:22.960 --> 03:02:25.630
<v Speaker 3>He calls things wrong because the guys who don't train,</v>

6863
03:02:25.660 --> 03:02:27.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think Anik might train a little bit,</v>

6864
03:02:27.371 --> 03:02:29.410
<v Speaker 3>but they just didn't call anything.</v>

6865
03:02:29.450 --> 03:02:32.500
<v Speaker 3>Like technically the Christian called positions and they certainly shouldn't</v>

6866
03:02:32.501 --> 03:02:35.950
<v Speaker 3>call transitions or potential bats because they know they're going to miss some</v>

6867
03:02:35.951 --> 03:02:36.784
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

6868
03:02:37.460 --> 03:02:38.350
<v Speaker 3>You know why they're doing that.</v>

6869
03:02:38.351 --> 03:02:39.640
<v Speaker 3>They try to look down to chill.</v>

6870
03:02:39.641 --> 03:02:42.460
<v Speaker 3>Some guys do it because they try to pretend that they know what they're doing.</v>

6871
03:02:42.461 --> 03:02:43.300
<v Speaker 3>And I don't mean John,</v>

6872
03:02:43.480 --> 03:02:46.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm really talking to most about guys and the be leaks.</v>

6873
03:02:46.350 --> 03:02:46.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6874
03:02:46.690 --> 03:02:47.740
<v Speaker 3>John doesn't really do that,</v>

6875
03:02:47.741 --> 03:02:49.030
<v Speaker 3>but guys who do do it,</v>

6876
03:02:49.031 --> 03:02:51.280
<v Speaker 3>it's annoying because like I know what you're doing.</v>

6877
03:02:51.281 --> 03:02:53.260
<v Speaker 3>You're just trying to let everybody know your knowledge.</v>

6878
03:02:53.290 --> 03:02:53.381
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6879
03:02:53.381 --> 03:02:54.161
<v Speaker 3>this is what happened.</v>

6880
03:02:54.161 --> 03:02:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Is it when MMA first,</v>

6881
03:02:56.420 --> 03:02:56.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6882
03:02:56.840 --> 03:02:58.810
<v Speaker 3>started like king of the cage,</v>

6883
03:02:58.811 --> 03:02:59.644
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

6884
03:02:59.710 --> 03:03:01.720
<v Speaker 3>when I got thrown into the commentator spot,</v>

6885
03:03:02.710 --> 03:03:06.040
<v Speaker 3>the producers didn't even know the difference between a play by play and a color</v>

6886
03:03:06.041 --> 03:03:06.874
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

6887
03:03:07.150 --> 03:03:08.230
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't really know,</v>

6888
03:03:08.231 --> 03:03:09.400
<v Speaker 3>they just hear two people talking.</v>

6889
03:03:09.401 --> 03:03:10.630
<v Speaker 3>But if you really look into it,</v>

6890
03:03:10.870 --> 03:03:15.430
<v Speaker 3>oh there's like a newscaster guy who's holding it all together and then a color</v>

6891
03:03:15.431 --> 03:03:20.110
<v Speaker 3>guy who gets asked questions and terms in whenever there's a professional guy</v>

6892
03:03:20.111 --> 03:03:21.460
<v Speaker 3>and a guy that just chimes in.</v>

6893
03:03:21.790 --> 03:03:23.740
<v Speaker 3>And I had to learn that the hard way,</v>

6894
03:03:23.741 --> 03:03:24.070
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

6895
03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:27.070
<v Speaker 3>And what ended up happening is in the beginning that wasn't professional</v>

6896
03:03:27.071 --> 03:03:29.950
<v Speaker 3>broadcasters to play the field that play by play spot.</v>

6897
03:03:30.070 --> 03:03:33.580
<v Speaker 3>So they would just take anybody and anybody that would throw in there would do</v>

6898
03:03:33.581 --> 03:03:34.414
<v Speaker 3>color too.</v>

6899
03:03:34.450 --> 03:03:38.110
<v Speaker 3>He would be doing play by play and color so that guys like Mike Goldberg would</v>

6900
03:03:38.111 --> 03:03:38.950
<v Speaker 3>see this and go,</v>

6901
03:03:38.951 --> 03:03:39.700
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

6902
03:03:39.700 --> 03:03:40.301
<v Speaker 3>these guys,</v>

6903
03:03:40.301 --> 03:03:43.000
<v Speaker 3>these other guys are doing play by play and a little color.</v>

6904
03:03:43.150 --> 03:03:43.970
<v Speaker 3>So my Goldberg,</v>

6905
03:03:43.970 --> 03:03:44.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6906
03:03:44.140 --> 03:03:46.870
<v Speaker 3>he's trained kickboxing and he think when he sees it,</v>

6907
03:03:47.110 --> 03:03:47.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6908
03:03:47.590 --> 03:03:48.423
<v Speaker 3>he calls it right.</v>

6909
03:03:48.530 --> 03:03:50.950
<v Speaker 3>He calls the t because some stuff and people get angry.</v>

6910
03:03:50.951 --> 03:03:52.460
<v Speaker 3>But you know Gilbert,</v>

6911
03:03:52.461 --> 03:03:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Dick Nfl.</v>

6912
03:03:54.010 --> 03:03:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6913
03:03:54.640 --> 03:03:55.473
<v Speaker 3>I love gold.</v>

6914
03:03:57.050 --> 03:03:57.980
<v Speaker 3>He how dare</v>

6915
03:03:57.980 --> 03:04:01.850
<v Speaker 1>you not even get through the l before you got your fucking shitting smile</v>

6916
03:04:04.810 --> 03:04:05.930
<v Speaker 1>because he got fired.</v>

6917
03:04:06.500 --> 03:04:08.870
<v Speaker 1>He started arguing with people on Twitter.</v>

6918
03:04:09.200 --> 03:04:12.110
<v Speaker 1>People were saying he fucked up a couple of things and one of them was two guys</v>

6919
03:04:12.111 --> 03:04:12.801
<v Speaker 1>at the same name.</v>

6920
03:04:12.801 --> 03:04:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6921
03:04:13.100 --> 03:04:15.560
<v Speaker 1>They said the same number of different name Adam.</v>

6922
03:04:15.561 --> 03:04:20.200
<v Speaker 1>One guy like he called one receiver that the same number and the same name?</v>

6923
03:04:20.210 --> 03:04:20.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6924
03:04:20.350 --> 03:04:20.541
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6925
03:04:20.541 --> 03:04:20.771
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6926
03:04:20.771 --> 03:04:20.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6927
03:04:20.931 --> 03:04:21.610
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

6928
03:04:21.610 --> 03:04:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Like a receiver for another team.</v>

6929
03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:24.840
<v Speaker 1>You gotta make stop.</v>

6930
03:04:25.010 --> 03:04:25.731
<v Speaker 1>He called one team,</v>

6931
03:04:25.731 --> 03:04:26.840
<v Speaker 1>like the Detroit lions.</v>

6932
03:04:27.860 --> 03:04:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

6933
03:04:28.250 --> 03:04:29.800
<v Speaker 1>This was a lot of freshmen.</v>

6934
03:04:29.820 --> 03:04:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I love Mike.</v>

6935
03:04:30.540 --> 03:04:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Was this his first NFL game?</v>

6936
03:04:31.910 --> 03:04:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6937
03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:33.313
<v Speaker 1>And then he got fired.</v>

6938
03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:35.150
<v Speaker 1>He got online.</v>

6939
03:04:37.940 --> 03:04:41.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what we're talking about it all the time on your show.</v>

6940
03:04:41.270 --> 03:04:41.541
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

6943
03:04:43.011 --> 03:04:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>

6944
03:04:45.750 --> 03:04:46.550
<v Speaker 1>He will be,</v>

6945
03:04:46.550 --> 03:04:49.220
<v Speaker 1>he'll be talking to you about something and you'll say something.</v>

6946
03:04:49.250 --> 03:04:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Well No,</v>

6947
03:04:50.050 --> 03:04:53.180
<v Speaker 1>you all are talking about that first one.</v>

6948
03:04:53.181 --> 03:04:53.991
<v Speaker 1>I was Mike Goldberg Vendor.</v>

6949
03:04:53.991 --> 03:04:54.381
<v Speaker 1>You were like,</v>

6950
03:04:54.381 --> 03:04:54.801
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

6951
03:04:54.801 --> 03:04:55.940
<v Speaker 1>I think talking about the rest of the,</v>

6952
03:04:55.950 --> 03:04:57.710
<v Speaker 1>why would they're talking about commentators,</v>

6953
03:04:57.711 --> 03:04:59.140
<v Speaker 1>would they talk about little,</v>

6954
03:05:00.450 --> 03:05:01.610
<v Speaker 1>I think my goal,</v>

6955
03:05:01.611 --> 03:05:03.140
<v Speaker 1>but it is the best play by play guy.</v>

6956
03:05:03.910 --> 03:05:07.760
<v Speaker 1>A hundred percent 100% muy Thai references and all that stuff.</v>

6957
03:05:07.940 --> 03:05:09.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about that shit.</v>

03:06:21.170 --> 03:06:22.400
<v Speaker 1>let them enter into your life.</v>

7001
03:06:22.810 --> 03:06:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Just go more in this man.</v>

7002
03:06:24.320 --> 03:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

7003
03:06:25.550 --> 03:06:28.220
<v Speaker 1>the ones that hurt distinct ones that actually sting,</v>

7004
03:06:28.310 --> 03:06:31.220
<v Speaker 1>they're probably telling you some shit that you could use to hear and you hear</v>

7005
03:06:31.221 --> 03:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>that and then correct your game so that it doesn't ever possibly make any sense.</v>

7006
03:06:36.160 --> 03:06:39.530
<v Speaker 1>So that any criticism they have that's related to what they were talking about,</v>

7007
03:06:39.710 --> 03:06:40.680
<v Speaker 1>it's illogical.</v>

7008
03:06:40.740 --> 03:06:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

7009
03:06:40.910 --> 03:06:42.110
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense at all.</v>

7010
03:06:42.250 --> 03:06:43.083
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7011
03:06:43.220 --> 03:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>if someone tells me,</v>

7012
03:06:44.270 --> 03:06:44.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7013
03:06:44.541 --> 03:06:45.141
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

7014
03:06:45.141 --> 03:06:45.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7015
03:06:45.471 --> 03:06:45.741
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

7016
03:06:45.741 --> 03:06:46.670
<v Speaker 1>you're doing commentary,</v>

7017
03:06:46.671 --> 03:06:47.840
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what the fuck is going on.</v>

7018
03:06:47.841 --> 03:06:48.830
<v Speaker 1>When the fight goes to the ground,</v>

7019
03:06:48.831 --> 03:06:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll go,</v>

7020
03:06:49.240 --> 03:06:49.601
<v Speaker 1>ha ha,</v>

7021
03:06:49.601 --> 03:06:50.140
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

7022
03:06:50.140 --> 03:06:51.260
<v Speaker 1>that's adorable.</v>

7023
03:06:52.360 --> 03:06:53.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to fight with them.</v>

7024
03:06:56.160 --> 03:06:57.210
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to acknowledge it.</v>

7025
03:06:57.390 --> 03:06:58.021
<v Speaker 4>You acknowledge them.</v>

7026
03:06:58.021 --> 03:06:58.650
<v Speaker 4>People go,</v>

7027
03:06:58.650 --> 03:06:59.000
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

7028
03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:02.130
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan or Bryan County acknowledged this negative stuff.</v>

7029
03:07:02.131 --> 03:07:04.350
<v Speaker 4>So then more than exactly monsters come out.</v>

7030
03:07:04.390 --> 03:07:05.550
<v Speaker 4>I think we're running out of time here.</v>

7031
03:07:05.730 --> 03:07:06.563
<v Speaker 4>How much time we got.</v>

7032
03:07:06.810 --> 03:07:07.260
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
