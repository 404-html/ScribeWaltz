1
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.050
<v Speaker 1>The general good experience.</v>

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm here with Peter Joseph,</v>

3
00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:09.350
<v Speaker 1>future king of the world,</v>

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>future core leader for the zeitgeists movement.</v>

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.980
<v Speaker 1>You're uncomfortable with that,</v>

6
00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:13.814
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.243
<v Speaker 1>Growing up to</v>

8
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.140
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>

9
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.930
<v Speaker 1>You can accept that kings or wells for just you on the front of the ship,</v>

10
00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:25.340
<v Speaker 1>just like they didn't have to Capria king in the world playing right there was</v>

11
00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:26.240
<v Speaker 1>an awesome conversation,</v>

12
00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:26.511
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

13
00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:27.080
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

14
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.520
<v Speaker 1>you're an interesting dude and you've had a very strange sort of jumped into</v>

15
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:32.354
<v Speaker 1>this thing.</v>

16
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>It's been a ride and you're very young guy to be doing this too.</v>

17
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.700
<v Speaker 1>You're only 32 years old.</v>

18
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.961
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

19
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I would've thought you were much older than that.</v>

20
00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Just really young looking like if that a lot telling you,</v>

21
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>man of the CIA is going to probably come to you soon.</v>

22
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 1>They're going to try to either make you more of their own or kill you.</v>

23
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.180
<v Speaker 1>They can put me out of my misery.</v>

24
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna have to make a decision,</v>

25
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.270
<v Speaker 1>make a decision or use your powers of charisma to convince them to let you run</v>

26
00:00:56.271 --> 00:00:56.900
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

27
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would suggest work that ag a little sigh off on the CIA.</v>

28
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.561
<v Speaker 1>What do you think,</v>

29
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Brian?</v>

30
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I think he can do it.</v>

31
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.603
<v Speaker 1>I think I could do it.</v>

32
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.390
<v Speaker 1>It was just the most fucked damn podcast we've ever done.</v>

33
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

34
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.530
<v Speaker 1>How many chances have you done the podcast is in this setting of zero.</v>

35
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:10.400
<v Speaker 1>This is the first pocket.</v>

36
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I do lots of little radio shows that you could call podcasts,</v>

37
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.653
<v Speaker 1>but nothing like this.</v>

38
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.933
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

39
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.823
<v Speaker 1>out of the ordinary.</v>

40
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.660
<v Speaker 1>It was so scary as well.</v>

41
00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>That is true too,</v>

42
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:21.901
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no goddamn humor to be a 32 year old dude out there,</v>

44
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:28.310
<v Speaker 1>doom and gloom and doom to civilization.</v>

46
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.173
<v Speaker 1>Trying to be positive,</v>

47
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.691
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

48
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:30.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not all doom and gloom,</v>

49
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.090
<v Speaker 1>but I appreciate the flexibility of different angles going on.</v>

50
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.731
<v Speaker 1>It's fun,</v>

51
00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:34.971
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:36.170
<v Speaker 1>You can actually be yourself,</v>

53
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.190
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

55
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate the way that you accepted that and it didn't take yourself too</v>

56
00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:40.801
<v Speaker 1>serious.</v>

57
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:42.860
<v Speaker 1>That just jumped in and went with it.</v>

58
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.420
<v Speaker 1>So people need to find you.</v>

59
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.630

<v Speaker 1>What did you do it last time?</v>

86
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:28.601
<v Speaker 1>It was June though.</v>

87
00:02:28.601 --> 00:02:28.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

88
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.410
<v Speaker 1>22 20th schools got out like the public schools got out before that a couple</v>

89
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>weeks before that so it was going to be mad.</v>

90
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.961
<v Speaker 1>People are like,</v>

91
00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:36.741
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of school yet.</v>

92
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:37.610
<v Speaker 1>I was like that's a great point.</v>

93
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.301
<v Speaker 1>That's a great point.</v>

94
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:38.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:41.450
<v Speaker 1>He got a contract and final TD do three days of shooting fast.</v>

96
00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:41.970
<v Speaker 1>That's what he did.</v>

97
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.591
<v Speaker 1>He was a weekend.</v>

98
00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:44.480
<v Speaker 1>It was Sunday or Saturday.</v>

99
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:44.661
<v Speaker 1>Sunday.</v>

100
00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:44.961
<v Speaker 1>Monday.</v>

101
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:47.000
<v Speaker 1>You can do them at any time during the weekend.</v>

102
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.320
<v Speaker 1>And then I go to one day but I like three days off.</v>

103
00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:50.851
<v Speaker 1>Two or three days.</v>

104
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Cause sometimes people can't do it but they want to be able to catch on.</v>

105
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

106
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Just calling something Earth Day.</v>

107
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.520
<v Speaker 1>It makes people conscious.</v>

108
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Hell they have</v>

109
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.851
<v Speaker 2>not littering and,</v>

110
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:03.860
<v Speaker 2>and you know it's doing on Christmas,</v>

111
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Christmas,</v>

112
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 2>that's got to be warm enough to go around and shit.</v>

113
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 2>People have families and stuff.</v>

114
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 2>It's hard keeping away from mushrooms on Christmas though.</v>

115
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

116
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 2>you're more than what happens if you follow the whole Christmas.</v>

117
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Santa Claus is a mushroom thing.</v>

118
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.871
<v Speaker 2>People are like,</v>

119
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I want to make another thing.</v>

120
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 2>When you look at all the different correlations,</v>

121
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 2>like when you looked online,</v>

122
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 2>there's stuff I want to say.</v>

123
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:24.881
<v Speaker 2>How old was those?</v>

124
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

125
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.013
<v Speaker 2>those paintings are,</v>

126
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.531
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

127
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:27.364
<v Speaker 2>I want to say to,</v>

128
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 2>some of them were not old.</v>

129
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Some of them obviously are new,</v>

130
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 2>but there's a bunch of really old ones that were looking or where it comes from.</v>

131
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

132
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Like something to do with that.</v>

133
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.021
<v Speaker 2>With the Pagan holiday.</v>

134
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:35.801
<v Speaker 2>They took over like a,</v>

135
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 2>but they were that where the worship that probably had something to do with it,</v>

136
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 2>but it was also something to do with just the Siberian Shamans,</v>

137
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

138
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.581
<v Speaker 2>the whole idea was,</v>

139
00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 2>and then he comes from the North Pole pole while Siberia is like,</v>

140
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:48.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

141
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 2>near the North Pole and the Siberian shamans are the ones where they know known</v>

142
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 2>to use this Aminay to miscarry and mushroom.</v>

143
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.180
<v Speaker 2>That's what we were talking about with the reindeer too.</v>

144
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 2>I forgot to say that when people come out of their huts to pee,</v>

145
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 2>when they're having these mushrooms,</v>

146
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 2>timelines reindeers we'll knock them over to get their pis.</v>

147
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 2>They'll knock them over to get smaller disagrees with that being a theory</v>

148
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 2>because he said in Siberia there's no,</v>

149
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 2>they don't have that,</v>

150
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

151
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 2>that the um,</v>

152
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.681
<v Speaker 2>images and stuff,</v>

153
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 2>they don't have that of the flying reindeer.</v>

154
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 2>So it was all based on that.</v>

155
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.053
<v Speaker 2>They should have it too.</v>

156
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense maybe.</v>

157
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

158
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:23.164
<v Speaker 2>maybe</v>

159
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 2>maybe to that which is also possible that to them,</v>

160
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the intoxicated,</v>

161
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 2>like it didn't need to have the reindeer fly.</v>

162
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 2>Everybody kind of knew the reindeer were tripping balls off.</v>

163
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.611
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

164
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:36.771
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

165
00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 2>and then maybe people heard about it at the reindeer do eat these psychedelic</v>

166
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms that is a part of their diet.</v>

167
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 2>They actually liked them was pretty wild.</v>

168
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Right out.</v>

169
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 2>We know some psych of dogs kill animals like DMT kill sheep.</v>

170
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

171
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:52.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

172
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:56.870
<v Speaker 2>If they find the graph that's rich in certain DMT die,</v>

173
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.920
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

174
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.970
<v Speaker 2>the sheep will eat it and then fall on their back and their little legs kick up</v>

175
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 2>in the air and they fucking seizure to death.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What the shits it.</v>

219
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh and genetically somewhere about your job and the way we're doing it to a,</v>

220
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 2>it's the way of breeding out.</v>

221
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.870
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty much what the Holocaust was like.</v>

222
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Part of that was like a scrubber to the negative traits.</v>

223
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.700
<v Speaker 2>They won't be part of our site anymore.</v>

224
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.751
<v Speaker 2>They were doing it.</v>

225
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 2>The people that just go all over and they said the reason the crime went in New</v>

226
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 2>York went,</v>

227
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.423
<v Speaker 2>plummeted,</v>

228
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

229
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 2>recently at the hardest cause of education,</v>

230
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:37.131
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

231
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:37.964
<v Speaker 2>It's like no,</v>

232
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.310
<v Speaker 2>it's because abortion was legalized 18 years ago.</v>

233
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing.</v>

234
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 2>It can be traced to all the poor people.</v>

235
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Instead of having these kids and like making new criminals,</v>

236
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 2>they got rid of them so it plummeted 18 years later when they would have been</v>

237
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:52.610
<v Speaker 2>started being tried as adults.</v>

238
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

239
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:55.050
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

00:06:55.051 --> 00:06:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

241
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.111
<v Speaker 2>and they were doing it.</v>

242
00:06:56.111 --> 00:06:59.210
<v Speaker 2>It gets people's wills and like North Carolina that are people sterilizing</v>

243
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 2>though like the super white trash.</v>

244
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.750
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

245
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.480

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

251
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 2>They want to make now it's because of the education programs like Nope,</v>

252
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 2>you can't trace it back to anything else,</v>

253
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:15.010
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

254
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.480
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

255
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 2>and nobody wants to talk about it.</v>

256
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Where did you get this from?</v>

257
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Is all of my friend Kurt Metzger turned me on to it,</v>

258
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's all out there and all over the Internet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

263
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 2>if that is a true statistic.</v>

264

<v Speaker 2>And I made all wolf and turn it into a Shitzu.</v>

291
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:13.281
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

292
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:15.170
<v Speaker 2>you could give me paperwork all you want.</v>

293
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:15.621
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

294
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:17.050
<v Speaker 2>no one really knows how to fuck.</v>

295
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.780
<v Speaker 2>But he did that.</v>

296
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:18.920
<v Speaker 2>That's silly shit.</v>

297
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:20.003
<v Speaker 2>The fuck.</v>

298
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.610
<v Speaker 2>How did they make bulldogs?</v>

299
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.453
<v Speaker 2>Dobermans?</v>

300
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.770
<v Speaker 2>It's all from wolves.</v>

301
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>

302
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

303
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 2>How many generations did that tag?</v>

304
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did they exactly go about doing that?</v>

305
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.920
<v Speaker 2>I think do that from wold,</v>

306
00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:32.450
<v Speaker 2>but I'd have to be over like a billion years.</v>

307
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.463
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

308
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows they,</v>

309
00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:34.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

310
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:37.700
<v Speaker 2>they had said that it was a really recent discovery that it was a,</v>

311
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 2>it was all wolves.</v>

312
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.340
<v Speaker 2>They used to think that it was a bunch of,</v>

313
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:40.551
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

314
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Most dogs are a bunch of different wild candidates,</v>

315
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:43.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

316
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:44.860
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the word for it.</v>

317
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Kane needs Caney just broke off.</v>

318
00:08:46.431 --> 00:08:49.160
<v Speaker 2>And so they thought there was a bunch of different wild kind of dogs,</v>

319
00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:49.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

320
00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:50.480
<v Speaker 2>like jackals or whatever.</v>

321
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 2>And they're all mixed together.</v>

322
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 2>But now it's all wolf.</v>

323
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Man could happen fast.</v>

324
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

325
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 2>knows.</v>

326
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.610
<v Speaker 2>But it's from,</v>

327
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 2>it happened because the people,</v>

328
00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.750
<v Speaker 2>it's really nuts because the only thing that,</v>

329
00:08:59.751 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 2>it's like people,</v>

330
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.633
<v Speaker 2>his dogs,</v>

331
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.091
<v Speaker 2>dogs,</v>

332
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that's like people where we're totally not uniform as a species,</v>

333
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 2>but that we can interbreed with each other.</v>

334
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

335
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.910
<v Speaker 2>you can in a breed with ones that don't look at anything like that.</v>

336
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 2>Salmon can't breathe with a bass.</v>

337
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 2>They swim in the same water,</v>

338
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 2>but they can't fuck each other.</v>

339
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be able to breed with the Smith.</v>

340
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.380
<v Speaker 2>What does a Kaplan should have gone with something like green.</v>

341
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

342
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

343
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.450
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>

344
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:26.761
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

345
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:27.490
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

346
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

347
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.651
<v Speaker 2>people are,</v>

348
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.450
<v Speaker 2>we vary as much as dogs do.</v>

349
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:30.811
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

350
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:31.980
<v Speaker 2>you have like many mean,</v>

351
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:33.060
<v Speaker 2>then you have Shaquille O'neil,</v>

352
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.170
<v Speaker 2>you know you'd have,</v>

353
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.790
<v Speaker 2>they both could get someone pregnant.</v>

354
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:41.090
<v Speaker 2>You know [inaudible] you've got little tiny dudes fight 135 pounds and then</v>

355
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:45.650
<v Speaker 2>you've got dudes like Brock Lesnar who has to cut weight to make to 65 that's</v>

356
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 2>like a different breed.</v>

357
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

358
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:48.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like this weird like dogs.</v>

359
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.760
<v Speaker 2>We're like dogs in our,</v>

360
00:09:49.761 --> 00:09:50.594
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

361
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.990
<v Speaker 2>you know how much we vary.</v>

362
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.620
<v Speaker 2>I think this is the reason if you get like when this race and race traits,</v>

363
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.693
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>

364
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

365
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 2>Because they keep integrating the same way over and over again.</v>

366
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 2>What's fascinating that people still to this day,</v>

367
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.170
<v Speaker 2>it's so clear that people who developed and certain parts of the world,</v>

368
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.340
<v Speaker 2>it just looked different.</v>

369
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.750
<v Speaker 2>They have different attributes,</v>

370
00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:11.970
<v Speaker 2>they have different strengths and different weaknesses,</v>

371
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:12.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

372
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 2>and you know there's certain parts of the world where there's,</v>

373
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:15.840
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

374
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 2>here's where the agents come from.</v>

375
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:17.641
<v Speaker 2>They come from Asia.</v>

376
00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:17.881
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

377
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:19.140
<v Speaker 2>they all look the same the other way around.</v>

378
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.650
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

379
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.760
<v Speaker 2>This is where the Africans come from.</v>

380
00:10:20.761 --> 00:10:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Look through the ones that live in Africa was coming near the creditor.</v>

381
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

382
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.353
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

383
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.333
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

384
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.370
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

385
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.750
<v Speaker 2>that's the argument also that human beings are some sort of a,</v>

386
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.470
<v Speaker 2>an experiment from aliens is that we're just like,</v>

387
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.040
<v Speaker 2>like people manipulated dogs created,</v>

388
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.610
<v Speaker 2>they started us off that they manipulated the DNA.</v>

389
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:42.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

390
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Just like we manipulated the DNA of the dogs.</v>

391
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:44.990
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about that?</v>

392
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.800
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

393
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise and not smash and breeding off for pleasure.</v>

394
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

395
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.800

<v Speaker 1>Man That was a lot of fun.</v>

410
00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm a convert to your program.</v>

411
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Are you beautiful?</v>

412
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I'd like it even more if I wasn't on it.</v>

413
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I think you converted a lot of people.</v>

414
00:11:10.781 --> 00:11:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I think he changed a lot of people's opinions on hunting and trapping and I</v>

415
00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:16.420
<v Speaker 1>think you expressed yourself in a way,</v>

416
00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:17.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

417
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.490
<v Speaker 1>in the podcast it's like,</v>

418
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:18.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

419
00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:23.050
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about where it's such a long form you get to really express</v>

420
00:11:23.051 --> 00:11:23.590
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

421
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:28.590
<v Speaker 1>You could kind of tell like sometimes like you had some really well thought out</v>

422
00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:32.320
<v Speaker 1>answers to these questions almost like he had been waiting for people to ask</v>

423
00:11:32.321 --> 00:11:35.350
<v Speaker 1>them because this is like something that's really kind of bugging you about</v>

424
00:11:35.351 --> 00:11:36.184
<v Speaker 1>perceptions.</v>

425
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I think the same issues come up again and again and I think,</v>

426
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:39.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

427
00:11:39.881 --> 00:11:44.881
<v Speaker 1>you put them to me in a way that was actually more challenging to me because I</v>

428
00:11:44.951 --> 00:11:47.680
<v Speaker 1>could tell you were like coming to honest conclusions.</v>

429
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're asking like real questions that came up and not questions that you</v>

430
00:11:51.971 --> 00:11:52.880
<v Speaker 1>learned somewhere.</v>

431
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ask him that because that was a good point.</v>

432
00:11:56.351 --> 00:11:56.791
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>

433
00:11:56.791 --> 00:12:00.420
<v Speaker 3>you're like giving me thoughts that popped out in your mind.</v>

434
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.670
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge subject.</v>

435
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 3>And I know that I wound up doing a lot of like adding layers on things like</v>

436
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.211
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

437
00:12:08.211 --> 00:12:09.021
<v Speaker 3>But then if you look,</v>

438
00:12:09.021 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 3>there's also this and it makes that not so this national,</v>

439
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.300
<v Speaker 3>but it's really hard to come in and be like,</v>

440
00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:14.451
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

441
00:12:14.451 --> 00:12:16.880
<v Speaker 3>this is wrong and this is right and it's wrong and this is right cause it's,</v>

442
00:12:16.881 --> 00:12:20.240
<v Speaker 3>things are so complicated the same way that it's hard to come in and say that,</v>

443
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

444
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.660
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to come in and start talking about euthanasia and accurate.</v>

445
00:12:23.661 --> 00:12:27.080
<v Speaker 3>You have all these like definite absolute opinions about the subject.</v>

446
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.220
<v Speaker 3>The wolf was really protect them.</v>

447
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.180
<v Speaker 3>There's so many different versions of,</v>

448
00:12:32.181 --> 00:12:32.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

449
00:12:32.391 --> 00:12:32.590
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

450
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:33.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

451
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.660
<v Speaker 3>scare sites where people are terrified of these wolves.</v>

452
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:35.810
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

453
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:35.961
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

454
00:12:35.961 --> 00:12:38.720
<v Speaker 3>there's so much bigger and that's the way you broke it down made so much sense.</v>

455
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.180
<v Speaker 3>Well they have the more smart food and the food's not ready for them and they</v>

456
00:12:41.181 --> 00:12:41.980
<v Speaker 3>get bigger.</v>

457
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.110
<v Speaker 3>Was saying even after all of this,</v>

458
00:12:45.111 --> 00:12:49.500
<v Speaker 3>I still can't certify we speak to that issue because I just,</v>

459
00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:50.334
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

460
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.550
<v Speaker 3>I guess coming from a lifelong,</v>

461
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.520
<v Speaker 3>a lifelong path as an outdoorsman,</v>

462
00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.420
<v Speaker 3>she just not like an uneducated opinion,</v>

463
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.270
<v Speaker 3>not devoted a good permanent,</v>

464
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.710
<v Speaker 3>it's like trying to study and understand these issues,</v>

465
00:13:03.711 --> 00:13:05.810
<v Speaker 3>but that is something I frankly hadn't heard of,</v>

466
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.673
<v Speaker 3>but my guests,</v>

467
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.680
<v Speaker 3>I think that if you follow what I'm saying,</v>

468
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.220
<v Speaker 3>that path would maybe lead you do some enlightenment about that.</v>

469
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.970
<v Speaker 3>If you could live in a part of this country,</v>

470
00:13:14.971 --> 00:13:18.810
<v Speaker 3>if you could like pick any spot in this country where you would have like gray</v>

471
00:13:18.811 --> 00:13:22.320
<v Speaker 3>hunting and great fishing and a good place to like live off the land.</v>

472
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.610
<v Speaker 3>What part of the country would you peg?</v>

473
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.313
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

474
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.750
<v Speaker 3>did best,</v>

475
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.793
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

476
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.010
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

477
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.350
<v Speaker 3>and kind of enjoyed that aspect of my life the most when I was living in</v>

478
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.253
<v Speaker 3>Montana.</v>

479
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:34.840
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

480
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

481
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.223
<v Speaker 3>Why Montana?</v>

482
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.073
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

483
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:37.831
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

484
00:13:37.831 --> 00:13:40.470
<v Speaker 3>it's like 77% public land.</v>

485
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.180
<v Speaker 3>You have very generous,</v>

486
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.073
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

487
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.160
<v Speaker 3>good long seasons.</v>

488
00:13:44.161 --> 00:13:44.820
<v Speaker 3>The haunt,</v>

489
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.110
<v Speaker 3>you have a wide variety.</v>

490
00:13:46.111 --> 00:13:48.510
<v Speaker 3>You can haul almost all north American big game there.</v>

491
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:49.883
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

492
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:50.701
<v Speaker 3>I liked it.</v>

493
00:13:50.701 --> 00:13:51.030
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

494
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.080
<v Speaker 3>I still have family there.</v>

495
00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:53.910
<v Speaker 3>I went there multiple times a year.</v>

496
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:54.803
<v Speaker 3>This is a great place.</v>

497
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:55.763
<v Speaker 3>Also.</v>

498
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Also Grizzlies.</v>

499
00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:57.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

500
00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.250
<v Speaker 3>but there's no season on mills,</v>

501
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.570
<v Speaker 3>but you can just shoot them all year round or you know,</v>

502
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.080
<v Speaker 3>right now you cannot,</v>

503
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.160
<v Speaker 3>right now you cannot hunt.</v>

504
00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.080
<v Speaker 3>There's still under protection.</v>

505
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.040
<v Speaker 3>If I see a Grizzly,</v>

506
00:14:08.041 --> 00:14:11.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm shooting that you will wind up being in tons of trouble.</v>

507
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.450
<v Speaker 3>Find stealthy.</v>

508
00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:12.751
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

509
00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:13.020
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

510
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:13.853
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

511
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.620
<v Speaker 3>they had guys check this out.</v>

512
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking put landmines around my property.</v>

513
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:19.430
<v Speaker 3>They've had guys,</v>

514
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.560
<v Speaker 3>you had guys that have killed,</v>

515
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.040
<v Speaker 3>they've had a black very permit,</v>

516
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:29.350
<v Speaker 3>so they're legally hunting blackbird and accidentally kill a grizzly and you</v>

517
00:14:29.351 --> 00:14:33.790
<v Speaker 3>wind up having your hunting privileges revoked and in all states to cooperate in</v>

518
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:35.560
<v Speaker 3>this agreement for period seven years,</v>

519
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:36.760
<v Speaker 3>$10,000 fine.</v>

520
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.431
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

521
00:14:37.431 --> 00:14:38.170
<v Speaker 3>Some big deal.</v>

522
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:38.381
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>

523
00:14:38.381 --> 00:14:38.651
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

524
00:14:38.651 --> 00:14:41.740
<v Speaker 3>you don't mess the grizzly bears is there some place they can hunt grizzlies,</v>

525
00:14:41.741 --> 00:14:42.574
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

526
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:43.340
<v Speaker 3>Where's that?</v>

527
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:48.340
<v Speaker 3>When we say the only state right now where there's legal hunting of grizzly</v>

528
00:14:49.251 --> 00:14:53.480
<v Speaker 3>bears or brown bears in and much of Canada,</v>

529
00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.160
<v Speaker 3>are grizzly bears the same thing?</v>

530
00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:55.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

531
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:56.320
<v Speaker 3>there are.</v>

532
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.030
<v Speaker 3>They're not recognized as being subspecies anymore.</v>

533
00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:00.290
<v Speaker 3>They recognized as being the same thing.</v>

534
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.530
<v Speaker 3>They used to call myself spaces.</v>

535
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.490
<v Speaker 3>They've been back and forth on brown bear was like so sweet.</v>

536
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.820
<v Speaker 3>And Jeremy is the one no like and general Noman like in general like Yo popular</v>

537
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:11.240
<v Speaker 3>terminology.</v>

538
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Popular Terminology would be that people refer generally to the ones in the</v>

539
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:17.150
<v Speaker 3>interior as grizzlies cause they,</v>

540
00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:17.451
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

541
00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:18.920
<v Speaker 3>there's like morphological differences.</v>

542
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:21.290
<v Speaker 3>The ones in the coastal areas with access to salmon,</v>

543
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:21.831
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>

544
00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:22.610
<v Speaker 3>much bigger.</v>

545
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 3>They have a different appearance.</v>

546
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.000
<v Speaker 3>They generally refer to those as brown bears.</v>

547
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.970
<v Speaker 3>Brown bears are actually larger than the intercoastal.</v>

548
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.000
<v Speaker 3>The coastal bears get much bigger.</v>

549
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.610
<v Speaker 3>Had the potential of getting much bigger in the bear is not interior.</v>

550
00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:37.070
<v Speaker 3>The interior.</v>

551
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:37.760
<v Speaker 3>The Grizzlies.</v>

552
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:37.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

553
00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:39.850
<v Speaker 3>So people usually call those grizzlies.</v>

554
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:40.520
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

555
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 3>Coastal one's brown bears,</v>

556
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.430
<v Speaker 3>but they're all part of the same species.</v>

557
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.590
<v Speaker 3>They're not recognized as subspecies anymore.</v>

558
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.990
<v Speaker 3>It's same species versus herbalists I think is what it totally embarrassed of</v>

559
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.090
<v Speaker 3>the really scary motherfuckers.</v>

560
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:50.953
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

561
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.830
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole different,</v>

562
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.260
<v Speaker 3>that's a whole different species.</v>

563
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:58.460
<v Speaker 3>But they now realize something they hadn't realized before that there is some</v>

564
00:15:58.461 --> 00:16:03.461
<v Speaker 3>genetic exchange between polar bears and grizzlies and some people argue that</v>

565
00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:05.060
<v Speaker 3>they can have viable offspring.</v>

566
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:05.893
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true.</v>

567
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's too common for hybrid.</v>

568
00:16:07.631 --> 00:16:09.560
<v Speaker 3>That's not uncommon by someone I think.</v>

569
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:11.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the answer to that,</v>

570
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.650
<v Speaker 3>but I know that there's,</v>

571
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.740
<v Speaker 3>there's a question about whether they can have viable offspring.</v>

572
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:16.500
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

573
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.630
<v Speaker 3>as a motherfucker and some people think that what's driving that exchange is</v>

574
00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:23.750
<v Speaker 3>that as we're losing ice polarized camps,</v>

575
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.860
<v Speaker 3>it's pushing more polar bear activity on the mainland where they're running into</v>

576
00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:28.930
<v Speaker 3>and hanging out in the grizzly bears.</v>

577
00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:30.080
<v Speaker 3>That's just something that people throw off.</v>

578
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:30.921
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true or not.</v>

579
00:16:30.921 --> 00:16:32.390
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever counted a polar bear in the wild?</v>

580
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.740
<v Speaker 3>I've never laid eyes on a poor rental.</v>

581
00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:35.330
<v Speaker 3>While it's one of the,</v>

582
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:35.750
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

583
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:36.860
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the few,</v>

584
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.770
<v Speaker 3>I think it might be one of the only large North America.</v>

585
00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.540
<v Speaker 3>I think it is it the only,</v>

586
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.550
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the only large North American mammal.</v>

587
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.510
<v Speaker 3>I have not seen the wild.</v>

588
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:45.270
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

589
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.030
<v Speaker 3>It was a polar bear or the common,</v>

590
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean can you go look for him and you'd have to go to certain spots?</v>

591
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 3>It's very reliable to go see them in certain areas.</v>

592
00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Like on Hudson Bay there's places where you very reliably find them.</v>

593
00:16:54.321 --> 00:16:57.740
<v Speaker 3>In the winter there's places where you will go and check them out and they you</v>

594
00:16:57.741 --> 00:16:59.690
<v Speaker 3>can like book a tour or trip and go check them out.</v>

595
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.140
<v Speaker 3>I just haven't seen most frightening stories I've ever heard was some some boat</v>

596
00:17:03.141 --> 00:17:07.100
<v Speaker 3>crash somewhere and these guys got off on an ice shelf and a polar bear started</v>

597
00:17:07.101 --> 00:17:10.190
<v Speaker 3>getting closer and closer to him and jumped in the water and climbed up on the</v>

598
00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:11.840
<v Speaker 3>ice shell just fucking killed the Nate,</v>

599
00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:13.130
<v Speaker 3>one of the guys in front of his friends.</v>

600
00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.240
<v Speaker 3>You have toward that to me felt like kill people.</v>

601
00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:17.421
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

602
00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:17.841
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>

603
00:17:17.841 --> 00:17:18.620
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

604
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:23.620
<v Speaker 3>I think that probably in a per capita sense like deaths attributed the death per</v>

605
00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:28.100
<v Speaker 3>number of bear ratio is probably highest with polar bears.</v>

606
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:29.970
<v Speaker 3>They fucked people up,</v>

607
00:17:29.971 --> 00:17:30.804
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

608
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.530
<v Speaker 3>Definitely second most high with with the grizzly bears,</v>

609
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:34.880
<v Speaker 3>which means a scratch people up.</v>

610
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.790
<v Speaker 3>I would like to get mildly scratched up by a grizzly bear.</v>

611
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 3>I would like to have,</v>

612
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.461
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

613
00:17:40.461 --> 00:17:41.420
<v Speaker 3>I want to have,</v>

614
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.373
<v Speaker 3>I would like to have,</v>

615
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.280
<v Speaker 3>I would like to have one five claws scars</v>

616
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.990
<v Speaker 3>where I would like to start</v>

617
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:51.450
<v Speaker 1>wearing my shirt open all the time.</v>

618
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.140
<v Speaker 1>You should shoot a grizzly bear and then have a friend ty,</v>

619
00:17:55.141 --> 00:17:59.800
<v Speaker 1>the par to a stick just for decoration.</v>

620
00:17:59.801 --> 00:18:00.840
<v Speaker 1>So Helen,</v>

621
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.100
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Listen man.</v>

623
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.380

<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

625
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:06.240
<v Speaker 1>If you ever want to come back again,</v>

626
00:18:06.241 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 1>please do anytime you're in town and we could do this 10 times,</v>

627
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:09.864
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee.</v>

628

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

630
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.353
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

631
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>

632
00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.750
<v Speaker 1>We're here with Hamilton Morris and his buddy Matt the camera man.</v>

633
00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

634
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:24.950
<v Speaker 1>we don't need to know your last name,</v>

635
00:18:24.951 --> 00:18:25.784
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

636
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:26.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

637
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.913
<v Speaker 1>that's all right.</v>

638
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.393
<v Speaker 1>Whatever man.</v>

639
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Matt was there the whole time.</v>

640
00:18:29.601 --> 00:18:33.710
<v Speaker 1>We had a podcast looming over our shoulders making it very uncomfortable because</v>

641
00:18:33.711 --> 00:18:36.080
<v Speaker 1>there was one person in a room that didn't fucking talk.</v>

642
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.480
<v Speaker 1>So I tried to say Matt said,</v>

643
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 1>hell,</v>

644
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:38.900
<v Speaker 1>once you become a part of this.</v>

645
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.220
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

646
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:45.050
<v Speaker 1>it's just dedicated to his creepy filming you and not talking strategy.</v>

647
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I had the Imac in front of me so I didn't have to see how this man,</v>

648
00:18:48.981 --> 00:18:50.300
<v Speaker 1>how come you didn't just hang out with us?</v>

649
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you just put the camera now for a little bit?</v>

650
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.330
<v Speaker 1>He's a professional.</v>

651
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:54.403
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

652
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.890
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to test.</v>

653
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Suppose it's my job.</v>

654
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.120
<v Speaker 1>You're not the person ambitious to hear me talking to on the day cause they</v>

655
00:19:02.121 --> 00:19:02.480
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

656
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:02.841
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

657
00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:03.674
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

658
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.150
<v Speaker 1>It would been cool if we got you in there though.</v>

659
00:19:05.151 --> 00:19:05.984
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

660
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.710
<v Speaker 1>we're going to put you on this.</v>

661
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

662
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:11.090
<v Speaker 1>We're on.</v>

663
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.923
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

664
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.041
<v Speaker 1>This is um,</v>

665
00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:16.130
<v Speaker 1>we do a little video blog where we just put little clips of uh,</v>

666
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.810
<v Speaker 1>people that just did the podcast,</v>

667
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:18.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

668
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.460
<v Speaker 1>ask them if they had fun.</v>

669
00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:22.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

670
00:19:22.131 --> 00:19:22.521
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

671
00:19:22.521 --> 00:19:25.550
<v Speaker 1>it's just one more piece of content that people enjoy.</v>

672
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:26.853
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

673
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:27.970
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

674
00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I can post podcast wrap up sort of the thing.</v>

675
00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I know it seems ridiculous,</v>

676
00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.493
<v Speaker 1>but they love it.</v>

677
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

678
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean what was good?</v>

679
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.350
<v Speaker 1>We're just neutral moon,</v>

680
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.580
<v Speaker 1>so here it is.</v>

681
00:19:36.581 --> 00:19:39.820
<v Speaker 1>The next one with you and what we were saying before we did this was one of the</v>

682
00:19:39.821 --> 00:19:42.910
<v Speaker 1>coolest things about the Internet is that you could watch somebody stuff like,</v>

683
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:43.491
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

684
00:19:43.491 --> 00:19:43.750
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

685
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:44.120
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

686
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:44.521
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

687
00:19:44.521 --> 00:19:45.400
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking crazy.</v>

688
00:19:45.401 --> 00:19:46.010
<v Speaker 1>What is he doing?</v>

689
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.300
<v Speaker 1>He's hanging out doing all these drugs and having a good fucking down to meet</v>

690
00:19:49.301 --> 00:19:50.134
<v Speaker 1>that guy and then boom,</v>

691
00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.210
<v Speaker 1>we're doing a podcast killer.</v>

692
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:53.231
<v Speaker 1>Amazing,</v>

693
00:19:53.231 --> 00:19:53.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

694
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

695
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:55.570
<v Speaker 1>It is strange fucking world.</v>

696
00:19:55.571 --> 00:19:56.404
<v Speaker 1>We live in</v>

697
00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.673
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>

698
00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.480
<v Speaker 1>It's craziness.</v>

699
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:02.830
<v Speaker 1>It's probably witchcraft.</v>

700
00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:04.960
<v Speaker 1>We should have a show would be the odd couple.</v>

701
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll come in and fuck it everyday I see ghosts and you're like,</v>

702
00:20:08.921 --> 00:20:09.371
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

703
00:20:09.371 --> 00:20:10.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a blurry picture.</v>

704
00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:11.051
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

705
00:20:11.051 --> 00:20:11.681
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

706
00:20:11.681 --> 00:20:15.910
<v Speaker 1>my aunt died and this building and to this day no ghost at all.</v>

707
00:20:15.911 --> 00:20:16.744
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in any of that.</v>

708
00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.320
<v Speaker 1>They'll believe that it's maybe like what's the most rational argument that</v>

709
00:20:20.321 --> 00:20:24.220
<v Speaker 1>someone had was that an experience can be so traumatic that so much energy is,</v>

710
00:20:24.221 --> 00:20:27.040
<v Speaker 1>is released in the form of emotions and fear,</v>

711
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.310
<v Speaker 1>but it actually stains in area or that you can go near that area and</v>

712
00:20:30.311 --> 00:20:31.780
<v Speaker 1>occasionally and get a little flashback.</v>

713
00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Steven Cain shining idea and people hallucinate all the time for various</v>

714
00:20:37.451 --> 00:20:38.284
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

715
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Too Smart for horror movies.</v>

716
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.530
<v Speaker 1>I love horror movies</v>

717
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.880
<v Speaker 1>because I would think you'd be in there going werewolves are impossible.</v>

718
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps not fit him.</v>

719
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:49.580
<v Speaker 1>How's it pants working now?</v>

720
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:51.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

721
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.001
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

722
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I seen every horror movie out there almost.</v>

723
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.110
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't make you,</v>

724
00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:56.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

725
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:57.263

726
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.001
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

727
00:20:58.001 --> 00:20:58.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

728
00:20:58.271 --> 00:20:59.104
<v Speaker 1>sit there and</v>

729
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:01.600
<v Speaker 1>look at some ridiculous shit.</v>

730
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.811
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

731
00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:02.441
<v Speaker 1>I think it's scary.</v>

732
00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:03.274
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>

733
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.273
<v Speaker 1>What are you scared of?</v>

734
00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Slasher films like that con?</v>

735
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.791
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

736
00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:08.230
<v Speaker 1>we can supernatural ones.</v>

737
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

738
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

739
00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:10.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

740
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:10.900
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>

741
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:11.411
<v Speaker 1>I haven't watched,</v>

742
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I used to watch them all at the time,</v>

743
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.130
<v Speaker 1>like every day really.</v>

744
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.660
<v Speaker 1>And then I started to wonder if it was damaging my mind in some way.</v>

745
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

746
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

747
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.340
<v Speaker 1>So you think that would be more than a hundred DMT</v>

748
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:28.480
<v Speaker 1>crazy asshole.</v>

749
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:30.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

750
00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:31.431
<v Speaker 1>you know crazy.</v>

751
00:21:31.431 --> 00:21:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I have to be to be 24 and I've already done DMT 30 days in a row.</v>

752
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.790
<v Speaker 1>That's something like someone like cancer does when they're like 90 like,</v>

753
00:21:39.791 --> 00:21:40.451
<v Speaker 1>well fuck it.</v>

754
00:21:40.451 --> 00:21:41.284
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what happens.</v>

755
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to worry about it anymore.</v>

756
00:21:44.051 --> 00:21:44.351
<v Speaker 1>Let's just,</v>

757
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:45.770
<v Speaker 1>red line is pitch and see what kind of,</v>

758
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

759
00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:47.530
<v Speaker 1>it's just kind of performance.</v>

760
00:21:47.531 --> 00:21:48.364
<v Speaker 1>We can get out of it.</v>

761
00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.060
<v Speaker 1>You did it.</v>

762
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.090
<v Speaker 1>How old were you when you did it?</v>

763
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:50.651
<v Speaker 1>Reason,</v>

764
00:21:50.651 --> 00:21:51.484
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

765
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:56.020
<v Speaker 1>19 probably about 21 but yeah,</v>

766
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's especially damaging,</v>

767
00:21:57.251 --> 00:22:01.810
<v Speaker 1>but inundating your subconscious with all of these violent images daily seems</v>

768
00:22:01.811 --> 00:22:02.644
<v Speaker 1>like it could.</v>

769
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

770
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever worry that someone that's going to see all this shit that you put</v>

771
00:22:08.261 --> 00:22:13.261
<v Speaker 1>online and that you are going to be some sort of a target for antidrug activists</v>

772
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.543
<v Speaker 1>prove a point.</v>

773
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's people that are really hate drugs.</v>

774
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.390
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

775
00:22:25.391 --> 00:22:28.780
<v Speaker 1>I'd be more afraid that it's just like academic opportunities,</v>

776
00:22:28.781 --> 00:22:29.531
<v Speaker 1>job interviews,</v>

777
00:22:29.531 --> 00:22:32.410
<v Speaker 1>things like that that you got to be missing out on.</v>

778
00:22:32.411 --> 00:22:33.244
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

779
00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:33.611
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

780
00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:34.444
<v Speaker 1>you don't need that.</v>

781
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Just write books,</v>

782
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.041
<v Speaker 1>write books.</v>

783
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:37.150
<v Speaker 1>He used the internet done.</v>

784
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.090
<v Speaker 1>You can do whatever the fuck you want and you've got the Internet man.</v>

785
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

786
00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:43.690
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful to be able to get,</v>

787
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:44.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

788
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.320
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a job teaching at some prestigious university.</v>

789
00:22:47.321 --> 00:22:48.154
<v Speaker 1>That'd be amazing.</v>

790
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.080
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

791
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.020
<v Speaker 1>it also would be amazing.</v>

792
00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:51.730
<v Speaker 1>You just fucking putting out books,</v>

793
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:52.811
<v Speaker 1>put out books,</v>

794
00:22:52.811 --> 00:22:53.980
<v Speaker 1>keep putting out videos,</v>

795
00:22:53.981 --> 00:22:56.410
<v Speaker 1>keep fucking doing what you're doing now you're,</v>

796
00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 1>you're doing some cool shit.</v>

797
00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

798
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Well I'd like to do both if possible.</v>

799
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

800
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

801
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.270
<v Speaker 1>is it a deterrent or is it,</v>

802
00:23:04.271 --> 00:23:04.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

803
00:23:04.541 --> 00:23:05.450
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another business?</v>

804
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it must really excessive,</v>

805
00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:11.110
<v Speaker 1>but there's plenty of people in that good prestigious university positions that</v>

806
00:23:11.111 --> 00:23:14.620
<v Speaker 1>have had sort of histories of one kind or another.</v>

807
00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>

808
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.233
<v Speaker 1>it's not like,</v>

809
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.630
<v Speaker 1>it's not like getting a job at a major bank or something like that.</v>

810
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.650
<v Speaker 1>There's also a lot of fear.</v>

811
00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:21.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of paranoia.</v>

812
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:25.190
<v Speaker 1>I know people at Mit that have prescriptions for Adderall and things like that,</v>

813
00:23:25.191 --> 00:23:27.910
<v Speaker 1>and they were terrified that anyone would ever find out that they take</v>

814
00:23:27.911 --> 00:23:29.770
<v Speaker 1>prescription stimulants.</v>

815
00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:32.530
<v Speaker 1>What is the deal with Adderall?</v>

816
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Is it that I have a friend who's on that shit every day.</v>

817
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.670
<v Speaker 1>It just seems to me like that seems like a weird mood.</v>

818
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.990
<v Speaker 1>It seems like an energy pill.</v>

819
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.441
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

820
00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:41.711
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

821
00:23:41.711 --> 00:23:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

822
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.770
<v Speaker 1>So was that someone should be taken every day.</v>

823
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.340
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>

824
00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.173
<v Speaker 1>it is a</v>

825
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.410
<v Speaker 1>complicated word,</v>

826
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.150
<v Speaker 1>but I think that certain people benefit from taking a daily,</v>

827
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.680
<v Speaker 1>this dude looks like he's aging rapidly.</v>

828
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:57.043
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

829
00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:57.641
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

830
00:23:57.641 --> 00:23:57.861
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

831
00:23:57.861 --> 00:24:01.960
<v Speaker 1>it may accelerate your metabolism in some way that you think,</v>

832
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:02.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

833
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:02.930
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

834
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:03.763
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say.</v>

835
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that if you're taking something that's on my massive of stimuli and then</v>

836
00:24:06.821 --> 00:24:07.940
<v Speaker 1>look at those faces of math,</v>

837
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:08.900
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

838
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Well I think though,</v>

839
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.500
<v Speaker 1>you don't look that bad.</v>

840
00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:16.460
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

841
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.460
<v Speaker 1>That is hilarious.</v>

842
00:24:18.461 --> 00:24:18.561
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

843
00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Heidi Fleiss the airport,</v>

844
00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Yardi sobriety,</v>

845
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.920
<v Speaker 1>and then look better after the neck.</v>

846
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:25.671
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

847
00:24:25.671 --> 00:24:28.270
<v Speaker 1>it's not as if they were extremely attractive people to begin with.</v>

848
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.840
<v Speaker 1>And then I hated math.</v>

849
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a jacket [inaudible] character.</v>

850
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:34.310
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of check.</v>

851
00:24:34.311 --> 00:24:35.660
<v Speaker 1>You remember picking up in a bar,</v>

852
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.670
<v Speaker 1>you know it's just a mistake.</v>

853
00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Dropped a mistake.</v>

854
00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:47.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just the perfect end to the weirdest interviews ever in the history of the</v>

855
00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:47.780
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

<v Speaker 1>coconut water,</v>

951

00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:43.591
<v Speaker 1>What does that do?</v>

<v Speaker 1>but why is it healthy?</v>

958
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.720
<v Speaker 1>I think the caffeine,</v>

959
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:52.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

960
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Just cleans out the inside.</v>

961
00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:58.420
<v Speaker 1>What about that woman who did a DMT enema?</v>

962
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.640
<v Speaker 1>That's that girl Hamilton Morrison.</v>

963
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh by the way,</v>

964
00:28:02.191 --> 00:28:03.820
<v Speaker 1>for any of this saw the Hamilton Morris interview,</v>

965
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.341
<v Speaker 1>we fucked up.</v>

966
00:28:05.341 --> 00:28:06.174
<v Speaker 1>We're so sorry.</v>

967
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.100
<v Speaker 1>We got Hamilton way too high.</v>

968
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.750
<v Speaker 1>We got way too high.</v>

969
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.940
<v Speaker 1>We just completely over modulated.</v>

970
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when you go to these dispensaries you forget like when you buy</v>

971
00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:16.920
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

972
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.880
<v Speaker 1>whether it's an indycar or a sativa you forget and uh,</v>

973
00:28:20.881 --> 00:28:23.310
<v Speaker 1>there was definitely a sativa or excuse me,</v>

974
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.300
<v Speaker 1>definitely an Indycar,</v>

975
00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.670
<v Speaker 1>which is like the stuff that makes you sleep here and it was way too strong.</v>

976
00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.920
<v Speaker 1>We were all off the tracks and into the woods and we were trying to keep a</v>

977
00:28:31.921 --> 00:28:32.700
<v Speaker 1>conversation together,</v>

978
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.360
<v Speaker 1>but we were just ball.</v>

979
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Here's an artist's rendering of it right here.</v>

980
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:37.853
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

981
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:39.743
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

982
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:40.350
<v Speaker 1>It was real.</v>

983
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:41.183
<v Speaker 1>It was preposterous.</v>

984
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.860
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we pulled together any sort of a podcast was amazing.</v>

985
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.690
<v Speaker 1>He kept fucking with his boys who would get it.</v>

986
00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Like really?</v>

987
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

988
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:46.981
<v Speaker 1>he was so high.</v>

989
00:28:46.981 --> 00:28:49.710
<v Speaker 1>He was like playing with his voice and that was freaking me out.</v>

990
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I love that dude though.</v>

991
00:28:53.341 --> 00:28:56.910
<v Speaker 1>How I love anybody who's out there doing wild shit like that.</v>

992
00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:01.230
<v Speaker 1>I love anybody who's out there just fully embracing the free culture.</v>

993
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:02.040
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

994
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.100
<v Speaker 1>pushing forward and he did a really cool thing with the isolation tank</v>

995
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:05.790
<v Speaker 1>manufacturers.</v>

996
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.830
<v Speaker 1>He went down there and film there and he took an ad,</v>

997
00:29:07.831 --> 00:29:08.910
<v Speaker 1>a ball before he got in.</v>

998
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:10.771
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

999
00:29:10.771 --> 00:29:13.590
<v Speaker 1>just take some like an hour and a half before you go on it and be perfect.</v>

1000
00:29:13.591 --> 00:29:15.930
<v Speaker 1>It just get in there and ride it and that's exactly he did,</v>

1001
00:29:15.931 --> 00:29:16.980
<v Speaker 1>he said was amazing.</v>

1002
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I went for a three hour ride.</v>

1003
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:19.751
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1004
00:29:19.751 --> 00:29:22.440
<v Speaker 1>It's super high on a pot Brownie and an isolation tank.</v>

1005
00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I get one of that.</v>

1006
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:26.580
<v Speaker 1>That's what you and I got to do next,</v>

1009
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.500
<v Speaker 1>we're going to start opening up tank centers.</v>

1010
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.750
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation today,</v>

1011
00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:37.860
<v Speaker 1>I was doing this interview for our Vegas show next week and I'm doing this</v>

1012
00:29:38.011 --> 00:29:38.940
<v Speaker 1>interview and I'm like,</v>

1013
00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:39.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1014
00:29:39.121 --> 00:29:41.770
<v Speaker 1>talking about the woman asks me about isolation and I said,</v>

1015
00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:41.961
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1016
00:29:41.961 --> 00:29:42.020
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

1017
00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:42.131
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

1018
00:29:42.131 --> 00:29:43.210
<v Speaker 5>they're really hard to find.</v>

1019
00:29:43.211 --> 00:29:43.391
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1020
00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:44.950
<v Speaker 5>there's a few places in California,</v>

1021
00:29:44.951 --> 00:29:47.180
<v Speaker 5>but I know that used to be a place in Vegas and I thought about,</v>

1022
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:47.441
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1023
00:29:47.441 --> 00:29:48.430
<v Speaker 5>why are they hard to find?</v>

1024
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.091
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1025
00:29:49.091 --> 00:29:50.640
<v Speaker 5>Just to start making tanks that great.</v>

1026
00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1027
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:51.281
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1028
00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:52.530
<v Speaker 5>There's fucking tanning centers.</v>

1029
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:52.960
<v Speaker 5>Math,</v>

1030
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.250
<v Speaker 5>you think they couldn't be tank centers.</v>

1031
00:29:54.251 --> 00:29:54.880
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

1032
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.381
<v Speaker 5>those tanks,</v>

1033
00:29:55.381 --> 00:29:57.730
<v Speaker 5>here's what a great way to meet cool people.</v>

1034
00:29:58.570 --> 00:29:59.021
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1035
00:29:59.021 --> 00:30:00.620
<v Speaker 5>go with a bunch of other people that are,</v>

1036
00:30:00.621 --> 00:30:01.750
<v Speaker 5>want to explore their consciousness.</v>

1037
00:30:01.751 --> 00:30:03.820
<v Speaker 5>A bunch of other people that want to relax and float.</v>

1038
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.220
<v Speaker 5>A bunch of other people that are curious about those sort of things.</v>

1039
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.750
<v Speaker 5>That'd be like a great place if you have like a big waiting area.</v>

1040
00:30:10.751 --> 00:30:14.110
<v Speaker 5>And it was like really quiet and couches and shit and magazines.</v>

1041
00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:15.820
<v Speaker 5>People would probably hang out there after there.</v>

1042
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:17.711
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1043
00:30:17.711 --> 00:30:19.060
<v Speaker 5>you could have little shows there.</v>

1044
00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.880
<v Speaker 5>You could have authors come in and talk about books,</v>

1045
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:22.241
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1046
00:30:22.241 --> 00:30:23.230
<v Speaker 5>books on consciousness.</v>

1047
00:30:23.231 --> 00:30:25.870
<v Speaker 5>You could have psychedelic that guys like Dennis mechanic come and speak.</v>

1048
00:30:25.871 --> 00:30:26.500
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1049
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.570
<v Speaker 5>let's do it too.</v>

1050
00:30:27.571 --> 00:30:28.510
<v Speaker 5>And we should do that.</v>

1051
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:28.960
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1052
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.520
<v Speaker 5>And I'd see the birth of an idea.</v>

1053
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.530
<v Speaker 5>This is totally what the next stage we'll do.</v>

1054
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:36.360
<v Speaker 5>That's how I'm gonna move my friend Tommy junior from Connecticut to having to</v>

1055
00:30:36.361 --> 00:30:37.194
<v Speaker 5>come down and run our,</v>

1056
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:38.160
<v Speaker 5>our tank centers.</v>

1057
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:39.003
<v Speaker 5>And yeah,</v>

1058
00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.570
<v Speaker 5>we need to fucking figure out a way to make ourselves completely self sustaining</v>

1059
00:30:43.571 --> 00:30:45.130
<v Speaker 5>outside of the mechanism of Hollywood.</v>

1060
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.260
<v Speaker 5>It's totally do I have an idea,</v>

1061
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:48.850
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not going to say on the air.</v>

1062
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:49.763
<v Speaker 5>Powerful,</v>

1063
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.823
<v Speaker 5>powerful,</v>

1064
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:58.100
<v Speaker 5>powerful time limits on power for led Lazarus and your dog's name.</v>

1065
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.730
<v Speaker 5>Blanche Blanche.</v>

1066
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:04.290
<v Speaker 5>Eliza is one of those crazy dog ladies that brings her dog everywhere she goes,</v>

1067
00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:04.690
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't it?</v>

1068
00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:08.220
<v Speaker 5>Comedy clubs and she brings her dog to the icehouse chronicles.</v>

1069
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.110
<v Speaker 5>The darn just fucking wanders out around the streets of Pasadena.</v>

1070
00:31:11.111 --> 00:31:13.270
<v Speaker 5>We had to go running after it while she was on stage.</v>

1071
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:14.161
<v Speaker 5>That's snuck out.</v>

1072
00:31:14.161 --> 00:31:14.351
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:31:14.351 --> 00:31:14.490
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1074
00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:15.370
<v Speaker 5>When he was watching her,</v>

1075
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.701
<v Speaker 5>nobody.</v>

1076
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:17.110
<v Speaker 5>You left her there and nobody was watching her.</v>

1077
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:18.550
<v Speaker 5>She didn't know why you weren't there.</v>

1078
00:31:18.551 --> 00:31:19.390
<v Speaker 5>She went looking for you.</v>

1079
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.060
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you just leave her in your car when you do stuff like that?</v>

1080
00:31:22.061 --> 00:31:22.970
<v Speaker 5>It's not hot out.</v>

1081
00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm the only car for a sec.</v>

1082
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.820
<v Speaker 5>Someone steals your car.</v>

1083
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.053
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1084
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:30.670
<v Speaker 5>I guess you could look at it that way.</v>

1085
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.170
<v Speaker 5>If someone's a glass half empty sort of get,</v>

1086
00:31:33.171 --> 00:31:34.120
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't cheap</v>

<v Speaker 5>back then.</v>

1088
00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:37.630
<v Speaker 5>You could make book bags.</v>

1089
00:31:37.631 --> 00:31:38.770
<v Speaker 5>You can keep her inside the perfect</v>

1090
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:41.351
<v Speaker 5>messenger.</v>

1091
00:31:41.351 --> 00:31:44.860
<v Speaker 5>You're probably the most aggressive female comedian we know what's,</v>

1092
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:46.030
<v Speaker 5>what's the secret to that?</v>

1093
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.253
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1094

1100
00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:59.080
<v Speaker 5>The audience came to have a good time,</v>

1101
00:31:59.081 --> 00:32:00.310
<v Speaker 5>but I give it to him.</v>

1102
00:32:00.311 --> 00:32:01.144
<v Speaker 5>None of us.</v>

1103
00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.340
<v Speaker 5>I do mind like that.</v>

1104
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.581
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1105
00:32:03.581 --> 00:32:05.020
<v Speaker 5>Do you get upset when you see people?</v>

1106
00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:05.860
<v Speaker 5>What else?</v>

1107
00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:06.461
<v Speaker 5>What else?</v>

1108
00:32:06.461 --> 00:32:07.800
<v Speaker 5>And they're like flip through their notes.</v>

1109
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.930
<v Speaker 5>It was like 12 people in the crowd and you're working something out.</v>

1110
00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:11.231
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1111
00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:13.720
<v Speaker 5>But I just feel like an audience came there drunk.</v>

1112
00:32:13.721 --> 00:32:14.531
<v Speaker 5>It's a Saturday night.</v>

1115
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:18.940
<v Speaker 5>and I have a lot of energy.</v>

1116
00:32:18.941 --> 00:32:21.190
<v Speaker 5>I like to move around and wouldn't give it to him proper.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's not a bad thing.</v>

1124
00:32:29.891 --> 00:32:31.100
<v Speaker 5>It's just unusual.</v>

1125
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:32.020
<v Speaker 5>You're not unusual girl.</v>

1126

00:33:16.821 --> 00:33:19.060
<v Speaker 1>made a mistake like that cause you know I was articulate.</v>

1154
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:19.461
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1155
00:33:19.461 --> 00:33:20.720
<v Speaker 1>but then they'll call you back the tape.</v>

1156
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:21.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

1157
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Like the podcasts or see myself say something on the podcast like one time I</v>

1158
00:33:24.741 --> 00:33:24.921
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1159
00:33:24.921 --> 00:33:25.071
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1160
00:33:25.071 --> 00:33:25.640
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1161
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like pcs versus a windows,</v>

1162
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.750
<v Speaker 1>which is the opposite.</v>

1163
00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:30.843
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

1164
00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:36.850
<v Speaker 1>like they get the jest and they correct.</v>

1165
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.073
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1166
00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the difference actually along that,</v>

1167
00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:42.710
<v Speaker 1>what am I,</v>

1168
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:44.240
<v Speaker 1>what I hate is when you go to give someone directions,</v>

1169
00:33:44.241 --> 00:33:44.451
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1170
00:33:44.451 --> 00:33:45.530
<v Speaker 1>it's right up here on that road.</v>

1171
00:33:45.531 --> 00:33:45.771
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1172
00:33:45.771 --> 00:33:49.920
<v Speaker 1>you made over here and like from inside a building or like who has spatial</v>

1173
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.720
<v Speaker 1>relations that much on the</v>

1174
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.021
<v Speaker 1>30th floor,</v>

1175
00:33:54.021 --> 00:33:54.854
<v Speaker 1>one or</v>

1176
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.033
<v Speaker 1>none of that</v>

1177
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:01.040
<v Speaker 1>fucking assholes.</v>

1178
00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Just be nice to Eliza.</v>

1179
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Who's a good person?</v>

1180
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Why do you make dudes uncomfortable?</v>

1181
00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:07.920
<v Speaker 1>We think that's all up.</v>

1182
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1183
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.770
<v Speaker 1>it's not my problem</v>

1184
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.190
<v Speaker 1>meeting with me.</v>

1185
00:34:13.191 --> 00:34:14.240
<v Speaker 1>If I make you uncomfortable,</v>

1186
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.170
<v Speaker 1>let me know.</v>

1187
00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:17.960
<v Speaker 1>He'd make me a little unclear.</v>

1188
00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:18.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1189
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.921
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>

1190
00:34:18.921 --> 00:34:20.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1191
00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.070
<v Speaker 1>that's not what I said.</v>

1192
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:23.360
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1193
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.193
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1194
00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:25.083
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1195
00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:26.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1196
00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:26.780
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

1197
00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.670
<v Speaker 1>there's no men are intimidated by intelligent women.</v>

1198
00:34:28.671 --> 00:34:29.111
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1199
00:34:29.111 --> 00:34:29.944
<v Speaker 1>men are,</v>

1200
00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.780
<v Speaker 1>a lot of men don't want the game to be difficult.</v>

1201
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:35.350
<v Speaker 1>It's already difficult to get a girl like you and to,</v>

1202
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:38.270
<v Speaker 1>you have to measure up to a girl as well as other men.</v>

1203
00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:38.601
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1204
00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Like that's why from the get go,</v>

1205
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:41.391
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1206
00:34:41.391 --> 00:34:42.640
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be smarter.</v>

1207
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Funny.</v>

1208
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.540
<v Speaker 1>As long as you're really hot.</v>

1209
00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:47.660
<v Speaker 1>So you just like have guys that are just nice to you guys.</v>

1210
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:48.820
<v Speaker 1>The guys smarter invited him.</v>

1211
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:49.641
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't have to be hot.</v>

1212
00:34:49.641 --> 00:34:50.151
<v Speaker 1>That's okay too,</v>

1213
00:34:50.151 --> 00:34:52.130
<v Speaker 1>but you have to somewhere you gotta be better than me.</v>

1214
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:57.730
<v Speaker 1>So you could be not funny or smart but hot or or be funny and smart and not so</v>

1215
00:34:58.641 --> 00:34:59.150
<v Speaker 1>hot.</v>

1216
00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two I was funny and smart can be hot.</v>

1217
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:02.743
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

1218
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:07.490
<v Speaker 1>So you're just like a guy and a lot of ways like guys don't like most guys don't</v>

1219
00:35:07.491 --> 00:35:10.850
<v Speaker 1>need grocery that's foreign or that they are going to be around.</v>

1220
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Well someone said this and I would always attributed to George Harrison,</v>

1221
00:35:13.941 --> 00:35:15.470
<v Speaker 1>although I can't find it online or they said it,</v>

1222
00:35:15.471 --> 00:35:18.890
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure he did say he said all I need from a woman is to be</v>

1223
00:35:18.891 --> 00:35:19.640
<v Speaker 1>attracted to her.</v>

1224
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Everything else I get from him,</v>

1225
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:21.583
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1226
00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:23.283
<v Speaker 1>that's really,</v>

1227
00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I remember much more current that going,</v>

1228
00:35:25.311 --> 00:35:25.600
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1229
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.720
<v Speaker 1>that's so brilliant.</v>

1230
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Women are much more complex and some of them for sure,</v>

1231
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.450
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>

1232
00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:31.283
<v Speaker 1>some of</v>

1233
00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:33.183
<v Speaker 1>what's interpreters,</v>

1234
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.910
<v Speaker 1>we need so many like yeah,</v>

1235
00:35:34.911 --> 00:35:35.780
<v Speaker 1>you need a guy to be hot,</v>

1236
00:35:35.781 --> 00:35:36.171
<v Speaker 1>but then it's like,</v>

1237
00:35:36.171 --> 00:35:38.640
<v Speaker 1>but he has to understand me and listen and not do that as,</v>

1238
00:35:38.641 --> 00:35:41.940
<v Speaker 1>and it has to be 75 degrees and I want to fund restaurant and wedges.</v>

1239
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:42.803
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

1240
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:45.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1241
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm very low maintenance,</v>

1242
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.030
<v Speaker 1>super low maintenance,</v>

1243
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.190
<v Speaker 1>super specific about what you want.</v>

1244
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:51.120
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1245
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.470
<v Speaker 1>it's demanding and like a cute way.</v>

1246
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Like you would never get annoyed.</v>

1247
00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1248
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure you're not an asshole about it?</v>

1249
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1250
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.070
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

1251
00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.790
<v Speaker 1>It comes time to food then it has to,</v>

1252
00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.840
<v Speaker 1>has to be your why.</v>

1253
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.810
<v Speaker 1>So like if you don't care really I think,</v>

1254
00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 1>what do you like that like you have arguments with any man about,</v>

1255
00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:08.271
<v Speaker 1>it's not about way,</v>

1256
00:36:08.271 --> 00:36:10.230
<v Speaker 1>it's why I don't want to eat in the car.</v>

1257
00:36:10.231 --> 00:36:10.801
<v Speaker 1>The guy and he's,</v>

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:46.403
<v Speaker 1>So too,</v>

1322
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:52.590
<v Speaker 1>we just got done up beautiful podcast with my friend Brian Count and my friend</v>

1323
00:37:52.591 --> 00:37:57.591
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Burke and you're crying and gentlemen is a life changer.</v>

1324
00:37:58.590 --> 00:37:59.251
<v Speaker 1>And I'm doing this,</v>

1325
00:37:59.251 --> 00:37:59.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1326
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:00.450
<v Speaker 1>what is this thing called?</v>

1327
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Turbo Sonic.</v>

1328
00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:02.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a turbo sonic,</v>

1329
00:38:02.371 --> 00:38:04.350
<v Speaker 1>which is sound waves that go through your body.</v>

1330
00:38:04.351 --> 00:38:06.030
<v Speaker 1>And I've actually never had this sensation.</v>

1331
00:38:06.031 --> 00:38:08.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a really weird feeling right now.</v>

1332
00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.840
<v Speaker 1>And I can hear my voice.</v>

1333
00:38:09.841 --> 00:38:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I actually can't control it.</v>

1334
00:38:10.861 --> 00:38:12.590
<v Speaker 1>That's how I'm talking the sound.</v>

1335
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:17.100
<v Speaker 1>This is a giant speaker and it's sonic waves that are forcing his body to</v>

1336
00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:21.450
<v Speaker 1>vibrate and keep an eye on because right now this is like the high frequency end</v>

1337
00:38:21.451 --> 00:38:21.870
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

1338
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:26.870
<v Speaker 1>but then it gets to this both studying frequency like their and totally surface.</v>

1339
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:29.083
<v Speaker 1>Now you hear it,</v>

1340
00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:29.360
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1341
00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.001
<v Speaker 1>it varies.</v>

1342
00:38:30.001 --> 00:38:30.571
<v Speaker 1>There's like a whole,</v>

1343
00:38:30.571 --> 00:38:33.030
<v Speaker 1>you can do it manual and you can have it set to a certain level.</v>

1344
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not just being chickens,</v>

1345
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

1346
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.570
<v Speaker 5>actually sonic waves.</v>

1347
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.730
<v Speaker 5>So when you say you're being shaken,</v>

1348
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.880
<v Speaker 5>you sort of odd,</v>

1349
00:38:40.881 --> 00:38:42.010
<v Speaker 5>but it's not like so much shaking.</v>

1350
00:38:42.011 --> 00:38:46.780
<v Speaker 5>You sonic waves through your whole body MNA through your fucking feet from a</v>

1351
00:38:46.781 --> 00:38:50.560
<v Speaker 5>speaker and the Russian scientists with users when they're in space,</v>

1352
00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:54.490
<v Speaker 5>use this to stay up in orbit far longer than anybody thought was possible.</v>

1353
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.571
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1354
00:38:55.571 --> 00:38:56.231
<v Speaker 5>it stimulates.</v>

1355
00:38:56.231 --> 00:38:58.960
<v Speaker 5>You might have said something similar as your body's ability to produce you with</v>

1356
00:38:58.961 --> 00:38:59.680
<v Speaker 5>growth hormone.</v>

1357
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.513
<v Speaker 5>It's great for you.</v>

1358
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:02.830
<v Speaker 5>It's fantastic for their muscle density.</v>

1359
00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:03.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1360
00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:04.370

1367
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.910
<v Speaker 5>When I got that girl pregnant and I was going to marry her and you,</v>

<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1420
00:40:24.611 --> 00:40:26.050
<v Speaker 5>as we develop,</v>

1421
00:40:26.051 --> 00:40:27.650
<v Speaker 5>we realized that we are a,</v>

1422
00:40:27.651 --> 00:40:31.180
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of deficits that we have when we're younger and we're still trying to</v>

1423
00:40:31.181 --> 00:40:34.150
<v Speaker 5>make up for shaking like a leaf.</v>

1424
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.460
<v Speaker 5>It's not even the machine.</v>

1425
00:40:36.461 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 5>This is how I'm thinking about his past.</v>

1431
00:40:41.881 --> 00:40:45.360
<v Speaker 5>it makes you feel great and it feels stimulated when you get off of the ads.</v>

1432
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:49.670
<v Speaker 5>And it's also exactly what Christopher and Mcdonald's in his book.</v>

<v Speaker 5>80,</v>

1455
00:41:16.241 --> 00:41:18.050
<v Speaker 5>a hundred miles in a day.</v>

<v Speaker 5>not bare feet.</v>

1458
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.130
<v Speaker 5>They were taking down tires,</v>

1459
00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.030
<v Speaker 5>cutting them down,</v>

1460
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.841
<v Speaker 5>melting them,</v>

1461
00:41:23.841 --> 00:41:27.620
<v Speaker 5>and they just having the smallest bit of rubber on the bottom of their feet.</v>

1462
00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.970
<v Speaker 5>They just conformed for their feet.</v>

1463
00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:31.610

1495
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:30.500
<v Speaker 5>because you can lift more and you feel it through your toes too.</v>

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:32.060
<v Speaker 5>You feel better?</v>

1497

1498
00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:33.710
<v Speaker 5>Your nervous system is becoming,</v>

1499
00:42:33.711 --> 00:42:35.300
<v Speaker 5>being gay with the more we have heels,</v>

1500
00:42:35.301 --> 00:42:36.860
<v Speaker 5>the more we have shit on the bottom of our feet.</v>

1501
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.500
<v Speaker 5>The more insulated we are from the world,</v>

1502
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.660
<v Speaker 5>that when someone created a running shoe,</v>

1503
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.240
<v Speaker 5>what they did is they created it so that when you land,</v>

1504
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.920
<v Speaker 5>you land on your heel,</v>

1505
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.840
<v Speaker 5>puts this pounding on unique.</v>

1506
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.870
<v Speaker 5>Once you're supposed to lay out your toes,</v>

1507
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.950
<v Speaker 5>that's how people are supposed to run.</v>

1508
00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.330
<v Speaker 5>You're supposed to write your chosen.</v>

1509
00:42:53.331 --> 00:42:54.710
<v Speaker 5>It's a shock of exactly.</v>

1510
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:56.540
<v Speaker 5>That takes all the pressure off your knees.</v>

1511
00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:00.830
<v Speaker 5>So fighters now they do sprints and do sprints for those five finger tow things</v>

1512
00:43:00.831 --> 00:43:02.480
<v Speaker 5>and they run on grass and everyone,</v>
