00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.403
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

3
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.273
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

4
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.173
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

5
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:04.921
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

6
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris.</v>

7
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man.</v>

8
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you.</v>

9
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Happy to be here.</v>

10
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.080
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

11
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.750
<v Speaker 1>I listened to your podcast with Jack.</v>

12
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Let's just get right into the jump in the Jack stuff because I listened to your</v>

13
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>podcast with Jack and I found something very when I did my podcast with Jack.</v>

14
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>First of all was not anticipating the blowback that I received.</v>

15
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>It was stunning.</v>

16
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

18
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

19
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

20
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.560
<v Speaker 1>what I thought was I was just going to have a conversation with this guy.</v>

21
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Be Fun.</v>

22
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>See what it's like to run this gigantic network that helps people communicate.</v>

23
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.370
<v Speaker 1>You'll be okay.</v>

24
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy helps people communicate and distribute information worldwide.</v>

25
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>What is it like to start something like that up and have it become what it is</v>

26
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>like how have you managed to try to keep up with it and one of the headaches</v>

27
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>been and apparently people online,</v>

28
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 1>particularly the people that want to comment about this,</v>

29
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:55.191
<v Speaker 1>all they wanted to know about with censorship and that was an issue with me.</v>

30
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Speaker 1>There was a question with me,</v>

31
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>but it became a far,</v>

32
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>was a far bigger question for people online.</v>

33
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.670
<v Speaker 1>They felt like that I tossed him softball questions and that I didn't press him</v>

34
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>and then I listened to your podcast and one thing about Jack is very smart guy,</v>

35
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.113
<v Speaker 1>very nice guy,</v>

36
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.510
<v Speaker 1>buddy talks in a very slow and methodical way and when you ask him a question,</v>

37
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.510
<v Speaker 1>he takes these routes and if you don't want to jump in and press them like</v>

38
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>you're in this weird situation where he's not totally answering your question,</v>

39
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.180
<v Speaker 1>but he's talking about the same subject that you talked to.</v>

40
00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Like for instance,</v>

41
00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>you brought up Louis Farrakhan,</v>

42
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>like how's Louis Farrakhan and good standing on the platform and someone like,</v>

43
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:39.511
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank,</v>

45
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Milo Yiannopoulos or Laura loomer,</v>

46
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.323
<v Speaker 1>whoever it was,</v>

47
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>they get kicked off.</v>

48
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>He never got to that.</v>

49
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>He went around and around and around with you.</v>

50
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

51
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>he recognized this after the podcast,</v>

52
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.140
<v Speaker 1>I received a lot of blowback.</v>

53
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.560
<v Speaker 1>He received a lot of blowback.</v>

54
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 1>So I contacted him and he said he'd be more than happy to come back on again and</v>

55
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>address all these things.</v>

56
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.471
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

57
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:01.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

58
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>what I'd like to do is address specific instances of people being censored.</v>

59
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.451
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

60
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:06.661
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

61
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>what I'll do is I'll bring in someone from the company that's in charge of that</v>

62
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:11.470
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

63
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

64
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>So I'm starting to put together a picture of what it's like to be a ceo of</v>

65
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>something as big and he's also a ceo of square.</v>

66
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>He's runs the cash app,</v>

67
00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of stuff going on there,</v>

68
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:22.681
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

69
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>So He's obviously busy.</v>

70
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>How much day to day involvement does he actually have and who gets censored and</v>

71
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>why they get censored and how much is he willing to share about that.</v>

72
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>So we're gonna find out in the next follow up podcast.</v>

73
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:40.401
<v Speaker 1>But I got accused of everything from being a shill to being a cook to being a.</v>

74
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>and there's also an issue that you've managed to avoid wisely.</v>

75
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>So you'll have advertising the cash apps and advertiser on my podcast.</v>

76
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.070
<v Speaker 1>So because the cash apps and advertiser on my podcast man had you by the throat.</v>

77
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

78
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Anything couldn't ask all those great questions that were queued up.</v>

79
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>The reality is,</v>

80
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 1>those are the questions I would've asked.</v>

81
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Now that's hard to say</v>

82
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 2>because no one's gonna believe it,</v>

83
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 2>but those are the questions that were asked and I tried not to be too</v>

84
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 2>confrontational with a guest,</v>

85
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 2>but in hindsight I probably could have pressed more particularly on people like</v>

86
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Kathy Griffin calling for doxing for the,</v>

87
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 2>the kid with the Maggot hat on with the native American.</v>

88
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 2>There was quite a few,</v>

89
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 2>but I noticed that.</v>

90
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

91
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 2>what was your experience like with it?</v>

92
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

93
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 2>so it's interesting.</v>

94
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you and I have a,</v>

95
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 2>we had different interviews because there were time differently.</v>

96
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.084
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

97
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting topic because this opens the door to all the ways in which</v>

98
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 2>our podcasts are different.</v>

99
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:36.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

100
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 2>they use stream live.</v>

101
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 2>I sit on my podcast for at least a week in Jack's case was like two weeks before</v>

102
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:42.934
<v Speaker 2>I released it,</v>

103
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.270
<v Speaker 2>so I did my interview with him before this flurry of interviews with him came</v>

104
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

105
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a rolling stone interview.</v>

106
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:51.784
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>

107
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

108
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 2>I think only,</v>

109
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe a Huffington post interview would come out,</v>

110
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 2>but basically there was nothing out there,</v>

111
00:03:56.651 --> 00:04:01.651
<v Speaker 2>so I had no real examples of how he dealt with these questions or how he talked.</v>

112
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

113
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

114
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.801
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

115
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:03.041
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

116
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:03.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean slow talking.</v>

117
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not a problem for me because I'm one of the great slow talker.</v>

118
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:06.180
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

119
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 2>so we're,</v>

120
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 2>we're in a groove there.</v>

121
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

122
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

123
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:11.284
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

124
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.901
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

125
00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what his boiler plate was and how he would,</v>

126
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 2>he would answer any of these questions.</v>

127
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 2>And your podcast came out before mine did,</v>

128
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 2>but mine was,</v>

129
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>mine was before the Covington Highschool Catholic.</v>

130
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

131
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.441
<v Speaker 2>circus happened,</v>

132
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:27.274
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

133
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.280
<v Speaker 2>So the real missed opportunity for me was just a sheer matter of timing because</v>

134
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 2>the commitment thing put such a fine point on everything that's wrong with</v>

135
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 2>twitter and the way journalism interacts with it.</v>

136
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.801
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

137
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:39.071
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

138
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

139
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

140
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a farhad manjoo wrote an op Ed in the New York Times saying</v>

141
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 2>twitter is destroyed journalism and,</v>

142
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

143
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 2>and it was not a crazy op ed.</v>

144
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:49.834
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

145
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

146
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.250
<v Speaker 2>after the Covington thing and the whole unit,</v>

147
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.190
<v Speaker 2>and then Kathy Griffin would've been the perfect example to talk about it.</v>

148
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Like why is she still on if she's calling for the Doxing,</v>

149
00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

150
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

151
00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

152
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:00.201
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

153
00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 2>I think I had a substantially similar interview with him that you did,</v>

154
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

155
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 2>because he's,</v>

156
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.891
<v Speaker 2>there's two things.</v>

157
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 2>One is he's great at sort of pure wedding around the,</v>

158
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.761
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

159
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

160
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 2>the sharp point of question of what is the policy and why or why are you</v>

161
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 2>applying it and in this seemingly disparate way.</v>

162
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

163
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 2>and it seems to skew politically in one direction all the time.</v>

164
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:24.304
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

165
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 2>But I think you also,</v>

166
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

167
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.631
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

168
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 2>and I think you did naturally,</v>

169
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 2>we cut him some slack in that he's the CEO of these two corporations.</v>

170
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 2>He can't be expected to actually know what happened in every one of these</v>

171
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:40.910
<v Speaker 2>microcases.</v>

172
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.061
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

173
00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 2>I think I brought up the case of,</v>

174
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.770
<v Speaker 2>I think her name is Megan Murphy.</v>

175
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't even heard of her,</v>

176
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:50.890
<v Speaker 2>but she's a lesbian woman that she was a feminist who said sort of the wrong</v>

177
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:53.150
<v Speaker 2>thing in the transgender space.</v>

178
00:05:53.151 --> 00:05:53.711
<v Speaker 2>She said something like,</v>

179
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:58.240
<v Speaker 2>men are not women and she got banned and or to know,</v>

180
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 2>I think it was temporary,</v>

181
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:00.171
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

182
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 2>so I raised it and you know,</v>

183
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

184
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 2>he obviously can't know exactly what happened in that case or at least it would</v>

185
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 2>be surprising to me if he knew.</v>

186
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.740
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that he doesn't have his finger on each one of these cases and what</v>

187
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:15.111
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

188
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 2>what the rationale was,</v>

189
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 2>and he has this sort of generic answer that what you're seeing,</v>

190
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

191
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 2>in public is not necessarily what we're seeing.</v>

192
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.790
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

193
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.130
<v Speaker 2>in virtually every actionable case is not what we're seeing in private with</v>

194
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 2>respect to how these people are all opening,</v>

195
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 2>opening multiple accounts and doing seemingly nefarious stuff behind the scenes.</v>

196
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.511
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

197
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 2>whether that is true,</v>

198
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.121
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

199
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 2>but I mean I can just say that Jack seemed,</v>

200
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

201
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.201
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

202
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:42.340
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

203
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

204
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.300
<v Speaker 2>I liked him and he seemed unusually open to talking about anything I wanted to</v>

205
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 2>talk about.</v>

206
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 2>So as I saw one allegation they got a hold of you,</v>

207
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:50.744
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

208
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

209
00:06:51.061 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 2>you must have been constrained by the topics you couldn't touch in advance.</v>

210
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 2>He must have had some agreement with him in advance,</v>

211
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

212
00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 2>it didn't happen with me right now.</v>

213
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:00.531
<v Speaker 2>I should address that.</v>

214
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Speaker 2>There was no,</v>

215
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 2>no discussion whatsoever about what was off limits.</v>

216
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 2>No nothing.</v>

217
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.721
<v Speaker 2>And he asked her.</v>

218
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:06.000
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

219
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.370
<v Speaker 2>So in my case,</v>

220
00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:10.710
<v Speaker 2>I tell all my guests and this the difference between use streaming live and,</v>

221
00:07:10.711 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 2>and me not,</v>

222
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.070
<v Speaker 2>I tell all my guests,</v>

223
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:13.820
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

224
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 2>if at any point in this interview you put your foot in your mouth or I put my</v>

225
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:17.810
<v Speaker 2>foot in there,</v>

226
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 2>we can edit it,</v>

227
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

228
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>

229
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.151
<v Speaker 2>I want you,</v>

230
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:23.870
<v Speaker 2>I want you to be totally happy with what you say over the next two or three</v>

231
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:24.704
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

232
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

233
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.770
<v Speaker 2>so if you have to take something again,</v>

234
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 2>take it again and,</v>

235
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:29.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

236
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 2>we'll just hide the seams as we go.</v>

237
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Now that virtually never happens.</v>

238
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:33.681
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

239
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:34.560
<v Speaker 2>And in Jack's case,</v>

240
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't even a wrinkle like that.</v>

241
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.183
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

242
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

243
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.560
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

244
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:38.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

245
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:38.891
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

246
00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

247
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

248
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:39.671
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

249
00:07:39.671 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 2>I recognize it's a high wire act for a lot of these people,</v>

250
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 2>especially if someone was running two publicly traded companies.</v>

251
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

252
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.010
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

253
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:47.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

254
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I also want to invite in Amman,</v>

255
00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:49.100
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

256
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:49.933
<v Speaker 2>I said jacket,</v>

257
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.920
<v Speaker 2>we were DM and on twitter and I said,</v>

258
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:52.131
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

259
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 2>I promise I'm not going to make you smoke a blunt on video that got him.</v>

260
00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:57.650
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know how you got him,</v>

261
00:07:57.651 --> 00:07:59.470
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't try to get them to a local boy.</v>

262
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.310
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even think about it.</v>

263
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

264
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:02.691
<v Speaker 2>we weren't drinking,</v>

265
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:03.320
<v Speaker 2>we were just talking.</v>

266
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we'd been better if we were drinking because it did seem very stiff.</v>

267
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.510
<v Speaker 2>I listened to it after the fact and</v>

268
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:15.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean I get from their anticipation why it would be disappointing.</v>

269
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 2>I just thought it was kind of boring.</v>

270
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.700
<v Speaker 2>I thought my podcast with them just wasn't very good.</v>

271
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:25.040
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes do too many podcasts and when I sometimes do too many podcasts,</v>

272
00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:29.060
<v Speaker 2>I think I run low on juice and I'm not as a,</v>

273
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

274
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not as engaged or I'm not as fired up about it and maybe I just should have.</v>

275
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.950
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely should've prepared more for him,</v>

276
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Speaker 2>but I really thought it was just going to be a conversation about what it's like</v>

277
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 2>and I thought that would be really easy to do because it's such a unique</v>

278
00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 2>position to be running something like twitter,</v>

279
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.020
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

280
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

281
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he was evasive in because he didn't know the things or because</v>

282
00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:53.570
<v Speaker 2>he didn't want to talk about the things,</v>

283
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 2>but there was things like he didn't know exactly why Alex Jones was ultimately</v>

284
00:08:58.501 --> 00:08:59.334
<v Speaker 2>banned.</v>

285
00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 2>He didn't,</v>

286
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't recall or didn't know.</v>

287
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Now is that because he couldn't recall it was because he didn't want to talk</v>

288
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 2>about it or is it because he didn't remember it?</v>

289
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:07.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

290
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:07.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

291
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

292
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.581
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

293
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:09.414
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to,</v>

294
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be inside his head to get that answer.</v>

295
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

296
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

297
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:12.250
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

298
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.810
<v Speaker 2>he's clearly got a,</v>

299
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.850
<v Speaker 2>a very practice line that he uses to answer these questions and because I,</v>

300
00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

301
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.490
<v Speaker 2>I know what it's like to have boilerplate had been a book on a book tour and</v>

302
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:27.360
<v Speaker 2>you're just basically going to ask the same questions again and again and here</v>

303
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:32.390
<v Speaker 2>he's getting asked fairly pointed questions about where twitter's going and he's</v>

304
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:34.490
<v Speaker 2>got,</v>

305
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:34.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

306
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think this is dishonest,</v>

307
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:36.924
<v Speaker 2>I just think,</v>

308
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:42.050
<v Speaker 2>but it has this amazing ability to close the door to further inquiry because he,</v>

309
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.210
<v Speaker 2>he gives you the full mayor Kulpa right upfront.</v>

310
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.070
<v Speaker 2>You ask like,</v>

311
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:47.390
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

312
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.660
<v Speaker 2>what's the situation with,</v>

313
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

314
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.870
<v Speaker 2>the seemingly asymmetrical banding of people.</v>

315
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.300
<v Speaker 2>And he'll say,</v>

316
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:53.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

317
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:53.941
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

318
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:54.481
<v Speaker 2>we really,</v>

319
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean we got to get much better at communicating our process.</v>

320
00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 2>We're not nearly transparent enough.</v>

321
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 2>This whole thing is in disarray and my job is to fix it.</v>

322
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.221
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

323
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:03.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a global,</v>

324
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

325
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.090
<v Speaker 2>we're fucked up and we're going to get better.</v>

326
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I promise you.</v>

327
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.390
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

328
00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.090
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

329
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.050
<v Speaker 2>do any good for the people that are already banned.</v>

330
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.321
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

331
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:10.900
<v Speaker 2>But actually,</v>

332
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.740
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot to get beyond that in an interview,</v>

333
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.660
<v Speaker 2>so it's whether,</v>

334
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

335
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's nefarious.</v>

336
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:20.370
<v Speaker 2>I think it could well be totally honest.</v>

337
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

338
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 2>but it does have,</v>

339
00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:26.370
<v Speaker 2>this is a fact of you just keep reaching a certain kind of brick wall,</v>

340
00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:26.800
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

341
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.633
<v Speaker 2>it was going to be there.</v>

342
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

343
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.911
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

344
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:29.790
<v Speaker 2>I felt that too.</v>

345
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:30.690
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't,</v>

346
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:35.580
<v Speaker 2>didn't really navigate that very well and that was a big part of the blow back.</v>

347
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.940
<v Speaker 2>But then the blow back was accentuated when they found out that he sponsors me</v>

348
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 2>because the cash APP is one of his businesses and sponsors the podcast.</v>

349
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:44.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

350
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:45.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

351
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Well I had a very similar result and I don't have that problem so that I don't</v>

352
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.020
<v Speaker 2>think that diagnosis your situation at all.</v>

353
00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:55.920
<v Speaker 2>But it's very interesting that the difference between these business,</v>

354
00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.950
<v Speaker 2>that business models under which we run our podcasts and I'm just the different</v>

355
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.560
<v Speaker 2>mean just every choice you make and how to produce a podcast.</v>

356
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 2>I essentially have made the opposite one,</v>

357
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

358
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.560
<v Speaker 2>like streaming live like this ms dot the fact that you're.</v>

359
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.460
<v Speaker 2>So this is just all very interesting to me because I'm a kind of a reluctant</v>

360
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.960
<v Speaker 2>student of digital media now because I've just kind of stumbled into this wild</v>

361
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:19.620
<v Speaker 2>west that,</v>

362
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:19.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

363
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.690
<v Speaker 2>you in large part have invented,</v>

364
00:11:21.691 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

365
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean this podcasting space was nothing.</v>

366
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.470
<v Speaker 2>And now we've got spotify,</v>

367
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:25.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

368
00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:28.200
<v Speaker 2>buying up and it says like a land grab for audio.</v>

369
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

370
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 2>That we were talking about that before the podcast.</v>

371
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:32.700
<v Speaker 2>They just purchased some company.</v>

372
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Was it,</v>

373
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.800
<v Speaker 2>what is it called for some godly amount of money,</v>

374
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.170
<v Speaker 2>like $200,000,000.</v>

375
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Not going to spend $500 this year or something.</v>

376
00:11:41.821 --> 00:11:42.780
<v Speaker 2>And so it's this,</v>

377
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.110
<v Speaker 2>we're all just making this up and you know,</v>

378
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:47.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm making and you know,</v>

379
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.930
<v Speaker 2>I've just released a meditation APP which is a different business model still as</v>

380
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:51.961
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

381
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:56.961
<v Speaker 2>Now I have these kind of two digital businesses happening in my life and it's</v>

382
00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:58.234
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

383
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 2>it's just very interesting.</v>

384
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 2>The decisions you make are a force to make and the consequences of it.</v>

385
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 2>And so like the fact that we're having this conversation live,</v>

386
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.020
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have to think about whether you're going to edit this right,</v>

387
00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:09.580
<v Speaker 2>because it's to be streaming live and you know,</v>

388
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:10.130
<v Speaker 2>we're going to,</v>

389
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:10.661
<v Speaker 2>when we're done,</v>

390
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:15.250
<v Speaker 2>we're going to turn off the mics and walk out of here and your job is done with</v>

391
00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:15.911
<v Speaker 2>my podcast.</v>

392
00:12:15.911 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 2>That's not the workflow at all.</v>

393
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:18.051
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

394
00:12:18.051 --> 00:12:18.884
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

395
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.560
<v Speaker 2>I totally envy this,</v>

396
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.210
<v Speaker 2>this approach that you have,</v>

397
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.800
<v Speaker 2>but for a variety of reasons,</v>

398
00:12:23.801 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I can't take it in,</v>

399
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.231
<v Speaker 2>in my life.</v>

400
00:12:26.231 --> 00:12:26.750
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>

401
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.130
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

402
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:27.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

403
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.860
<v Speaker 2>but it is very different.</v>

404
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.810
<v Speaker 2>Dictates many choices,</v>

405
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

406
00:12:32.381 --> 00:12:33.161
<v Speaker 2>down the line,</v>

407
00:12:33.161 --> 00:12:33.994
<v Speaker 2>which I'm,</v>

408
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:35.523
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

409
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:36.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

410
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:37.151
<v Speaker 2>there's a positive,</v>

411
00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:37.601
<v Speaker 2>a negative,</v>

412
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:38.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

413
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:38.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

414
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:43.290
<v Speaker 2>the positive is what you hear is what we got and we're done after we turn these</v>

415
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:44.200
<v Speaker 2>mics off.</v>

416
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

417
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:45.623
<v Speaker 2>and that's not,</v>

418
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.840
<v Speaker 2>that's not how I podcast.</v>

419
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.420
<v Speaker 1>There's also the visual element of it.</v>

420
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:52.320
<v Speaker 1>And the visual element of it in initially was almost like a side effect.</v>

421
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:52.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

422
00:12:52.621 --> 00:12:52.940
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

423
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.080
<v Speaker 1>we first started it out visually,</v>

424
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.030
<v Speaker 1>but then when it started going to itunes,</v>

425
00:12:57.031 --> 00:12:59.580
<v Speaker 1>the itunes aspect of it became the focus,</v>

426
00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:02.190
<v Speaker 1>the audio version of it rather became the focus,</v>

427
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.570
<v Speaker 1>but then we decided to stream on youtube and put it up on youtube,</v>

428
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.120
<v Speaker 1>but it was totally not profitable.</v>

429
00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:09.930
<v Speaker 1>It was just for,</v>

430
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.980
<v Speaker 1>for a goof like,</v>

431
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:11.251
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

432
00:13:11.251 --> 00:13:12.060
<v Speaker 1>we'll have the video up.</v>

433
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Why not some people like video.</v>

434
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:14.580
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those things.</v>

435
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:18.990
<v Speaker 1>But then you realize ultimately that youtube becomes a viable source of revenue</v>

436
00:13:18.991 --> 00:13:22.470
<v Speaker 1>and then it's also the way a lot of people like to watch it,</v>

437
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

438
00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.190
<v Speaker 1>and they also like to watch it because they can comment under it.</v>

439
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.500
<v Speaker 1>So that was the other thing that came out of the Jack podcast.</v>

440
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:33.500
<v Speaker 1>We got into a controversy about comments and about how comments are deleted or</v>

441
00:13:34.321 --> 00:13:39.210
<v Speaker 1>how they're shown and hidden and what happens because people were accusing Jamie</v>

442
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.950
<v Speaker 1>of deleting all the derogatory comments that we don't touch any.</v>

443
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:44.640
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

444
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.810
<v Speaker 1>we don't delete any of them.</v>

445
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.310
<v Speaker 1>We don't do anything to them.</v>

446
00:13:47.311 --> 00:13:50.340
<v Speaker 1>We just leave them up there and it's mostly a cesspool.</v>

447
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.750
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

448
00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.550
<v Speaker 1>even even on a good podcasts,</v>

449
00:13:53.551 --> 00:13:55.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of crazy shit that happens on these things,</v>

450
00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:57.420
<v Speaker 1>but from what we think,</v>

451
00:13:57.421 --> 00:13:58.620
<v Speaker 1>and Jamie correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

452
00:13:58.621 --> 00:14:02.340
<v Speaker 1>you think that what's going on is that people are marketing other people's posts</v>

453
00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:03.170
<v Speaker 1>as spam.</v>

454
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

455
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.650
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>

456
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:09.510
<v Speaker 1>And then brandon also has a theory that a lot of all right people are targeted</v>

457
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.510
<v Speaker 1>by the algorithm that youtube uses.</v>

458
00:14:12.511 --> 00:14:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Like in one case there was a guy who had a pepe the frog Avatar,</v>

459
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.570
<v Speaker 1>and he said like his.</v>

460
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:22.590
<v Speaker 1>His comment immediately went to spam and that the other thing is that the</v>

461
00:14:22.711 --> 00:14:27.711
<v Speaker 1>comments are curated depending upon who is watching it and what account it'll</v>

462
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:28.050
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

463
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.000
<v Speaker 1>there'll be different sort of,</v>

464
00:14:30.001 --> 00:14:30.181
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

465
00:14:30.181 --> 00:14:32.370
<v Speaker 1>that they'll propagate different comments to the top.</v>

466
00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:33.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not a this.</v>

467
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.250
<v Speaker 1>You can actually change it if you,</v>

468
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:39.840
<v Speaker 1>if you prefer to see the most new comment from your own personal youtube when</v>

469
00:14:39.841 --> 00:14:40.601
<v Speaker 1>you're watching you,</v>

470
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:44.250
<v Speaker 1>you as a viewer or a user of Youtube have to make that actual.</v>

471
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

472
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.390
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

473
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.150
<v Speaker 1>that conspiracy theory just heightened the whole thing.</v>

474
00:14:48.151 --> 00:14:48.331
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

475
00:14:48.331 --> 00:14:48.601
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

476
00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Now they're deleting negative comments like,</v>

477
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:50.960
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

478
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't like doing bad podcast,</v>

479
00:14:52.731 --> 00:14:55.790
<v Speaker 1>but I will be the first one to tell you when I think a podcast sucked.</v>

480
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.640
<v Speaker 1>That podcast was definitely disappointing.</v>

481
00:14:58.641 --> 00:14:59.390
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't good.</v>

482
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.051
<v Speaker 1>Mine wasn't good.</v>

483
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:00.950
<v Speaker 1>It was like I said,</v>

484
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:01.581
<v Speaker 1>when I listened to it,</v>

485
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:01.810
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

486
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Kinda,</v>

487
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.793
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of boring.</v>

488
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:04.383
<v Speaker 1>Just wasn't,</v>

489
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 1>wasn't juicy.</v>

490
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:05.850
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing.</v>

491
00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.240
<v Speaker 1>He didn't get a flow.</v>

492
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.700
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like he and I were just shooting the shit.</v>

493
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Having a good</v>

494
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.970
<v Speaker 2>time to take that one decision.</v>

495
00:15:12.971 --> 00:15:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Say you have decided to make video,</v>

496
00:15:15.341 --> 00:15:19.510
<v Speaker 2>a main component of this podcast are still probably a small percentage of your</v>

497
00:15:19.511 --> 00:15:21.190
<v Speaker 2>actual listens you're out anymore.</v>

498
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.270
<v Speaker 2>When it was not anymore.</v>

499
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.380
<v Speaker 2>It's gotten to.</v>

500
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.370
<v Speaker 2>It's almost 50 slash 50 because they're closing in on the used to be like 90</v>

501
00:15:27.371 --> 00:15:27.740
<v Speaker 2>slash 10,</v>

502
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:27.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

503
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

504
00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

505
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:30.041
<v Speaker 2>So I have it.</v>

506
00:15:30.041 --> 00:15:33.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a video component and so I just put audio on Youtube,</v>

507
00:15:33.011 --> 00:15:35.250
<v Speaker 2>but I put absolutely no energy into youtube.</v>

508
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

509
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean that may one day change,</v>

510
00:15:37.181 --> 00:15:38.950
<v Speaker 2>but because I don't,</v>

511
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what's happening on Youtube.</v>

512
00:15:40.901 --> 00:15:41.081
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

513
00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:44.410
<v Speaker 2>So I never see the comments and whenever I look it is,</v>

514
00:15:44.411 --> 00:15:44.801
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>

515
00:15:44.801 --> 00:15:45.311
<v Speaker 2>assessable,</v>

516
00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:45.821
<v Speaker 2>it's insane.</v>

517
00:15:45.821 --> 00:15:48.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean youtube is just skews massively,</v>

518
00:15:48.191 --> 00:15:48.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

519
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:53.640
<v Speaker 2>It skews just massively male and it's probably skews very young too.</v>

520
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.080
<v Speaker 2>So you have it just like millennial alt right.</v>

521
00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.771
<v Speaker 2>Craziness,</v>

522
00:15:59.771 --> 00:15:59.891
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

523
00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:00.031
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

524
00:16:00.031 --> 00:16:00.761
<v Speaker 2>like as I say,</v>

525
00:16:00.761 --> 00:16:01.391
<v Speaker 2>these sentences,</v>

526
00:16:01.391 --> 00:16:03.940
<v Speaker 2>your youtube pages just blowing up with hate for me.</v>

527
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.970
<v Speaker 2>You've got a bunch of millennials with a thumbs up.</v>

528
00:16:06.971 --> 00:16:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Their ass is just wind,</v>

529
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:08.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

530
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.060
<v Speaker 2>the older people too.</v>

531
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:10.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

532
00:16:10.381 --> 00:16:10.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

533
00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.920
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it's got to be younger than most of of where.</v>

534
00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Well first of all I'm not even seen most common threads they could possibly</v>

535
00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.840
<v Speaker 2>respond to anything I put out there now.</v>

536
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:20.051
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

537
00:16:20.051 --> 00:16:20.411
<v Speaker 2>So I got to,</v>

538
00:16:20.411 --> 00:16:22.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't even look at my app mentions for the most part.</v>

539
00:16:22.541 --> 00:16:24.520
<v Speaker 2>I spend maybe five minutes a day looking at it.</v>

540
00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:25.930
<v Speaker 2>That's healthy was coming back to me.</v>

541
00:16:25.931 --> 00:16:26.080
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

542
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.620
<v Speaker 2>And you were actually helpful and reformatted my brain on that,</v>

543
00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.311
<v Speaker 2>on that topic.</v>

544
00:16:30.311 --> 00:16:31.250
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

545
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.300
<v Speaker 2>so because I don't see any of that stuff,</v>

546
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe I'm getting a lot of pain for my Dorsey interview but I don't even</v>

547
00:16:38.051 --> 00:16:38.680
<v Speaker 2>know about it.</v>

548
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

549
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.930
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm not having,</v>

550
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:41.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

551
00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like I have to course correct in response to anything now and in</v>

552
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:49.660
<v Speaker 2>large measure it is a consequence of justice decision that,</v>

553
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

554
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.700
<v Speaker 2>I inadvertently made that I'm just,</v>

555
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a video component to my podcast at the moment.</v>

556
00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:55.054
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm not,</v>

557
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not spectating on,</v>

558
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:57.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

559
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.270
<v Speaker 2>the feedback on Youtube.</v>

560
00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Well the feedback thing is interesting because we were just talking about this</v>

561
00:17:01.681 --> 00:17:06.570
<v Speaker 1>before the show that with feedback and comments on Youtube essentially anyone</v>

562
00:17:06.571 --> 00:17:09.450
<v Speaker 1>can comment and if you don't go banning people from the channel,</v>

563
00:17:09.451 --> 00:17:10.284
<v Speaker 1>which we don't do,</v>

564
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not what we wouldn't do if someone was totally a piece of shit but we</v>

565
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:15.870
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

566
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:19.260
<v Speaker 1>So you essentially have this open forum,</v>

567
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.380
<v Speaker 1>so it's like almost like a message board where people could just sort of comment</v>

568
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:25.470
<v Speaker 1>and it's unlike twitter in that regard because twitter just,</v>

569
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:17:26.161 --> 00:17:27.900
<v Speaker 1>you get abusive and Shitty on twitter,</v>

571
00:17:27.901 --> 00:17:28.740
<v Speaker 1>they just get rid of you.</v>

572
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.830
<v Speaker 1>If you get abusive and Shitty on instagram or on facebook,</v>

573
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:32.641
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

574
00:17:32.641 --> 00:17:33.474
<v Speaker 1>they'll just get rid of you.</v>

575
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:37.500
<v Speaker 1>But if you're on youtube and you're in those comments,</v>

576
00:17:37.501 --> 00:17:39.090
<v Speaker 1>you could kind of get away with more.</v>

577
00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:43.750
<v Speaker 1>So I would imagine that people that don't appreciate censorship and want to just</v>

578
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.680
<v Speaker 1>just fucking spew out whatever's on their mind,</v>

579
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.150
<v Speaker 1>that would be the place that they would go.</v>

580
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Especially if it's the same.</v>

581
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>

582
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:51.301
<v Speaker 1>The only thing different,</v>

583
00:17:51.301 --> 00:17:54.270
<v Speaker 1>and this is the thing where it got confusing with the youtube people versus the</v>

584
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:56.280
<v Speaker 1>audio people with the audio people.</v>

585
00:17:56.281 --> 00:17:58.770
<v Speaker 1>It's very obvious that the cash app as a sponsor,</v>

586
00:17:58.771 --> 00:18:00.150
<v Speaker 1>because it's we say it,</v>

587
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.250
<v Speaker 1>this podcast is brought to you by the cash app.</v>

588
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in Youtube they like,</v>

589
00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:03.901
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

590
00:18:03.901 --> 00:18:05.660
<v Speaker 1>they're hiding the fact that the cash apps,</v>

591
00:18:05.661 --> 00:18:06.494
<v Speaker 1>a sponsor.</v>

592
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.090
<v Speaker 1>We talked about it during the podcast itself,</v>

593
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.900
<v Speaker 1>but we don't put the ads on Youtube.</v>

594
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

595
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.690
<v Speaker 1>there's ads that youtube puts on,</v>

596
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.770
<v Speaker 1>but we put the ads on like after the show is over I'll read the ads and we'll</v>

597
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.240
<v Speaker 1>insert those into the audio and that will go up to itunes and rss feeds and all</v>

598
00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:24.930
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

599
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.910
<v Speaker 1>So the stuff that's on youtube,</v>

600
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.660
<v Speaker 1>it's abbreviated in the sense that especially the live one doesn't have</v>

601
00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:31.110
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

602
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:35.130
<v Speaker 1>So like this has zero ads and then the ones that will be posted on youtube</v>

603
00:18:35.131 --> 00:18:35.491
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

604
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:36.630
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of Youtube ads.</v>

605
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

606
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's why this.</v>

607
00:18:38.121 --> 00:18:40.560
<v Speaker 1>So there was a couple of conspiracy theories in that regard.</v>

608
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.340
<v Speaker 1>There's also apparently an emerging conspiracy theory about that.</v>

609
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Jack was trying to pump up bitcoin because they have some sort of a bitcoin</v>

610
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.943
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

611
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.293
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard this one?</v>

612
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.081
<v Speaker 1>I read that,</v>

613
00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:56.160
<v Speaker 1>but from what I saw it's not higher than it was at any point.</v>

614
00:18:56.161 --> 00:18:57.870
<v Speaker 1>It's still right around $3,500.</v>

615
00:18:57.871 --> 00:19:02.860
<v Speaker 1>So if there was a pump and dump scheme of some sort then like it should be like</v>

616
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.350
<v Speaker 1>provable on a blockchain I guess.</v>

617
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

618
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:05.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

619
00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that,</v>

620
00:19:05.971 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 1>but is there any other component to it?</v>

621
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:08.071
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

622
00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:08.491
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

623
00:19:08.491 --> 00:19:09.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where that was coming from.</v>

624
00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.620
<v Speaker 1>This don't even know what did it all he said was that will the cash app sells</v>

625
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.310
<v Speaker 1>bitcoins.</v>

626
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.143
<v Speaker 1>We talked about</v>

627
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.103
<v Speaker 2>coin.</v>

628
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.700
<v Speaker 2>You can buy and sell bitcoin through the cash app,</v>

629
00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:20.300
<v Speaker 2>I should say.</v>

630
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.280
<v Speaker 2>I think he said something about blockchain technology,</v>

631
00:19:22.281 --> 00:19:24.690
<v Speaker 2>rendering everything permanent online and that was.</v>

632
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.830
<v Speaker 2>That was something different though.</v>

633
00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

634
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.621
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

635
00:19:26.621 --> 00:19:30.290
<v Speaker 1>that I think that's in regard to comments into anything.</v>

636
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Blog posts,</v>

637
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.970
<v Speaker 1>blockchain is essentially going to have everything that's online forever,</v>

638
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:39.620
<v Speaker 1>but there's so many fucking conspiracy theories about all this stuff.</v>

639
00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:40.190
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

640
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.270
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating.</v>

641
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.870
<v Speaker 1>And as you know,</v>

642
00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.810
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about earlier with your,</v>

643
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.400
<v Speaker 1>the way you do yours,</v>

644
00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:51.500
<v Speaker 1>you used to use patrion and now you use your own website after the Sargon of a</v>

645
00:19:51.501 --> 00:19:52.400
<v Speaker 1>cod incident,</v>

646
00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:52.660
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

647
00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

648
00:19:53.241 --> 00:19:54.540
<v Speaker 1>beliefs stepped back away from</v>

649
00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.290
<v Speaker 2>patrion now or not.</v>

650
00:19:56.291 --> 00:19:58.890
<v Speaker 2>So no blade depending on what you think of Oregon to pick out.</v>

651
00:19:58.891 --> 00:19:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

652
00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

653
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Well it's not even that.</v>

654
00:20:00.221 --> 00:20:00.890
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

655
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

656
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

657
00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

658
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:07.990
<v Speaker 2>there's so many misconceptions about what happened there and I tried to clear</v>

659
00:20:08.651 --> 00:20:10.210
<v Speaker 2>them up on my podcast,</v>

660
00:20:10.211 --> 00:20:11.290
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

661
00:20:11.291 --> 00:20:14.320
<v Speaker 2>there's an interesting implication to not taking ads.</v>

662
00:20:14.321 --> 00:20:14.441
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

663
00:20:14.441 --> 00:20:14.590
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

664
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:15.850
<v Speaker 2>I think what's happening,</v>

665
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.950
<v Speaker 2>and this is much bigger than even podcasting,</v>

666
00:20:17.951 --> 00:20:18.784
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

667
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I'd be interested to know what you feel about this.</v>

668
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.600
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>

669
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.600
<v Speaker 2>you are the quintessence of the successful ad model in,</v>

670
00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:28.521
<v Speaker 2>in podcasting,</v>

671
00:20:28.521 --> 00:20:28.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

672
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is you.</v>

673
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:33.070
<v Speaker 2>It's working fantastically well for you.</v>

674
00:20:33.071 --> 00:20:36.790
<v Speaker 2>And for people like Tim Ferriss and probably Mark Marin.</v>

675
00:20:36.791 --> 00:20:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's this,</v>

676
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:41.050
<v Speaker 2>there's some kind of like a winner take all thing happening in this space where</v>

677
00:20:41.051 --> 00:20:46.051
<v Speaker 2>ads are working great and I am a really also a highly successful example of the</v>

678
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:51.723
<v Speaker 2>support model.</v>

679
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:56.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like the pbs model or the NPR model and what's weird is that I can't,</v>

680
00:20:56.471 --> 00:20:56.981
<v Speaker 2>like we,</v>

681
00:20:56.981 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

682
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.410
<v Speaker 2>you and I are both surrounded by people who have podcasts,</v>

683
00:21:00.411 --> 00:21:03.880
<v Speaker 2>want to have podcasts and are asking us for advice about how to succeed and how</v>

684
00:21:03.881 --> 00:21:04.714
<v Speaker 2>to monetize.</v>

685
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:10.170
<v Speaker 2>And like I'm not even in a place where I can recommend my model to anyone else.</v>

686
00:21:10.961 --> 00:21:11.201
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

687
00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Because it's,</v>

688
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.453
<v Speaker 2>it's a very,</v>

689
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.380
<v Speaker 2>it's very hit or miss.</v>

690
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:17.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had just happened to have developed an audience that will support my</v>

691
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:19.900
<v Speaker 2>work and you had developed that audience previously,</v>

692
00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:21.310
<v Speaker 2>ironically enough on youtube,</v>

693
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:26.530
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of youtube debates and random people calling people putting my</v>

694
00:21:26.531 --> 00:21:27.820
<v Speaker 2>content on their youtube channels,</v>

695
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.220
<v Speaker 2>but they're mostly debates,</v>

696
00:21:30.221 --> 00:21:30.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

697
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

698
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:31.690
<v Speaker 2>And as a,</v>

699
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:31.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

700
00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:32.591
<v Speaker 2>as an author,</v>

701
00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:37.591
<v Speaker 2>but it was just a podcast grew and I had this sort of for forest choice where am</v>

702
00:21:39.161 --> 00:21:39.690
<v Speaker 2>I going to go the,</v>

703
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:39.940
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

704
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.230
<v Speaker 2>the ad route or,</v>

705
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:42.123
<v Speaker 2>or not.</v>

706
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.390
<v Speaker 2>And I found that I may have two things to,</v>

707
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.081
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

708
00:21:48.081 --> 00:21:48.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

709
00:21:48.251 --> 00:21:49.660
<v Speaker 2>fairly strongly against ads,</v>

710
00:21:49.661 --> 00:21:53.620
<v Speaker 2>but really only one of them applies to me and I don't think it applies to you or</v>

711
00:21:53.621 --> 00:21:54.221
<v Speaker 2>tim or,</v>

712
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:55.120
<v Speaker 2>or anyone else.</v>

713
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:55.821
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

714
00:21:55.821 --> 00:22:00.821
<v Speaker 2>I just felt personally I couldn't use ads because of sort of what my platform is</v>

715
00:22:01.511 --> 00:22:05.170
<v Speaker 2>and the kinds of topics I'm engaging and it just didn't work.</v>

716
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:10.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was nothing high brow enough where I felt like my credibility</v>

717
00:22:11.441 --> 00:22:13.090
<v Speaker 2>wasn't getting subtly undermine.</v>

718
00:22:13.091 --> 00:22:13.571
<v Speaker 2>Bye Bye.</v>

719
00:22:13.571 --> 00:22:14.201
<v Speaker 2>Shilling for it.</v>

720
00:22:14.201 --> 00:22:14.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

721
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:17.230
<v Speaker 2>it could be something that I just legit loved and it could've been the Oxford</v>

722
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.681
<v Speaker 2>English dictionary,</v>

723
00:22:17.681 --> 00:22:17.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

724
00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:20.440
<v Speaker 2>like you guys is the best engineer in the world.</v>

725
00:22:20.441 --> 00:22:21.274
<v Speaker 2>You guys should use it.</v>

726
00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I still couldn't do it and I tried it with the only thing I took on as a sponsor</v>

727
00:22:26.081 --> 00:22:26.740
<v Speaker 2>was audible.</v>

728
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.450
<v Speaker 2>And I did that for some weeks and then it just,</v>

729
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

730
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.943
<v Speaker 2>I love audible but,</v>

731
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:30.410
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

732
00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:31.180
<v Speaker 2>it just felt wrong.</v>

733
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:36.180
<v Speaker 2>And so I decided to just experiment with a different business model and it's</v>

734
00:22:36.941 --> 00:22:38.050
<v Speaker 2>working for me,</v>

735
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

736
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:43.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it can work for most people and I view that as a problem.</v>

737
00:22:43.331 --> 00:22:43.481
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

738
00:22:43.481 --> 00:22:43.670
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

739
00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:48.670
<v Speaker 2>and the thing that I think is interesting is that this is much bigger than</v>

740
00:22:49.091 --> 00:22:49.471
<v Speaker 2>podcasts.</v>

741
00:22:49.471 --> 00:22:50.171
<v Speaker 2>And so you have,</v>

742
00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:53.470
<v Speaker 2>like you have facebook on the one hand,</v>

743
00:22:53.471 --> 00:22:55.450
<v Speaker 2>which is just a,</v>

744
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.670
<v Speaker 2>a totally free platform.</v>

745
00:22:57.671 --> 00:23:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Where were the users don't even realize that they're not the customers there at</v>

746
00:23:01.931 --> 00:23:02.920
<v Speaker 2>the actual product,</v>

747
00:23:02.921 --> 00:23:03.131
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

748
00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:08.131
<v Speaker 2>They use as the users are having their attention sold to advertisers and it's</v>

749
00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:09.820
<v Speaker 2>this enormous business.</v>

750
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.920
<v Speaker 2>And on the other end of the digital spectrum,</v>

751
00:23:11.921 --> 00:23:13.270
<v Speaker 2>you have Netflix,</v>

752
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.280
<v Speaker 2>which is just a stark paywall,</v>

753
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

754
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.380
<v Speaker 2>And there's no way in but to pay the subscription and you know,</v>

755
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:20.890
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

756
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:24.490
<v Speaker 2>and Netflix could run ads and get more money if they wanted to,</v>

757
00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:25.520
<v Speaker 2>but they're not,</v>

758
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.090
<v Speaker 2>they're not doing that and presumably won't do that.</v>

759
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:33.280
<v Speaker 2>And I'm hoping just generally speaking that the digital future looks much more</v>

760
00:23:33.281 --> 00:23:35.590
<v Speaker 2>like Netflix and much less like facebook.</v>

761
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.160
<v Speaker 2>And because I see what ads has ads have done is they've anchored everyone to the</v>

762
00:23:42.221 --> 00:23:43.420
<v Speaker 2>illusion of free.</v>

763
00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:48.421
<v Speaker 2>Everyone expects their digital content for free except in places like Netflix.</v>

764
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.891
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

765
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:50.870
<v Speaker 2>So like if when you release a comedy special,</v>

766
00:23:50.871 --> 00:23:54.770
<v Speaker 2>when you release your next hour and you sell it to Netflix,</v>

767
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.460
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine there are very few people in,</v>

768
00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.480
<v Speaker 2>in your fan base who are thinking,</v>

769
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:00.830
<v Speaker 2>well fuck Joe Rogan,</v>

770
00:24:00.831 --> 00:24:02.420
<v Speaker 2>why didn't he just put that out on Youtube?</v>

771
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:02.841
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

772
00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Why is this on Netflix?</v>

773
00:24:03.981 --> 00:24:04.121
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

774
00:24:04.121 --> 00:24:07.640
<v Speaker 2>they sort of understand that this piece of content is,</v>

775
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:10.010
<v Speaker 2>belongs on that shelf and that if they want it,</v>

776
00:24:10.011 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 2>they have to subscribe to Netflix.</v>

777
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you did something slightly different,</v>

778
00:24:16.071 --> 00:24:17.330
<v Speaker 2>but functionally the same,</v>

779
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:21.860
<v Speaker 2>if you put it on Vimeo and charge people $5 or whatever in a vimeo on demand,</v>

780
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.233
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

781
00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:23.570
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

782
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd get a lot more pain,</v>

783
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

784
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

785
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:25.881
<v Speaker 2>people would say,</v>

786
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:26.481
<v Speaker 2>well fuck you,</v>

787
00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:27.530
<v Speaker 2>you greedy bastard like you've,</v>

788
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:28.610
<v Speaker 2>you're already doing great.</v>

789
00:24:28.611 --> 00:24:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Just release your stuff.</v>

790
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:30.111
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

791
00:24:30.111 --> 00:24:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

792
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.310
<v Speaker 2>And I view that as a problem as like,</v>

793
00:24:34.311 --> 00:24:35.600
<v Speaker 2>it's like a psychological problem.</v>

794
00:24:35.601 --> 00:24:39.830
<v Speaker 2>People have been anchored to the ad subsidized model more or less everywhere and</v>

795
00:24:39.831 --> 00:24:41.600
<v Speaker 2>they expect everything for free.</v>

796
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:47.110
<v Speaker 2>And in my world I'm trying to just continually brook that expectation and push</v>

797
00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:54.380
<v Speaker 2>people into a different sense of you get what you pay for and,</v>

798
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:59.410
<v Speaker 2>and the so that the hybrid model I've created for myself is I'm putting more</v>

799
00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:00.830
<v Speaker 2>stuff behind a paywall,</v>

800
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:01.281
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

801
00:25:01.281 --> 00:25:01.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

802
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.170
<v Speaker 2>so that this is not just pure sponsorship of otherwise free content,</v>

803
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.860
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

804
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:08.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm very personally,</v>

805
00:25:08.901 --> 00:25:12.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm very uncomfortable with the idea that if someone actually can't afford it,</v>

806
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.450
<v Speaker 2>they can't get access to my content.</v>

807
00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:15.620
<v Speaker 2>So I just tell people,</v>

808
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.460
<v Speaker 2>if you really can't afford the stuff behind the pay wall or you really can't</v>

809
00:25:19.461 --> 00:25:20.660
<v Speaker 2>afford my meditation APP,</v>

810
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.090
<v Speaker 2>just send us an email and we'll give it to you for free.</v>

811
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:23.541
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

812
00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:24.650
<v Speaker 2>So I've heard that.</v>

813
00:25:24.651 --> 00:25:25.010
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

814
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.880
<v Speaker 2>this guy's crazy.</v>

815
00:25:25.881 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's actually,</v>

816
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.190
<v Speaker 2>it's actually in the pricing,</v>

817
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.110
<v Speaker 2>in the APP store for my meditation APP.</v>

818
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:32.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's the pricing and then below that there's,</v>

819
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.040
<v Speaker 2>if you can't afford this,</v>

820
00:25:34.041 --> 00:25:34.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

821
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:34.761
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>

822
00:25:34.761 --> 00:25:35.594
<v Speaker 2>here's the email address.</v>

823
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.860
<v Speaker 2>I think that's fantastic.</v>

824
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:37.723
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

825
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:38.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

826
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm splitting it that way,</v>

827
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:41.780
<v Speaker 2>but I'm raising prices.</v>

828
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.560
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

829
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.393
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

830
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.670
<v Speaker 2>because I think everything is too cheap in the,</v>

831
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.970
<v Speaker 2>in the digital space I think.</v>

832
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.500
<v Speaker 2>I think we're anchored to.</v>

833
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:53.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are people who will spend $5 a day on a cup of coffee everyday for</v>

834
00:25:54.471 --> 00:25:59.471
<v Speaker 2>the rest of their lives and he had a few told them this podcast or this app that</v>

835
00:26:00.111 --> 00:26:00.440
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

836
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:05.270
<v Speaker 2>that they say is incredibly valuable to them is going to cost them $5 a month.</v>

837
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.320
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

838
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.310
<v Speaker 2>they feel raped.</v>

839
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:07.701
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

840
00:26:07.701 --> 00:26:07.911
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

841
00:26:07.911 --> 00:26:08.744
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

842
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

843
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.340
<v Speaker 2>and I completely understand it because I know what it's like to hit a pay wall</v>

844
00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:15.830
<v Speaker 2>and think I can't get my credit card out again.</v>

845
00:26:15.831 --> 00:26:16.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to pay for this.</v>

846
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find this information somewhere else.</v>

847
00:26:18.951 --> 00:26:22.700
<v Speaker 2>So we've all been anchored to this thing and you know,</v>

848
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.460
<v Speaker 2>something is going to win in the end.</v>

849
00:26:25.461 --> 00:26:25.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

850
00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:25.701
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

851
00:26:25.701 --> 00:26:25.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

852
00:26:25.911 --> 00:26:27.200
<v Speaker 2>I think at some point,</v>

853
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.440
<v Speaker 2>you know it's going to look much more like Netflix or much more like a facebook</v>

854
00:26:33.231 --> 00:26:33.421
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

855
00:26:33.421 --> 00:26:33.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

856
00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:34.041
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

857
00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:34.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

858
00:26:34.191 --> 00:26:35.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm throwing my lot in with the former,</v>

859
00:26:35.871 --> 00:26:37.760
<v Speaker 2>but it really is the wild west.</v>

860
00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:38.001
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

861
00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:41.930
<v Speaker 2>the Netflix things different because Netflix has programs that cost a lot of</v>

862
00:26:41.931 --> 00:26:42.764
<v Speaker 2>money to create.</v>

863
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 2>This podcast is very</v>

864
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:44.341
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

865
00:26:44.341 --> 00:26:44.881
<v Speaker 1>You're my friend.</v>

866
00:26:44.881 --> 00:26:45.391
<v Speaker 1>I call you up,</v>

867
00:26:45.391 --> 00:26:45.541
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

868
00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:46.341
<v Speaker 1>you want to do a podcast?</v>

869
00:26:46.341 --> 00:26:47.174
<v Speaker 1>You coming over here.</v>

870
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously we had to pay for all this equipment,</v>

871
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:52.860
<v Speaker 1>but other than that it's just bandwidth and rent and all that stuff.</v>

872
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:53.371
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>

873
00:26:53.371 --> 00:26:54.204
<v Speaker 1>it just goes up.</v>

874
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you do a comedy special across hundreds of thousands of dollars.</v>

875
00:26:57.541 --> 00:26:58.740
<v Speaker 1>You have to secure a venue,</v>

876
00:26:58.741 --> 00:26:59.940
<v Speaker 1>you have to hire staff.</v>

877
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a big deal.</v>

878
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:02.520
<v Speaker 1>That's an.</v>

879
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.880
<v Speaker 1>That's an easy thing in terms of like bang for their buck,</v>

880
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:07.620
<v Speaker 1>what Netflix will get out of it.</v>

881
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.050
<v Speaker 1>If you do a television show,</v>

882
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:10.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean my God,</v>

883
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:11.450
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

884
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.530
<v Speaker 1>you need to hire hundreds of people.</v>

885
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:18.420
<v Speaker 1>There's wardrobe and makeup and set and there's writers and producers and</v>

886
00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:21.000
<v Speaker 1>executives and everybody has to go over the script with a fine tooth comb.</v>

887
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.320
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly,</v>

888
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.610
<v Speaker 1>incredibly strenuous.</v>

889
00:27:23.611 --> 00:27:27.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot going on when you create a television like stranger things or</v>

890
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:27.571
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

891
00:27:27.571 --> 00:27:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have so much special effects and so to ask for that for free seems to</v>

892
00:27:32.001 --> 00:27:33.930
<v Speaker 1>be to me seems ridiculous.</v>

893
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

894
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:35.601
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

895
00:27:35.601 --> 00:27:37.260
<v Speaker 2>but except I mean,</v>

896
00:27:37.261 --> 00:27:38.400
<v Speaker 2>so I'm kind of split.</v>

897
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:38.731
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

898
00:27:38.731 --> 00:27:39.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm running on two tracks here.</v>

899
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.450
<v Speaker 2>An APP is much more like a television show.</v>

900
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Surprisingly that than it is like a podcast.</v>

901
00:27:44.881 --> 00:27:45.420
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>

902
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.400
<v Speaker 2>but even if it's just a podcast,</v>

903
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:49.680
<v Speaker 2>if you want to build something,</v>

904
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:51.420
<v Speaker 2>if you want to build a media company like,</v>

905
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.810
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

906
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:53.010
<v Speaker 2>like let's say you were,</v>

907
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.660
<v Speaker 2>let's say you were asking for support for this otherwise free pod podcast.</v>

908
00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.210
<v Speaker 2>People don't know what your aspirations are.</v>

909
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:02.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe you want to start a podcast network,</v>

910
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:02.431
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

911
00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you have,</v>

912
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:07.080
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to build a business that is that maybe you have massive payroll</v>

913
00:28:07.081 --> 00:28:09.900
<v Speaker 2>expenses that you,</v>

914
00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:10.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

915
00:28:10.551 --> 00:28:15.551
<v Speaker 2>so the expectation that the products should always be free closes the door to</v>

916
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:19.880
<v Speaker 2>any of those aspirations if in fact you have them and you know,</v>

917
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:20.520
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

918
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.353
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

919
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is very interesting psychologically because.</v>

920
00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:24.591
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

921
00:28:24.591 --> 00:28:24.991
<v Speaker 2>so I have,</v>

922
00:28:24.991 --> 00:28:27.450
<v Speaker 2>I've created this network of support for my podcast,</v>

923
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.080
<v Speaker 2>but I see people do calculations that they would never do in a more</v>

924
00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:35.840
<v Speaker 2>transactional space that they were just like,</v>

925
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.320
<v Speaker 2>let's say buying my next book.</v>

926
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.591
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

927
00:28:37.591 --> 00:28:38.424
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

928
00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:38.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

929
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.940
<v Speaker 2>for me offering a free podcast and then saying if you find this valuable,</v>

930
00:28:44.881 --> 00:28:45.780
<v Speaker 2>you can support it,</v>

931
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:46.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

932
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.513
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

933
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:47.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

934
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.950
<v Speaker 2>from the side of being a creator of that content,</v>

935
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:55.430
<v Speaker 2>it feels like the most transparent interaction possible because a person can</v>

936
00:28:55.861 --> 00:28:59.490
<v Speaker 2>listen for free for as long as they want to just discover how valuable that is</v>

937
00:28:59.491 --> 00:29:02.340
<v Speaker 2>and then they can support it to the degree that they find it valuable.</v>

938
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if I'm selling you a book,</v>

939
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.130
<v Speaker 2>you can't even read the book before you before you buy it or you have to make</v>

940
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.780
<v Speaker 2>the decision to buy it.</v>

941
00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:12.510
<v Speaker 2>And I'm trying to convince you to buy it because it took me all this time to</v>

942
00:29:12.511 --> 00:29:12.930
<v Speaker 2>write it.</v>

943
00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:13.260
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

944
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.093
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

945
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:14.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

946
00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:15.060
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

947
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:15.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

948
00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:16.000
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

949
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.100
<v Speaker 2>it's transactional.</v>

950
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm with,</v>

951
00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:20.970
<v Speaker 2>but with a podcast,</v>

952
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:26.030
<v Speaker 2>people make calculations that they would never make when they're just figuring</v>

953
00:29:26.191 --> 00:29:27.550
<v Speaker 2>out whether they want to buy something that's like,</v>

954
00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:30.960
<v Speaker 2>like I'll really along the lines of what you just described.</v>

955
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:31.861
<v Speaker 2>People say,</v>

956
00:29:31.861 --> 00:29:32.694
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

957
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.950
<v Speaker 2>how much has the podcast costs to produce?</v>

958
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:35.341
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

959
00:29:35.341 --> 00:29:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

960
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:39.930
<v Speaker 2>like if I knew what you were spending the money on and what it costs you to do</v>

961
00:29:39.931 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 2>this podcast will then I would support you.</v>

962
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:42.431
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

963
00:29:42.431 --> 00:29:47.110
<v Speaker 2>But they're never saying how much does it cost to write a book and if I knew</v>

964
00:29:47.111 --> 00:29:49.240
<v Speaker 2>what you were going to spend the money on once you,</v>

965
00:29:49.241 --> 00:29:50.600
<v Speaker 2>once you were once,</v>

966
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.700
<v Speaker 2>once I bought this book,</v>

967
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.800
<v Speaker 2>then I would know whether or not I wanted to buy.</v>

968
00:29:53.801 --> 00:29:55.180
<v Speaker 2>They either want the book or you don't.</v>

969
00:29:55.181 --> 00:29:55.361
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

970
00:29:55.361 --> 00:29:57.670
<v Speaker 2>So the problem with the support model,</v>

971
00:29:57.671 --> 00:30:00.160
<v Speaker 2>and that's the problem with Patriot and everything else,</v>

972
00:30:00.161 --> 00:30:02.030
<v Speaker 2>is that it engages the,</v>

973
00:30:02.031 --> 00:30:04.900
<v Speaker 2>sort of the philanthropy charity side of the brain,</v>

974
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

975
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:08.830
<v Speaker 2>And people are worried about what you're going to do and how much it,</v>

976
00:30:08.831 --> 00:30:09.281
<v Speaker 2>all costs.</v>

977
00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:10.480
<v Speaker 2>Like how much does it cost?</v>

978
00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

979
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>

980
00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:11.890
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

981
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:14.410
<v Speaker 2>that's a question that someone is asking when they're donating.</v>

982
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:15.400
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't been donating.</v>

983
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.390
<v Speaker 2>And the problem there is they're not understanding,</v>

984
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

985
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.240
<v Speaker 2>just the opportunity costs.</v>

986
00:30:22.241 --> 00:30:22.481
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

987
00:30:22.481 --> 00:30:22.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

988
00:30:22.691 --> 00:30:24.280
<v Speaker 2>I have to decide how to spend my time,</v>

989
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:27.460
<v Speaker 2>am I going to spend 90 percent of my time on a podcast will that,</v>

990
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.181
<v Speaker 2>if.</v>

991
00:30:28.181 --> 00:30:29.014
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

992
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:30.650
<v Speaker 2>that closes the door to,</v>

993
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.920
<v Speaker 2>to virtually everything else I can do.</v>

994
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:33.221
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

995
00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:33.630
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

996
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:33.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

997
00:30:33.831 --> 00:30:33.970
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

998
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:35.650
<v Speaker 2>it has to become a viable business.</v>

999
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:36.761
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1000
00:30:36.761 --> 00:30:36.971
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1001
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:37.081
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1002
00:30:37.081 --> 00:30:39.580
<v Speaker 2>I've recognized now that I am,</v>

1003
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:40.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1004
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:45.310
<v Speaker 2>to some degree going against the grain of human psychology in asking for support</v>

1005
00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:45.940
<v Speaker 2>and now I,</v>

1006
00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.430
<v Speaker 2>now I feel like I'm going to ask much less,</v>

1007
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell people what the business model is and you know,</v>

1008
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.720
<v Speaker 2>instilling and remind them of it,</v>

1009
00:30:52.721 --> 00:30:54.970
<v Speaker 2>but I'm personally,</v>

1010
00:30:54.971 --> 00:30:59.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go more and more in the direction of putting stuff behind a paywall</v>

1011
00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.870
<v Speaker 2>and if people want it then they can support.</v>

1012
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:02.990
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>

1013
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.320
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of sort of Netflix,</v>

1014
00:31:05.321 --> 00:31:10.321
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate version of it would be if it were Netflix that would also let you</v>

1015
00:31:10.391 --> 00:31:11.980
<v Speaker 2>get it for free if you really couldn't afford it.</v>

1016
00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:13.573
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

1017
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.260
<v Speaker 2>that's the guilt free business model that I'm converging on that.</v>

1018
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

1019
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I like how you're thinking and I'd like the ethics involved in it and I think</v>

1020
00:31:21.961 --> 00:31:22.651
<v Speaker 1>it's a great thing.</v>

1021
00:31:22.651 --> 00:31:24.030
<v Speaker 1>And when you set it on your podcast,</v>

1022
00:31:24.031 --> 00:31:24.691
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked,</v>

1023
00:31:24.691 --> 00:31:26.010
<v Speaker 1>but it makes sense coming from you.</v>

1024
00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1025
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.080
<v Speaker 1>my thought is I'm in negotiation or in discussions right now,</v>

1026
00:31:31.081 --> 00:31:32.280
<v Speaker 1>and I talked to you about this too,</v>

1027
00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:37.340
<v Speaker 1>about building an APP and what I want to do with the APP is have a set amount of</v>

1028
00:31:37.531 --> 00:31:42.120
<v Speaker 1>money that you pay per month if you want to sign up for the APP and you get the</v>

1029
00:31:42.121 --> 00:31:43.620
<v Speaker 1>podcast with no ads,</v>

1030
00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1031
00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:48.840
<v Speaker 1>So you could either get it from itunes or whatever you google play or Google</v>

1032
00:31:48.841 --> 00:31:52.110
<v Speaker 1>podcast or you can get it from the APP and if you get it from the APP,</v>

1033
00:31:52.111 --> 00:31:56.220
<v Speaker 1>you pay x amount per month and you get the podcast with zero ads and it'll</v>

1034
00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:56.910
<v Speaker 1>stream live.</v>

1035
00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to figure out how to do both those things.</v>

1036
00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:02.910
<v Speaker 1>My thought going into advertising when I,</v>

1037
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.200
<v Speaker 1>when I first did the podcast,</v>

1038
00:32:04.201 --> 00:32:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing the podcast now for nine years.</v>

1039
00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.620
<v Speaker 1>When I first started doing it,</v>

1040
00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:09.450
<v Speaker 1>there was no ads for the longest time.</v>

1041
00:32:09.451 --> 00:32:10.320
<v Speaker 1>It just costs money.</v>

1042
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.670
<v Speaker 1>It costs money to,</v>

1043
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:12.391
<v Speaker 1>for bandwidth,</v>

1044
00:32:12.391 --> 00:32:13.171
<v Speaker 1>it costs money to put it.</v>

1045
00:32:13.171 --> 00:32:14.880
<v Speaker 1>But I was doing it for fun and I didn't care.</v>

1046
00:32:14.881 --> 00:32:17.220
<v Speaker 1>And I had my revenue was coming from other sources.</v>

1047
00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:18.121
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1048
00:32:18.121 --> 00:32:19.440
<v Speaker 1>a few years ago,</v>

1049
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1050
00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I decided what I was going to do was,</v>

1051
00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.000
<v Speaker 1>because I was getting ad,</v>

1052
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.420
<v Speaker 1>the first ad request was the facebook was the fleshlight rather,</v>

1053
00:32:27.421 --> 00:32:30.870
<v Speaker 1>and you were the first person to request I killed them to not have the</v>

1054
00:32:30.871 --> 00:32:32.490
<v Speaker 1>flashlight on your podcast.</v>

1055
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.010
<v Speaker 1>The first podcast that we did in Prima Donna</v>

1056
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:37.650
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1057
00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:38.490
<v Speaker 1>it made sense.</v>

1058
00:32:38.491 --> 00:32:38.721
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1059
00:32:38.721 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 1>they were disgusting adds to.</v>

1060
00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:40.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1061
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.110
<v Speaker 1>we would get ridiculous and,</v>

1062
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.150
<v Speaker 1>and be really silly and those ads,</v>

1063
00:32:44.151 --> 00:32:45.200
<v Speaker 1>it was just the juxtaposition.</v>

1064
00:32:45.201 --> 00:32:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1065
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:49.520
<v Speaker 1>just knowing that the Mike would go hot and then 15 seconds before it would</v>

1066
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:52.460
<v Speaker 1>still be ringing in their ears if you want to jack off with this fantastic</v>

1067
00:32:52.461 --> 00:32:53.294
<v Speaker 1>device.</v>

1068
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.710
<v Speaker 1>And here's Sam Harris,</v>

1069
00:32:54.711 --> 00:32:55.544
<v Speaker 1>neuroscientists,</v>

1070
00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.990
<v Speaker 1>but moral philosopher,</v>

1071
00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.730
<v Speaker 1>the fleshlight experience,</v>

1072
00:32:58.731 --> 00:33:03.080
<v Speaker 1>some pretty significant positive impact from that.</v>

1073
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:06.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean their business went through the roof because of the podcast.</v>

1074
00:33:06.771 --> 00:33:07.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1075
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:10.130
<v Speaker 1>they're really sold a shitload of flashlights where they told me that like some</v>

1076
00:33:10.131 --> 00:33:10.881
<v Speaker 1>ungodly number,</v>

1077
00:33:10.881 --> 00:33:14.120
<v Speaker 1>like 50 percent of the flashlights they were selling was codeword Rogan.</v>

1078
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.200
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want a picture too much.</v>

1079
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.900
<v Speaker 1>The armies of people using their product,</v>

1080
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:21.260
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1081
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:26.260
<v Speaker 1>So word got around and then as the podcast space started expanding,</v>

1082
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.250
<v Speaker 1>then advertisers,</v>

1083
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:33.400
<v Speaker 1>tentatively we're dipping their toe in my philosophy and it's still holds 2006</v>

1084
00:33:35.091 --> 00:33:35.924
<v Speaker 1>or seven or</v>

1085
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.660
<v Speaker 1>2012.</v>

1086
00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.580
<v Speaker 1>The first time I was on here it was 2011.</v>

1087
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.053
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1088
00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the end of 2009.</v>

1089
00:33:46.611 --> 00:33:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 10 was probably on before.</v>

1090
00:33:48.981 --> 00:33:49.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1091
00:33:49.281 --> 00:33:51.390
<v Speaker 1>You were probably around 2010 or 11.</v>

1092
00:33:51.391 --> 00:33:53.930
<v Speaker 1>There was no other ads other than the fleshlight though with you.</v>

1093
00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1094
00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.640
<v Speaker 1>and then the fleshlight dropped off when we started asking for more money.</v>

1095
00:33:57.641 --> 00:33:57.911
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1096
00:33:57.911 --> 00:33:58.090
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1097
00:33:58.090 --> 00:33:59.420
<v Speaker 1>I think we hit the point of no return.</v>

1098
00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:03.170
<v Speaker 1>But my philosophy getting into advertisement was a,</v>

1099
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:08.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want to do a 100 percent and have no impact</v>

1100
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:13.220
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever on the content of my podcast.</v>

1101
00:34:13.221 --> 00:34:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Like whatever advertisers that I choose,</v>

1102
00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.270
<v Speaker 1>whatever advertisers that</v>

1103
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.120
<v Speaker 1>make deals with,</v>

1104
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.480
<v Speaker 1>they have to understand that there's no way I'm changing the content of the</v>

1105
00:34:23.481 --> 00:34:26.180
<v Speaker 1>podcast and if I lose them I lose them.</v>

1106
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.133
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

1107
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.210
<v Speaker 1>And that was the thought process going in.</v>

1108
00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:33.230
<v Speaker 1>So I never hit a snag like this cash app,</v>

1109
00:34:33.231 --> 00:34:38.231
<v Speaker 1>Jack Dorsey thing before where people think that the reason why I was easy with</v>

1110
00:34:38.241 --> 00:34:41.240
<v Speaker 1>him was because of the fact that he sponsors the podcasts.</v>

1111
00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a very obvious</v>

1112
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.050
<v Speaker 1>conflict of interest,</v>

1113
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:51.020
<v Speaker 1>but people have to realize that if they churn out off your podcast,</v>

1114
00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:53.400
<v Speaker 1>you've got just an endless number of advertisers.</v>

1115
00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.580
<v Speaker 1>There's waiting lines.</v>

1116
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:54.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1117
00:34:54.741 --> 00:34:57.380
<v Speaker 1>so I mean the cash out logical opponent,</v>

1118
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:59.810
<v Speaker 1>it's just one way of looking at it that they.</v>

1119
00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.400
<v Speaker 1>They buy a lot of ads.</v>

1120
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:02.720
<v Speaker 1>They do buy a lot of ads.</v>

1121
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:04.160
<v Speaker 1>We do have a good relationship with them,</v>

1122
00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:08.000
<v Speaker 1>but I don't need them if they went away.</v>

1123
00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:11.120
<v Speaker 1>I have too many ads and that sounds gross to say,</v>

1124
00:35:11.121 --> 00:35:12.170
<v Speaker 1>but it is a fact.</v>

1125
00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.320
<v Speaker 1>I have many more ads than I have spots for ads,</v>

1126
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:19.610
<v Speaker 1>so if they went away would not hurt me at all financially because I put a limit</v>

1127
00:35:19.611 --> 00:35:21.220
<v Speaker 1>on how many ads I do podcasts.</v>

1128
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I also don't ever interrupt a podcast with an ad.</v>

1129
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that because I don't do that.</v>

1130
00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:27.613
<v Speaker 1>That cost me money,</v>

1131
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:32.830
<v Speaker 1>but I just feel like the experience of listening to a podcast unbroken is so</v>

1132
00:35:33.981 --> 00:35:37.130
<v Speaker 1>much better than listening to a podcast.</v>

1133
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Be Right back with this word from Casper mattresses.</v>

1134
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:40.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1135
00:35:40.151 --> 00:35:42.030
<v Speaker 1>it just feels gross,</v>

1136
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.350
<v Speaker 1>but in the beginning I'm like,</v>

1137
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:43.800
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1138
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.760
<v Speaker 1>you know where it is.</v>

1139
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.080
<v Speaker 1>You can fast forward,</v>

1140
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.880
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you're into this stuff.</v>

1141
00:35:47.881 --> 00:35:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need stamps.com.</v>

1142
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.580
<v Speaker 1>It may be whatever the fuck you need.</v>

1143
00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Those are the ads.</v>

1144
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.890
<v Speaker 1>They pay a lot of money.</v>

1145
00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take that money and I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want and if</v>

1146
00:35:55.951 --> 00:35:57.150
<v Speaker 1>these guys decide,</v>

1147
00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:57.391
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1148
00:35:57.391 --> 00:35:59.880
<v Speaker 1>you smoke pot or you're too controversial,</v>

1149
00:35:59.881 --> 00:36:01.710
<v Speaker 1>or you talk about this or talk about that,</v>

1150
00:36:01.711 --> 00:36:02.544
<v Speaker 1>we're going to drop you.</v>

1151
00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:03.683
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1152
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.600
<v Speaker 1>that's my philosophy and I've lost ads.</v>

1153
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Have lost sponsors.</v>

1154
00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1155
00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't care,</v>

1156
00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:11.550
<v Speaker 1>but if I lost the cash app because it was too high,</v>

1157
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:15.810
<v Speaker 1>hard on Jack Dorsey or if Jack Dorsey comes back and I'm too hard on him in</v>

1158
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.910
<v Speaker 1>grilling him about these people that have been censored.</v>

1159
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I hope it doesn't,</v>

1160
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:20.640
<v Speaker 1>but I like him.</v>

1161
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:21.390
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice guy.</v>

1162
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what the fuck's going on there.</v>

1163
00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1164
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:23.671
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

1165
00:36:23.671 --> 00:36:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm having Tim Pool come on tomorrow.</v>

1166
00:36:25.591 --> 00:36:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Tim Pools of investigative journalists,</v>

1167
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.360
<v Speaker 1>independent journalist who was used to be with vice and he knows a lot about the</v>

1168
00:36:33.331 --> 00:36:36.020
<v Speaker 1>censorship issue with youtube or with a,</v>

1169
00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.020
<v Speaker 1>with twitter rather.</v>

1170
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.490
<v Speaker 1>And he knows about youtube as well,</v>

1171
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:39.150
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1172
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.280
<v Speaker 1>with who is censored and why,</v>

1173
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:42.180
<v Speaker 1>who is removed,</v>

1174
00:36:42.181 --> 00:36:43.290
<v Speaker 1>who's been deep platform,</v>

1175
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:47.100
<v Speaker 1>why they'd been diy platform and where the inconsistencies and you know,</v>

1176
00:36:47.101 --> 00:36:47.880
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

1177
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.300
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

1178
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.220
<v Speaker 1>why is it skewing so heavily,</v>

1179
00:36:50.221 --> 00:36:50.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1180
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Where the people in the right are the ones who were getting banned.</v>

1181
00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.200
<v Speaker 1>The people on the left are getting away with a lot of crazy shit.</v>

1182
00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.040
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to,</v>

1183
00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:59.250
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get into the weeds with that and if the cash app hears that and</v>

1184
00:36:59.251 --> 00:37:01.290
<v Speaker 1>they decided to drop me as a sponsor,</v>

1185
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.333
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

1186
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:03.630
<v Speaker 1>I really don't care.</v>

1187
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.670
<v Speaker 1>This is a major source of income for me,</v>

1188
00:37:05.671 --> 00:37:09.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's only one source is one of the things that being a standup comedian</v>

1189
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:13.080
<v Speaker 1>working for the UFC and having a podcast and I have a podcast with ads on</v>

1190
00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:13.800
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>

1191
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.670
<v Speaker 1>And and having ads that are on the regular podcast itself,</v>

1192
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm free in a sense too.</v>

1193
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I have plenty of money.</v>

1194
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not whether or not I'm starving or worry about paying my bills.</v>

1195
00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm free to do whatever I want to do.</v>

1196
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Well also actually be clear like I don't think because this can sound totally</v>

1197
00:37:31.201 --> 00:37:33.870
<v Speaker 1>sanctimonious and it's not intended that way.</v>

1198
00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:39.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think my scruples around at reading it as on my podcast apply to you or</v>

1199
00:37:41.821 --> 00:37:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Tim Ferriss or many other people like tim is the ultimate example.</v>

1200
00:37:44.881 --> 00:37:49.881
<v Speaker 1>Tim is somebody who's brand on some level is what I'm going to do is I'm going</v>

1201
00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:52.290
<v Speaker 1>to go out there and find the best shit in the world,</v>

1202
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.000
<v Speaker 1>the best shirts,</v>

1203
00:37:54.001 --> 00:37:55.410
<v Speaker 1>the best workout equipment that is,</v>

1204
00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:56.670
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to tell you about it.</v>

1205
00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:58.500
<v Speaker 1>So I want to know what tim has found.</v>

1206
00:37:58.930 --> 00:37:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Tim,</v>

1207
00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:04.190
<v Speaker 1>if tim is reading an ad for something that is totally brand convergent for him,</v>

1208
00:38:04.351 --> 00:38:07.350
<v Speaker 1>and I think you're very much in a similar situation if you're talking about on</v>

1209
00:38:07.351 --> 00:38:08.160
<v Speaker 1>it or whatever it is.</v>

1210
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.930
<v Speaker 1>It's your own you own part of on it.</v>

1211
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I should also be clear that I say no to a lot of ads that I don't want.</v>

1212
00:38:14.371 --> 00:38:15.031
<v Speaker 1>Like there was one,</v>

1213
00:38:15.031 --> 00:38:17.010
<v Speaker 1>there was a uber for babysitting.</v>

1214
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1215
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.350
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck Outta here.</v>

1216
00:38:19.351 --> 00:38:22.560
<v Speaker 1>What are you crazy that got recommended to me by somebody.</v>

1217
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.790
<v Speaker 1>But it sounds like it sounds like it sounds like craigslist for babies.</v>

1218
00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:27.690
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.</v>

1219
00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.630
<v Speaker 1>There's been a few that I've said no to quite a few.</v>

1220
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Some of them that are just boring.</v>

1221
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:32.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1222
00:38:32.701 --> 00:38:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not reading that.</v>

1223
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not selling that.</v>

1224
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:34.740
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid.</v>

1225
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 1>But also you're a comic</v>

1226
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.000
<v Speaker 2>who can send up ads and saw.</v>

1227
00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think bill burr does this where you kind of trashes the ad as he's</v>

1228
00:38:42.101 --> 00:38:46.630
<v Speaker 2>reading it because he lost naturebox cause he told people to go eat apples.</v>

1229
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:48.343
<v Speaker 2>Really</v>

1230
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:50.303
<v Speaker 2>fucking apple.</v>

1231
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.540
<v Speaker 2>So I mean that's totally.</v>

1232
00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:57.090
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that's a tool you have in your wheel house that has a</v>

1233
00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.210
<v Speaker 2>effects down the list.</v>

1234
00:38:58.211 --> 00:39:03.211
<v Speaker 2>Like it's one reason why you can stream live without really worrying about it.</v>

1235
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.600
<v Speaker 2>And I feel I can't like.</v>

1236
00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.750
<v Speaker 2>So it's like at the end of the day,</v>

1237
00:39:07.751 --> 00:39:10.270
<v Speaker 2>like if things go completely haywire on your podcast,</v>

1238
00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:11.560
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>

1239
00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:12.191
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1240
00:39:12.191 --> 00:39:12.941
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking comic,</v>

1241
00:39:12.941 --> 00:39:13.560
<v Speaker 2>what do I know?</v>

1242
00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:13.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1243
00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:14.141
<v Speaker 2>You like,</v>

1244
00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:14.580
<v Speaker 2>you can just,</v>

1245
00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.160
<v Speaker 2>you can just pull the rip cord and you're fine.</v>

1246
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1247
00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.550
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

1248
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1249
00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't say,</v>

1250
00:39:20.981 --> 00:39:21.814
<v Speaker 2>I'm a more</v>

1251
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:25.250
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1252
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1253
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:26.261
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

1254
00:39:26.261 --> 00:39:26.411
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1255
00:39:26.411 --> 00:39:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I can and there's certain circumstances where I should,</v>

1256
00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:29.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's like I,</v>

1257
00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.440
<v Speaker 2>I should avoid those circumstances.</v>

1258
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1259
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.793
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1260
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:33.723
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1261
00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:34.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1262
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:34.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1263
00:39:34.541 --> 00:39:38.970
<v Speaker 2>I have to prepare more for podcasts and um,</v>

1264
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.260
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I personally,</v>

1265
00:39:41.261 --> 00:39:42.094
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1266
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.830
<v Speaker 2>it's as much as out of concern for my guests as well.</v>

1267
00:39:44.831 --> 00:39:45.664
<v Speaker 2>Like I just,</v>

1268
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:46.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1269
00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:47.290
<v Speaker 2>this is a high wire act,</v>

1270
00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:52.860
<v Speaker 2>but I want to net normally so that people feel free to be totally unguarded</v>

1271
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.630
<v Speaker 2>because they know that if we have a spazz attack,</v>

1272
00:39:55.631 --> 00:39:55.961
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>

1273
00:39:55.961 --> 00:39:56.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1274
00:39:56.231 --> 00:39:56.641
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>

1275
00:39:56.641 --> 00:39:57.474
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1276
00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:57.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1277
00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.490
<v Speaker 2>even uttering spazz attack will screw.</v>

1278
00:39:59.491 --> 00:40:00.640
<v Speaker 2>So some people's careers.</v>

1279
00:40:00.641 --> 00:40:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1280
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:03.490
<v Speaker 2>We actually had a conversation about a podcast that I talked to you about one of</v>

1281
00:40:03.491 --> 00:40:06.220
<v Speaker 2>your podcasts where you said that you actually started it over.</v>

1282
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:07.343
<v Speaker 2>You started.</v>

1283
00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Let's try this again.</v>

1284
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Let's just start from scratch.</v>

1285
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1286
00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:11.301
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1287
00:40:11.301 --> 00:40:11.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

1288
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:12.573
<v Speaker 2>maybe I,</v>

1289
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it would,</v>

1290
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it would be sport into a sandwich podcasts that was.</v>

1291
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.141
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1292
00:40:17.141 --> 00:40:21.970
<v Speaker 2>so I had a podcast that went completely into the ditch for the first half hour.</v>

1293
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.241
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1294
00:40:22.241 --> 00:40:23.074
<v Speaker 2>just brutal.</v>

1295
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:24.280
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1296
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:25.480
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1297
00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.200
<v Speaker 2>there's a really,</v>

1298
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.520
<v Speaker 2>there's a good conversation for us to have here and now I know how bad this can</v>

1299
00:40:30.521 --> 00:40:30.990
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

1300
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.271
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1301
00:40:31.271 --> 00:40:33.610
<v Speaker 2>So like now I know just where the track is.</v>

1302
00:40:33.611 --> 00:40:37.390
<v Speaker 2>I have to struggle to keep the train on and so we're going to reboot.</v>

1303
00:40:37.391 --> 00:40:39.370
<v Speaker 2>We're going to start again and let's see what happens.</v>

1304
00:40:39.371 --> 00:40:39.971
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1305
00:40:39.971 --> 00:40:41.140
<v Speaker 2>the podcast was,</v>

1306
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.610
<v Speaker 2>was not perfect and I got some criticism for it,</v>

1307
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.340
<v Speaker 2>but people didn't understand that we were like,</v>

1308
00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:48.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1309
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.540
<v Speaker 2>we had uh,</v>

1310
00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:49.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1311
00:40:49.901 --> 00:40:50.350
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>

1312
00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:50.650
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

1313
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.770
<v Speaker 2>I had seen the pit of alligators and didn't want to fall in.</v>

1314
00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1315
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:57.430
<v Speaker 2>it made more sense though when you told me that because I'm like,</v>

1316
00:40:57.431 --> 00:40:57.701
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1317
00:40:57.701 --> 00:41:02.230
<v Speaker 2>it was heated before you even got to go because you had already gone through a</v>

1318
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.280
<v Speaker 2>half an hour of back and forth.</v>

1319
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:04.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1320
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:04.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1321
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1322
00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:09.070
<v Speaker 2>I think people need to understand what it's like to do one of these things too</v>

1323
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.100
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

1324
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:11.470
<v Speaker 2>you do it so often,</v>

1325
00:41:11.471 --> 00:41:13.930
<v Speaker 2>it becomes pretty and you're so good at talking.</v>

1326
00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:18.460
<v Speaker 2>You're such a good orator and you're so articulate that it comes off smooth and</v>

1327
00:41:18.461 --> 00:41:18.711
<v Speaker 2>easy.</v>

1328
00:41:18.711 --> 00:41:19.990
<v Speaker 2>You just having a conversation with someone,</v>

1329
00:41:19.991 --> 00:41:22.990
<v Speaker 2>but you're always considering the fact that people are listening to this.</v>

1330
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:24.070
<v Speaker 2>You're always saying,</v>

1331
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:24.910
<v Speaker 2>how do I,</v>

1332
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:27.940
<v Speaker 2>how do I get more out of him or her?</v>

1333
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:32.050
<v Speaker 2>How do I take this and how do I get this person to expand upon this?</v>

1334
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:33.093
<v Speaker 2>How do I,</v>

1335
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:35.330
<v Speaker 2>how do I make this something,</v>

1336
00:41:35.331 --> 00:41:36.350
<v Speaker 2>make something out of this?</v>

1337
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:40.340
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things that I felt with Jack because he was talking in this</v>

1338
00:41:40.341 --> 00:41:44.300
<v Speaker 2>way and we're really working hard on fixing all these issues and I'm like,</v>

1339
00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:45.134
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus,</v>

1340
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:50.170
<v Speaker 2>I got to change my gears here and try to figure out because it's almost like</v>

1341
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.430
<v Speaker 2>we'd have to restart again.</v>

1342
00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Every time a question would be answered,</v>

1343
00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.840
<v Speaker 2>he would stop talking and I'd go,</v>

1344
00:41:56.841 --> 00:41:57.360
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1345
00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.220
<v Speaker 2>The next day.</v>

1346
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.610
<v Speaker 2>So long.</v>

1347
00:41:58.610 --> 00:41:59.490
<v Speaker 2>You forgot what you asked.</v>

1348
00:41:59.491 --> 00:41:59.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1349
00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:02.360
<v Speaker 2>well it's almost like I have to restart the momentum of it,</v>

1350
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:03.643
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1351
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:04.431
<v Speaker 2>Well again,</v>

1352
00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:04.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1353
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:05.391
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally,</v>

1354
00:42:05.391 --> 00:42:07.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm that kind of speaker so you know,</v>

1355
00:42:07.061 --> 00:42:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1356
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:08.720
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't a problem and.</v>

1357
00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:12.020
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't know what he talked like I'd never heard him talk ever.</v>

1358
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.840
<v Speaker 2>So hearing him talk there and talking to them live,</v>

1359
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:15.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1360
00:42:15.441 --> 00:42:17.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean some people are fucking effortless.</v>

1361
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.680
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>

1362
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.510
<v Speaker 2>like Elan took awhile,</v>

1363
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.160
<v Speaker 2>like we had to start drinking now.</v>

1364
00:42:22.161 --> 00:42:22.994
<v Speaker 2>That was brutal.</v>

1365
00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.071
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

1366
00:42:25.071 --> 00:42:27.770
<v Speaker 2>you know how much I tried to micromanage that behind the scenes.</v>

1367
00:42:27.771 --> 00:42:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1368
00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:28.843
<v Speaker 2>Like I was</v>

1369
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:31.123
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure that out.</v>

1370
00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.473
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

1371
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.490
<v Speaker 2>you guys basically broke all the rules.</v>

1372
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I thought I laid down and Ilan [inaudible],</v>

1373
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Ilan tweeted y'all be on Joe's podcast Thursday night at 9:00 or whatever.</v>

1374
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:43.343
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1375
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:43.701
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1376
00:42:43.701 --> 00:42:43.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1377
00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:44.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1378
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:45.540
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want you guys to go live.</v>

1379
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I wanted,</v>

1380
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.650
<v Speaker 2>I wanted you to both have a chance to say,</v>

1381
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.191
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

1382
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:50.390
<v Speaker 2>this is smoking a blunt,</v>

1383
00:42:50.391 --> 00:42:51.560
<v Speaker 2>really the thing we want to be doing here.</v>

1384
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1385
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:53.893
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1386
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:54.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1387
00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.980
<v Speaker 2>you didn't take my advice and it was what it was when we were drunk by the time</v>

1388
00:42:57.981 --> 00:42:58.814
<v Speaker 2>that we'd came out.</v>

1389
00:42:58.820 --> 00:42:59.570
<v Speaker 2>That was what's,</v>

1390
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:03.380
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting to me is we were drinking from the beginning of the podcast.</v>

1391
00:43:03.381 --> 00:43:04.280
<v Speaker 2>We started drinking whiskey.</v>

1392
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:08.480
<v Speaker 2>We both had two or three glasses of whiskey before the weed came out.</v>

1393
00:43:08.481 --> 00:43:09.260
<v Speaker 2>Nobody cared.</v>

1394
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 2>The fact that the CEO of Tesla was drunk,</v>

1395
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.340
<v Speaker 2>like no one cared about that.</v>

1396
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:13.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1397
00:43:13.541 --> 00:43:14.301
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't drunk,</v>

1398
00:43:14.301 --> 00:43:15.400
<v Speaker 2>but he shouldn't have been driving.</v>

1399
00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:17.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that was obvious.</v>

1400
00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they saw that you were drinking.</v>

1401
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.520
<v Speaker 2>It was obvious in the beginning,</v>

1402
00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:21.680
<v Speaker 2>pouring the whiskey.</v>

1403
00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:22.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1404
00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.061
<v Speaker 2>it was on the table.</v>

1405
00:43:23.061 --> 00:43:23.721
<v Speaker 2>We had ice.</v>

1406
00:43:23.721 --> 00:43:25.040
<v Speaker 2>We're clinking glasses,</v>

1407
00:43:25.041 --> 00:43:25.700
<v Speaker 2>salute.</v>

1408
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:26.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was very obvious.</v>

1409
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:27.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1410
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:30.110
<v Speaker 2>the problem for me there with that podcast,</v>

1411
00:43:30.111 --> 00:43:34.100
<v Speaker 2>frankly it was that I feel like you both got unlucky with,</v>

1412
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.500
<v Speaker 2>which is where he was in his life at that moment because it.</v>

1413
00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:40.880
<v Speaker 2>So what that podcast showcased,</v>

1414
00:43:40.881 --> 00:43:41.900
<v Speaker 2>at least for the first,</v>

1415
00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:43.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1416
00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:48.290
<v Speaker 2>90 minutes was just how many user interface problems you could have with Elon.</v>

1417
00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:48.591
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1418
00:43:48.591 --> 00:43:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Like he just showed up as,</v>

1419
00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.530
<v Speaker 2>as kind of fairly weird,</v>

1420
00:43:51.531 --> 00:43:52.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1421
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:52.850
<v Speaker 2>He's not,</v>

1422
00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:55.040
<v Speaker 2>he's not always like that by any stretch.</v>

1423
00:43:55.041 --> 00:43:58.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean he can give a very loose interview and.</v>

1424
00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:59.840
<v Speaker 2>But you were working.</v>

1425
00:43:59.841 --> 00:44:03.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was just absolutely heroic work trying to keep that conversation</v>

1426
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.090
<v Speaker 2>happening in the beginning.</v>

1427
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:06.440
<v Speaker 2>But once we got loose,</v>

1428
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1429
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.431
<v Speaker 2>that was good.</v>

1430
00:44:07.431 --> 00:44:08.264
<v Speaker 2>But it was still,</v>

1431
00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:08.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1432
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:13.510
<v Speaker 2>he was just in a space that he was so massively stressed and so overworked and</v>

1433
00:44:15.321 --> 00:44:15.610
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

1434
00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:16.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean he had,</v>

1435
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:17.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1436
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:19.730
<v Speaker 2>fires everywhere that had to be put out.</v>

1437
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.000
<v Speaker 2>And so I just felt,</v>

1438
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1439
00:44:22.191 --> 00:44:22.941
<v Speaker 2>as a friend,</v>

1440
00:44:22.941 --> 00:44:23.511
<v Speaker 2>I just felt like,</v>

1441
00:44:23.511 --> 00:44:23.721
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1442
00:44:23.721 --> 00:44:26.190
<v Speaker 2>this is sort of the wrong time to be doing this.</v>

1443
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:28.310
<v Speaker 2>And so I just felt,</v>

1444
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:28.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1445
00:44:28.581 --> 00:44:29.540
<v Speaker 2>it just felt unlucky to me.</v>

1446
00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:30.240
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1447
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.073
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1448
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.220
<v Speaker 2>because he's,</v>

1449
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:33.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1450
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:33.961
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1451
00:44:33.961 --> 00:44:34.141
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1452
00:44:34.141 --> 00:44:34.530
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1453
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:34.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1454
00:44:34.771 --> 00:44:35.431
<v Speaker 2>I see him in,</v>

1455
00:44:35.431 --> 00:44:37.650
<v Speaker 2>in many other moments and he can be,</v>

1456
00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:40.710
<v Speaker 2>if that was out,</v>

1457
00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:42.720
<v Speaker 2>there was actually a circumstance where I was looking at the comments,</v>

1458
00:44:42.721 --> 00:44:42.961
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1459
00:44:42.961 --> 00:44:43.231
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1460
00:44:43.231 --> 00:44:43.481
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1461
00:44:43.481 --> 00:44:44.071
<v Speaker 2>and Alice saying,</v>

1462
00:44:44.071 --> 00:44:44.270
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1463
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.760
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

1464
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.990
<v Speaker 2>these are people who are basically reading him as somebody who is,</v>

1465
00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.150
<v Speaker 2>is much stranger than in fact he,</v>

1466
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.140
<v Speaker 2>he ever is.</v>

1467
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.810
<v Speaker 2>And I could see why they were doing that because he,</v>

1468
00:44:54.811 --> 00:44:55.110
<v Speaker 2>the guy,</v>

1469
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.840
<v Speaker 2>he just seemed in a very stressed space in his life.</v>

1470
00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:58.711
<v Speaker 2>What was interesting,</v>

1471
00:44:58.711 --> 00:45:02.550
<v Speaker 2>he was very different when you first got here versus when the Mike came on right</v>

1472
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.990
<v Speaker 2>when he first got here,</v>

1473
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:09.350
<v Speaker 2>he pulls out the fucking blow torch and starts shooting this flame thrower in</v>

1474
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.530
<v Speaker 2>the middle of the hallway.</v>

1475
00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:12.000
<v Speaker 2>And we're laughing and I'm like,</v>

1476
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:13.110
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be easy.</v>

1477
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:13.944
<v Speaker 2>This is great.</v>

1478
00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:17.870
<v Speaker 2>And then we sat down and then right off the bat and,</v>

1479
00:45:17.871 --> 00:45:18.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1480
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to massage it and get them,</v>

1481
00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:21.360
<v Speaker 2>get them,</v>

1482
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.193
<v Speaker 2>get them going.</v>

1483
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Although I honestly,</v>

1484
00:45:23.401 --> 00:45:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I think that is another consequence of live.</v>

1485
00:45:26.101 --> 00:45:26.261
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1486
00:45:26.261 --> 00:45:26.521
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1487
00:45:26.521 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not arguing that you shouldn't be live because it,</v>

1488
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:31.620
<v Speaker 2>it has a massive advantage for you as well,</v>

1489
00:45:31.621 --> 00:45:33.270
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>

1490
00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:35.100
<v Speaker 2>there's just a different feeling.</v>

1491
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.990
<v Speaker 2>If I knew that this was being taped and I could rethink the thing we're about to</v>

1492
00:45:39.991 --> 00:45:41.730
<v Speaker 2>say about Liam Neeson or whatever it is,</v>

1493
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:42.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1494
00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:43.050
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1495
00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:43.883
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>

1496
00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:44.763
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1497
00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:45.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1498
00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:48.960
<v Speaker 2>but will the Liam Neeson story is a perfect example there.</v>

1499
00:45:48.961 --> 00:45:49.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1500
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1501
00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:50.071
<v Speaker 2>let's go.</v>

1502
00:45:50.071 --> 00:45:52.920
<v Speaker 2>They're a perfect example of a story where,</v>

1503
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1504
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:55.110
<v Speaker 2>if you are Liam's friend,</v>

1505
00:45:55.111 --> 00:45:56.030
<v Speaker 2>you would go toe.</v>

1506
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Tell that one.</v>

1507
00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Don't tell that one he's like,</v>

1508
00:45:58.681 --> 00:45:59.520
<v Speaker 2>but I want to be honest,</v>

1509
00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:01.170
<v Speaker 2>like don't,</v>

1510
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:01.591
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1511
00:46:01.591 --> 00:46:02.730
<v Speaker 2>you could be honest with me.</v>

1512
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to judge you if you tell me that someone got raped and you went</v>

1513
00:46:06.541 --> 00:46:11.541
<v Speaker 2>out with a baseball bat for a week looking for a black man to beat up on the</v>

1514
00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:12.870
<v Speaker 2>hill to kill.</v>

1515
00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:13.441
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

1516
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:15.030
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus Christ man.</v>

1517
00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:17.700
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck was going through your head at that point in time?</v>

1518
00:46:17.701 --> 00:46:17.881
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1519
00:46:17.881 --> 00:46:18.630
<v Speaker 2>that's terrible.</v>

1520
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1521
00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:19.111
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1522
00:46:19.111 --> 00:46:20.100
<v Speaker 2>I feel awful about it,</v>

1523
00:46:20.101 --> 00:46:21.210
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that was me,</v>

1524
00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:22.950
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't happen.</v>

1525
00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:23.843
<v Speaker 2>Nothing happened.</v>

1526
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:24.940
<v Speaker 2>And now you know,</v>

1527
00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.020
<v Speaker 2>people are calling him a racist and they don't want them in movies.</v>

1528
00:46:28.021 --> 00:46:28.854
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>

1529
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1530
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1531
00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:29.730
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1532
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:31.470
<v Speaker 2>this is fascinating to me because again,</v>

1533
00:46:31.471 --> 00:46:34.680
<v Speaker 2>this is a much larger problem with massive implications.</v>

1534
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:40.130
<v Speaker 2>We need to think through the whole process of redemption for people in our</v>

1535
00:46:41.911 --> 00:46:42.480
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

1536
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:42.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1537
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.771
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1538
00:46:42.771 --> 00:46:43.150
<v Speaker 2>like we,</v>

1539
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:45.990
<v Speaker 2>we have to understand what are the,</v>

1540
00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:51.020
<v Speaker 2>what are the criteria for successful apologies and for forgiveness or like just</v>

1541
00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.130
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1542
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:55.000
<v Speaker 2>because especially,</v>

1543
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1544
00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:55.710
<v Speaker 2>we're in,</v>

1545
00:46:55.710 --> 00:47:00.710
<v Speaker 2>we're in a world where people are having their reputations destroyed in their</v>

1546
00:47:00.841 --> 00:47:01.501
<v Speaker 2>careers,</v>

1547
00:47:01.501 --> 00:47:03.290
<v Speaker 2>threatened for tweets,</v>

1548
00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:04.990
<v Speaker 2>they sent us teenagers yet.</v>

1549
00:47:04.991 --> 00:47:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1550
00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:05.380
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1551
00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.091
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1552
00:47:06.091 --> 00:47:06.790
<v Speaker 2>more this,</v>

1553
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:07.980
<v Speaker 2>this is the dorseys point.</v>

1554
00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Things are not disappearing online anymore.</v>

1555
00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.610
<v Speaker 2>In a certain point.</v>

1556
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:12.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1557
00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:17.320
<v Speaker 2>everyone is going to be a three 60 kind of panopticon view of everyone's life.</v>

1558
00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:18.271
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1559
00:47:18.271 --> 00:47:22.050
<v Speaker 2>there are people who have grown up on social media and everything is out there.</v>

1560
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.513
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1561
00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.253
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1562
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:25.651
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1563
00:47:25.651 --> 00:47:30.651
<v Speaker 2>the irony here for me is that you have progress progressives and the people on</v>

1564
00:47:31.001 --> 00:47:34.840
<v Speaker 2>the far left who received a disclosure like,</v>

1565
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:35.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1566
00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:39.310
<v Speaker 2>Liam Neeson's justice take his and they just want,</v>

1567
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:41.620
<v Speaker 2>they just want to see him burned alive,</v>

1568
00:47:41.621 --> 00:47:41.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1569
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:42.400
<v Speaker 2>A little,</v>

1570
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.620
<v Speaker 2>let's just do the wicker man on this guy because this is,</v>

1571
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:45.940
<v Speaker 2>this is so awful.</v>

1572
00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:48.520
<v Speaker 2>And yet alongside that,</v>

1573
00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:52.790
<v Speaker 2>the same people on the left are people who have as a,</v>

1574
00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.670
<v Speaker 2>as a genuine ethical norm,</v>

1575
00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.980
<v Speaker 2>the rehabilitation of murderers,</v>

1576
00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:02.340
<v Speaker 2>or you could be somebody who spent 20 years in prison for a crime you admit,</v>

1577
00:48:02.711 --> 00:48:07.240
<v Speaker 2>you committed and there's this norm around redemption.</v>

1578
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:08.590
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1579
00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:09.281
<v Speaker 2>so there's,</v>

1580
00:48:09.281 --> 00:48:09.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1581
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:10.990
<v Speaker 2>there's no way to square those two things.</v>

1582
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:13.810
<v Speaker 2>They're constantly holding news to two contradictions,</v>

1583
00:48:13.811 --> 00:48:14.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1584
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:14.261
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1585
00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:15.010
<v Speaker 2>here's another one,</v>

1586
00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:16.710
<v Speaker 2>women's rights and supportive.</v>

1587
00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.553
<v Speaker 2>The Hijab,</v>

1588
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:18.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1589
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:19.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1590
00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:20.950
<v Speaker 2>this is what's going on there.</v>

1591
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:21.873
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that?</v>

1592
00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:22.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1593
00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:24.460
<v Speaker 2>don't be Islamophobic,</v>

1594
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:26.860
<v Speaker 2>but also support women's rights and gay rights.</v>

1595
00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1596
00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:28.641
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1597
00:48:28.641 --> 00:48:30.100
<v Speaker 2>I think Eric Weinstein,</v>

1598
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.500
<v Speaker 2>our mutual friend calls these,</v>

1599
00:48:32.501 --> 00:48:32.761
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1600
00:48:32.761 --> 00:48:33.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1601
00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:36.220
<v Speaker 2>the Hilbert problems for social justice warriors.</v>

1602
00:48:36.221 --> 00:48:39.530
<v Speaker 2>And David Hilpert was a very famous mathematician who at,</v>

1603
00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:39.830
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

1604
00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:42.280
<v Speaker 2>at the turn of the 19th century,</v>

1605
00:48:42.281 --> 00:48:45.460
<v Speaker 2>posed a set of problems in mathematics that,</v>

1606
00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:45.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1607
00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.541
<v Speaker 2>we're just,</v>

1608
00:48:46.541 --> 00:48:46.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1609
00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:46.880
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1610
00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:47.710
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1611
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:51.100
<v Speaker 2>on his list of the most desirable questions that they like the hardest questions</v>

1612
00:48:51.101 --> 00:48:52.960
<v Speaker 2>and the most consequential questions to answer.</v>

1613
00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:53.860
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1614
00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:54.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1615
00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:55.420
<v Speaker 2>Eric has been a mathematician,</v>

1616
00:48:55.421 --> 00:48:57.190
<v Speaker 2>has flipped that around ironically and said these were,</v>

1617
00:48:57.191 --> 00:48:59.870
<v Speaker 2>these were the questions that social justice warriors have to answer and there</v>

1618
00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.990
<v Speaker 2>are these impossible oppositions of this sort.</v>

1619
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:03.041
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1620
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:04.330
<v Speaker 2>so the Liam Neeson thing,</v>

1621
00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:05.441
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1622
00:49:05.441 --> 00:49:05.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1623
00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.880
<v Speaker 2>forgive me if I,</v>

1624
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:09.580
<v Speaker 2>if there's some detail that has come out that I'm not aware of,</v>

1625
00:49:09.581 --> 00:49:12.550
<v Speaker 2>but my understanding of it is he,</v>

1626
00:49:12.551 --> 00:49:12.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1627
00:49:12.731 --> 00:49:17.470
<v Speaker 2>he had a friend who was raped and then he reported this state of mind,</v>

1628
00:49:17.471 --> 00:49:22.471
<v Speaker 2>this murderous state of mind he was in where he was walking around with a few.</v>

1629
00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:24.840
<v Speaker 2>He calls it a cautious.</v>

1630
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:26.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm a British word for like a,</v>

1631
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:28.390
<v Speaker 2>like a small metal club,</v>

1632
00:49:28.391 --> 00:49:29.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1633
00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:29.873
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1634
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:33.040
<v Speaker 2>it was like a black jack or another term for it,</v>

1635
00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:33.700
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1636
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:38.700
<v Speaker 2>And I'm looking for a black guy to kill your life,</v>

1637
00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.610
<v Speaker 2>doesn't hoping someone's going to come out of the woodwork and threatened him so</v>

1638
00:49:42.611 --> 00:49:47.611
<v Speaker 2>that he could kill this guy in this act of instrumental violence because his</v>

1639
00:49:47.681 --> 00:49:49.150
<v Speaker 2>friend had been raped by a black guy.</v>

1640
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:49.351
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1641
00:49:49.351 --> 00:49:50.830
<v Speaker 2>So it's like any black I will do now,</v>

1642
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:55.950
<v Speaker 2>that's likely the extra horrific wrinkle to the story right now.</v>

1643
00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:02.310
<v Speaker 2>And he's confessing this as a kind of a symptom of transient mental illness,</v>

1644
00:50:02.741 --> 00:50:03.850
<v Speaker 2>at least as far as I know.</v>

1645
00:50:03.851 --> 00:50:04.151
<v Speaker 2>It's like a.</v>

1646
00:50:04.151 --> 00:50:07.090
<v Speaker 2>he's horrified by the fact that he was in the state of mind.</v>

1647
00:50:07.091 --> 00:50:07.241
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1648
00:50:07.241 --> 00:50:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine like Aida,</v>

1649
00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Liam Neeson it actor.</v>

1650
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:12.400
<v Speaker 2>I have everything to lose.</v>

1651
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:16.000
<v Speaker 2>And although I don't remember at what point in his life he said this happened.</v>

1652
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine that?</v>

1653
00:50:18.371 --> 00:50:19.660
<v Speaker 2>I was in the state of mind.</v>

1654
00:50:19.661 --> 00:50:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1655
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.430
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

1656
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:22.541
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>

1657
00:50:22.541 --> 00:50:24.550
<v Speaker 2>at an all too honest disclosure,</v>

1658
00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 2>but it is damn interesting.</v>

1659
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:28.850
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1660
00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:33.170
<v Speaker 2>And it is the kind of thing that we should be able to talk about.</v>

1661
00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1662
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:38.650
<v Speaker 2>And it's not an the fact that this is becoming synonymous with racism seems just</v>

1663
00:50:39.381 --> 00:50:42.290
<v Speaker 2>wrong given given how he's two he described,</v>

1664
00:50:42.291 --> 00:50:43.190
<v Speaker 2>or at least how I've,</v>

1665
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I've heard this because he's saying,</v>

1666
00:50:45.051 --> 00:50:45.351
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1667
00:50:45.351 --> 00:50:50.180
<v Speaker 2>if this had been an Armenian guy or an Italian or a Japanese guy,</v>

1668
00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:51.590
<v Speaker 2>I'd be looking for one of them,</v>

1669
00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:51.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1670
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:52.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1671
00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:52.260
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1672
00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:52.640
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1673
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.690
<v Speaker 2>what this was,</v>

1674
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:58.970
<v Speaker 2>at least on his telling is the virus of instrumental violence.</v>

1675
00:50:58.971 --> 00:50:59.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1676
00:50:59.121 --> 00:50:59.660
<v Speaker 2>the Va,</v>

1677
00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.850
<v Speaker 2>the virus of like,</v>

1678
00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:06.160
<v Speaker 2>this is how every blood feud ever in human history gets started.</v>

1679
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

1680
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:09.830
<v Speaker 2>like someone from your tribe killed my brother.</v>

1681
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:13.730
<v Speaker 2>And now what I want to do is kill anyone from your tribe,</v>

1682
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:13.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1683
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter who you are.</v>

1684
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.920
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1685
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.000
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1686
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:17.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1687
00:51:17.931 --> 00:51:20.750
<v Speaker 2>clearly as toxic as it gets,</v>

1688
00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:21.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1689
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:22.003
<v Speaker 2>ethically.</v>

1690
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:24.260
<v Speaker 2>But that's not racism,</v>

1691
00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:24.681
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1692
00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:25.514
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>

1693
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.800
<v Speaker 2>that is that we have a word for it.</v>

1694
00:51:27.801 --> 00:51:29.420
<v Speaker 2>It's an instrumental violence.</v>

1695
00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1696
00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:31.280
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1697
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:31.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1698
00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:31.821
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1699
00:51:31.821 --> 00:51:34.190
<v Speaker 2>obviously he's getting totally pilloried over this,</v>

1700
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:35.840
<v Speaker 2>but we need,</v>

1701
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:42.430
<v Speaker 2>we just need to figure out how to talk about how people can redeem themselves</v>

1702
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.030
<v Speaker 2>once something this unsavory is,</v>

1703
00:51:46.031 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 2>is revealed about their past.</v>

1704
00:51:48.081 --> 00:51:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Whether they reveal it or whether it's just,</v>

1705
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:50.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1706
00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:50.990
<v Speaker 2>found out about them.</v>

1707
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:51.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1708
00:51:51.981 --> 00:51:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1709
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:52.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1710
00:51:52.731 --> 00:51:53.840
<v Speaker 2>it is racism though,</v>

1711
00:51:53.841 --> 00:51:54.111
<v Speaker 2>Ryan,</v>

1712
00:51:54.111 --> 00:51:56.660
<v Speaker 2>because he's specifically looking for a black guy.</v>

1713
00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:57.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1714
00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.900
<v Speaker 2>I understand that it's a part of the other tribe.</v>

1715
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:00.081
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1716
00:52:00.081 --> 00:52:02.330
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't suggest that he has,</v>

1717
00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:05.570
<v Speaker 2>that he dispose that he feels one way or another about black people.</v>

1718
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:05.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1719
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:06.980
<v Speaker 2>like if you told me,</v>

1720
00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:08.283
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1721
00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.473
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1722
00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:11.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1723
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:11.160
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1724
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:11.660
<v Speaker 2>he could,</v>

1725
00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:13.250
<v Speaker 2>he could have said again,</v>

1726
00:52:13.251 --> 00:52:15.450
<v Speaker 2>it could have been a,</v>

1727
00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:16.393
<v Speaker 2>an Irish guy,</v>

1728
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.701
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1729
00:52:16.701 --> 00:52:17.534
<v Speaker 2>Or it could have been mental.</v>

1730
00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:18.351
<v Speaker 2>I guess he's Irish.</v>

1731
00:52:18.351 --> 00:52:18.441
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1732
00:52:18.441 --> 00:52:19.370
<v Speaker 2>he's a Scottish or Irish.</v>

1733
00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1734
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:21.590
<v Speaker 2>it could have been an English guy.</v>

1735
00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:21.801
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1736
00:52:21.801 --> 00:52:23.330
<v Speaker 2>It could've been like any type.</v>

1737
00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:23.721
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1738
00:52:23.721 --> 00:52:28.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like the salience of the tribe is what he was reacting to,</v>

1739
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:29.390
<v Speaker 2>at least in his description.</v>

1740
00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why you wouldn't take him at his word given that he didn't have to</v>

1741
00:52:33.741 --> 00:52:35.270
<v Speaker 2>say any of this in the first place.</v>

1742
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.421
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1743
00:52:35.421 --> 00:52:35.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1744
00:52:35.571 --> 00:52:35.691
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1745
00:52:35.691 --> 00:52:39.470
<v Speaker 2>this is an amazingly honest and unnecessary disclosure,</v>

1746
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:40.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1747
00:52:40.971 --> 00:52:41.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1748
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:44.000
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think people would think of it as racism if he,</v>

1749
00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.940
<v Speaker 2>if the story simply was a,</v>

1750
00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:52.130
<v Speaker 2>she got raped by a cop and I was just hoping to go kill a cop.</v>

1751
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1752
00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.050
<v Speaker 2>The same story.</v>

1753
00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:54.943
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1754
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:55.843
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1755
00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:56.541
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1756
00:52:56.541 --> 00:52:57.374
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1757
00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.273
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1758
00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:03.280
<v Speaker 2>but we're so trigger happy in our outrage with respect to anything.</v>

1759
00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:05.120
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that is?</v>

1760
00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:05.471
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

1761
00:53:05.471 --> 00:53:06.291
<v Speaker 2>what is going on?</v>

1762
00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Because outrage seems to be more in season than it's ever been in my lifetime.</v>

1763
00:53:10.311 --> 00:53:10.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1764
00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:15.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever remember outrage being so just such a.</v>

1765
00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:16.970
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1766
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:17.803
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1767
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.010
<v Speaker 2>it's recreational.</v>

1768
00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:19.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1769
00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:20.090
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

1770
00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:20.800
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1771
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:21.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's back to Jack.</v>

1772
00:53:21.801 --> 00:53:22.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a lot.</v>

1773
00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.950
<v Speaker 2>It has a lot to do with social media and twitter in.</v>

1774
00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1775
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:26.833
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have.</v>

1776
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:28.021
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>

1777
00:53:28.021 --> 00:53:33.021
<v Speaker 2>I missed the whole Covington highschool Catholic fiasco not onto basically was</v>

1778
00:53:33.901 --> 00:53:34.590
<v Speaker 2>ignoring twitter.</v>

1779
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:35.241
<v Speaker 2>I saw it,</v>

1780
00:53:35.241 --> 00:53:36.630
<v Speaker 2>saw it out of the corner of my eye,</v>

1781
00:53:36.631 --> 00:53:37.160
<v Speaker 2>like men,</v>

1782
00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:37.741
<v Speaker 2>this is interesting,</v>

1783
00:53:37.741 --> 00:53:38.490
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1784
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:39.151
<v Speaker 2>this is blowing up,</v>

1785
00:53:39.151 --> 00:53:40.230
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1786
00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:42.770
<v Speaker 2>I was so off twitter that I had,</v>

1787
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.570
<v Speaker 2>there was no temptation for a hot take from me.</v>

1788
00:53:45.571 --> 00:53:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1789
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.700
<v Speaker 2>And I saw these people just torching their reputations by taking these,</v>

1790
00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:54.810
<v Speaker 2>like Kathy Griffin basically calling for the docs and have these kids,</v>

1791
00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:55.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1792
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:57.860
<v Speaker 2>given all that she has suffered from,</v>

1793
00:53:57.930 --> 00:54:01.620
<v Speaker 2>from mob behavior online and she's whipping up her own mob.</v>

1794
00:54:01.621 --> 00:54:02.454
<v Speaker 2>It was just nuts,</v>

1795
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:03.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's normal.</v>

1796
00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:04.650
<v Speaker 2>That's what people do.</v>

1797
00:54:04.651 --> 00:54:06.930
<v Speaker 2>It's what the platform is calling out of people,</v>

1798
00:54:06.931 --> 00:54:11.370
<v Speaker 2>but it's also when people have been shamed and they've done something awful.</v>

1799
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:13.770
<v Speaker 2>Then they reinforce their base like that.</v>

1800
00:54:13.771 --> 00:54:18.771
<v Speaker 2>Now she's like his so heavily hard left because the right wing ran after her.</v>

1801
00:54:18.991 --> 00:54:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Like anyone on the right that does anything.</v>

1802
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.900
<v Speaker 2>She's calling for her side to go after this person.</v>

1803
00:54:24.901 --> 00:54:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Like reinforcing that she's a part of that tribe,</v>

1804
00:54:27.811 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 2>that she's a part of that left wing tribe.</v>

1805
00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1806
00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:30.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1807
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Well it's.</v>

1808
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.610
<v Speaker 2>So obviously everyone has a lot to lose doing this,</v>

1809
00:54:35.611 --> 00:54:40.380
<v Speaker 2>especially in a case where all the facts aren't in and if you just waited a beat</v>

1810
00:54:40.381 --> 00:54:42.030
<v Speaker 2>and even the New York Times got this wrong,</v>

1811
00:54:42.031 --> 00:54:45.090
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times writes an article about the kids in the Maga hat that they</v>

1812
00:54:45.091 --> 00:54:46.200
<v Speaker 2>have to resend.</v>

1813
00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:48.780
<v Speaker 2>And the.</v>

1814
00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:53.400
<v Speaker 2>So then as the dust is settling and I see these people,</v>

1815
00:54:53.401 --> 00:54:54.630
<v Speaker 2>some people are doubling down,</v>

1816
00:54:54.631 --> 00:54:57.120
<v Speaker 2>some people are issuing public apologies.</v>

1817
00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:02.750
<v Speaker 2>I see somebody who's actually kind of branded herself as one of my enemies for</v>

1818
00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:04.860
<v Speaker 2>some reason I can't fathom.</v>

1819
00:55:04.861 --> 00:55:06.750
<v Speaker 2>But this journalist Kara Swisher,</v>

1820
00:55:07.310 --> 00:55:07.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1821
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.341
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1822
00:55:08.341 --> 00:55:08.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1823
00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:08.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1824
00:55:08.791 --> 00:55:09.030
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

1825
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:13.080
<v Speaker 2>she works for a recode and vox now,</v>

1826
00:55:13.081 --> 00:55:15.070
<v Speaker 2>but she's got a big podcast and she's a,</v>

1827
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.380
<v Speaker 2>she actually writes for the New York Times.</v>

1828
00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Now she's got an opinion piece,</v>

1829
00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:19.500
<v Speaker 2>a regular column for the New York Times.</v>

1830
00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:21.330
<v Speaker 2>She's a tech journalist.</v>

1831
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:26.310
<v Speaker 2>And I happened to know she doesn't like me because she's tweeted against,</v>

1832
00:55:26.311 --> 00:55:26.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1833
00:55:26.461 --> 00:55:30.510
<v Speaker 2>she's said some disparaging things about me on twitter and we had an offline</v>

1834
00:55:30.511 --> 00:55:31.380
<v Speaker 2>conversation about it.</v>

1835
00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:32.250
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1836
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:33.390
<v Speaker 2>but I saw her,</v>

1837
00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:38.040
<v Speaker 2>she said one of the most vituperative and fairly crazy things in response to the</v>

1838
00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:41.580
<v Speaker 2>kids initially and then once more information came out,</v>

1839
00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:44.160
<v Speaker 2>she walked it back and she basically apologized,</v>

1840
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:44.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1841
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.473
<v Speaker 2>good for her twitter.</v>

1842
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:46.240
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1843
00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:46.741
<v Speaker 2>so I said,</v>

1844
00:55:46.741 --> 00:55:47.650
<v Speaker 2>good for you Cara.</v>

1845
00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:48.840
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to,</v>

1846
00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:53.400
<v Speaker 2>to support this norm of acknowledging that you got something wrong.</v>

1847
00:55:53.401 --> 00:55:58.200
<v Speaker 2>And I wanted to do it even I wanted to actually do it for someone who I know</v>

1848
00:55:58.201 --> 00:55:59.040
<v Speaker 2>really doesn't like me.</v>

1849
00:55:59.041 --> 00:55:59.251
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1850
00:55:59.251 --> 00:55:59.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1851
00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:01.120
<v Speaker 2>that was an added bonus for me because that's,</v>

1852
00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:01.390
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

1853
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:04.020
<v Speaker 2>that's another norm that I think we should support.</v>

1854
00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:04.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1855
00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:05.550
<v Speaker 2>like we should,</v>

1856
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:08.430
<v Speaker 2>we should play fair even with our enemies.</v>

1857
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:09.960
<v Speaker 2>And I mean honestly,</v>

1858
00:56:09.961 --> 00:56:10.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1859
00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:10.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1860
00:56:10.441 --> 00:56:13.410
<v Speaker 2>I try to play fair even with people who never play fair with me.</v>

1861
00:56:13.411 --> 00:56:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Even someone like Glenn Greenwald or raise ocelot,</v>

1862
00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:19.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean people who have just lied about me endlessly.</v>

1863
00:56:19.621 --> 00:56:21.330
<v Speaker 2>If I get something wrong about them,</v>

1864
00:56:21.331 --> 00:56:22.770
<v Speaker 2>I publicly apologized for it.</v>

1865
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1866
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:29.250
<v Speaker 2>so I did this and this was at the absolute 11th hour with respect to this,</v>

1867
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:30.401
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1868
00:56:30.401 --> 00:56:30.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1869
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:31.543
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1870
00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:36.860
<v Speaker 2>scandal online and when I saw the kind of pain I was getting just for,</v>

1871
00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1872
00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:42.490
<v Speaker 2>supporting Kara in her walk back of this thing we had at a moment when it was</v>

1873
00:56:42.491 --> 00:56:44.170
<v Speaker 2>obvious she should have walked this back.</v>

1874
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:45.430
<v Speaker 2>I got people saying,</v>

1875
00:56:45.431 --> 00:56:45.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1876
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:47.410
<v Speaker 2>unsubscribing from your podcast,</v>

1877
00:56:47.411 --> 00:56:47.771
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

1878
00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:47.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1879
00:56:47.981 --> 00:56:49.570
<v Speaker 2>now I know you're a fucking racist,</v>

1880
00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:50.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1881
00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:50.511
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>

1882
00:56:50.511 --> 00:56:52.990
<v Speaker 2>I just sure pain and I just thought,</v>

1883
00:56:52.991 --> 00:56:53.531
<v Speaker 2>wow man,</v>

1884
00:56:53.531 --> 00:56:53.801
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1885
00:56:53.801 --> 00:56:54.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1886
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:57.750
<v Speaker 2>it's like you just touched this thing at the very end and you're,</v>

1887
00:56:57.751 --> 00:56:58.040
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1888
00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:58.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1889
00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.760
<v Speaker 2>it's the slime gets on you.</v>

1890
00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:01.973
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1891
00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:02.681
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1892
00:57:02.681 --> 00:57:03.514
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

1893
00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:04.570
<v Speaker 2>it's the medium.</v>

1894
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:09.250
<v Speaker 2>We have no opportunity to do this before it is the medium and it's also people</v>

1895
00:57:09.251 --> 00:57:12.070
<v Speaker 2>that don't feel like their opinions are being heard.</v>

1896
00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Like they want their opinion to be heard.</v>

1897
00:57:14.081 --> 00:57:15.160
<v Speaker 2>They want it to be heard right now.</v>

1898
00:57:15.161 --> 00:57:17.290
<v Speaker 2>And it might not be a very well thought out opinion,</v>

1899
00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:20.050
<v Speaker 2>but they know that they have the ability to blare it out.</v>

1900
00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:21.053
<v Speaker 2>And so they</v>

1901
00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.040
<v Speaker 2>just send it out and that,</v>

1902
00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:24.430
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1903
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:25.960
<v Speaker 2>the ability to do that,</v>

1904
00:57:25.961 --> 00:57:29.440
<v Speaker 2>it's just intoxicating for folks and they'll reach you.</v>

1905
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:30.820
<v Speaker 2>You talk about this with Jack.</v>

1906
00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:32.283
<v Speaker 2>There is a.</v>

1907
00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:36.250
<v Speaker 2>What makes twitter especially good for this is that everything has the same</v>

1908
00:57:36.251 --> 00:57:36.940
<v Speaker 2>stature,</v>

1909
00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:40.180
<v Speaker 2>like your tweets no bigger than the other tweet that just called you an asshole.</v>

1910
00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.740
<v Speaker 2>That's my Kurt Metzger.</v>

1911
00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Take on it because Kurt Metzger was a hilarious standup comedian.</v>

1912
00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:45.401
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1913
00:57:45.401 --> 00:57:45.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1914
00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.740
<v Speaker 2>he'll write a facebook blog only.</v>

1915
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:49.030
<v Speaker 2>He only writes on facebook.</v>

1916
00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:49.390
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1917
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:51.100
<v Speaker 2>I like how it's set up.</v>

1918
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:51.810
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1919
00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:52.070
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1920
00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:52.903
<v Speaker 2>there's a big.</v>

1921
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:57.250
<v Speaker 2>It differentiates between me and these fucking idiots who are commenting under</v>

1922
00:57:57.251 --> 00:57:58.510
<v Speaker 2>there have.</v>

1923
00:57:58.540 --> 00:57:59.321
<v Speaker 2>Although ironically,</v>

1924
00:57:59.321 --> 00:58:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I hate facebook.</v>

1925
00:58:00.191 --> 00:58:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I can't even,</v>

1926
00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:03.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean just the graphic design on facebook,</v>

1927
00:58:03.371 --> 00:58:06.040
<v Speaker 2>I find so offensive that I can't even look at facebook.</v>

1928
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:08.350
<v Speaker 2>So I use it as a publishing channel.</v>

1929
00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:08.790
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

1930
00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:09.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1931
00:58:09.011 --> 00:58:12.190
<v Speaker 2>I keep threatening in my own mind to just delete the account because I just</v>

1932
00:58:12.191 --> 00:58:13.020
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

1933
00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:16.590
<v Speaker 2>I've only read the comments three times maybe ever read them.</v>

1934
00:58:16.591 --> 00:58:17.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like choose Christ.</v>

1935
00:58:17.771 --> 00:58:18.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like youtube,</v>

1936
00:58:18.611 --> 00:58:19.570
<v Speaker 2>but alive.</v>

1937
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.130
<v Speaker 2>I know it's like youtube,</v>

1938
00:58:21.131 --> 00:58:22.810
<v Speaker 2>but with people with their real names,</v>

1939
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:25.590
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1940
00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:25.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1941
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:28.550
<v Speaker 2>this is a new world that we're living in man,</v>

1942
00:58:28.551 --> 00:58:31.510
<v Speaker 2>and everybody's trying to navigate this thing and figure it out as it goes</v>

1943
00:58:31.511 --> 00:58:31.961
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>

1944
00:58:31.961 --> 00:58:33.670
<v Speaker 2>And not everybody's doing it well.</v>

1945
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.900
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1946
00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:38.080
<v Speaker 2>I think this world is going to get more and more intrusive.</v>

1947
00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:39.490
<v Speaker 2>I think this is just the beginning.</v>

1948
00:58:39.491 --> 00:58:41.230
<v Speaker 2>I think we didn't see twitter coming,</v>

1949
00:58:41.231 --> 00:58:42.370
<v Speaker 2>whatever comes after twitter.</v>

1950
00:58:42.371 --> 00:58:43.300
<v Speaker 2>And this is one of the things that I,</v>

1951
00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:48.370
<v Speaker 2>before the podcast I wanted to really talk to jack about to get his take on what</v>

1952
00:58:48.371 --> 00:58:51.370
<v Speaker 2>he thinks is next down the line because there's going to be something that's</v>

1953
00:58:51.371 --> 00:58:52.180
<v Speaker 2>more invasive.</v>

1954
00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:53.710
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be something that is more,</v>

1955
00:58:53.711 --> 00:58:54.520
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a,</v>

1956
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.430
<v Speaker 2>I think probably something in the line of augmented reality.</v>

1957
00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:02.880
<v Speaker 2>There were probably a decade away from something that makes this look like books</v>

1958
00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:04.031
<v Speaker 2>look like,</v>

1959
00:59:04.031 --> 00:59:04.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1960
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:07.090
<v Speaker 2>a fucking corkboard at a bookstore.</v>

1961
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Although strangely we're live.</v>

1962
00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:11.830
<v Speaker 2>We're living through the golden age of audio here.</v>

1963
00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:15.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like we went full into video and we're poised to go like,</v>

1964
00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:16.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1965
00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:18.460
<v Speaker 2>three d and Vr.</v>

1966
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:21.410
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden audio is king.</v>

1967
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.591
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1968
00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:22.970
<v Speaker 2>how about phone calls and texts?</v>

1969
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember I called you out of the blue ones and it was like,</v>

1970
00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:28.130
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck what you</v>

1971
00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:30.830
<v Speaker 2>walk into a supermarket.</v>

1972
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Somebody said on twitter once.</v>

1973
00:59:33.321 --> 00:59:34.041
<v Speaker 2>It was hilarious.</v>

1974
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:37.900
<v Speaker 2>That facetiming face timing me out of nowhere.</v>

1975
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:42.910
<v Speaker 2>It just like knocking on my door without calling me straight up.</v>

1976
00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.460
<v Speaker 2>She was angry that somebody face timed her.</v>

1977
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:47.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1978
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:50.510
<v Speaker 2>it always feels like an old school move to my book.</v>

1979
00:59:50.511 --> 00:59:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Agent calls me out of the blue and it's just seems so old.</v>

1980
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:55.910
<v Speaker 2>It is just like a knock on the door.</v>

1981
00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:59.270
<v Speaker 2>My friend Joey Diaz only calls only for years.</v>

1982
00:59:59.271 --> 01:00:01.130
<v Speaker 2>He would scream at you if you text.</v>

1983
01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:04.250
<v Speaker 2>And then recently within the last two or three years you started texting</v>

1984
01:00:04.251 --> 01:00:05.084
<v Speaker 2>occasionally.</v>

1985
01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:06.350
<v Speaker 2>But he only calls.</v>

1986
01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Well I gotta I gotTa tell you I haven't released this meditation APP has given</v>

1987
01:00:11.151 --> 01:00:14.870
<v Speaker 2>me a kind of a sanity check on everything else I'm doing.</v>

1988
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:18.470
<v Speaker 2>Which is very interesting because in releasing the APP,</v>

1989
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:19.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1990
01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:22.970
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's firewalled from all the other controversial stuff I'm doing.</v>

1991
01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:23.211
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1992
01:00:23.211 --> 01:00:24.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in the APP,</v>

1993
01:00:24.471 --> 01:00:26.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm not whinging about trump or you know,</v>

1994
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:31.750
<v Speaker 2>talking about any of the stuff I talk about on my podcast is just me trying to</v>

1995
01:00:31.851 --> 01:00:36.710
<v Speaker 2>teach meditation as a largely as an antidote to all of this stuff we're talking</v>

1996
01:00:36.711 --> 01:00:36.921
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1997
01:00:36.921 --> 01:00:38.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like we've got,</v>

1998
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:42.200
<v Speaker 2>this is Tristan Harris says we've got the slot machine in our pocket that is</v>

1999
01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:47.260
<v Speaker 2>continually gaming our attention all day long and in my view a meditation app is</v>

2000
01:00:48.741 --> 01:00:53.000
<v Speaker 2>like the one thing you can have on your smartphone that completely subverts the</v>

2001
01:00:53.001 --> 01:00:58.001
<v Speaker 2>technology and you can get you to actually live a more examined life using the</v>

2002
01:00:58.641 --> 01:00:59.474
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

2003
01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:05.140
<v Speaker 2>But what's been amazing for me personally is that I put it out and it is the</v>

2004
01:01:05.811 --> 01:01:10.811
<v Speaker 2>only thing that I have put out maybe ever right where it has been received</v>

2005
01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.270
<v Speaker 2>exactly as I've intended.</v>

2006
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:14.661
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2007
01:01:14.661 --> 01:01:15.890
<v Speaker 2>There's no controversy.</v>

2008
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:16.530
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

2009
01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:18.260
<v Speaker 2>like the people who are finding it useful,</v>

2010
01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.210
<v Speaker 2>love it and they say thank you,</v>

2011
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:21.141
<v Speaker 2>and it's like they're,</v>

2012
01:01:21.141 --> 01:01:21.361
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2013
01:01:21.361 --> 01:01:25.370
<v Speaker 2>they're getting exactly what I thought I was putting into it and it's like,</v>

2014
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:26.840
<v Speaker 2>it made me think,</v>

2015
01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.370
<v Speaker 2>what the hell am I doing over here with all of this toxic stuff that has been</v>

2016
01:01:31.371 --> 01:01:31.940
<v Speaker 2>endlessly,</v>

2017
01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:36.320
<v Speaker 2>endlessly maliciously spawn against me and misunderstood and you know,</v>

2018
01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:36.660
<v Speaker 2>was just,</v>

2019
01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:36.930
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2020
01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:37.763
<v Speaker 2>I have to,</v>

2021
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:41.360
<v Speaker 2>I have to do both because there's a lot of important things to talk about that</v>

2022
01:01:41.361 --> 01:01:42.870
<v Speaker 2>are going to be endlessly spawn and,</v>

2023
01:01:42.871 --> 01:01:43.440
<v Speaker 2>and malicious.</v>

2024
01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Slandered,</v>

2025
01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:44.361
<v Speaker 2>misunderstood.</v>

2026
01:01:44.361 --> 01:01:45.800
<v Speaker 2>But it is,</v>

2027
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:48.470
<v Speaker 2>it's been so refreshing to have one thing.</v>

2028
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean you must get this with,</v>

2029
01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:50.450
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2030
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:50.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2031
01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.660
<v Speaker 2>you're doing your standup or,</v>

2032
01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.660
<v Speaker 2>or maybe I don't have a thing.</v>

2033
01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:55.430
<v Speaker 2>I get shit for everything.</v>

2034
01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:55.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2035
01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.750
<v Speaker 2>But well maybe.</v>

2036
01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Maybe UFC commentary.</v>

2037
01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.650
<v Speaker 2>They come after me for everything.</v>

2038
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Well he is just,</v>

2039
01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:07.280
<v Speaker 2>it has been psychologically it's been a revelation to have one thing that I can</v>

2040
01:02:07.281 --> 01:02:09.560
<v Speaker 2>put out that is just,</v>

2041
01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:12.650
<v Speaker 2>it's just received appreciated.</v>

2042
01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:15.230
<v Speaker 2>And they got what I intended and it's just,</v>

2043
01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:15.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2044
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:16.170
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

2045
01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:17.060
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

2046
01:02:17.061 --> 01:02:17.481
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>

2047
01:02:17.481 --> 01:02:18.260
<v Speaker 2>that's possible.</v>

2048
01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:19.620
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea I had.</v>

2049
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>If I ever knew I had forgotten that that w that was possible.</v>

2050
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2051
01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>meditation now it kind of makes sense because the people who are going to flock</v>

2052
01:02:27.331 --> 01:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>to that are looking to meditate.</v>

2053
01:02:28.621 --> 01:02:29.670
<v Speaker 1>They're looking to improve their mind.</v>

2054
01:02:29.671 --> 01:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>They're not looking to spew hatred on facebook.</v>

2055
01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:32.913
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2056
01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.540
<v Speaker 1>I thought that after the podcast with Jack,</v>

2057
01:02:36.541 --> 01:02:36.841
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2058
01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

2059
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I should just stick to podcast with comics because podcast with comics,</v>

2060
01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>even if you put your foot in your mouth,</v>

2061
01:02:42.481 --> 01:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows you're just trying to be funny.</v>

2062
01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2063
01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>You know if you do a podcast and and the thing about the podcast with Jack,</v>

2064
01:02:47.881 --> 01:02:48.301
<v Speaker 1>it's not even,</v>

2065
01:02:48.301 --> 01:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>like I said anything bad,</v>

2066
01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>it's what I didn't say that that was upsetting to so many people,</v>

2067
01:02:53.461 --> 01:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>but that's such a loaded thing and because of that podcast,</v>

2068
01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:00.330
<v Speaker 1>now there's negative to it that blow back.</v>

2069
01:03:00.331 --> 01:03:03.060
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of toxic anger and all that,</v>

2070
01:03:03.061 --> 01:03:05.760
<v Speaker 1>but the positive is what I like.</v>

2071
01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:11.090
<v Speaker 1>The positive that came out of it is me forced to reexamine how I do podcast,</v>

2072
01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:15.330
<v Speaker 1>reexamined the significance of each individual guests and especially someone</v>

2073
01:03:15.331 --> 01:03:17.450
<v Speaker 1>that comes with as much baggage know,</v>

2074
01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.290
<v Speaker 1>without lack of a better term,</v>

2075
01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:22.500
<v Speaker 1>a as Jack that you're,</v>

2076
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:23.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2077
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:26.880
<v Speaker 1>you gotta think that there's people listening and there's some questions that</v>

2078
01:03:26.881 --> 01:03:28.500
<v Speaker 1>you really have to work at.</v>

2079
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.341
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

2080
01:03:29.341 --> 01:03:30.810
<v Speaker 1>you have to push through and even if he's,</v>

2081
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:32.670
<v Speaker 1>he's dancing and peer wedding,</v>

2082
01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I should've went back to,</v>

2083
01:03:33.991 --> 01:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2084
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:36.480
<v Speaker 1>why is Kathy Griffin on your platform?</v>

2085
01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Like if doxing is bad,</v>

2086
01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:38.251
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>

2087
01:03:38.251 --> 01:03:38.990
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to docs,</v>

2088
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:40.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't want threats of violence.</v>

2089
01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:41.220
<v Speaker 1>When someone says,</v>

2090
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I want names,</v>

2091
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:43.471
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2092
01:03:43.471 --> 01:03:44.790
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do with these fucking names?</v>

2093
01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:45.930
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do with them?</v>

2094
01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:48.900
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do with a 16 year old kid and his names and then when you see</v>

2095
01:03:48.901 --> 01:03:49.770
<v Speaker 1>the actual,</v>

2096
01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:54.000
<v Speaker 1>the actual video of what actually happened and there's so many people that are</v>

2097
01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:57.810
<v Speaker 1>still not walking it back still no doubling down.</v>

2098
01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people doubled down.</v>

2099
01:03:58.930 --> 01:03:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Fuck him.</v>

2100
01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:01.590
<v Speaker 1>And here's another little piece of insight.</v>

2101
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:05.940
<v Speaker 1>My friend Matt lived in DC and those hats,</v>

2102
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>those magazines,</v>

2103
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:08.130
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking everywhere.</v>

2104
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.260
<v Speaker 1>There's these little where these kids were that area.</v>

2105
01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.690
<v Speaker 1>There's these carts that sell these hats,</v>

2106
01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:15.180
<v Speaker 1>so these kids bought those hats that day.</v>

2107
01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:17.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they're these mag a kids.</v>

2108
01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:19.580
<v Speaker 1>They'd probably just be an assholes right there,</v>

2109
01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:21.750
<v Speaker 1>unsupervised teenage boys.</v>

2110
01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Their frontal lobe is not fully formed and they're all together feeding off each</v>

2111
01:04:25.951 --> 01:04:27.060
<v Speaker 1>other like a pack of Gremlins.</v>

2112
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I was a teenage boy.</v>

2113
01:04:28.861 --> 01:04:29.850
<v Speaker 1>You were a teenage boy.</v>

2114
01:04:29.851 --> 01:04:31.790
<v Speaker 1>You know how fucking stupid used to be.</v>

2115
01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2116
01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.050
<v Speaker 1>I was probably way more stupid than you,</v>

2117
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:35.550
<v Speaker 1>but I was a mess.</v>

2118
01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:40.560
<v Speaker 1>I had my moments now it'd be just you get 100 teenage boys together in a crowd,</v>

2119
01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:42.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2120
01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:46.920
<v Speaker 1>on a school trip and you get some native elder drumming in one of the in some</v>

2121
01:04:46.921 --> 01:04:47.754
<v Speaker 1>guys face.</v>

2122
01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:50.370
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing what didn't happen.</v>

2123
01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2124
01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.640
<v Speaker 1>No violence,</v>

2125
01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:53.181
<v Speaker 1>no violence,</v>

2126
01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:53.900
<v Speaker 1>and no.</v>

2127
01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:54.631
<v Speaker 1>The way he handled it.</v>

2128
01:04:54.631 --> 01:04:54.751
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2129
01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:55.584
<v Speaker 1>you did a smile.</v>

2130
01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.840
<v Speaker 1>So listen,</v>

2131
01:04:57.841 --> 01:05:02.841
<v Speaker 1>I'm as biased as anyone against a Catholic school kid wearing a Maga hat given.</v>

2132
01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Given my backstory is like,</v>

2133
01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:06.181
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2134
01:05:06.181 --> 01:05:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally poised.</v>

2135
01:05:07.351 --> 01:05:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I think this guy's an asshole and this likely always to be an asshole.</v>

2136
01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:15.390
<v Speaker 1>But what people read into an uncomfortable smile,</v>

2137
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.811
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2138
01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:15.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2139
01:05:15.961 --> 01:05:16.530
<v Speaker 1>just like the,</v>

2140
01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2141
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>the shots</v>

2142
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.620
<v Speaker 2>of his face with the tweets that said,</v>

2143
01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:21.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2144
01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:23.230
<v Speaker 2>this is what white privilege looks like.</v>

2145
01:05:23.231 --> 01:05:23.540
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

2146
01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:23.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2147
01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:24.121
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2148
01:05:24.121 --> 01:05:24.681
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>

2149
01:05:24.681 --> 01:05:26.140
<v Speaker 2>everything that's wrong in our society.</v>

2150
01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.273
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2151
01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:29.230
<v Speaker 2>we have to slow down.</v>

2152
01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.100
<v Speaker 2>How about raise road?</v>

2153
01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:31.500
<v Speaker 2>If you ever seen a more entrepreneur,</v>

2154
01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.353
<v Speaker 2>punchable face,</v>

2155
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.251
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

2156
01:05:33.251 --> 01:05:37.310
<v Speaker 2>You want to punch him because he's smiling with his me started on,</v>

2157
01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:37.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2158
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:42.630
<v Speaker 2>calls for violence from the left are so fucking disturbing to me because my</v>

2159
01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:44.260
<v Speaker 2>parents were hippies when I grew up.</v>

2160
01:05:44.261 --> 01:05:46.810
<v Speaker 2>I always thought of the left and we always,</v>

2161
01:05:46.811 --> 01:05:47.980
<v Speaker 2>I've been called,</v>

2162
01:05:47.981 --> 01:05:48.161
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2163
01:05:48.161 --> 01:05:51.580
<v Speaker 2>We have never voted anything but democratic in my life except for Gary Johnson.</v>

2164
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.760
<v Speaker 2>Gary Johnson was the only time I voted independent or whatever the fuck he was</v>

2165
01:05:54.761 --> 01:05:55.594
<v Speaker 2>libertarian.</v>

2166
01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:56.651
<v Speaker 2>But that was just [inaudible].</v>

2167
01:05:56.651 --> 01:05:57.484
<v Speaker 2>He did my podcast.</v>

2168
01:05:57.930 --> 01:06:00.700
<v Speaker 2>I've often Tulsi Gavin because he did my podcast,</v>

2169
01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:02.073
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

2170
01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:02.940
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2171
01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:03.230
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2172
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:06.360
<v Speaker 2>the left was always very considerate.</v>

2173
01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Well read.</v>

2174
01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:08.621
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

2175
01:06:08.621 --> 01:06:11.170
<v Speaker 2>there were the people that were more openminded,</v>

2176
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:15.100
<v Speaker 2>there were supporting of gay people and minorities that was the left and then</v>

2177
01:06:15.101 --> 01:06:15.934
<v Speaker 2>were nonviolent.</v>

2178
01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.400
<v Speaker 2>They were the people that are protesting Vietnam when I was a kid.</v>

2179
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Also just supportive of the virtue of speech and free speech and self criticism.</v>

2180
01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:24.800
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2181
01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:25.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean that the,</v>

2182
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:26.320
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2183
01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:31.320
<v Speaker 2>the disadvantage of the left against the right has always been there's this self</v>

2184
01:06:32.981 --> 01:06:37.300
<v Speaker 2>scrutiny and willingness to wonder whether or not I'm wrong,</v>

2185
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:40.030
<v Speaker 2>that isn't mirrored if you go far enough.</v>

2186
01:06:40.031 --> 01:06:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2187
01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:42.010
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2188
01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:42.800
<v Speaker 2>it has,</v>

2189
01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.250
<v Speaker 2>there has been.</v>

2190
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:45.820
<v Speaker 2>So there's been kind of an asymmetric war between left and right,</v>

2191
01:06:45.821 --> 01:06:46.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2192
01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:46.834
<v Speaker 2>politically from,</v>

2193
01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:48.100
<v Speaker 2>for much of our lifetime,</v>

2194
01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:50.660
<v Speaker 2>but you go far enough left now and you're,</v>

2195
01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:55.920
<v Speaker 2>you're meeting a kind of totalitarian resistance to speech and it's.</v>

2196
01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:58.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2197
01:06:58.351 --> 01:06:58.811
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

2198
01:06:58.811 --> 01:06:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm just,</v>

2199
01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:00.890
<v Speaker 2>it'll be interesting to see how the,</v>

2200
01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:03.380
<v Speaker 2>the 2020 campaign plays out,</v>

2201
01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:08.420
<v Speaker 2>but I'm certainly worried that we could totally blow it with some leftist social</v>

2202
01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.230
<v Speaker 2>new uprising.</v>

2203
01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:11.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2204
01:07:11.621 --> 01:07:13.810
<v Speaker 2>That would be unfortunate because I think they would just double down on the</v>

2205
01:07:13.811 --> 01:07:14.320
<v Speaker 2>other side.</v>

2206
01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.780
<v Speaker 2>We'd be better off with some sort of a reasonable centrist,</v>

2207
01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:17.080
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2208
01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Someone who just made sense and,</v>

2209
01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:19.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2210
01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:22.390
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I liked about Tulsi is that she's a veteran and,</v>

2211
01:07:22.391 --> 01:07:23.224
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2212
01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:24.070
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

2213
01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:25.660
<v Speaker 2>she seems very reasonable to me,</v>

2214
01:07:25.661 --> 01:07:30.661
<v Speaker 2>but except that I haven't followed her career closely,</v>

2215
01:07:30.911 --> 01:07:35.530
<v Speaker 2>but it just seems like she's not making the right noises on things like Syria</v>

2216
01:07:35.531 --> 01:07:38.530
<v Speaker 2>and Assad and I don't know enough about that to comment.</v>

2217
01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:41.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about Assad and the controversy of whether or not he gassed</v>

2218
01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.510
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2219
01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:44.200
<v Speaker 2>whether that is,</v>

2220
01:07:44.201 --> 01:07:48.340
<v Speaker 2>I think uncontroversial in terms of what she mean that is uncontroversial.</v>

2221
01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Which in terms of what she is saying about it,</v>

2222
01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.220
<v Speaker 2>about him.</v>

2223
01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:52.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2224
01:07:52.381 --> 01:07:52.431
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

2225
01:07:52.431 --> 01:07:56.550
<v Speaker 2>she's capable of putting both feet in her mouth on that and thought she's what</v>

2226
01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.100
<v Speaker 2>she's saying.</v>

2227
01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.330
<v Speaker 2>He's not an enemy of America.</v>

2228
01:07:58.331 --> 01:07:58.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2229
01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:58.990
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2230
01:07:58.990 --> 01:07:59.501
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2231
01:07:59.501 --> 01:07:59.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2232
01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.341
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2233
01:08:00.341 --> 01:08:01.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not close enough to it and uh,</v>

2234
01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.030
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2235
01:08:03.030 --> 01:08:07.870
<v Speaker 2>I would be very circumspect about endorsing her going forward.</v>

2236
01:08:07.871 --> 01:08:11.680
<v Speaker 2>And we did do a little homework because I think her candidacy is not going to</v>

2237
01:08:11.681 --> 01:08:12.514
<v Speaker 2>age well.</v>

2238
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.520
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2239
01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2240
01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:15.143
<v Speaker 2>that's my.</v>

2241
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Who makes sense to you?</v>

2242
01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Elizabeth Warren's fucked now.</v>

2243
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:20.990
<v Speaker 2>The most recent one,</v>

2244
01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.790
<v Speaker 2>she's got the most recent one for.</v>

2245
01:08:22.791 --> 01:08:24.000
<v Speaker 2>She filled out an application.</v>

2246
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:28.820
<v Speaker 2>She wrote native American on a budget just having done the DNA test is playing</v>

2247
01:08:28.821 --> 01:08:30.110
<v Speaker 2>that game with trump.</v>

2248
01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:30.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was,</v>

2249
01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:32.540
<v Speaker 2>that was such a miscalculation.</v>

2250
01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:32.841
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2251
01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:35.720
<v Speaker 2>the fact that she released the data and the data's so clear.</v>

2252
01:08:35.721 --> 01:08:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Well it's almost like she had to because otherwise he would call her pocahontas</v>

2253
01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:40.761
<v Speaker 2>to the end of time,</v>

2254
01:08:40.761 --> 01:08:41.150
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

2255
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:44.950
<v Speaker 2>but then to then have to apologize to native Americans for having done the</v>

2256
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:48.600
<v Speaker 2>tablet just because the amount of native American is so low.</v>

2257
01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:52.700
<v Speaker 2>I've been joking around about it than I am like 100 times more African and she</v>

2258
01:08:52.701 --> 01:08:53.534
<v Speaker 2>is native American.</v>

2259
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:58.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm one point six percent African and she's less than like way less than one</v>

2260
01:08:58.371 --> 01:08:59.420
<v Speaker 2>percent native American.</v>

2261
01:08:59.421 --> 01:08:59.631
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2262
01:08:59.631 --> 01:09:00.020
<v Speaker 2>But this,</v>

2263
01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:00.340
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

2264
01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:04.400
<v Speaker 2>this is the sort of masochistic death spiral that people on the left can get</v>

2265
01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:04.701
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

2266
01:09:04.701 --> 01:09:08.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're on the left and I've always said that the left eats its own in</v>

2267
01:09:08.451 --> 01:09:10.370
<v Speaker 2>a way that the right never does.</v>

2268
01:09:10.710 --> 01:09:11.543
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2269
01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:12.201
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2270
01:09:12.201 --> 01:09:12.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2271
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:17.950
<v Speaker 2>we have to find someone who can stand outside that the circular firing squad,</v>

2272
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:20.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2273
01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2274
01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.930
<v Speaker 2>and it would be someone who's,</v>

2275
01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2276
01:09:25.071 --> 01:09:25.610
<v Speaker 2>it would be,</v>

2277
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:26.271
<v Speaker 2>in my view,</v>

2278
01:09:26.271 --> 01:09:27.290
<v Speaker 2>would be somebody like a,</v>

2279
01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:29.330
<v Speaker 2>a younger Bloomberg,</v>

2280
01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:29.481
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2281
01:09:29.481 --> 01:09:29.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2282
01:09:29.591 --> 01:09:30.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's,</v>

2283
01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:30.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's Bloomberg,</v>

2284
01:09:30.861 --> 01:09:31.670
<v Speaker 2>but like somebody,</v>

2285
01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:36.670
<v Speaker 2>like a legit businessman who could call bullshit on all of trump's fake business</v>

2286
01:09:37.251 --> 01:09:41.210
<v Speaker 2>acumen and who's not ethically compromised.</v>

2287
01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:41.421
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2288
01:09:41.421 --> 01:09:41.900
<v Speaker 2>But who can,</v>

2289
01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:43.420
<v Speaker 2>who can get stuff done and so,</v>

2290
01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:44.683
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2291
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.000
<v Speaker 2>and definitely not someone who feels the need to pander to the far left on these</v>

2292
01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.030
<v Speaker 2>identity politics issues.</v>

2293
01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:57.650
<v Speaker 2>I think identity politics is really going to be bad for us against trump because</v>

2294
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.090
<v Speaker 2>so much of the country,</v>

2295
01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.420
<v Speaker 2>the crucial sliver of the country.</v>

2296
01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:07.200
<v Speaker 2>And you just have to ask yourself who was it who voted for Obama and then or</v>

2297
01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.260
<v Speaker 2>twice and then voted for trump.</v>

2298
01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2299
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Those people aren't racist,</v>

2300
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:12.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2301
01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Those people are sick of being called racist.</v>

2302
01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:14.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2303
01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:15.740
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

2304
01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:19.910
<v Speaker 2>what's happening on the left around identity politics and all of these.</v>

2305
01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:20.391
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2306
01:10:20.391 --> 01:10:22.220
<v Speaker 2>it's not that racism isn't a problem,</v>

2307
01:10:22.221 --> 01:10:26.690
<v Speaker 2>is not that transgender issues don't have to be worked out and be like all like</v>

2308
01:10:26.691 --> 01:10:28.580
<v Speaker 2>all of those are legit concerns,</v>

2309
01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:33.350
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that that's the center of mass politically on the left,</v>

2310
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.880
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2311
01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.030
<v Speaker 2>in a nationwide election against someone like trump.</v>

2312
01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I just think that's an absolute recipe for disaster because the people that</v>

2313
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:46.940
<v Speaker 2>subscribed to that ideology don't realize how many people think it's silly.</v>

2314
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2315
01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2316
01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:52.100
<v Speaker 2>when you're in the oppression Olympics and you're trying to win the gold and for</v>

2317
01:10:52.101 --> 01:10:54.470
<v Speaker 2>and for how many people it's actually misapplied.</v>

2318
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:56.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like there,</v>

2319
01:10:56.311 --> 01:11:01.311
<v Speaker 2>there are many more explanations for voting for trump in addition to racism.</v>

2320
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:03.783
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

2321
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:04.251
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2322
01:11:04.251 --> 01:11:04.431
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2323
01:11:04.431 --> 01:11:04.850
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2324
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:06.620
<v Speaker 2>every racist voted for trump,</v>

2325
01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:06.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2326
01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:07.760
<v Speaker 2>virtually.</v>

2327
01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.780
<v Speaker 2>So that's fine.</v>

2328
01:11:08.781 --> 01:11:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Every white supremacist voted for trump,</v>

2329
01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:16.090
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the story about why trump got elected and song store.</v>

2330
01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.260
<v Speaker 2>It's just much more.</v>

2331
01:11:19.261 --> 01:11:19.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2332
01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.710
<v Speaker 2>there's people who just have not,</v>

2333
01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:23.293
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2334
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.570
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

2335
01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Ours are not thriving in the current economy and stuff like that.</v>

2336
01:11:27.611 --> 01:11:30.750
<v Speaker 2>You got automation displacing manufacturing jobs.</v>

2337
01:11:30.751 --> 01:11:33.150
<v Speaker 2>You got the consequences of trade and immigration.</v>

2338
01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.013
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2339
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2340
01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.600
<v Speaker 2>you have legitimate concerns about,</v>

2341
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:38.083
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2342
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:39.270
<v Speaker 2>you have a legit,</v>

2343
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:43.020
<v Speaker 2>there are legitimate concerns about immigration that have nothing to do with</v>

2344
01:11:43.021 --> 01:11:43.650
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>

2345
01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:48.650
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're going to score any hesitation over something like open borders</v>

2346
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.740
<v Speaker 2>as a sign of your xenophobia and racism,</v>

2347
01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:57.000
<v Speaker 2>you're going to lose virtually everyone who has a sane concern about how to,</v>

2348
01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:58.890
<v Speaker 2>how you keep people in,</v>

2349
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.410
<v Speaker 2>how you,</v>

2350
01:11:59.410 --> 01:12:01.620
<v Speaker 2>how you admit the right people into a country,</v>

2351
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:02.663
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2352
01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:03.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2353
01:12:03.301 --> 01:12:05.640
<v Speaker 2>there are economic concerns and there are social concerns.</v>

2354
01:12:05.641 --> 01:12:06.474
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2355
01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:07.853
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2356
01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:08.491
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2357
01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:08.791
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2358
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:12.240
<v Speaker 2>and you don't have to be Ben Shapiro to share some of those concerns.</v>

2359
01:12:12.241 --> 01:12:12.431
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2360
01:12:12.431 --> 01:12:13.890
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying bench appears racist,</v>

2361
01:12:13.891 --> 01:12:15.330
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'm saying he's a conservative,</v>

2362
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:16.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2363
01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:16.651
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2364
01:12:16.651 --> 01:12:18.120
<v Speaker 2>take some more conservative line on,</v>

2365
01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:19.980
<v Speaker 2>on many of these questions than I do,</v>

2366
01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:21.850
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2367
01:12:22.190 --> 01:12:23.023
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2368
01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.020
<v Speaker 2>you either you either think,</v>

2369
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:27.270
<v Speaker 2>but just take immigration is the narrow case.</v>

2370
01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.080
<v Speaker 2>You either think you should be able to know who's coming into the country or you</v>

2371
01:12:33.121 --> 01:12:34.170
<v Speaker 2>don't right now,</v>

2372
01:12:34.171 --> 01:12:34.471
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

2373
01:12:34.471 --> 01:12:36.570
<v Speaker 2>if you think you should just have open borders,</v>

2374
01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:38.063
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2375
01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.450
<v Speaker 2>there are two problems with that.</v>

2376
01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:43.500
<v Speaker 2>One is there are many good arguments against that and to,</v>

2377
01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:46.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the percentage is,</v>

2378
01:12:46.381 --> 01:12:50.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's got to be something like 95 percent of Americans would be terrified at</v>

2379
01:12:50.521 --> 01:12:51.270
<v Speaker 2>that prospect.</v>

2380
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.451
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2381
01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:51.810
<v Speaker 2>So if you're,</v>

2382
01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:51.980
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2383
01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:55.760
<v Speaker 2>if any of your platform is essentially saying it,</v>

2384
01:12:55.761 --> 01:12:58.470
<v Speaker 2>concerned about immigration is synonymous with racism,</v>

2385
01:12:59.100 --> 01:12:59.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2386
01:12:59.371 --> 01:13:03.600
<v Speaker 2>you have a platform that is going to alienate most people and that's what the</v>

2387
01:13:03.601 --> 01:13:07.110
<v Speaker 2>Democrats are totally capable of seeming like that.</v>

2388
01:13:07.111 --> 01:13:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Whether in fact that's,</v>

2389
01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:10.500
<v Speaker 2>that's true for most Democrats.</v>

2390
01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.330
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is,</v>

2391
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:15.180
<v Speaker 2>what's the primary factor like what,</v>

2392
01:13:15.181 --> 01:13:19.440
<v Speaker 2>what caused identity politics through reached this boiling point that it's at</v>

2393
01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:20.274
<v Speaker 2>right now?</v>

2394
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:21.601
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2395
01:13:21.601 --> 01:13:22.291
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

2396
01:13:22.291 --> 01:13:26.520
<v Speaker 2>I think in large measure what the Internet is doing to us,</v>

2397
01:13:26.521 --> 01:13:27.331
<v Speaker 2>it's not that identity.</v>

2398
01:13:27.331 --> 01:13:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Politics has been a feature of politics for forever,</v>

2399
01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:33.720
<v Speaker 2>but there is a,</v>

2400
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:35.130
<v Speaker 2>there's the silo effect.</v>

2401
01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:40.160
<v Speaker 2>There's the effect that groups become more radicalized the as groups because the</v>

2402
01:13:42.511 --> 01:13:45.180
<v Speaker 2>most extreme voices tend to,</v>

2403
01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:46.920
<v Speaker 2>to pipe up more and then and,</v>

2404
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:48.030
<v Speaker 2>and everyone.</v>

2405
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Everyone who's who is silent.</v>

2406
01:13:50.491 --> 01:13:50.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2407
01:13:50.611 --> 01:13:52.920
<v Speaker 2>there's kind of a diffusion of responsibility around,</v>

2408
01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.350
<v Speaker 2>around countering these extreme voices,</v>

2409
01:13:55.351 --> 01:13:55.581
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

2410
01:13:55.581 --> 01:13:55.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2411
01:13:55.771 --> 01:13:56.581
<v Speaker 2>every you can,</v>

2412
01:13:56.581 --> 01:14:01.581
<v Speaker 2>it only takes a small percentage of extreme voices to cow the rest of the group</v>

2413
01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:04.640
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2414
01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:08.610
<v Speaker 2>and make the group seem like the extreme voices are speaking for the group,</v>

2415
01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:09.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2416
01:14:09.291 --> 01:14:09.471
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2417
01:14:09.471 --> 01:14:13.090
<v Speaker 2>and so I think what we have on in the left and the right,</v>

2418
01:14:13.810 --> 01:14:15.400
<v Speaker 2>we have a small percentage.</v>

2419
01:14:15.401 --> 01:14:15.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2420
01:14:15.591 --> 01:14:15.671
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2421
01:14:15.671 --> 01:14:16.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2422
01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:19.360
<v Speaker 2>the last poll I saw that trying to get at this question was something like,</v>

2423
01:14:19.361 --> 01:14:19.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2424
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:24.510
<v Speaker 2>six or eight percent on the tails that are making it seem like these are,</v>

2425
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:25.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

2426
01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.050
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more of a problem on the left than on the right because I mean,</v>

2427
01:14:29.051 --> 01:14:33.700
<v Speaker 2>the extreme right stay is fringe and looks fringe,</v>

2428
01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:33.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2429
01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Like the guy,</v>

2430
01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:35.830
<v Speaker 2>the guys in Charlottesville,</v>

2431
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.480
<v Speaker 2>Charlottesville with their Tiki torches,</v>

2432
01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:41.200
<v Speaker 2>they don't look like they represent the Republican Party or the,</v>

2433
01:14:41.201 --> 01:14:41.920
<v Speaker 2>or the,</v>

2434
01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.311
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2435
01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:43.144
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2436
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:43.810
<v Speaker 2>the right,</v>

2437
01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:46.210
<v Speaker 2>the conservatives in any general sense.</v>

2438
01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2439
01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:48.790
<v Speaker 2>there are a symptom of some problem,</v>

2440
01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:50.140
<v Speaker 2>but it's a smaller problem.</v>

2441
01:14:50.141 --> 01:14:51.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a minority problem.</v>

2442
01:14:51.161 --> 01:14:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Whereas on the left,</v>

2443
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:55.870
<v Speaker 2>the extreme voices are,</v>

2444
01:14:55.990 --> 01:15:00.820
<v Speaker 2>have massive sway in major companies in tech companies,</v>

2445
01:15:00.821 --> 01:15:01.780
<v Speaker 2>in journalism,</v>

2446
01:15:01.781 --> 01:15:02.620
<v Speaker 2>in academia,</v>

2447
01:15:02.650 --> 01:15:02.861
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2448
01:15:02.861 --> 01:15:07.861
<v Speaker 2>like the silencing effect and the reputational cost that's being paid by even</v>

2449
01:15:07.931 --> 01:15:12.850
<v Speaker 2>very powerful people in all these mainstream forums on the left is,</v>

2450
01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:13.773
<v Speaker 2>is just,</v>

2451
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:16.420
<v Speaker 2>that's not mirrored on the right,</v>

2452
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:17.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2453
01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.281
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>

2454
01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:18.451
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2455
01:15:18.451 --> 01:15:20.950
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know if I told you this,</v>

2456
01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly didn't say it on a,</v>

2457
01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:24.670
<v Speaker 2>on a previous podcast with you,</v>

2458
01:15:24.671 --> 01:15:25.250
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2459
01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:25.541
<v Speaker 2>so it was,</v>

2460
01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:29.410
<v Speaker 2>I was at dinner with a bunch of Silicon Valley people and we were talking about,</v>

2461
01:15:29.411 --> 01:15:29.730
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2462
01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:30.450
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2463
01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:31.900
<v Speaker 2>it was at the moment when that,</v>

2464
01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:35.620
<v Speaker 2>that Netflix story happened where the,</v>

2465
01:15:35.621 --> 01:15:36.454
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2466
01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:40.240
<v Speaker 2>where Jonathan Friedland got fired over using the n word in a closed door</v>

2467
01:15:40.241 --> 01:15:40.840
<v Speaker 2>meeting.</v>

2468
01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:41.830
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

2469
01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:42.191
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2470
01:15:42.191 --> 01:15:42.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2471
01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:45.180
<v Speaker 2>using the n word in response to my friend Tom Segura who you.</v>

2472
01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2473
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:46.151
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2474
01:15:46.151 --> 01:15:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2475
01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:47.723
<v Speaker 2>Special.</v>

2476
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Where he said you can't say retarded anymore.</v>

2477
01:15:51.810 --> 01:15:53.650
<v Speaker 2>And then explained like that,</v>

2478
01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:53.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2479
01:15:53.951 --> 01:15:55.320
<v Speaker 2>there's words you can't use anymore.</v>

2480
01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:57.730
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even wasn't using it in a joke,</v>

2481
01:15:57.731 --> 01:16:00.370
<v Speaker 2>like calling someone retarded or saying something's retarded,</v>

2482
01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:01.810
<v Speaker 2>but they were in,</v>

2483
01:16:01.811 --> 01:16:04.040
<v Speaker 2>he was saying that that's like using the envelope around.</v>

2484
01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:04.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2485
01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:06.520
<v Speaker 2>But he used the n word in this meeting,</v>

2486
01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:06.710
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2487
01:16:06.710 --> 01:16:10.610
<v Speaker 2>And it says like using the n word and the,</v>

2488
01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:11.350
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>

2489
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.531
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2490
01:16:11.531 --> 01:16:14.950
<v Speaker 2>the mere intonation of those syllables was so shocking.</v>

2491
01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:16.023
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2492
01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2493
01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:18.850
<v Speaker 2>that he wound up getting fired.</v>

2494
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:19.211
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2495
01:16:19.211 --> 01:16:19.331
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2496
01:16:19.331 --> 01:16:19.840
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

2497
01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:20.260
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

2498
01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:24.520
<v Speaker 2>he was using it in the context of expressing just how careful netflix has to be</v>

2499
01:16:24.521 --> 01:16:29.440
<v Speaker 2>about speech and he was going social justice warrior on himself among social</v>

2500
01:16:29.441 --> 01:16:30.340
<v Speaker 2>justice warriors.</v>

2501
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:33.520
<v Speaker 2>And he said this is how worried we have to be.</v>

2502
01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:35.890
<v Speaker 2>And that it gave a magic incantation.</v>

2503
01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:37.540
<v Speaker 2>You can still say retarded,</v>

2504
01:16:37.541 --> 01:16:39.520
<v Speaker 2>which is amazing because it's stiff.</v>

2505
01:16:39.810 --> 01:16:40.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2506
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:42.970
<v Speaker 2>in his defense you kind of have to say both words.</v>

2507
01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.800
<v Speaker 2>You're not saying the R word,</v>

2508
01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:45.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2509
01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Like using the r word is,</v>

2510
01:16:46.611 --> 01:16:46.651
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2511
01:16:46.651 --> 01:16:48.490
<v Speaker 2>like using the n word around black people.</v>

2512
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:52.920
<v Speaker 2>More getting to some weird fucking weird place with this.</v>

2513
01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:53.261
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

2514
01:16:53.261 --> 01:16:53.500
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2515
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm realized why I'm confused about why I think I've talked about this</v>

2516
01:16:56.321 --> 01:16:59.680
<v Speaker 2>because I did a podcast with Chelsea handler,</v>

2517
01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:00.841
<v Speaker 2>which hasn't aired,</v>

2518
01:17:00.841 --> 01:17:01.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2519
01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:01.900
<v Speaker 2>did it months ago,</v>

2520
01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:02.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2521
01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:05.800
<v Speaker 2>because she was doing a documentary on white privilege I think.</v>

2522
01:17:05.801 --> 01:17:05.981
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2523
01:17:05.981 --> 01:17:09.320
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm actually cast as the guy with white privilege and this documentary.</v>

2524
01:17:09.370 --> 01:17:09.720
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

2525
01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:10.310
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be fun.</v>

2526
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:11.121
<v Speaker 2>You have white privilege.</v>

2527
01:17:11.121 --> 01:17:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2528
01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

2529
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:12.261
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2530
01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:13.094
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2531
01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:13.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2532
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.690
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2533
01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:15.020
<v Speaker 2>I recorded a podcast with her.</v>

2534
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:15.501
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

2535
01:17:15.501 --> 01:17:18.860
<v Speaker 2>so we hit this point because this had just come out,</v>

2536
01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:19.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2537
01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:19.761
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

2538
01:17:19.761 --> 01:17:21.890
<v Speaker 2>And I think her documentary is probably for Netflix.</v>

2539
01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:24.170
<v Speaker 2>So what was her take on it?</v>

2540
01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:25.251
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2541
01:17:25.251 --> 01:17:25.760
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>

2542
01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:26.750
<v Speaker 2>she was basically,</v>

2543
01:17:26.751 --> 01:17:29.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean she was playing the other side of the net for this,</v>

2544
01:17:29.421 --> 01:17:29.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2545
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:30.630
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2546
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:31.140
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2547
01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:31.973
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2548
01:17:32.150 --> 01:17:32.361
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

2549
01:17:32.361 --> 01:17:32.931
<v Speaker 2>we'll have to see.</v>

2550
01:17:32.931 --> 01:17:33.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2551
01:17:33.141 --> 01:17:33.974
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>

2552
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2553
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.181
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2554
01:17:35.181 --> 01:17:35.931
<v Speaker 2>at least in my own mind,</v>

2555
01:17:35.931 --> 01:17:40.070
<v Speaker 2>I certainly made sense there and she shouldn't have a lot of response to what I</v>

2556
01:17:40.071 --> 01:17:40.880
<v Speaker 2>was saying,</v>

2557
01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:41.211
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2558
01:17:41.211 --> 01:17:43.040
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard the audio or seeing the video.</v>

2559
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2560
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:45.830
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

2561
01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:47.293
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2562
01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:49.063
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

2563
01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:54.100
<v Speaker 2>I was at a dinner with a bunch of tech ceos talking about this problem and one</v>

2564
01:17:55.821 --> 01:17:57.500
<v Speaker 2>guy who I won't name,</v>

2565
01:17:57.501 --> 01:17:58.960
<v Speaker 2>who runs a big company,</v>

2566
01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.093
<v Speaker 2>which I won't name,</v>

2567
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:01.430
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2568
01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:01.641
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2569
01:18:01.641 --> 01:18:04.340
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea how deep this goes.</v>

2570
01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:06.840
<v Speaker 2>Like I have an hr complaint where,</v>

2571
01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.313
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2572
01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:12.020
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy who identifies as a furry,</v>

2573
01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:17.000
<v Speaker 2>he thinks he's a cat and because we don't provide litter boxes in the bathroom,</v>

2574
01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:18.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2575
01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:18.853
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2576
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:20.480
<v Speaker 2>he's launched an HR complaint,</v>

2577
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:21.170
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2578
01:18:21.170 --> 01:18:21.980
<v Speaker 2>This is real,</v>

2579
01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:22.460
<v Speaker 2>this is real.</v>

2580
01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.670
<v Speaker 2>This was told as a real story in,</v>

2581
01:18:24.671 --> 01:18:24.900
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2582
01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:25.550
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2583
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:27.000
<v Speaker 2>as a counterpoint or in,</v>

2584
01:18:27.010 --> 01:18:29.670
<v Speaker 2>in amplification of the story we were talking about it.</v>

2585
01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:30.081
<v Speaker 2>Netflix,</v>

2586
01:18:30.081 --> 01:18:30.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2587
01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:32.690
<v Speaker 2>So it's like this is,</v>

2588
01:18:35.290 --> 01:18:39.230
<v Speaker 2>this is happening like this is people are having to navigate ceos of</v>

2589
01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:44.260
<v Speaker 2>multimillion dollar companies are having to navigate around this stuff in house.</v>

2590
01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:44.571
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2591
01:18:44.571 --> 01:18:45.620
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

2592
01:18:45.621 --> 01:18:47.630
<v Speaker 2>the Google thing over James Demore,</v>

2593
01:18:47.631 --> 01:18:47.871
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2594
01:18:47.871 --> 01:18:48.704
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was,</v>

2595
01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:51.230
<v Speaker 2>that was an enormous problem for Google,</v>

2596
01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:51.621
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2597
01:18:51.621 --> 01:18:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Like that was the wheels were coming off as far as I can tell from what I've</v>

2598
01:18:56.091 --> 01:18:58.460
<v Speaker 2>heard what and how.</v>

2599
01:18:58.461 --> 01:18:59.570
<v Speaker 2>So just that,</v>

2600
01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:00.890
<v Speaker 2>like there was a,</v>

2601
01:19:00.891 --> 01:19:04.990
<v Speaker 2>there was going to be a google mutiny over James Damore if he was,</v>

2602
01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:06.200
<v Speaker 2>he has be fired.</v>

2603
01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:06.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2604
01:19:06.381 --> 01:19:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2605
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:07.370
<v Speaker 2>This was,</v>

2606
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:08.810
<v Speaker 2>this was a big deal at Google.</v>

2607
01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:13.190
<v Speaker 2>That's what he and what he wrote was essentially like a,</v>

2608
01:19:13.191 --> 01:19:13.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2609
01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:15.890
<v Speaker 2>a b plus term paper and human biology.</v>

2610
01:19:15.891 --> 01:19:16.041
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2611
01:19:16.041 --> 01:19:17.510
<v Speaker 2>And it was like in May you can,</v>

2612
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.823
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

2613
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:22.670
<v Speaker 2>you can push back on some of the science,</v>

2614
01:19:22.730 --> 01:19:23.271
<v Speaker 2>say or.</v>

2615
01:19:23.271 --> 01:19:27.290
<v Speaker 2>But like this was not a malicious distortion of the state of the science.</v>

2616
01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:27.600
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2617
01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.100
<v Speaker 2>and this was not calling for discrimination against women.</v>

2618
01:19:31.101 --> 01:19:31.701
<v Speaker 2>This was just saying,</v>

2619
01:19:31.701 --> 01:19:32.480
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2620
01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:34.640
<v Speaker 2>men and women are different and they've got different interests.</v>

2621
01:19:34.641 --> 01:19:34.881
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2622
01:19:34.881 --> 01:19:38.240
<v Speaker 2>And this could account for why there's an unequal representation at the left</v>

2623
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:40.550
<v Speaker 2>level of software and software development.</v>

2624
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2625
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.040
<v Speaker 2>and so we're like,</v>

2626
01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:45.770
<v Speaker 2>we're on the left.</v>

2627
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:51.130
<v Speaker 2>We're finding it very difficult to even talk about differences between men and</v>

2628
01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:52.190
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

2629
01:19:52.190 --> 01:19:52.431
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2630
01:19:52.431 --> 01:19:52.881
<v Speaker 2>That there's,</v>

2631
01:19:52.881 --> 01:19:53.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2632
01:19:53.610 --> 01:19:54.300
<v Speaker 2>start with,</v>

2633
01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:56.480
<v Speaker 2>start with a uterus and then count from there.</v>

2634
01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2635
01:19:57.170 --> 01:20:00.350
<v Speaker 2>That is already a taboo conversation to have and that,</v>

2636
01:20:00.370 --> 01:20:00.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2637
01:20:00.591 --> 01:20:03.950
<v Speaker 2>as we said at the beginning in talking about twitter,</v>

2638
01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:06.920
<v Speaker 2>that one writer again,</v>

2639
01:20:06.921 --> 01:20:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2640
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 2>her name is Megan Murphy,</v>

2641
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:12.150
<v Speaker 2>she got booted for saying men are not women.</v>

2642
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2643
01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:13.873
<v Speaker 2>But that's.</v>

2644
01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:14.550
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2645
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:15.000
<v Speaker 2>so again,</v>

2646
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:15.840
<v Speaker 2>this was politically,</v>

2647
01:20:15.841 --> 01:20:20.841
<v Speaker 2>I'm very worried that unless we resolve that or just cut through it,</v>

2648
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.843
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2649
01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:26.130
<v Speaker 2>we don't stand a chance against trump in 2020.</v>

2650
01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:30.330
<v Speaker 2>I was reading a story about a woman who was on some sort of an Lbgt,</v>

2651
01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:30.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2652
01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.280
<v Speaker 2>panel and uh,</v>

2653
01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:37.520
<v Speaker 2>she's a part of some group and she was kicked out of it by a man who identifies</v>

2654
01:20:38.371 --> 01:20:41.010
<v Speaker 2>as a lesbian and he has a penis.</v>

2655
01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:42.413
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2656
01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2657
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2658
01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:48.250
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2659
01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:49.980
<v Speaker 2>What ironically,</v>

2660
01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.470
<v Speaker 2>so this is the point that he has a penis.</v>

2661
01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:56.640
<v Speaker 2>I want to be sure he definitely identifies as a lesbian that I might've read a</v>

2662
01:20:56.641 --> 01:20:59.490
<v Speaker 2>twitter comment about how preposterous that was inside the penis part.</v>

2663
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:04.140
<v Speaker 2>This is something that Andrew Sullivan wrote in a recent article on this is that</v>

2664
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:09.500
<v Speaker 2>the transgender thing is at odds with gay rights in a fundamental sense and that</v>

2665
01:21:11.071 --> 01:21:16.071
<v Speaker 2>you can't balance these equations because like two gay identity absolutely</v>

2666
01:21:17.341 --> 01:21:20.880
<v Speaker 2>focuses on the legitimate differences between men and women.</v>

2667
01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:22.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm a man,</v>

2668
01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:23.520
<v Speaker 2>I like men,</v>

2669
01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:24.420
<v Speaker 2>I like women.</v>

2670
01:21:24.421 --> 01:21:25.440
<v Speaker 2>That's my situation.</v>

2671
01:21:25.890 --> 01:21:26.790
<v Speaker 2>But once you,</v>

2672
01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:28.900
<v Speaker 2>once you change the,</v>

2673
01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:29.300
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2674
01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:30.270
<v Speaker 2>your notion of what,</v>

2675
01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:30.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2676
01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:32.850
<v Speaker 2>how gender relates to sex,</v>

2677
01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:33.790
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2678
01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:37.500
<v Speaker 2>it begins to erode this claim on the legitimacy of,</v>

2679
01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:37.920
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2680
01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:38.753
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2681
01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:43.590
<v Speaker 2>of a gay identity is that they're all marginalized so they stick together.</v>

2682
01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:44.341
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea,</v>

2683
01:21:44.341 --> 01:21:45.360
<v Speaker 2>I guess behind it.</v>

2684
01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:47.700
<v Speaker 2>But there's something I can only imagine what,</v>

2685
01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:48.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2686
01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Sullivan's twitter feed looks like now because he,</v>

2687
01:21:50.690 --> 01:21:51.810
<v Speaker 2>when he writes these articles,</v>

2688
01:21:51.811 --> 01:21:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's just gets eviscerated by the left and he's just,</v>

2689
01:21:55.641 --> 01:21:55.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2690
01:21:55.831 --> 01:21:57.000
<v Speaker 2>straight up talking about,</v>

2691
01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:58.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2692
01:21:58.110 --> 01:22:00.800
<v Speaker 2>this is what gay rights looks like and this is,</v>

2693
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:02.550
<v Speaker 2>this is how you can't be a,</v>

2694
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:06.090
<v Speaker 2>a man with a penis who's identifies as a lesbian.</v>

2695
01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:06.983
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2696
01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:07.380
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2697
01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:08.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2698
01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:09.240
<v Speaker 2>But you can't say that.</v>

2699
01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2700
01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:14.880
<v Speaker 2>and you also can't say that a man with a penis is not a woman because if a man</v>

2701
01:22:15.121 --> 01:22:15.841
<v Speaker 2>with a penis,</v>

2702
01:22:15.841 --> 01:22:18.180
<v Speaker 2>I can say it because I can't be fired,</v>

2703
01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.670
<v Speaker 2>but if you do say it,</v>

2704
01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:22.200
<v Speaker 2>you will get a certain amount of hate.</v>

2705
01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:22.471
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2706
01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:26.760
<v Speaker 2>there's people that are saying that men who will not date trans women who still</v>

2707
01:22:26.761 --> 01:22:27.600
<v Speaker 2>have penises,</v>

2708
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:28.733
<v Speaker 2>they're transphobic,</v>

2709
01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:29.300
<v Speaker 2>transphobia.</v>

2710
01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:30.133
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

2711
01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:30.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2712
01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:31.470
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

2713
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:32.071
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever,</v>

2714
01:22:32.071 --> 01:22:32.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2715
01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:33.510
<v Speaker 2>have you ever met Jamie Kilstein?</v>

2716
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.630
<v Speaker 2>So Jamie and I have a checkered history.</v>

2717
01:22:36.631 --> 01:22:39.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if maybe you and I have spoken about this.</v>

2718
01:22:39.361 --> 01:22:40.380
<v Speaker 2>I've never met Jamie,</v>

2719
01:22:40.381 --> 01:22:41.011
<v Speaker 2>but Jamie,</v>

2720
01:22:41.011 --> 01:22:43.140
<v Speaker 2>when Jamie was social justice warrior,</v>

2721
01:22:43.170 --> 01:22:43.770
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>

2722
01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:44.401
<v Speaker 2>he went hard.</v>

2723
01:22:44.401 --> 01:22:45.910
<v Speaker 2>He went hard on me.</v>

2724
01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>

2725
01:22:47.230 --> 01:22:47.740
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

2726
01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:52.740
<v Speaker 2>he was dunking on me endlessly in ways that were totally unfair.</v>

2727
01:22:52.921 --> 01:22:53.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2728
01:22:53.071 --> 01:22:53.850
<v Speaker 2>he was just,</v>

2729
01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:54.683
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

2730
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:58.290
<v Speaker 2>he was working very hard to become an enemy.</v>

2731
01:22:58.830 --> 01:23:00.270
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2732
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:02.280
<v Speaker 2>then he had his,</v>

2733
01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:06.220
<v Speaker 2>his epiphany of then the social justice mob came for him</v>

2734
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:11.250
<v Speaker 1>over something for almost nothing over him trying to get laid.</v>

2735
01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2736
01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.110
<v Speaker 1>like they were saying he was a creep or something like that,</v>

2737
01:23:14.150 --> 01:23:15.520
<v Speaker 1>just try hitting on girls.</v>

2738
01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:17.440
<v Speaker 1>I miss the details there,</v>

2739
01:23:17.441 --> 01:23:18.490
<v Speaker 1>but then he came then.</v>

2740
01:23:18.491 --> 01:23:21.090
<v Speaker 1>So then he since sent me very,</v>

2741
01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:23.043
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2742

<v Speaker 1>friendly and apologetic emails about Josie.</v>

2743
01:23:26.091 --> 01:23:26.591

2744
01:23:26.591 --> 01:23:27.131

2749
01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:29.500
<v Speaker 1>he wants to do a podcast.</v>

2750
01:23:29.501 --> 01:23:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I haven't taken them up on it,</v>

2751
01:23:30.731 --> 01:23:31.060
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2752
01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:31.893

<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2760

<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2761
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:42.970
<v Speaker 1>he and I had our own issue at one point in time over a podcast that we did</v>

2762
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.880
<v Speaker 1>versus,</v>

2763

<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2765
01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:50.170
<v Speaker 1>you remember when the Daniel Tosh rape controversy like,</v>

2766

<v Speaker 1>I know who talked about,</v>

2770
01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I missed the joke,</v>

2771
01:23:53.711 --> 01:23:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I should say rape joke.</v>

2772
01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Some woman in a crowd.</v>

2773
01:23:57.821 --> 01:23:58.450
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

2774
01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:01.750
<v Speaker 1>he was on stage and he wasn't supposed to be there.</v>

2775
01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:02.950
<v Speaker 1>It was at the laugh factory.</v>

2776
01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:03.611
<v Speaker 1>And Dom,</v>

<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2779
01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:06.971
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any material.</v>

2780
01:24:06.971 --> 01:24:08.140
<v Speaker 1>What do you guys want to talk about?</v>

2781
01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.150
<v Speaker 1>And some guy yells out,</v>

2782
01:24:10.151 --> 01:24:10.984
<v Speaker 1>rape.</v>

2783
01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:12.363
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2784
01:24:12.490 --> 01:24:13.323
<v Speaker 1>that's always helpful.</v>

2785
01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.230
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2786
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2787
01:24:14.670 --> 01:24:16.150
<v Speaker 1>it's like some drunk and a crowd.</v>

2788
01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:16.660
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2789
01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:17.510
<v Speaker 1>she's crazy late.</v>

2790
01:24:17.730 --> 01:24:20.160
<v Speaker 1>And so Daniel tosh his take on it.</v>

2791
01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2792
01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:21.760
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2793
01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.710
<v Speaker 1>what's funny about that humiliation,</v>

2794
01:24:23.711 --> 01:24:24.544
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

2795
01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:24.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2796
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:25.110
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2797
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:27.040
<v Speaker 1>he's like berating,</v>

2798
01:24:27.041 --> 01:24:29.560
<v Speaker 1>this guy is trying to do standup while he's doing this.</v>

2799
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:30.820
<v Speaker 1>And some woman yells out,</v>

2800
01:24:30.821 --> 01:24:33.130
<v Speaker 1>actually there's nothing funny about rape.</v>

2801
01:24:34.090 --> 01:24:34.541
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

2802
01:24:34.541 --> 01:24:38.680
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be funny if someone who just raped her and everybody starts laughing</v>

2803
01:24:38.681 --> 01:24:42.070
<v Speaker 1>or do you remember this woman wrote a giant blog about it and she wanted him to</v>

2804
01:24:42.071 --> 01:24:42.910
<v Speaker 1>apologize about it.</v>

2805
01:24:42.910 --> 01:24:46.210
<v Speaker 1>And Jamie went after Daniel Tosh as a fellow,</v>

2806
01:24:46.670 --> 01:24:48.520
<v Speaker 1>as a fellow comic saying that it's,</v>

2807
01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:49.630
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2808
01:24:49.630 --> 01:24:50.081
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2809
01:24:50.081 --> 01:24:50.231
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2810
01:24:50.231 --> 01:24:51.100
<v Speaker 1>she's a heckler.</v>

2811
01:24:51.101 --> 01:24:52.360
<v Speaker 1>The women women heckled,</v>

2812
01:24:52.361 --> 01:24:55.910
<v Speaker 1>like while he was trying to do to stand up and he's like,</v>

2813
01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to support rape culture.</v>

2814
01:24:57.521 --> 01:24:57.881
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2815
01:24:57.881 --> 01:24:59.320
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck is that rape culture?</v>

2816
01:24:59.321 --> 01:24:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>

2817
01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:04.510
<v Speaker 1>he's clearly making a joke about something she said that was very,</v>

2818
01:25:04.690 --> 01:25:05.860
<v Speaker 1>very patronizing.</v>

2819
01:25:06.130 --> 01:25:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Like obviously he doesn't think there's something funny about rape.</v>

2820
01:25:08.501 --> 01:25:09.100
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2821
01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:14.100
<v Speaker 1>he's just trying to work through this ad Lib set that he's doing with some guy</v>

2822
01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:17.410
<v Speaker 1>who yelled out something that this whole crowd has to respond to.</v>

2823
01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:20.530
<v Speaker 1>He can't just ignore the fact that it happened and go,</v>

2824
01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:21.690
<v Speaker 1>how about firetrucks,</v>

2825
01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:22.150
<v Speaker 1>folks?</v>

2826
01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:22.421
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2827
01:25:22.421 --> 01:25:24.400
<v Speaker 1>They always read now he can't do that.</v>

2828
01:25:24.401 --> 01:25:24.820
<v Speaker 1>He's gotTa.</v>

2829
01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:28.270
<v Speaker 1>He's got deal with what this guy sat and so that's what he tosses out there and</v>

2830
01:25:28.271 --> 01:25:29.470
<v Speaker 1>everybody laughed by the way,</v>

2831
01:25:29.530 --> 01:25:32.170
<v Speaker 1>but also isn't the priority of his persona persona.</v>

2832
01:25:32.230 --> 01:25:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Just a villain.</v>

2833
01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:34.570
<v Speaker 1>He takes it to the edge,</v>

2834
01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:34.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2835
01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2836
01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:36.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2837
01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:36.550
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2838
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2839
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:37.840
<v Speaker 1>he's edgy comedian.</v>

2840
01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:39.610
<v Speaker 1>He's funny and you know,</v>

2841
01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Jamie and I had this little tit for tat about it,</v>

2842
01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:43.600
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

2843
01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:46.180
<v Speaker 1>he's very honest about his mistakes.</v>

2844
01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Like when you talked to him and he's,</v>

2845
01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:51.130
<v Speaker 1>he's got great insight because he was that guy,</v>

2846
01:25:51.370 --> 01:25:51.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2847
01:25:51.551 --> 01:25:55.150
<v Speaker 1>he was that guy that was going back and forth with people online all day and</v>

2848
01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:55.980
<v Speaker 1>checking is mentioned,</v>

2849
01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.900
<v Speaker 1>like couldn't walk down the street more than five steps before he'd pull out his</v>

2850
01:25:58.901 --> 01:26:03.490
<v Speaker 1>phone and check has mentioned how people responding to as late as Duncan take</v>

2851
01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:04.390
<v Speaker 1>down or you know,</v>

2852
01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:05.390
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2853
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:07.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a toxic thing that people are doing.</v>

2854
01:26:07.751 --> 01:26:08.320
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>

2855
01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:08.900
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2856
01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:09.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2857
01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:10.850
<v Speaker 1>looking for people that are,</v>

2858
01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:13.610
<v Speaker 1>that are bad and looking for things that are wrong,</v>

2859
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.200
<v Speaker 1>looking for wrong speak.</v>

2860
01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.490
<v Speaker 1>It's very toxic.</v>

2861
01:26:16.491 --> 01:26:18.110
<v Speaker 1>It's toxic for the people that are doing it.</v>

2862
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:19.850
<v Speaker 1>It's toxic for the people that are receiving it.</v>

2863
01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:20.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2864
01:26:20.890 --> 01:26:24.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not a way that human beings would ever communicate in one on one.</v>

2865
01:26:24.170 --> 01:26:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2866
01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I tried to communicate with people the same way online as I would have.</v>

2867
01:26:30.441 --> 01:26:31.161
<v Speaker 1>They're right in front of me.</v>

2868
01:26:31.161 --> 01:26:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't always succeed,</v>

2869
01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.073
<v Speaker 1>but I try.</v>

2870
01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:33.913
<v Speaker 1>That's my goal.</v>

2871
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:36.140
<v Speaker 1>My goal is to try to talk to someone as if they were right in front of me.</v>

2872
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:38.610
<v Speaker 1>That's clearly not how everybody's handling.</v>

2873
01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.290
<v Speaker 1>I think road rage is the is the best analogy for what's happening on social</v>

2874
01:26:42.291 --> 01:26:42.690
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

2875
01:26:42.690 --> 01:26:43.550
<v Speaker 1>I've adopted that,</v>

2876
01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:45.260
<v Speaker 1>have adopted that way of looking at it too,</v>

2877
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:47.840
<v Speaker 1>and the only difference is a road rage.</v>

2878
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:48.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2879
01:26:48.081 --> 01:26:51.650
<v Speaker 1>there's like a physiological reason for road rage because you're,</v>

2880
01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:52.160
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2881
01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:55.430
<v Speaker 1>you're in a dangerous situation that you're subliminally taking stock going</v>

2882
01:26:55.431 --> 01:26:56.264
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

2883
01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.750
<v Speaker 1>You're going to a metal machine with a bunch of assholes that are probably</v>

2884
01:26:59.751 --> 01:27:03.080
<v Speaker 1>looking at their phone and everybody's going fast and you could die at any</v>

2885
01:27:03.081 --> 01:27:04.100
<v Speaker 1>moment if someone goes wrong.</v>

2886
01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.810
<v Speaker 1>If you're on a highway like the four,</v>

2887
01:27:05.811 --> 01:27:06.261
<v Speaker 1>oh five,</v>

2888
01:27:06.261 --> 01:27:08.450
<v Speaker 1>when you have five lanes going 70 miles an hour,</v>

2889
01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:11.150
<v Speaker 1>it is a fucking miracle that no one dies.</v>

2890
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:13.070
<v Speaker 1>And everyday we do it every day.</v>

2891
01:27:13.071 --> 01:27:13.904
<v Speaker 1>Everything's fine.</v>

2892
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2893
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:15.651
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2894
01:27:15.651 --> 01:27:20.270
<v Speaker 2>so let's go back to this idea of what the,</v>

2895
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:25.510
<v Speaker 2>the actual normative response would be when somebody puts their foot in their</v>

2896
01:27:25.611 --> 01:27:28.820
<v Speaker 2>mouth or something from their past gets disclosed.</v>

2897
01:27:28.821 --> 01:27:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

2898
01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:29.251
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2899
01:27:29.251 --> 01:27:29.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2900
01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:33.410
<v Speaker 2>the stupid and indefensible thing they did as a teenager,</v>

2901
01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:33.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2902
01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2903
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:35.730
<v Speaker 2>You know this,</v>

2904
01:27:35.890 --> 01:27:36.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2905
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:42.010
<v Speaker 2>you've got these guys who are now having their careers destroyed for having</v>

2906
01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:46.020
<v Speaker 2>dressed up in black face or neck in a,</v>

2907
01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.840
<v Speaker 2>in a hood for Halloween or whatever it was.</v>

2908
01:27:47.841 --> 01:27:48.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2909
01:27:48.031 --> 01:27:48.151
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2910
01:27:48.151 --> 01:27:48.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2911
01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:49.300
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2912
01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:50.133
<v Speaker 2>I think this,</v>

2913
01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:54.180
<v Speaker 2>that one politician said he's not even in the,</v>

2914
01:27:54.181 --> 01:27:54.801
<v Speaker 2>in the photo,</v>

2915
01:27:54.801 --> 01:27:57.590
<v Speaker 2>but the photo was on his yearbook page or like whatever you put on your yearbook</v>

2916
01:27:57.591 --> 01:27:58.371
<v Speaker 2>page in high school,</v>

2917
01:27:58.371 --> 01:27:59.204
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2918
01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.030
<v Speaker 2>You find out this thing that,</v>

2919
01:28:02.031 --> 01:28:03.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2920
01:28:03.081 --> 01:28:04.730
<v Speaker 2>adult is going to defend,</v>

2921
01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:05.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2922
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:07.730
<v Speaker 2>But what is the path back?</v>

2923
01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:07.910
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2924
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:08.181
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

2925
01:28:08.181 --> 01:28:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Like what is the reboot that,</v>

2926
01:28:09.791 --> 01:28:13.370
<v Speaker 2>what that should be acceptable because we don't even know.</v>

2927
01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:14.241
<v Speaker 2>It seems.</v>

2928
01:28:14.241 --> 01:28:15.350
<v Speaker 2>We don't even know what</v>

2929
01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:21.620
<v Speaker 2>could conceivably work to rehabilitate somebody career.</v>

2930
01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.510
<v Speaker 2>And yet on this other side,</v>

2931
01:28:23.511 --> 01:28:28.340
<v Speaker 2>we've got people who again are being let out of prison for murders.</v>

2932
01:28:28.341 --> 01:28:30.080
<v Speaker 2>They admit they committed,</v>

2933
01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:30.471
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2934
01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:31.101
<v Speaker 2>Or rapes,</v>

2935
01:28:31.101 --> 01:28:31.550
<v Speaker 2>they admit,</v>

2936
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:34.760
<v Speaker 2>admit they committed and they're rehabilitated.</v>

2937
01:28:34.761 --> 01:28:35.110
<v Speaker 2>And we did.</v>

2938
01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:35.630
<v Speaker 2>And these are,</v>

2939
01:28:35.630 --> 01:28:37.430
<v Speaker 2>these are stories we're supposed to feel good about,</v>

2940
01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:37.641
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2941
01:28:37.641 --> 01:28:40.070
<v Speaker 2>So we have to figure out how to square this.</v>

2942
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:43.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the left and you know,</v>

2943
01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:44.533
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2944
01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:50.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean the way I've been thinking about it is that it has to be intelligible,</v>

2945
01:28:50.691 --> 01:28:54.290
<v Speaker 2>how you are different from the person who committed that thing.</v>

2946
01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2947
01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:55.573
<v Speaker 2>So like if you,</v>

2948
01:28:55.610 --> 01:29:00.610
<v Speaker 2>if you did something that was let's say legit racist when you were 20 and it was</v>

2949
01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 2>like mark,</v>

2950
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:03.600
<v Speaker 2>Mark Walberg is an example of this.</v>

2951
01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was running around just beating people senseless.</v>

2952
01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2953
01:29:07.530 --> 01:29:10.440
<v Speaker 2>And for avowed racist motives.</v>

2954
01:29:10.441 --> 01:29:13.650
<v Speaker 2>I believe when he was a teenager he would guy lost his eye,</v>

2955
01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:14.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2956
01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:14.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2957
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2958
01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:15.420
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2959
01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:15.750
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2960
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:16.740
<v Speaker 2>and I think that was a,</v>

2961
01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:18.120
<v Speaker 2>I think I was a Vietnamese guy.</v>

2962
01:29:18.121 --> 01:29:19.770
<v Speaker 2>He attacked or uh,</v>

2963
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:24.510
<v Speaker 2>but I mean he was just doing truly indefensible things.</v>

2964
01:29:24.511 --> 01:29:29.511
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't know what sort of know pr moment he has had since or how he's</v>

2965
01:29:29.821 --> 01:29:30.870
<v Speaker 2>apologized for it or.</v>

2966
01:29:30.871 --> 01:29:31.980
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that was a,</v>

2967
01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:33.150
<v Speaker 2>as a very different time.</v>

2968
01:29:33.151 --> 01:29:33.984
<v Speaker 2>I think if it was,</v>

2969
01:29:34.050 --> 01:29:38.550
<v Speaker 2>if all that stuff was being discovered about him now there may be no way back</v>

2970
01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:38.710
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

2971
01:29:38.710 --> 01:29:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Well my problem is with this day and age it could be reignited.</v>

2972
01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Like even though he's apologized for it and even though that it's been</v>

2973
01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:47.933
<v Speaker 2>addressed,</v>

2974
01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:51.720
<v Speaker 2>it absolutely get reignited image just made talking about on your podcast is</v>

2975
01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:52.613
<v Speaker 2>fucking him over.</v>

2976
01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Could.</v>

2977
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2978
01:29:53.371 --> 01:29:58.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean and also people have to recognize that there's some things that you can't</v>

2979
01:29:58.141 --> 01:30:03.141
<v Speaker 2>retroactively instill today's ideas of what constitutes racism on 1985.</v>

2980
01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:10.480
<v Speaker 2>So if you were in high school in 1985 and you dressed up as Mr t that you know,</v>

2981
01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that was racist back then.</v>

2982
01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:13.291
<v Speaker 2>I never did it,</v>

2983
01:30:13.291 --> 01:30:14.700
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if that's racist.</v>

2984
01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Like if you had a bunch of gold chains and you made your hair black and are you</v>

2985
01:30:17.970 --> 01:30:20.040
<v Speaker 2>making you made your face black and gave herself a Mohawk.</v>

2986
01:30:20.041 --> 01:30:20.251
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2987
01:30:20.251 --> 01:30:23.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm Mr t for Halloween and the pictures emerged today.</v>

2988
01:30:24.090 --> 01:30:28.830
<v Speaker 2>What you did when you went door to door when you were 15 or 12 or whatever,</v>

2989
01:30:28.831 --> 01:30:31.320
<v Speaker 2>you were knocking on people's doors and everybody was laughing.</v>

2990
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:34.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh you're Mr. t nobody thought it was racist,</v>

2991
01:30:34.710 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 2>but let's take.</v>

2992
01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:37.230
<v Speaker 2>Let's take the hard case.</v>

2993
01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:39.420
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you were racist,</v>

2994
01:30:39.421 --> 01:30:39.631
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2995
01:30:39.631 --> 01:30:39.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2996
01:30:39.781 --> 01:30:41.920
<v Speaker 2>so like I had this guy is a Christian pitcher,</v>

2997
01:30:41.921 --> 01:30:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Eleni on my podcast once who's an ex neonazis just legit racist,</v>

2998
01:30:46.111 --> 01:30:46.231
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2999
01:30:46.231 --> 01:30:47.880
<v Speaker 2>It's got all the tattoos to prove it.</v>

3000
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:51.200
<v Speaker 2>And now their major problems with Christian pitcher Delaney as,</v>

3001
01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:51.600
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

3002
01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.021
<v Speaker 2>as I think,</v>

3003
01:30:52.021 --> 01:30:52.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3004
01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:53.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3005
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.960
<v Speaker 2>that I discovered after that podcast.</v>

3006
01:30:54.961 --> 01:30:55.630
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3007
01:30:55.630 --> 01:30:56.463
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3008
01:30:56.490 --> 01:30:58.290
<v Speaker 2>so this is not an endorsement of him,</v>

3009
01:30:58.650 --> 01:30:59.011
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

3010
01:30:59.011 --> 01:30:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Christian.</v>

3011
01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:00.653
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

3012
01:31:01.210 --> 01:31:02.043
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3013
01:31:02.050 --> 01:31:02.880
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3014
01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.020
<v Speaker 2>there's a path back.</v>

3015
01:31:04.021 --> 01:31:04.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3016
01:31:04.181 --> 01:31:06.300
<v Speaker 2>it's like he's celebrated on the left,</v>

3017
01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:08.220
<v Speaker 2>like he's a former Neo Nazi and he is,</v>

3018
01:31:08.221 --> 01:31:08.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3019
01:31:08.730 --> 01:31:08.940
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3020
01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:09.460
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3021
01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:14.460
<v Speaker 2>I discovered him on Sarah Silvermans a show on wherever that is,</v>

3022
01:31:14.491 --> 01:31:15.324
<v Speaker 2>Hulu.</v>

3023
01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:16.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3024
01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:18.090
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3025
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3026
01:31:18.571 --> 01:31:19.800
<v Speaker 2>he's a darling of the left,</v>

3027
01:31:19.801 --> 01:31:23.730
<v Speaker 2>right at Darlene of Msnbc for this redemption story.</v>

3028
01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:24.211
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3029
01:31:24.211 --> 01:31:25.800
<v Speaker 2>but what is the,</v>

3030
01:31:25.801 --> 01:31:30.801
<v Speaker 2>you take someone like any of these politicians who have something in their</v>

3031
01:31:30.991 --> 01:31:33.120
<v Speaker 2>backstory that is ugly.</v>

3032
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3033
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:39.590
<v Speaker 2>my feeling is all there has to be is a transparent and intelligible account of</v>

3034
01:31:41.731 --> 01:31:46.200
<v Speaker 2>how you are now different of how you can actually honestly look back on this</v>

3035
01:31:46.201 --> 01:31:47.310
<v Speaker 2>thing and say,</v>

3036
01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:48.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3037
01:31:48.450 --> 01:31:51.390
<v Speaker 2>I am as embarrassed by that as you think I should be.</v>

3038
01:31:51.391 --> 01:31:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3039
01:31:51.670 --> 01:31:52.200
<v Speaker 2>That's not like,</v>

3040
01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:53.400
<v Speaker 2>that is nothing that,</v>

3041
01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:56.640
<v Speaker 2>that does not represent how I view the world at all now.</v>

3042
01:31:58.050 --> 01:32:03.050
<v Speaker 2>But there's just the spirit of the time on social media,</v>

3043
01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:03.731
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3044
01:32:03.731 --> 01:32:08.731
<v Speaker 2>especially on the left and to our total dysfunction politically is to never</v>

3045
01:32:10.121 --> 01:32:11.740
<v Speaker 2>accept any of that.</v>

3046
01:32:11.890 --> 01:32:12.221
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

3047
01:32:12.221 --> 01:32:16.310
<v Speaker 2>there is no apology good enough and um,</v>

3048
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:17.771
<v Speaker 2>or that,</v>

3049
01:32:17.771 --> 01:32:18.290
<v Speaker 2>or there's,</v>

3050
01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:18.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3051
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:22.060
<v Speaker 2>the most cynical possible interpretation of your,</v>

3052
01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:23.260
<v Speaker 2>of your apology.</v>

3053
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:24.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're just trying to,</v>

3054
01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:27.820
<v Speaker 2>you're the only reason why you're apologizing is because you want to save your</v>

3055
01:32:27.821 --> 01:32:28.330
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

3056
01:32:28.330 --> 01:32:29.163
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3057
01:32:29.770 --> 01:32:30.330
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

3058
01:32:30.330 --> 01:32:30.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3059
01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:32.470
<v Speaker 2>we have to figure out how to.</v>

3060
01:32:32.770 --> 01:32:32.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3061
01:32:32.981 --> 01:32:37.981
<v Speaker 2>we just need some recovery disk that we can reboot from here because it's just</v>

3062
01:32:38.651 --> 01:32:39.820
<v Speaker 2>not a,</v>

3063
01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:42.280
<v Speaker 2>this is going someplace terrible.</v>

3064
01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:43.300
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

3065
01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:46.410
<v Speaker 2>to look at it through the Lens narrowly politically of,</v>

3066
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:46.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3067
01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:47.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3068
01:32:47.530 --> 01:32:48.640
<v Speaker 2>over the next two years,</v>

3069
01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:49.670
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3070
01:32:49.670 --> 01:32:51.820
<v Speaker 2>it's to the massive disadvantage of the left.</v>

3071
01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:52.841
<v Speaker 2>It certainly is,</v>

3072
01:32:52.841 --> 01:32:55.330
<v Speaker 2>but I don't see any way to fix that.</v>

3073
01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Like with the current climate and this current attitude where people are</v>

3074
01:32:59.141 --> 01:33:00.970
<v Speaker 2>engaging in this recreational outrage,</v>

3075
01:33:01.150 --> 01:33:02.320
<v Speaker 2>it fits the climate.</v>

3076
01:33:02.830 --> 01:33:03.401
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean,</v>

3077
01:33:03.401 --> 01:33:07.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what would have to happen for people to come to some sort of a</v>

3078
01:33:07.061 --> 01:33:07.894
<v Speaker 2>realization.</v>

3079
01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:10.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would have to happen to them like it did to James.</v>

3080
01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Like what happened with Jamie sees,</v>

3081
01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:14.170
<v Speaker 2>they turned on him and he's like,</v>

3082
01:33:14.171 --> 01:33:14.651
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

3083
01:33:14.651 --> 01:33:15.484
<v Speaker 2>this is awful.</v>

3084
01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:16.320
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm,</v>

3085
01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.153
<v Speaker 2>what's this?</v>

3086
01:33:17.530 --> 01:33:18.610
<v Speaker 2>And then he realized,</v>

3087
01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:18.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3088
01:33:18.851 --> 01:33:19.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3089
01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:22.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what other thing could happen,</v>

3090
01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:24.130
<v Speaker 2>know what we're,</v>

3091
01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.620
<v Speaker 2>the game we're playing is part of it.</v>

3092
01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:26.771
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3093
01:33:26.771 --> 01:33:28.930
<v Speaker 2>you and I are in a position to take risks that,</v>

3094
01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:29.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3095
01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:32.680
<v Speaker 2>even the people at the top of journalism,</v>

3096
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:33.700
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

3097
01:33:33.701 --> 01:33:33.871
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3098
01:33:33.871 --> 01:33:34.040
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3099
01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:36.250
<v Speaker 2>like Megan Kelly says one wrong thing and you know,</v>

3100
01:33:36.251 --> 01:33:38.820
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter that she's got a $20,000,000 contract.</v>

3101
01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:39.341
<v Speaker 2>She's just,</v>

3102
01:33:39.341 --> 01:33:40.174
<v Speaker 2>she's fired.</v>

3103
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:41.303
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3104
01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:43.570
<v Speaker 2>and when you look at the thing that she said,</v>

3105
01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:44.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3106
01:33:44.321 --> 01:33:45.510
<v Speaker 2>it was just a question.</v>

3107
01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:46.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3108
01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:50.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean she just didn't seem to understand how charged the phrase black face was.</v>

3109
01:33:50.770 --> 01:33:51.011
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3110
01:33:51.011 --> 01:33:53.590
<v Speaker 2>She's just ignorant of that piece of history or something.</v>

3111
01:33:53.591 --> 01:33:53.981
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

3112
01:33:53.981 --> 01:33:54.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3113
01:33:54.191 --> 01:33:54.760
<v Speaker 2>so she just,</v>

3114
01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:55.240
<v Speaker 2>she should,</v>

3115
01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:56.260
<v Speaker 2>she put her foot in her mouth.</v>

3116
01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:58.810
<v Speaker 2>She gave an apology that was just like,</v>

3117
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:59.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3118
01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:01.530
<v Speaker 2>full blown hostage video apology,</v>

3119
01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:02.190
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

3120
01:34:02.190 --> 01:34:02.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3121
01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:04.750
<v Speaker 2>just like I'm so fucking sorry.</v>

3122
01:34:04.751 --> 01:34:05.391
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know,</v>

3123
01:34:05.391 --> 01:34:05.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3124
01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:08.250
<v Speaker 2>here take a sample of my blood and you'll just see my task,</v>

3125
01:34:08.290 --> 01:34:10.720
<v Speaker 2>my cortisol and not good enough.</v>

3126
01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Not good enough.</v>

3127
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:16.240
<v Speaker 2>And they let her say the apology is even more crazy.</v>

3128
01:34:16.241 --> 01:34:16.481
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3129
01:34:16.481 --> 01:34:17.470
<v Speaker 2>they let her come back,</v>

3130
01:34:17.471 --> 01:34:18.670
<v Speaker 2>say the apology and then you have good.</v>

3131
01:34:18.671 --> 01:34:19.231
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for doing that.</v>

3132
01:34:19.231 --> 01:34:20.064
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3133
01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:21.671
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3134
01:34:21.671 --> 01:34:22.590
<v Speaker 2>but so she,</v>

3135
01:34:22.810 --> 01:34:27.490
<v Speaker 2>no one's job in that space is secure enough where they can take real risks.</v>

3136
01:34:27.610 --> 01:34:28.190
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3137
01:34:28.190 --> 01:34:29.200
<v Speaker 2>you and I,</v>

3138
01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:30.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3139
01:34:30.191 --> 01:34:32.590
<v Speaker 2>you and I could do an interview with Louis C,</v>

3140
01:34:32.591 --> 01:34:33.430
<v Speaker 2>k right,</v>

3141
01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:33.821
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3142
01:34:33.821 --> 01:34:38.821
<v Speaker 2>and just process his coming back into stand up and do it in a way where people</v>

3143
01:34:40.151 --> 01:34:40.750
<v Speaker 2>didn't like it.</v>

3144
01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:41.201
<v Speaker 2>You just say,</v>

3145
01:34:41.201 --> 01:34:41.441
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3146
01:34:41.441 --> 01:34:42.041
<v Speaker 2>fuck off.</v>

3147
01:34:42.041 --> 01:34:42.281
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3148
01:34:42.281 --> 01:34:47.281
<v Speaker 2>This is the conversation we had and I think modeling that more and more.</v>

3149
01:34:47.471 --> 01:34:47.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3150
01:34:47.571 --> 01:34:48.250
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3151
01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to take those risks and people like us have to take those risks</v>

3152
01:34:52.570 --> 01:34:57.570
<v Speaker 2>and hope to break the spell by having those in public.</v>

3153
01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:01.880
<v Speaker 2>I would hope that we're having some kind of an impact on it.</v>

3154
01:35:01.881 --> 01:35:02.900
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like we're,</v>

3155
01:35:03.710 --> 01:35:04.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3156
01:35:04.071 --> 01:35:08.450
<v Speaker 2>we're throwing buckets of cold water into a volcano.</v>

3157
01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

3158
01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:10.160
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know.</v>

3159
01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:11.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's enough.</v>

3160
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:12.160
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

3161
01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:13.490
<v Speaker 2>we have pretty big buckets.</v>

3162
01:35:13.491 --> 01:35:13.671
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3163
01:35:13.671 --> 01:35:14.810
<v Speaker 2>you have an enormous bucket.</v>

3164
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:15.081
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3165
01:35:15.081 --> 01:35:15.231
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3166
01:35:15.231 --> 01:35:19.850
<v Speaker 2>you're reaching more people than the biggest television shows are reaching.</v>

3167
01:35:19.851 --> 01:35:21.140
<v Speaker 2>People aren't aware of this,</v>

3168
01:35:21.230 --> 01:35:22.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a fact.</v>

3169
01:35:22.521 --> 01:35:23.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

3170
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:23.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3171
01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:24.233
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3172
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:26.390
<v Speaker 2>so I think that's part of it.</v>

3173
01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:31.600
<v Speaker 2>And then changing the norm somehow of how we engage on social media I think is</v>

3174
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:34.490
<v Speaker 2>is another piece.</v>

3175
01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3176
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:35.600
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

3177
01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:36.433
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

3178
01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:40.940
<v Speaker 1>The norm on how we engage on social media I think is flavored by two things.</v>

3179
01:35:40.941 --> 01:35:41.420
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

3180
01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:42.770
<v Speaker 1>the immediacy of it,</v>

3181
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:45.200
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there's no person in front of you,</v>

3182
01:35:45.201 --> 01:35:46.960
<v Speaker 1>you don't experience their,</v>

3183
01:35:46.961 --> 01:35:51.110
<v Speaker 1>their anger or their fear or their sadness when you say something fucked up.</v>

3184
01:35:51.650 --> 01:35:56.650
<v Speaker 1>But also anonymity and I think anonymity is good in a lot of ways.</v>

3185
01:35:57.111 --> 01:35:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Like for whistleblowers,</v>

3186
01:35:58.610 --> 01:36:02.810
<v Speaker 1>people that work in a certain environment where they want to be honest,</v>

3187
01:36:02.811 --> 01:36:04.190
<v Speaker 1>but they would get fired,</v>

3188
01:36:04.630 --> 01:36:04.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3189
01:36:04.930 --> 01:36:06.830
<v Speaker 1>with a very restricted environment.</v>

3190
01:36:06.831 --> 01:36:08.930
<v Speaker 1>But they have maybe a controversial opinion.</v>

3191
01:36:08.931 --> 01:36:09.764
<v Speaker 1>They want to,</v>

3192
01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:12.860
<v Speaker 1>they want to be able to express free speech and they can't.</v>

3193
01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:14.810
<v Speaker 1>They can't unless they do something anonymous.</v>

3194
01:36:14.811 --> 01:36:17.000
<v Speaker 1>And even sometimes people when they do things anonymous,</v>

3195
01:36:17.001 --> 01:36:19.130
<v Speaker 1>they get caught and they get in trouble.</v>

3196
01:36:19.131 --> 01:36:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember there was a guy on four Chan who was,</v>

3197
01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:25.190
<v Speaker 1>who would say a bunch of fucked up things like a lot of people do,</v>

3198
01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:30.440
<v Speaker 1>and people tracked him down and found out who he was and then sent all of these</v>

3199
01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:35.560
<v Speaker 1>anonymously authored posts to his employer and he got fired and this guy was a</v>

3200
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:40.580
<v Speaker 1>father and he had children and he was supporting his family and now he's</v>

3201
01:36:40.581 --> 01:36:41.780
<v Speaker 1>struggling to make a living.</v>

3202
01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:45.560
<v Speaker 1>He's got to try to figure because he wrote some things anonymously online on a</v>

3203
01:36:45.561 --> 01:36:49.670
<v Speaker 1>message board and he found recreation and saying fucked up things,</v>

3204
01:36:50.050 --> 01:36:50.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3205
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3206
01:36:51.531 --> 01:36:53.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the solution is,</v>

3207
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:55.820
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like anonymity,</v>

3208
01:36:56.890 --> 01:37:01.330
<v Speaker 2>it encourages less hospitable behavior.</v>

3209
01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear about the professor at a academic conference?</v>

3210
01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Get into an elevator and making A.</v>

3211
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Just a dad joke of it so he gets it,</v>

3212
01:37:09.521 --> 01:37:14.260
<v Speaker 2>gets into a crowded elevator in an academic conference and someone asked what</v>

3213
01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:15.400
<v Speaker 2>floor and he says,</v>

3214
01:37:15.401 --> 01:37:16.630
<v Speaker 2>women's lingerie please.</v>

3215
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Dean Martin joke or whatever.</v>

3216
01:37:19.001 --> 01:37:19.834
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3217
01:37:19.870 --> 01:37:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Someone in the elevator was so offended by that,</v>

3218
01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:26.250
<v Speaker 2>that they lodge a complaint and I,</v>

3219
01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:26.680
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

3220
01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:27.300
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

3221
01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:30.550
<v Speaker 2>it's been now at least a month or so since I heard the story,</v>

3222
01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:31.810
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know if he was fired,</v>

3223
01:37:31.811 --> 01:37:36.760
<v Speaker 2>but like he was fighting for his academic life over this complaint process.</v>

3224
01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Dean Martin show.</v>

3225
01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:40.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean just like that,</v>

3226
01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:45.540
<v Speaker 2>that in the fullness of time that is going to seem like some insane which panic,</v>

3227
01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:48.791
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3228
01:37:48.791 --> 01:37:52.480
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no such thing as witches and yet people are getting burned alive</v>

3229
01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:54.760
<v Speaker 2>because of the allegations with witchcraft.</v>

3230
01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:58.570
<v Speaker 2>We're in that kind of situation and we,</v>

3231
01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:01.080
<v Speaker 2>we just have to wake up.</v>

3232
01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3233
01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:02.760
<v Speaker 2>And and so,</v>

3234
01:38:03.450 --> 01:38:05.850
<v Speaker 1>well you and I don't teach and we're not in a,</v>

3235
01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.250
<v Speaker 1>in a university and we're not in that bubble.</v>

3236
01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I think the people that are in that bubble than the escape that bubble and go to</v>

3237
01:38:12.210 --> 01:38:14.310
<v Speaker 1>whatever tech company or whatever business,</v>

3238
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:18.990
<v Speaker 1>they continue that same bubble like behavior and they want everybody to</v>

3239
01:38:18.991 --> 01:38:19.680
<v Speaker 1>acquiesce.</v>

3240
01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:23.850
<v Speaker 1>They want everybody around them to behave the way that they've been programmed</v>

3241
01:38:23.851 --> 01:38:25.800
<v Speaker 1>to think that everybody is supposed to behave.</v>

3242
01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:28.470
<v Speaker 1>And you see that now from a lot of young people,</v>

3243
01:38:28.471 --> 01:38:31.810
<v Speaker 1>you see a lot of young people who are entering into the workforce.</v>

3244
01:38:31.811 --> 01:38:36.811
<v Speaker 1>I think that the standards and the norms that they got enforced upon them at</v>

3245
01:38:36.991 --> 01:38:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Yale or Columbia,</v>

3246
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:39.760
<v Speaker 1>wherever they went to school,</v>

3247
01:38:39.761 --> 01:38:41.970
<v Speaker 1>like this is how you're supposed to behave,</v>

3248
01:38:41.971 --> 01:38:46.680
<v Speaker 1>but social justice is important and this is real and you have to recognize your</v>

3249
01:38:46.681 --> 01:38:47.281
<v Speaker 1>privilege.</v>

3250
01:38:47.281 --> 01:38:50.340
<v Speaker 1>You have to check your privilege and you have to do this and you have to do that</v>

3251
01:38:50.341 --> 01:38:52.970
<v Speaker 1>and you have to support trans rights and you have to call out culture.</v>

3252
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Call out culture is a big one.</v>

3253
01:38:54.690 --> 01:38:55.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of it.</v>

3254
01:38:55.771 --> 01:38:56.790
<v Speaker 1>And canceled culture.</v>

3255
01:38:57.220 --> 01:38:57.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3256
01:38:57.990 --> 01:39:00.720
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants everybody to lose their job.</v>

3257
01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:01.210
<v Speaker 1>You want.</v>

3258
01:39:01.210 --> 01:39:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the way that things change.</v>

3259
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:06.450
<v Speaker 1>The way things change is you have to reinforce the fact that there's these new</v>

3260
01:39:06.451 --> 01:39:11.451
<v Speaker 1>standards and it has to be severe repercussions for deviating so very,</v>

3261
01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:12.930
<v Speaker 1>very much about controlling.</v>

3262
01:39:12.931 --> 01:39:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Jordan goes on about this Jordan Peterson.</v>

3263
01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:17.010
<v Speaker 1>That's like one of his pet subjects.</v>

3264
01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Then yeah,</v>

3265
01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:20.790
<v Speaker 1>this is where this goes.</v>

3266
01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:25.500
<v Speaker 1>This is all about control and that it's a very slippery slope and when you start</v>

3267
01:39:25.501 --> 01:39:29.280
<v Speaker 1>telling people what to do and what not to do and that there's these</v>

3268
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:30.630
<v Speaker 1>indefensible,</v>

3269
01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:35.550
<v Speaker 1>undebatable standards that have to be reinforced and you can't talk about it</v>

3270
01:39:35.610 --> 01:39:35.970
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3271
01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:37.290
<v Speaker 1>and that's what happened with Megan Kelly.</v>

3272
01:39:37.530 --> 01:39:37.800
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

3273
01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:38.431
<v Speaker 1>well how come?</v>

3274
01:39:38.431 --> 01:39:38.761
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

3275
01:39:38.761 --> 01:39:40.230
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck Outta here.</v>

3276
01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Sixty dollars million dollar job.</v>

3277
01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:44.201
<v Speaker 2>Again.</v>

3278
01:39:44.201 --> 01:39:45.940
<v Speaker 2>The crucial moment for me is</v>

3279
01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:50.200
<v Speaker 2>why is it that the apology isn't good enough?</v>

3280
01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:53.950
<v Speaker 2>That this isn't what is by all appearances,</v>

3281
01:39:54.010 --> 01:39:55.450
<v Speaker 2>a sincere apology.</v>

3282
01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3283
01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:56.801
<v Speaker 2>like where the link,</v>

3284
01:39:56.801 --> 01:39:59.800
<v Speaker 2>there is no link to real racism.</v>

3285
01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:01.000
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no link to like,</v>

3286
01:40:01.330 --> 01:40:01.781
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

3287
01:40:01.781 --> 01:40:05.080
<v Speaker 2>I want to live in a society where black people have it harder than white people.</v>

3288
01:40:05.110 --> 01:40:05.381
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3289
01:40:05.381 --> 01:40:05.980
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3290
01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:06.251
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3291
01:40:06.251 --> 01:40:06.670
<v Speaker 2>if that,</v>

3292
01:40:06.670 --> 01:40:07.361
<v Speaker 2>if that's who you are,</v>

3293
01:40:07.361 --> 01:40:12.361
<v Speaker 2>if you're racist will then find we know we can understand why we want to boycott</v>

3294
01:40:12.491 --> 01:40:13.570
<v Speaker 2>your business or we want to,</v>

3295
01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:14.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3296
01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:16.060
<v Speaker 2>you want nothing to do with you.</v>

3297
01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:16.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3298
01:40:16.490 --> 01:40:18.280
<v Speaker 2>There should be massive.</v>

3299
01:40:18.281 --> 01:40:22.870
<v Speaker 2>So social pressure against those kinds of noxious political commitments.</v>

3300
01:40:23.290 --> 01:40:27.040
<v Speaker 2>But if someone misspeaks or it's an off color joke and they were,</v>

3301
01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:29.740
<v Speaker 2>it was like they weren't trying to offend anyone and they're just,</v>

3302
01:40:30.370 --> 01:40:30.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3303
01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:32.620
<v Speaker 2>they wish they could take it back and like,</v>

3304
01:40:32.621 --> 01:40:32.821
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3305
01:40:32.821 --> 01:40:33.230
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3306
01:40:33.230 --> 01:40:34.540
<v Speaker 2>and that links up with,</v>

3307
01:40:34.930 --> 01:40:35.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3308
01:40:35.141 --> 01:40:38.860
<v Speaker 2>did you say you must've seen the norm macdonald?</v>

3309
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3310
01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was brutal,</v>

3311
01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:41.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3312
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Like it's at what he was,</v>

3313
01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:43.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3314
01:40:43.630 --> 01:40:46.390
<v Speaker 2>he knew he couldn't use the word retard.</v>

3315
01:40:46.391 --> 01:40:46.691
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3316
01:40:46.691 --> 01:40:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Because it's like that that's going to get them in trouble.</v>

3317
01:40:49.090 --> 01:40:49.923
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3318
01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:51.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3319
01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:52.240
<v Speaker 2>it's hilarious.</v>

3320
01:40:52.241 --> 01:40:53.074
<v Speaker 2>And explain what.</v>

3321
01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:53.441
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3322
01:40:53.441 --> 01:40:54.090
<v Speaker 2>So he was,</v>

3323
01:40:54.090 --> 01:40:55.210
<v Speaker 2>he was on Howard stern show,</v>

3324
01:40:55.211 --> 01:40:55.690
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>

3325
01:40:55.690 --> 01:40:56.290
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3326
01:40:56.290 --> 01:40:57.123
<v Speaker 2>I think he was,</v>

3327
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:58.810
<v Speaker 2>I could have this wrong,</v>

3328
01:40:58.811 --> 01:41:00.790
<v Speaker 2>but the gist of this is his right,</v>

3329
01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:06.480
<v Speaker 2>I believe is on the Howard stern show and he was about to use the word retard.</v>

3330
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.820
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3331
01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:08.290
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

3332
01:41:08.290 --> 01:41:08.930
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3333
01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:10.040
<v Speaker 2>we'll walk this back now.</v>

3334
01:41:10.110 --> 01:41:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Now it's coming back to me.</v>

3335
01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:14.690
<v Speaker 2>He was defense.</v>

3336
01:41:14.710 --> 01:41:17.900
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about his friend that the,</v>

3337
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:18.060
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3338
01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:22.870
<v Speaker 2>the ordeal that Louis Ck has gone through in this just massive exile experience,</v>

3339
01:41:22.871 --> 01:41:23.051
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3340
01:41:23.051 --> 01:41:23.290
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3341
01:41:23.290 --> 01:41:26.230
<v Speaker 2>there's massive social shunning a.</v>

3342
01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:28.230
<v Speaker 2>and he said he,</v>

3343
01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.690
<v Speaker 2>he was describing it in a way where it,</v>

3344
01:41:31.090 --> 01:41:33.880
<v Speaker 2>he then got accused that he was,</v>

3345
01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:36.490
<v Speaker 2>he cared more about what Lucy Kay was going through,</v>

3346
01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:39.790
<v Speaker 2>then the women who felt very victimized by Louis C K,</v>

3347
01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:43.720
<v Speaker 2>and that was not his intention at all apparently.</v>

3348
01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:44.590
<v Speaker 2>And so when he went to,</v>

3349
01:41:44.591 --> 01:41:44.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3350
01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:46.060
<v Speaker 2>to clarify this,</v>

3351
01:41:46.570 --> 01:41:47.870
<v Speaker 2>he was about to say,</v>

3352
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:48.170
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3353
01:41:48.170 --> 01:41:53.170
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be retarded to think that I cared more about Louis Ck is ordeal</v>

3354
01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:57.220
<v Speaker 2>than the ordeal of these women who had felt that their careers got derailed.</v>

3355
01:41:57.221 --> 01:41:58.054
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3356
01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:02.050
<v Speaker 2>But as the word retard was coming or retarded was coming out of his mouth,</v>

3357
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:05.860
<v Speaker 2>he tried to course correct and because he doesn't know what the fuck he's</v>

3358
01:42:05.861 --> 01:42:06.401
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

3359
01:42:06.401 --> 01:42:08.560
<v Speaker 2>he says you'd have to have downs syndrome,</v>

3360
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3361
01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:10.421
<v Speaker 2>Which is worse,</v>

3362
01:42:10.421 --> 01:42:10.661
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3363
01:42:10.661 --> 01:42:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Is more specific and it's what it's like.</v>

3364
01:42:12.341 --> 01:42:14.000
<v Speaker 2>And then you got all these parents with Down's syndrome who,</v>

3365
01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:14.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3366
01:42:14.590 --> 01:42:15.910
<v Speaker 2>who have kids with down syndrome who are just,</v>

3367
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:17.103
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3368
01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:19.600
<v Speaker 2>And so now he's just,</v>

3369
01:42:19.670 --> 01:42:20.440
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>

3370
01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Then he was,</v>

3371
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:22.330
<v Speaker 2>he showed up on the view,</v>

3372
01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:23.290
<v Speaker 2>right with this,</v>

3373
01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:24.300
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3374
01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:25.133
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3375
01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:27.250
<v Speaker 2>on this apology tour.</v>

3376
01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:28.240
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

3377
01:42:28.241 --> 01:42:31.990
<v Speaker 2>that's just amazing video to see him on the view surrounded by these,</v>

3378
01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:35.260
<v Speaker 2>these four women who know he's not a bad guy,</v>

3379
01:42:35.261 --> 01:42:35.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3380
01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Like they're trying,</v>

3381
01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:39.280
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to just throwing them a lifeline after lifeline and he's so</v>

3382
01:42:39.281 --> 01:42:44.230
<v Speaker 2>beaten down and he's so walking on eggshells and you got Whoopi Goldberg,</v>

3383
01:42:44.231 --> 01:42:44.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3384
01:42:44.381 --> 01:42:46.630
<v Speaker 2>trying to just pull him back,</v>

3385
01:42:46.631 --> 01:42:46.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3386
01:42:46.841 --> 01:42:48.670
<v Speaker 2>from the lions.</v>

3387
01:42:49.150 --> 01:42:49.983
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

3388
01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:52.713
<v Speaker 2>it should be.</v>

3389
01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:53.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3390
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:56.960
<v Speaker 2>it should be so straightforward like it does it.</v>

3391
01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Is it part of norms,</v>

3392
01:42:58.930 --> 01:43:03.930
<v Speaker 2>goal to cause pain for parents who have kids with mental disabilities,</v>

3393
01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:05.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3394
01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:06.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3395
01:43:06.370 --> 01:43:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3396
01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:07.210
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3397
01:43:07.210 --> 01:43:08.070
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

3398
01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:09.390
<v Speaker 2>you can look in,</v>

3399
01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:14.400
<v Speaker 2>you can look into this guy's eyes for t for 10 seconds and know that this is not</v>

3400
01:43:14.531 --> 01:43:15.640
<v Speaker 2>the biggest you're worried about.</v>

3401
01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

3402
01:43:16.750 --> 01:43:17.530
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3403
01:43:17.530 --> 01:43:19.000
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3404
01:43:20.230 --> 01:43:22.560
<v Speaker 2>and yet people just want him destroyed overnight.</v>

3405
01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they still do,</v>

3406
01:43:23.471 --> 01:43:25.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's like the moment where it was,</v>

3407
01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.460
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

3408
01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:27.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3409
01:43:27.730 --> 01:43:30.550
<v Speaker 2>a real concern that has his show would get canceled.</v>

3410
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.701
<v Speaker 2>I me,</v>

3411
01:43:30.701 --> 01:43:31.600
<v Speaker 2>like this was a while.</v>

3412
01:43:31.610 --> 01:43:35.950
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't been for a second season and maybe that's maybe that's part of the</v>

3413
01:43:35.951 --> 01:43:36.720
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

3414
01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:37.553
<v Speaker 2>It is part of the problem.</v>

3415
01:43:37.570 --> 01:43:37.860
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

3416
01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:38.830
<v Speaker 2>he was devastated.</v>

3417
01:43:38.831 --> 01:43:39.664
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>

3418
01:43:39.730 --> 01:43:41.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm very good friends with Adam Egan.</v>

3419
01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:42.690
<v Speaker 2>He's a guy that runs the comedy store,</v>

3420
01:43:42.691 --> 01:43:46.720
<v Speaker 2>is the talent director at the comedy store and he's been on norm show.</v>

3421
01:43:46.721 --> 01:43:48.010
<v Speaker 2>He was on norms.</v>

3422
01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:49.570
<v Speaker 2>He was like norm sidekick on the show.</v>

3423
01:43:49.571 --> 01:43:54.230
<v Speaker 2>He's a very good friend with nora and norm really suffered from this in a way</v>

3424
01:43:54.231 --> 01:43:57.260
<v Speaker 2>that he never saw anything in his career in terms of like his own personal</v>

3425
01:43:57.261 --> 01:43:58.050
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>

3426
01:43:58.050 --> 01:43:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Like he was devastated by it,</v>

3427
01:43:59.271 --> 01:44:03.110
<v Speaker 2>by the blow back and the reaction and he wanted to come on my podcast and talk</v>

3428
01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:03.471
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

3429
01:44:03.471 --> 01:44:04.370
<v Speaker 2>But netflix is like,</v>

3430
01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:07.880
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck that's like said no press.</v>

3431
01:44:07.881 --> 01:44:08.631
<v Speaker 2>Don't do anything.</v>

3432
01:44:08.631 --> 01:44:09.290
<v Speaker 2>No press.</v>

3433
01:44:09.290 --> 01:44:09.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3434
01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:13.190
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that you can't talk your way out of.</v>

3435
01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:13.670
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3436
01:44:13.670 --> 01:44:15.050
<v Speaker 2>that's the fucking disease.</v>

3437
01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:15.231
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3438
01:44:15.231 --> 01:44:17.360
<v Speaker 2>the problem is not that you can't talk your way out of it.</v>

3439
01:44:17.361 --> 01:44:20.060
<v Speaker 2>The problem was that they wouldn't even let him attempt to talk your way out of</v>

3440
01:44:20.061 --> 01:44:23.960
<v Speaker 2>it because they think they realized that norms a maniac and norm is a maniac in</v>

3441
01:44:23.961 --> 01:44:27.530
<v Speaker 2>the best sense of the word is one of my favorite comics and he's fucking</v>

3442
01:44:27.531 --> 01:44:28.070
<v Speaker 2>hilarious,</v>

3443
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:30.960
<v Speaker 2>but he's also completely crazy in the best way possible.</v>

3444
01:44:31.010 --> 01:44:31.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3445
01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:31.641
<v Speaker 2>Norman?</v>

3446
01:44:31.641 --> 01:44:36.530
<v Speaker 2>I randomly in some strange way randomly were seated next to each other on two</v>

3447
01:44:36.531 --> 01:44:37.364
<v Speaker 2>separate flights.</v>

3448
01:44:37.410 --> 01:44:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3449
01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:38.690
<v Speaker 2>just randomly skirt.</v>

3450
01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:39.613
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

3451
01:44:39.650 --> 01:44:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Like nor have again,</v>

3452
01:44:40.611 --> 01:44:44.960
<v Speaker 2>like this is crazy and we had a great time just talking to the entire flight and</v>

3453
01:44:46.170 --> 01:44:48.350
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about cigarettes longer,</v>

3454
01:44:48.351 --> 01:44:48.471
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3455
01:44:48.471 --> 01:44:48.851
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3456
01:44:48.851 --> 01:44:49.181
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3457
01:44:49.181 --> 01:44:49.341
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3458
01:44:49.341 --> 01:44:50.091
<v Speaker 2>I used to smoke.</v>

3459
01:44:50.091 --> 01:44:50.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad I quit.</v>

3460
01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Fucking terrible for you.</v>

3461
01:44:52.411 --> 01:44:53.000
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3462
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:53.833
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just.</v>

3463
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:56.810
<v Speaker 2>But I just always wanted a cigarette and then it'd be gambling.</v>

3464
01:44:56.811 --> 01:44:57.620
<v Speaker 2>I want a cigarette,</v>

3465
01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:58.251
<v Speaker 2>but I quit.</v>

3466
01:44:58.251 --> 01:44:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

3467
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:59.181
<v Speaker 2>fuck cigarettes.</v>

3468
01:44:59.181 --> 01:44:59.991
<v Speaker 2>Like how long did you quit?</v>

3469
01:44:59.991 --> 01:45:00.530
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

3470
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:00.890
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3471
01:45:00.890 --> 01:45:02.330
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had a cigarette in years.</v>

3472
01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:02.811
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3473
01:45:02.811 --> 01:45:02.931
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3474
01:45:02.931 --> 01:45:03.650
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

3475
01:45:03.650 --> 01:45:04.970
<v Speaker 2>We landed lax.</v>

3476
01:45:04.971 --> 01:45:06.740
<v Speaker 2>He goes right into a store and buy cigarettes.</v>

3477
01:45:06.741 --> 01:45:06.951
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3478
01:45:06.951 --> 01:45:07.731
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

3479
01:45:07.731 --> 01:45:09.170
<v Speaker 2>He goes all that talk of cigarettes.</v>

3480
01:45:09.171 --> 01:45:10.004
<v Speaker 2>I just want one now.</v>

3481
01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:12.530
<v Speaker 2>He was lighting it on the way out the door.</v>

3482
01:45:12.531 --> 01:45:13.760
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't get out the door.</v>

3483
01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:17.030
<v Speaker 2>He lit it before he the the automatic door.</v>

3484
01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:18.710
<v Speaker 2>He was before it was opening.</v>

3485
01:45:18.711 --> 01:45:19.880
<v Speaker 2>He was lighting that cigarette.</v>

3486
01:45:20.130 --> 01:45:20.511
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3487
01:45:20.511 --> 01:45:21.344
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy.</v>

3488
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:22.880
<v Speaker 2>But that's many.</v>

3489
01:45:22.881 --> 01:45:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Many comedians are incredibly impulsive and this is norm.</v>

3490
01:45:25.881 --> 01:45:26.714
<v Speaker 2>I mean he just.</v>

3491
01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:27.770
<v Speaker 2>He's got such a.</v>

3492
01:45:27.770 --> 01:45:29.150
<v Speaker 2>he's so off kilter.</v>

3493
01:45:29.151 --> 01:45:32.780
<v Speaker 2>He's got a sort of Garry shandling and like you don't know what's going to come</v>

3494
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:34.240
<v Speaker 2>out of his mouth extemporaneously.</v>

3495
01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3496
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:35.930
<v Speaker 2>but okay.</v>

3497
01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:37.610
<v Speaker 2>We have to be.</v>

3498
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Let's put this back into the diversity Olympics.</v>

3499
01:45:41.571 --> 01:45:44.960
<v Speaker 2>We need some respect for neuro diversity.</v>

3500
01:45:45.210 --> 01:45:45.441
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3501
01:45:45.441 --> 01:45:49.370
<v Speaker 2>There are people who are somewhere on the spectrum toward autism,</v>

3502
01:45:49.371 --> 01:45:49.581
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3503
01:45:49.581 --> 01:45:52.400
<v Speaker 2>There's people who are that there's spectrums we don't even know about.</v>

3504
01:45:52.590 --> 01:45:57.590
<v Speaker 2>We haven't named for sure and everyone is in some weird spot and people</v>

3505
01:45:58.860 --> 01:45:59.630
<v Speaker 2>misspeak.</v>

3506
01:45:59.630 --> 01:46:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3507
01:46:00.110 --> 01:46:02.300
<v Speaker 2>There has to be a way back to say,</v>

3508
01:46:02.630 --> 01:46:03.620
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I meant.</v>

3509
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:04.101
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3510
01:46:04.101 --> 01:46:04.281
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3511
01:46:04.281 --> 01:46:09.281
<v Speaker 2>like this is like offending people of this type was not my intention.</v>

3512
01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:13.820
<v Speaker 2>At some level that has to be good enough.</v>

3513
01:46:13.821 --> 01:46:14.301
<v Speaker 2>Unless,</v>

3514
01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:14.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3515
01:46:14.690 --> 01:46:18.290
<v Speaker 2>we open your closet and we see that you've got swastikas everywhere,</v>

3516
01:46:18.291 --> 01:46:19.124
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3517
01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:20.650
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

3518
01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:23.540
<v Speaker 2>so I think we have to,</v>

3519
01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:26.090
<v Speaker 2>we have to hold the line here,</v>

3520
01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:26.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3521
01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:30.230
<v Speaker 2>and very few people are in a position to be able to do it.</v>

3522
01:46:30.231 --> 01:46:30.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's like,</v>

3523
01:46:30.930 --> 01:46:31.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3524
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Netflix,</v>

3525
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Netflix doesn't feel they can do it.</v>

3526
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:35.031
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3527
01:46:35.031 --> 01:46:40.031
<v Speaker 2>Netflix is just so terrified of continual blowback and they just thought like,</v>

3528
01:46:40.041 --> 01:46:41.210
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to save this show,</v>

3529
01:46:41.211 --> 01:46:44.240
<v Speaker 2>the way to save it is to get them to stop talking because he's just going to</v>

3530
01:46:44.241 --> 01:46:46.730
<v Speaker 2>just take his other foot and take other people's feet and stuff.</v>

3531
01:46:46.731 --> 01:46:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Them and his mouth as well.</v>

3532
01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 2>I think one thing that help</v>

3533
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:55.070
<v Speaker 1>to illuminate our understanding of how people behave is what you really enjoy</v>

3534
01:46:55.081 --> 01:47:00.081
<v Speaker 1>talking about and you really definitely changed my way of looking at things that</v>

3535
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:00.781
<v Speaker 1>they're really.</v>

3536
01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Essentially the concept of free will is a very flawed thing and that you have to</v>

3537
01:47:05.311 --> 01:47:08.940
<v Speaker 1>really take into consideration who a person is right now and what what has</v>

3538
01:47:08.941 --> 01:47:13.350
<v Speaker 1>caused them to be this person right now and that a lot of us are operating on</v>

3539
01:47:13.351 --> 01:47:18.351
<v Speaker 1>this really bizarre momentum of of our past and our behavior and our genetics</v>

3540
01:47:18.541 --> 01:47:21.780
<v Speaker 1>and life experiences and all these different variables that really need to be</v>

3541
01:47:21.781 --> 01:47:22.620
<v Speaker 1>taken into account.</v>

3542
01:47:22.621 --> 01:47:26.970
<v Speaker 1>This idea that you are autonomous and you are the director of your own life is</v>

3543
01:47:26.971 --> 01:47:28.200
<v Speaker 1>true to a certain extent,</v>

3544
01:47:28.590 --> 01:47:30.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's also very complicated,</v>

3545
01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:34.890
<v Speaker 1>much more complicated than we would like to admit and when you're talking about</v>

3546
01:47:34.891 --> 01:47:37.110
<v Speaker 1>something that happened when you were 17,</v>

3547
01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:39.060
<v Speaker 1>like Brett kavanaugh or something like that,</v>

3548
01:47:39.550 --> 01:47:40.830
<v Speaker 1>but Jesus Christ,</v>

3549
01:47:40.831 --> 01:47:42.120
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to hold a 55,</v>

3550
01:47:42.570 --> 01:47:45.660
<v Speaker 1>55 year old man accountable to something that he did when he was 17.</v>

3551
01:47:45.661 --> 01:47:49.110
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a crime and you're not exactly sure what happened.</v>

3552
01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:49.451
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

3553
01:47:49.451 --> 01:47:50.880
<v Speaker 1>This is all very strange.</v>

3554
01:47:50.881 --> 01:47:52.020
<v Speaker 1>This is a very strange stuff.</v>

3555
01:47:52.190 --> 01:47:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3556
01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:57.520
<v Speaker 2>so taking the red pill on on freewill makes you much more forgiving of a lot of</v>

3557
01:48:02.151 --> 01:48:06.380
<v Speaker 2>this stuff because you see just everyone is an open system.</v>

3558
01:48:07.850 --> 01:48:09.680
<v Speaker 2>No one offered themselves,</v>

3559
01:48:09.810 --> 01:48:11.660
<v Speaker 2>no one created the themselves,</v>

3560
01:48:11.661 --> 01:48:12.494
<v Speaker 2>no one,</v>

3561
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:17.950
<v Speaker 2>no one can directly regulate the effect of every influence that they had or</v>

3562
01:48:19.011 --> 01:48:19.641
<v Speaker 2>didn't have.</v>

3563
01:48:19.641 --> 01:48:19.791
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3564
01:48:19.791 --> 01:48:20.071
<v Speaker 2>it's like you,</v>

3565
01:48:20.071 --> 01:48:24.860
<v Speaker 2>you are the totality of what brought you here.</v>

3566
01:48:24.861 --> 01:48:25.041
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3567
01:48:25.041 --> 01:48:29.600
<v Speaker 2>the universe has sort of just pushed you to this point in time and the only</v>

3568
01:48:29.601 --> 01:48:34.601
<v Speaker 2>thing you've got is your brain and it states and that is,</v>

3569
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:38.960
<v Speaker 2>that is based on your genes and the totality of environmental influences.</v>

3570
01:48:38.961 --> 01:48:39.340
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3571
01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:39.650
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3572
01:48:39.650 --> 01:48:41.150
<v Speaker 2>you had a system have,</v>

3573
01:48:41.210 --> 01:48:45.500
<v Speaker 2>have had working on you up until this moment.</v>

3574
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:50.000
<v Speaker 2>And so the next words that come out of your mouth are part of that process.</v>

3575
01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Now the peep.</v>

3576
01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:53.840
<v Speaker 2>Some people find this to be,</v>

3577
01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:54.713
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3578
01:48:55.010 --> 01:48:55.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3579
01:48:55.250 --> 01:48:56.083
<v Speaker 2>frankly</v>

3580
01:48:57.380 --> 01:48:59.260
<v Speaker 2>demoralizing picture or they think,</v>

3581
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.391
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3582
01:48:59.391 --> 01:48:59.601
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3583
01:48:59.601 --> 01:48:59.841
<v Speaker 2>well I'm,</v>

3584
01:48:59.841 --> 01:49:00.410
<v Speaker 2>you're telling me,</v>

3585
01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:01.460
<v Speaker 2>telling me I'm just a robot,</v>

3586
01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:04.700
<v Speaker 2>but you're a robot that is open,</v>

3587
01:49:04.701 --> 01:49:07.010
<v Speaker 2>continuously open to influence,</v>

3588
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:10.880
<v Speaker 2>to influence of either internally based on its own processes.</v>

3589
01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:11.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3590
01:49:11.031 --> 01:49:15.590
<v Speaker 2>there's like there's top down control of the executive function in the brain to</v>

3591
01:49:16.010 --> 01:49:16.341
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3592
01:49:16.341 --> 01:49:16.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3593
01:49:16.581 --> 01:49:17.570
<v Speaker 2>your emotional life,</v>

3594
01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:18.620
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3595
01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:23.300
<v Speaker 2>and you're continually open to the influences of culture,</v>

3596
01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:23.691
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3597
01:49:23.691 --> 01:49:23.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3598
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:27.740
<v Speaker 2>the cultures as operating system that you're interacting with in each moment and</v>

3599
01:49:28.610 --> 01:49:32.410
<v Speaker 2>whatever's getting in can change you in radical ways very quickly.</v>

3600
01:49:32.411 --> 01:49:37.190
<v Speaker 2>And there's no telling how much you can change on the basis of one new idea</v>

3601
01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:39.470
<v Speaker 2>coming your way right now.</v>

3602
01:49:39.471 --> 01:49:41.630
<v Speaker 2>I would argue that that process of change,</v>

3603
01:49:41.631 --> 01:49:41.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3604
01:49:41.781 --> 01:49:46.781
<v Speaker 2>if I say something that changes your view on anything that's not evidence of</v>

3605
01:49:47.590 --> 01:49:49.960
<v Speaker 2>that is evidence of just yet more causality.</v>

3606
01:49:49.961 --> 01:49:50.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3607
01:49:50.171 --> 01:49:50.620
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

3608
01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:52.330
<v Speaker 2>you don't pick the changes that come your way.</v>

3609
01:49:52.331 --> 01:49:52.571
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>

3610
01:49:52.571 --> 01:49:55.810
<v Speaker 2>if I get you to see something that you didn't see a moment before,</v>

3611
01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:59.560
<v Speaker 2>you're not responsible for the fact that you didn't see it a moment before and</v>

3612
01:49:59.561 --> 01:50:02.140
<v Speaker 2>you're not responsible for the fact that you now see it is just like the</v>

3613
01:50:02.141 --> 01:50:03.580
<v Speaker 2>dominoes just kept falling,</v>

3614
01:50:03.710 --> 01:50:04.543
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3615
01:50:04.690 --> 01:50:05.523
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3616
01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:10.800
<v Speaker 2>but it does give you this far more patient sense of,</v>

3617
01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:13.433
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3618
01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:15.371
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

3619
01:50:15.371 --> 01:50:15.720
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

3620
01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:16.120
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

3621
01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:16.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3622
01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:20.580
<v Speaker 2>all the causes and conditions that have created the,</v>

3623
01:50:20.590 --> 01:50:21.340
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3624
01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:22.540
<v Speaker 2>this ods behavior.</v>

3625
01:50:22.541 --> 01:50:22.721
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

3626
01:50:22.721 --> 01:50:23.010
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3627
01:50:23.010 --> 01:50:25.600
<v Speaker 2>you're now disposed to react to in the world,</v>

3628
01:50:25.601 --> 01:50:25.751
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3629
01:50:25.751 --> 01:50:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3630
01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:28.800
<v Speaker 2>like you can everything on some level is,</v>

3631
01:50:28.801 --> 01:50:32.200
<v Speaker 2>is more of a force of nature than it is something that you need to take</v>

3632
01:50:32.201 --> 01:50:32.711
<v Speaker 2>personally.</v>

3633
01:50:32.711 --> 01:50:34.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like if there's a hurricane blowing outside,</v>

3634
01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:39.070
<v Speaker 2>we don't respond to it the same way we would respond to,</v>

3635
01:50:39.690 --> 01:50:40.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3636
01:50:40.210 --> 01:50:42.400
<v Speaker 2>al Qaeda dropping a bomb on us,</v>

3637
01:50:42.401 --> 01:50:42.581
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3638
01:50:42.581 --> 01:50:42.921
<v Speaker 2>Because it might,</v>

3639
01:50:42.921 --> 01:50:44.710
<v Speaker 2>it might create the same amount of damage.</v>

3640
01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:46.180
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

3641
01:50:46.350 --> 01:50:46.961
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

3642
01:50:46.961 --> 01:50:51.130
<v Speaker 2>in the latter case where we have an identifiable identifiable agent,</v>

3643
01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:52.293
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3644
01:50:52.630 --> 01:50:53.530
<v Speaker 2>We feel like,</v>

3645
01:50:53.531 --> 01:50:53.741
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3646
01:50:53.741 --> 01:50:56.920
<v Speaker 2>now we're in the presence of human evil and we have to go kill these</v>

3647
01:50:56.921 --> 01:50:59.020
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers right now we may have to kill them.</v>

3648
01:50:59.110 --> 01:50:59.351
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3649
01:50:59.351 --> 01:51:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Because that may be the only way of,</v>

3650
01:51:00.721 --> 01:51:01.000
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3651
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:01.990
<v Speaker 2>of putting out this,</v>

3652
01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:02.973
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3653
01:51:03.090 --> 01:51:03.923
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3654
01:51:04.330 --> 01:51:06.430
<v Speaker 2>stopping the damage there.</v>

3655
01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:07.720
<v Speaker 2>They're committed to causing.</v>

3656
01:51:07.721 --> 01:51:08.530
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3657
01:51:08.530 --> 01:51:10.690
<v Speaker 2>and we would kill hurricanes if we could kill them.</v>

3658
01:51:10.691 --> 01:51:10.931
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3659
01:51:10.931 --> 01:51:11.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3660
01:51:11.111 --> 01:51:11.350
<v Speaker 2>we would,</v>

3661
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3662
01:51:11.591 --> 01:51:13.420
<v Speaker 2>we would nullify them,</v>

3663
01:51:13.421 --> 01:51:16.540
<v Speaker 2>but the feeling we have in both cases is very different.</v>

3664
01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:21.660
<v Speaker 2>The feeling you have attributing ultimate authorship to a person's behavior is</v>

3665
01:51:22.721 --> 01:51:27.721
<v Speaker 2>super a narrow a psychologically and ethically,</v>

3666
01:51:28.271 --> 01:51:29.104
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

3667
01:51:29.590 --> 01:51:30.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3668
01:51:30.130 --> 01:51:31.360
<v Speaker 2>the feeling of vengeance,</v>

3669
01:51:31.570 --> 01:51:31.841
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3670
01:51:31.841 --> 01:51:32.021
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3671
01:51:32.021 --> 01:51:32.441
<v Speaker 2>like you don't,</v>

3672
01:51:32.441 --> 01:51:32.901
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3673
01:51:32.901 --> 01:51:33.560
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

3674
01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:38.530
<v Speaker 2>you have this feeling of vengeance is so natural to get triggered in response to</v>

3675
01:51:38.531 --> 01:51:39.364
<v Speaker 2>a person.</v>

3676
01:51:39.850 --> 01:51:43.420
<v Speaker 2>It's not natural in response to a wild animal who may have done something</v>

3677
01:51:43.421 --> 01:51:43.960
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

3678
01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:44.171
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3679
01:51:44.171 --> 01:51:45.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean like you would like.</v>

3680
01:51:45.730 --> 01:51:50.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean there have been examples of this where people have taken vengeance on</v>

3681
01:51:50.141 --> 01:51:55.141
<v Speaker 2>animals and it just looks like a kind of moral dysfunction on the part of the</v>

3682
01:51:55.721 --> 01:51:56.230
<v Speaker 2>people that did it.</v>

3683
01:51:56.230 --> 01:51:56.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3684
01:51:56.351 --> 01:51:57.520
<v Speaker 2>there's a famous picture of a,</v>

3685
01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:01.720
<v Speaker 2>an elephant that got hung from a railroad crane I think back in the twenties.</v>

3686
01:52:01.721 --> 01:52:01.871
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3687
01:52:01.871 --> 01:52:05.290
<v Speaker 2>So like the circus elephant escaped and it ran,</v>

3688
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:06.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3689
01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:10.220
<v Speaker 2>rampage through the streets and trampled by a few people and the,</v>

3690
01:52:10.370 --> 01:52:11.171
<v Speaker 2>and the people in the,</v>

3691
01:52:11.171 --> 01:52:11.801
<v Speaker 2>in the town.</v>

3692
01:52:11.801 --> 01:52:12.571
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where this was,</v>

3693
01:52:12.571 --> 01:52:17.530
<v Speaker 2>it was a baltimore or someplace were so outraged that they've decided to lynch</v>

3694
01:52:17.531 --> 01:52:18.230
<v Speaker 2>the elephant,</v>

3695
01:52:18.230 --> 01:52:18.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3696
01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3697
01:52:19.210 --> 01:52:21.160
<v Speaker 2>and yet that's,</v>

3698
01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:24.760
<v Speaker 2>there's something uncanny about that sort of misappropriation of agency to an</v>

3699
01:52:24.761 --> 01:52:25.331
<v Speaker 2>elephant and what,</v>

3700
01:52:25.331 --> 01:52:25.900
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

3701
01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:29.800
<v Speaker 2>what is a mistreated circus elephant gonna do when he gets out and is terrified</v>

3702
01:52:29.801 --> 01:52:30.850
<v Speaker 2>and he's trying to get away from people,</v>

3703
01:52:30.851 --> 01:52:31.960
<v Speaker 2>it's going to trample a few people.</v>

3704
01:52:32.770 --> 01:52:37.770
<v Speaker 2>So we have a very different set of books we keep ethically for humans and by</v>

3705
01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:42.040
<v Speaker 2>some of it's understandable,</v>

3706
01:52:42.041 --> 01:52:43.150
<v Speaker 2>some of it's inevitable,</v>

3707
01:52:43.210 --> 01:52:47.450
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it gives us moral that we don't need to have and it gives a,</v>

3708
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:48.590
<v Speaker 2>it gives us a kind of</v>

3709
01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:53.540
<v Speaker 2>just an inability to take stock of all the variables that are actually guiding</v>

3710
01:52:53.541 --> 01:52:58.340
<v Speaker 2>human behavior and react to them and mitigate them and disincentivize them</v>

3711
01:52:58.341 --> 01:52:59.174
<v Speaker 2>intelligently.</v>

3712
01:52:59.330 --> 01:53:00.081
<v Speaker 2>Made punishment.</v>

3713
01:53:00.081 --> 01:53:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>

3714
01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:03.560
<v Speaker 2>Not because people really,</v>

3715
01:53:03.561 --> 01:53:07.010
<v Speaker 2>really deserve at bottom whatever their punishments are.</v>

3716
01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:08.750
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense in a,</v>

3717
01:53:08.751 --> 01:53:09.584
<v Speaker 2>in a retro,</v>

3718
01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:10.760
<v Speaker 2>retributive paradigm.</v>

3719
01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:13.410
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense if it,</v>

3720
01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:18.580
<v Speaker 2>if it's the best tool to discourage dangerous behavior,</v>

3721
01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:20.573
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3722
01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:22.310
<v Speaker 2>and it works,</v>

3723
01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:22.641
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3724
01:53:22.641 --> 01:53:23.091
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

3725
01:53:23.091 --> 01:53:23.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3726
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:24.251
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

3727
01:53:24.251 --> 01:53:26.630
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to punish people for things they can't control,</v>

3728
01:53:27.170 --> 01:53:28.003
<v Speaker 2>well that's stupid,</v>

3729
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.371
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3730
01:53:28.371 --> 01:53:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Because if you,</v>

3731
01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:31.670
<v Speaker 2>as much as you punish them that you're not going to,</v>

3732
01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:33.140
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to moderate the behavior.</v>

3733
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:37.490
<v Speaker 2>So you have to punish people for things that are actually under voluntary</v>

3734
01:53:37.491 --> 01:53:41.420
<v Speaker 2>control and it only.</v>

3735
01:53:41.421 --> 01:53:46.421
<v Speaker 2>It only makes sense if it's the only tool to do the job.</v>

3736
01:53:47.091 --> 01:53:48.430
<v Speaker 2>And if the moment you had.</v>

3737
01:53:48.431 --> 01:53:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean this may have brought this up last time we spoke about free will,</v>

3738
01:53:53.150 --> 01:53:55.550
<v Speaker 2>but this is really the sort of reductio ad absurdum of,</v>

3739
01:53:55.551 --> 01:53:58.130
<v Speaker 2>of where most people are on this topic.</v>

3740
01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:02.420
<v Speaker 2>The moment we really understand human evil at the level of the brain,</v>

3741
01:54:02.421 --> 01:54:04.310
<v Speaker 2>the moment we understand psychopathy say,</v>

3742
01:54:04.311 --> 01:54:04.610
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

3743
01:54:04.610 --> 01:54:06.410
<v Speaker 2>let me maybe that's not the totality of evil,</v>

3744
01:54:06.411 --> 01:54:08.720
<v Speaker 2>but that's certainly center of the Bullseye.</v>

3745
01:54:10.190 --> 01:54:13.610
<v Speaker 2>Once we understand psychopathy is a neurological condition that's governed by</v>

3746
01:54:13.611 --> 01:54:16.190
<v Speaker 2>genes and environment and we can,</v>

3747
01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:20.240
<v Speaker 2>we can actually intrude at the level of the brain to mitigate it.</v>

3748
01:54:20.241 --> 01:54:22.550
<v Speaker 2>So like psychopathy becomes a disease,</v>

3749
01:54:22.551 --> 01:54:22.701
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3750
01:54:22.701 --> 01:54:23.534
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a,</v>

3751
01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:23.890
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3752
01:54:23.890 --> 01:54:25.790
<v Speaker 2>an injuries syndrome,</v>

3753
01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:26.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3754
01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:27.530
<v Speaker 2>That we can fix.</v>

3755
01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:28.670
<v Speaker 2>And let's say it's,</v>

3756
01:54:28.670 --> 01:54:30.050
<v Speaker 2>let's say it's a very simple fix.</v>

3757
01:54:30.051 --> 01:54:30.920
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's a pill,</v>

3758
01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:31.191
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3759
01:54:31.191 --> 01:54:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's just a neurotransmitter imbalance in the presence of that</v>

3760
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:36.583
<v Speaker 2>breakthrough,</v>

3761
01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:41.480
<v Speaker 2>we will feel very differently about that species of human evil.</v>

3762
01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.770
<v Speaker 2>We will not judge it in the same way will,</v>

3763
01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:47.540
<v Speaker 2>because what will happen is you'll give people the pill and they'll say,</v>

3764
01:54:47.541 --> 01:54:47.991
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

3765
01:54:47.991 --> 01:54:50.420
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I was that dangerous asshole.</v>

3766
01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:50.661
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3767
01:54:50.661 --> 01:54:51.890
<v Speaker 2>like the thank you for like,</v>

3768
01:54:51.891 --> 01:54:52.461
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

3769
01:54:52.461 --> 01:54:57.461
<v Speaker 2>I'm as horrified by who I was before you cured me as you were right.</v>

3770
01:54:58.100 --> 01:54:59.730
<v Speaker 2>And it.</v>

3771
01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:04.430
<v Speaker 2>So it'll psychopathy and the presence of a cure for it would look much more like</v>

3772
01:55:04.431 --> 01:55:07.640
<v Speaker 2>diabetes than it looks like evil in the present case.</v>

3773
01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:10.460
<v Speaker 2>And people aren't imagining what it would like.</v>

3774
01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:12.050
<v Speaker 2>What would it be like to be there?</v>

3775
01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:16.310
<v Speaker 2>What it would be like to actually fully understand the under underlying</v>

3776
01:55:16.311 --> 01:55:18.590
<v Speaker 2>neurophysiology here and actually have something.</v>

3777
01:55:18.591 --> 01:55:18.741
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3778
01:55:18.741 --> 01:55:18.840
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3779
01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:20.210
<v Speaker 2>there's no guarantee you will be able to,</v>

3780
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:23.030
<v Speaker 2>to deal with it in a simple way.</v>

3781
01:55:23.031 --> 01:55:25.040
<v Speaker 2>But it's certainly possible.</v>

3782
01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:26.343
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3783
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:30.680
<v Speaker 2>and I mean the classic example is just like the Charles Whitman example where</v>

3784
01:55:30.681 --> 01:55:30.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3785
01:55:30.841 --> 01:55:33.650
<v Speaker 2>you have a brain tumor that's causing this aberrant behavior.</v>

3786
01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:34.671
<v Speaker 2>In that case,</v>

3787
01:55:34.671 --> 01:55:35.504
<v Speaker 2>everyone,</v>

3788
01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:36.740
<v Speaker 2>everyone sees,</v>

3789
01:55:36.741 --> 01:55:37.041
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3790
01:55:37.041 --> 01:55:38.480
<v Speaker 2>this is not evil.</v>

3791
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:39.500
<v Speaker 2>This is a brain tumor,</v>

3792
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:43.800
<v Speaker 2>that's the tower shooter games back in [inaudible] 64 I think.</v>

3793
01:55:46.350 --> 01:55:47.220
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3794
01:55:47.850 --> 01:55:49.890
<v Speaker 2>but in the same way that a brain,</v>

3795
01:55:49.891 --> 01:55:52.080
<v Speaker 2>tuber tumors exculpatory there,</v>

3796
01:55:52.081 --> 01:55:57.081
<v Speaker 2>I think a full understanding of the underlying neurology would be exculpatory</v>

3797
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:59.161
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

3798
01:55:59.161 --> 01:56:01.040
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean you in the meantime,</v>

3799
01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:01.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3800
01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:02.191
<v Speaker 2>before we get there,</v>

3801
01:56:02.191 --> 01:56:05.940
<v Speaker 2>we have obviously we have to lock up dangerous people if there's no way to to</v>

3802
01:56:05.941 --> 01:56:06.600
<v Speaker 2>help them.</v>

3803
01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:09.960
<v Speaker 2>But the more we see the causes,</v>

3804
01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:11.370
<v Speaker 2>the more we view.</v>

3805
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:16.080
<v Speaker 2>We view this in terms of just sheer bad luck,</v>

3806
01:56:16.230 --> 01:56:16.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3807
01:56:16.610 --> 01:56:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Like there are,</v>

3808
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:18.750
<v Speaker 2>there are people who,</v>

3809
01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:22.170
<v Speaker 2>when they're adults are quintessentially evil,</v>

3810
01:56:22.410 --> 01:56:22.920
<v Speaker 2>who we've,</v>

3811
01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:23.531
<v Speaker 2>who and they,</v>

3812
01:56:23.531 --> 01:56:23.700
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3813
01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:26.250
<v Speaker 2>they provoked the greatest feeling of engines from us.</v>

3814
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:28.650
<v Speaker 2>But if you just walked back there timeline,</v>

3815
01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:32.430
<v Speaker 2>you recognize that at a certain they were four years old at one point,</v>

3816
01:56:32.690 --> 01:56:32.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3817
01:56:32.970 --> 01:56:37.590
<v Speaker 2>They were the four year old who was destined to become this terrible person.</v>

3818
01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:39.380
<v Speaker 2>It's an unlucky four year old,</v>

3819
01:56:39.770 --> 01:56:40.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3820
01:56:40.090 --> 01:56:41.520
<v Speaker 2>and so at what point,</v>

3821
01:56:41.521 --> 01:56:43.110
<v Speaker 2>where's the bright line that says,</v>

3822
01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:43.861
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3823
01:56:43.861 --> 01:56:48.720
<v Speaker 2>here's the point where it's appropriate to just hate this person and feel no</v>

3824
01:56:48.721 --> 01:56:51.840
<v Speaker 2>compassion and it on the other side of this line,</v>

3825
01:56:52.170 --> 01:56:54.480
<v Speaker 2>you should just feel compassion because this person's unlucky.</v>

3826
01:56:54.930 --> 01:56:59.930
<v Speaker 2>There is no such line and a complete understanding of this lifeline in,</v>

3827
01:57:01.110 --> 01:57:06.000
<v Speaker 2>in scientific terms would obliterate any line you think you have.</v>

3828
01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3829
01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:10.170
<v Speaker 2>It would just be this cascade of causation and you know,</v>

3830
01:57:10.171 --> 01:57:12.120
<v Speaker 2>adding randomness to the picture doesn't help,</v>

3831
01:57:12.121 --> 01:57:12.301
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3832
01:57:12.301 --> 01:57:12.571
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

3833
01:57:12.571 --> 01:57:13.770
<v Speaker 2>it's the randomness is just,</v>

3834
01:57:13.771 --> 01:57:13.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3835
01:57:13.891 --> 01:57:17.430
<v Speaker 2>somebody is in your brain rolling dice and all influencing your behavior that</v>

3836
01:57:17.431 --> 01:57:17.700
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

3837
01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:17.881
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3838
01:57:17.881 --> 01:57:18.140
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3839
01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:19.590
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't give you the free will.</v>

3840
01:57:19.591 --> 01:57:20.401
<v Speaker 2>People think they have.</v>

3841
01:57:20.401 --> 01:57:21.720
<v Speaker 2>So there isn't.</v>

3842
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:23.040
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>

3843
01:57:23.070 --> 01:57:23.903
<v Speaker 2>Ironically,</v>

3844
01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:26.670
<v Speaker 2>there is what seems</v>

3845
01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:30.880
<v Speaker 2>on some level deflationary of the,</v>

3846
01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:31.813
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

3847
01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:32.753
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3848
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.650
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3849
01:57:33.650 --> 01:57:38.650
<v Speaker 2>the Gravitas of the human spirit for people opens the door to,</v>

3850
01:57:38.900 --> 01:57:39.870
<v Speaker 2>at least in my view,</v>

3851
01:57:39.871 --> 01:57:44.871
<v Speaker 2>a far more ethical and tolerant and patient and understanding view of,</v>

3852
01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:46.590
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3853
01:57:46.590 --> 01:57:46.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3854
01:57:46.771 --> 01:57:50.160
<v Speaker 2>human failings and human frailty and,</v>

3855
01:57:50.170 --> 01:57:50.620
<v Speaker 2>and just.</v>

3856
01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:54.930
<v Speaker 2>And then at that point you can just have a conversation about what's pragmatic,</v>

3857
01:57:54.931 --> 01:57:55.501
<v Speaker 2>what works,</v>

3858
01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:56.910
<v Speaker 2>what helps people change.</v>

3859
01:57:57.070 --> 01:57:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Like in this,</v>

3860
01:57:57.570 --> 01:57:59.430
<v Speaker 2>this person over here who's doing terrible things,</v>

3861
01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:02.730
<v Speaker 2>is there something we can do to make him a better person?</v>

3862
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3863
01:58:03.210 --> 01:58:03.961
<v Speaker 2>if there is less,</v>

3864
01:58:03.961 --> 01:58:05.670
<v Speaker 2>do that without all the judgment.</v>

3865
01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't it be amazing if that's how we treated these public shaming events?</v>

3866
01:58:10.891 --> 01:58:11.041
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3867
01:58:11.041 --> 01:58:11.341
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't,</v>

3868
01:58:11.341 --> 01:58:15.000
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it be amazing if we gave someone an opportunity to say,</v>

3869
01:58:15.150 --> 01:58:15.900
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

3870
01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:17.640
<v Speaker 2>this is what I did,</v>

3871
01:58:17.670 --> 01:58:20.040
<v Speaker 2>this is how awful I feel about this.</v>

3872
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I would never do that again.</v>

3873
01:58:21.511 --> 01:58:22.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm a different person.</v>

3874
01:58:22.351 --> 01:58:23.310
<v Speaker 2>That was 20 years ago,</v>

3875
01:58:23.311 --> 01:58:24.144
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was,</v>

3876
01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:25.020
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3877
01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:26.610
<v Speaker 2>and have everybody join in.</v>

3878
01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:27.473
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3879
01:58:27.810 --> 01:58:29.520
<v Speaker 2>anyone could be you.</v>

3880
01:58:29.670 --> 01:58:32.250
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for being honest about who you are now.</v>

3881
01:58:32.251 --> 01:58:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for evolving.</v>

3882
01:58:33.571 --> 01:58:36.540
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for expressing yourself in a way that maybe other people who have also</v>

3883
01:58:36.541 --> 01:58:37.860
<v Speaker 2>committed really,</v>

3884
01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:42.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm just unsavory or just unfortunate</v>

3885
01:58:42.670 --> 01:58:43.900
<v Speaker 1>things in the past,</v>

3886
01:58:43.901 --> 01:58:45.010
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately acts in the past.</v>

3887
01:58:45.011 --> 01:58:49.210
<v Speaker 1>They can feel relieved by the fact that you've grown and evolved to become a</v>

3888
01:58:49.211 --> 01:58:51.070
<v Speaker 1>better person and that you're a,</v>

3889
01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:54.310
<v Speaker 1>you're a different thing now and you are the product of all of your experiences.</v>

3890
01:58:54.311 --> 01:58:54.641
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>

3891
01:58:54.641 --> 01:58:55.930
<v Speaker 1>you're not this one thing.</v>

3892
01:58:55.931 --> 01:58:58.930
<v Speaker 1>You're not stuck in who you were when you were 16 years old.</v>

3893
01:58:58.990 --> 01:59:01.690
<v Speaker 1>If you were mark and mark and you hit that guy with a stick,</v>

3894
01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:02.570
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3895
01:59:02.570 --> 01:59:03.181
<v Speaker 1>whatever he did,</v>

3896
01:59:03.181 --> 01:59:03.360
<v Speaker 1>you didn't.</v>

3897
01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:05.980
<v Speaker 1>You're not stuck in that spot for ever.</v>

3898
01:59:06.570 --> 01:59:08.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not a scarlet letter.</v>

3899
01:59:08.410 --> 01:59:11.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not a mark on your forehead that you keep for life.</v>

3900
01:59:11.740 --> 01:59:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3901
01:59:11.930 --> 01:59:14.280
<v Speaker 2>But the thing about the Liam Neeson incident,</v>

3902
01:59:14.281 --> 01:59:18.410
<v Speaker 2>which I find so interesting is that there's a case where they,</v>

3903
01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:20.790
<v Speaker 2>what he's revealing about himself is,</v>

3904
01:59:20.970 --> 01:59:22.380
<v Speaker 2>is pretty amazing,</v>

3905
01:59:22.530 --> 01:59:22.831
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3906
01:59:22.831 --> 01:59:23.101
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3907
01:59:23.101 --> 01:59:24.190
<v Speaker 2>it's like he,</v>

3908
01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:25.830
<v Speaker 2>he just decided,</v>

3909
01:59:25.831 --> 01:59:26.180
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3910
01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:27.140
<v Speaker 2>we need a,</v>

3911
01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:30.780
<v Speaker 2>a truth and Reconciliation Commission for who I used to be.</v>

3912
01:59:30.810 --> 01:59:31.111
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3913
01:59:31.111 --> 01:59:31.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3914
01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:32.573
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3915
01:59:32.930 --> 01:59:33.763
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3916
01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:35.070
<v Speaker 2>just volunteered this.</v>

3917
01:59:35.130 --> 01:59:36.030
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>

3918
01:59:36.031 --> 01:59:36.864
<v Speaker 2>like I like,</v>

3919
01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:37.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3920
01:59:39.110 --> 01:59:41.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't actually understand that state of mind.</v>

3921
01:59:41.401 --> 01:59:43.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are many abrons states of mind that I can understand.</v>

3922
01:59:43.981 --> 01:59:45.180
<v Speaker 2>I certainly understand what it's like to,</v>

3923
01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:47.570
<v Speaker 2>to want to harm somebody and uh,</v>

3924
01:59:47.571 --> 01:59:47.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3925
01:59:47.821 --> 01:59:49.440
<v Speaker 2>to feel vengeance and all that.</v>

3926
01:59:49.441 --> 01:59:51.630
<v Speaker 2>But the instrumental violence piece,</v>

3927
01:59:51.631 --> 01:59:52.351
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

3928
01:59:52.351 --> 01:59:53.460
<v Speaker 2>I've never felt like,</v>

3929
01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:54.721
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3930
01:59:54.721 --> 01:59:58.170
<v Speaker 2>this type of person wronged me or someone close to me.</v>

3931
01:59:58.440 --> 02:00:02.520
<v Speaker 2>So anytime any person of that type will do right like that.</v>

3932
02:00:02.730 --> 02:00:05.010
<v Speaker 2>But that is such a problem,</v>

3933
02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:08.760
<v Speaker 2>the world over in human history that it is,</v>

3934
02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:11.250
<v Speaker 2>it is just fascinating ethically,</v>

3935
02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:16.140
<v Speaker 2>for someone of his stature to reveal that about himself.</v>

3936
02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:17.160
<v Speaker 2>And he put it in terms of,</v>

3937
02:00:17.190 --> 02:00:18.023
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3938
02:00:18.170 --> 02:00:18.781
<v Speaker 2>of honor.</v>

3939
02:00:18.781 --> 02:00:18.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3940
02:00:18.901 --> 02:00:19.350
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3941
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.921
<v Speaker 2>it was an honor.</v>

3942
02:00:19.921 --> 02:00:20.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3943
02:00:20.071 --> 02:00:20.520
<v Speaker 2>this is what,</v>

3944
02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:21.353
<v Speaker 2>this is what,</v>

3945
02:00:21.390 --> 02:00:23.640
<v Speaker 2>what is so dysfunctional about honor culture,</v>

3946
02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:23.881
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3947
02:00:23.881 --> 02:00:24.510
<v Speaker 2>This is what,</v>

3948
02:00:24.510 --> 02:00:28.320
<v Speaker 2>this is what we see more in the south than anywhere else in the country.</v>

3949
02:00:28.321 --> 02:00:31.860
<v Speaker 2>And this is what you see basically everywhere you go in the Middle East.</v>

3950
02:00:32.410 --> 02:00:37.410
<v Speaker 2>And this is what Islam inculcates to a degree that's fairly unmatched in,</v>

3951
02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:39.060
<v Speaker 2>in its community.</v>

3952
02:00:39.690 --> 02:00:41.700
<v Speaker 2>This notion of honor is,</v>

3953
02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:46.940
<v Speaker 2>does link up with this tendency to find satisfaction in instrumental violence</v>

3954
02:00:48.961 --> 02:00:49.290
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3955
02:00:49.290 --> 02:00:50.270
<v Speaker 2>but when you,</v>

3956
02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:54.660
<v Speaker 2>when you try to run that software on my brain that just looks like madness,</v>

3957
02:00:55.050 --> 02:00:55.231
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3958
02:00:55.231 --> 02:01:00.231
<v Speaker 2>The idea that any other person will do right of a certain type that's just,</v>

3959
02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:03.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3960
02:01:03.190 --> 02:01:03.591
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

3961
02:01:03.591 --> 02:01:06.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't read that resonates not at all right.</v>

3962
02:01:06.570 --> 02:01:07.403
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3963
02:01:07.690 --> 02:01:08.523
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3964
02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:13.830
<v Speaker 2>it's just damn interested in the fact that the lesson being taken from this</v>

3965
02:01:13.831 --> 02:01:14.664
<v Speaker 2>seems to be,</v>

3966
02:01:16.290 --> 02:01:17.123
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

3967
02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:22.080
<v Speaker 2>this should be the end of your career for having talked about this in the way.</v>

3968
02:01:22.170 --> 02:01:23.130
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

3969
02:01:23.150 --> 02:01:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I apologize if there's some part of the story that I've gotten wrong or I'm not</v>

3970
02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:28.740
<v Speaker 2>missing or missing,</v>

3971
02:01:28.741 --> 02:01:33.690
<v Speaker 2>but it seemed to me that he was always counting this in the,</v>

3972
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.720
<v Speaker 2>the horror and amazement appropriate to the,</v>

3973
02:01:36.750 --> 02:01:40.840
<v Speaker 2>to the disclosure like he can't believe was inhabiting this state of</v>

3974
02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:41.600
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

3975
02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:42.850
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3976
02:01:42.851 --> 02:01:44.930
<v Speaker 2>it's just an amazing thing to reveal about yourself.</v>

3977
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:46.760
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3978
02:01:46.761 --> 02:01:48.410
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure he regrets every second of it.</v>

3979
02:01:48.411 --> 02:01:48.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3980
02:01:48.741 --> 02:01:49.190
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

3981
02:01:49.190 --> 02:01:50.900
<v Speaker 2>that's the wrong fucking punchline.</v>

3982
02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:54.890
<v Speaker 2>The thing that should happen is</v>

3983
02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:58.940
<v Speaker 2>someone with a lot to lose,</v>

3984
02:01:59.390 --> 02:02:00.440
<v Speaker 2>should be able to say,</v>

3985
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3986
02:02:00.831 --> 02:02:02.870
<v Speaker 2>how ugly a human mind can be.</v>

3987
02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:04.550
<v Speaker 2>This is an experience I had,</v>

3988
02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:05.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3989
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.730
<v Speaker 2>This is who I was and you know,</v>

3990
02:02:07.731 --> 02:02:10.220
<v Speaker 2>how much I have to live for and how much I have to lose.</v>

3991
02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:14.030
<v Speaker 2>We have to talk about this kind of mania.</v>

3992
02:02:14.031 --> 02:02:15.860
<v Speaker 2>They can get humming on a human brain,</v>

3993
02:02:16.090 --> 02:02:16.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3994
02:02:16.410 --> 02:02:17.241
<v Speaker 2>We see this eight.</v>

3995
02:02:17.241 --> 02:02:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Every time you open the paper,</v>

3996
02:02:18.710 --> 02:02:21.080
<v Speaker 2>you see someone in the grip of this kind of thing.</v>

3997
02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3998
02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:23.300
<v Speaker 2>It even happened to me,</v>

3999
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:23.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4000
02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:25.970
<v Speaker 2>I think it was an amazing conversation to start.</v>

4001
02:02:25.971 --> 02:02:29.240
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that the result is just,</v>

4002
02:02:29.330 --> 02:02:29.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4003
02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:30.553
<v Speaker 2>in an,</v>

4004
02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:32.120
<v Speaker 2>an auto defay uh,</v>

4005
02:02:32.150 --> 02:02:32.983
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

4006
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.920
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

4007
02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:34.790
<v Speaker 2>is the problem.</v>

4008
02:02:34.791 --> 02:02:35.070
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

4009
02:02:35.070 --> 02:02:37.390
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to fight our way through it.</v>

4010
02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:38.271
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it to.</v>

4011
02:02:38.271 --> 02:02:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Because there's too many voices.</v>

4012
02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:40.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4013
02:02:40.010 --> 02:02:42.080
<v Speaker 2>there's just so many people that are reacting to it.</v>

4014
02:02:42.081 --> 02:02:43.400
<v Speaker 2>If he's dealing with,</v>

4015
02:02:43.610 --> 02:02:46.310
<v Speaker 2>he's not dealing with three or four or five voices.</v>

4016
02:02:46.311 --> 02:02:51.311
<v Speaker 2>He's dealing with millions of people to get to chime in on this and get a few</v>

4017
02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:53.870
<v Speaker 2>thousand of those people that are furious at you.</v>

4018
02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:54.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4019
02:02:54.570 --> 02:02:57.560
<v Speaker 2>like you were saying like it doesn't.</v>

4020
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:58.670
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

4021
02:02:58.670 --> 02:02:59.503
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't work.</v>

4022
02:02:59.510 --> 02:03:02.720
<v Speaker 2>I was just about to say I was going to make a comparison to your podcast with</v>

4023
02:03:02.721 --> 02:03:03.051
<v Speaker 2>Jack,</v>

4024
02:03:03.051 --> 02:03:05.300
<v Speaker 2>but you're not listening to them reading the comments,</v>

4025
02:03:05.301 --> 02:03:06.770
<v Speaker 2>but he's.</v>

4026
02:03:07.010 --> 02:03:12.010
<v Speaker 2>He's getting this gigantic signal from a huge number of people you know.</v>

4027
02:03:13.131 --> 02:03:15.740
<v Speaker 2>So this is all over my google news feed.</v>

4028
02:03:15.741 --> 02:03:16.910
<v Speaker 2>I saw it on Yahoo.</v>

4029
02:03:16.911 --> 02:03:21.650
<v Speaker 2>I saw it in all these different publications are talking about Liam Neeson's</v>

4030
02:03:21.651 --> 02:03:26.630
<v Speaker 2>case and so then everybody starts timing in and then the virtue signaling ratio</v>

4031
02:03:26.631 --> 02:03:29.880
<v Speaker 2>is very high and the anger ratio is very high than the people that think he's</v>

4032
02:03:29.881 --> 02:03:32.870
<v Speaker 2>secretly still racist and doesn't want to admit it is very high.</v>

4033
02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:36.350
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also the fact that he's a man of wealth and privilege and he's</v>

4034
02:03:36.351 --> 02:03:39.560
<v Speaker 2>successful and famous and there's got to be a bunch of jealousy that's attached</v>

4035
02:03:39.561 --> 02:03:42.080
<v Speaker 2>to that and a bunch of people that want to knock him down because he's at a very</v>

4036
02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:42.914
<v Speaker 2>high hill.</v>

4037
02:03:43.110 --> 02:03:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4038
02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:45.020
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot going on there.</v>

4039
02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:47.310
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

4040
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:47.780
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4041
02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:48.613
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4042
02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:49.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4043
02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:49.400
<v Speaker 2>I feel,</v>

4044
02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:50.450
<v Speaker 2>I feel for the guy,</v>

4045
02:03:50.451 --> 02:03:50.721
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

4046
02:03:50.721 --> 02:03:51.171
<v Speaker 2>I don't know him,</v>

4047
02:03:51.171 --> 02:03:51.800
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>

4048
02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:52.790
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

4049
02:03:53.610 --> 02:03:54.201
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

4050
02:03:54.201 --> 02:03:55.610
<v Speaker 2>forgive me if I get this slightly wrong,</v>

4051
02:03:55.611 --> 02:03:58.610
<v Speaker 2>but isn't it true that his wife,</v>

4052
02:03:58.670 --> 02:04:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Natasha Richardson just died in this freak accident that she's a skiing</v>

4053
02:04:02.931 --> 02:04:03.470
<v Speaker 2>accident?</v>

4054
02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Fell and hit her head.</v>

4055
02:04:04.371 --> 02:04:04.870
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4056
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:05.900
<v Speaker 2>but honestly,</v>

4057
02:04:06.050 --> 02:04:06.940
<v Speaker 2>she didn't even fall.</v>

4058
02:04:07.220 --> 02:04:08.990
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't moving when she fell.</v>

4059
02:04:08.991 --> 02:04:13.970
<v Speaker 2>She was standing on a ski slope and fell from a standing position and hit her</v>

4060
02:04:13.971 --> 02:04:14.370
<v Speaker 2>head on the,</v>

4061
02:04:14.370 --> 02:04:14.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4062
02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:16.160
<v Speaker 2>the hard snow obviously.</v>

4063
02:04:16.730 --> 02:04:19.010
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it's just,</v>

4064
02:04:19.150 --> 02:04:19.841
<v Speaker 2>it's all it takes.</v>

4065
02:04:19.841 --> 02:04:20.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4066
02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:21.070
<v Speaker 2>it's brutal.</v>

4067
02:04:21.070 --> 02:04:21.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4068
02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:22.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4069
02:04:22.070 --> 02:04:22.903
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4070
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:23.840
<v Speaker 2>and on top of that,</v>

4071
02:04:23.841 --> 02:04:26.480
<v Speaker 2>I believe his cousin or his nephew,</v>

4072
02:04:26.750 --> 02:04:27.800
<v Speaker 2>nephew or niece,</v>

4073
02:04:28.070 --> 02:04:29.090
<v Speaker 2>died the same way.</v>

4074
02:04:29.930 --> 02:04:31.760
<v Speaker 2>Not the same way in terms of fell skiing.</v>

4075
02:04:31.761 --> 02:04:33.200
<v Speaker 2>But also hit their head and ride.</v>

4076
02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4077
02:04:33.650 --> 02:04:37.830
<v Speaker 2>So it was like Jesus Christ is this guy and obviously there's many people out</v>

4078
02:04:37.831 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 2>there that</v>

4079
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:39.780
<v Speaker 1>are experienced at far greater tragedy.</v>

4080
02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:41.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to quantify it,</v>

4081
02:04:41.551 --> 02:04:42.810
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

4082
02:04:42.811 --> 02:04:43.644
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

4083
02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:44.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4084
02:04:44.190 --> 02:04:44.660
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

4085
02:04:44.660 --> 02:04:46.230
<v Speaker 1>he tried to talk about a real thing,</v>

4086
02:04:46.370 --> 02:04:46.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4087
02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:48.060
<v Speaker 1>and tried to talk about a real thing.</v>

4088
02:04:48.061 --> 02:04:48.300
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

4089
02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:49.133
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>

4090
02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:52.440
<v Speaker 1>he's given some interviews since then where he's,</v>

4091
02:04:52.441 --> 02:04:52.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4092
02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:53.031
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

4093
02:04:53.031 --> 02:04:53.281
<v Speaker 1>I'll look,</v>

4094
02:04:53.281 --> 02:04:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a racist,</v>

4095
02:04:54.211 --> 02:04:57.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you I was in such a fucked up state of mind because of this</v>

4096
02:04:57.631 --> 02:05:00.270
<v Speaker 1>rate that I was willing to do something irrational and horrible,</v>

4097
02:05:01.510 --> 02:05:02.343
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't know,</v>

4098
02:05:02.380 --> 02:05:03.060
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't.</v>

4099
02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

4100
02:05:03.450 --> 02:05:03.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4101
02:05:03.601 --> 02:05:03.981
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

4102
02:05:03.981 --> 02:05:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4103
02:05:04.290 --> 02:05:04.630
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

4104
02:05:04.630 --> 02:05:05.820
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

4105
02:05:05.821 --> 02:05:08.040
<v Speaker 1>it will take it full circle people.</v>

4106
02:05:08.041 --> 02:05:12.810
<v Speaker 1>These same people who are calling for his head are prepared to forgive other</v>

4107
02:05:12.811 --> 02:05:14.700
<v Speaker 1>people who did do that thing.</v>

4108
02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:16.470
<v Speaker 1>It's so dependent.</v>

4109
02:05:16.471 --> 02:05:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Like I had Mike Tyson on the podcast and one of the things that I got when I</v>

4110
02:05:19.531 --> 02:05:20.430
<v Speaker 1>said it was on part of my,</v>

4111
02:05:20.450 --> 02:05:21.030
<v Speaker 1>that was fast.</v>

4112
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I've asked so many people were like,</v>

4113
02:05:22.321 --> 02:05:23.640
<v Speaker 1>fuck that rapist.</v>

4114
02:05:23.641 --> 02:05:24.361
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this guy.</v>

4115
02:05:24.361 --> 02:05:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

4116
02:05:25.010 --> 02:05:26.340
<v Speaker 1>All these different things about him,</v>

4117
02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:31.700
<v Speaker 1>what I wanted to get into him with him was who he was when he was 12 years old,</v>

4118
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:34.050
<v Speaker 1>when he was a little boy,</v>

4119
02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:38.580
<v Speaker 1>when he met custom motto and was taught out of box and was fucking hypnotized,</v>

4120
02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:42.090
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the really important things that came out of that podcast was</v>

4121
02:05:42.091 --> 02:05:46.170
<v Speaker 1>custom model who was not just this boxing legend who took in this young kid from</v>

4122
02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:47.520
<v Speaker 1>the ghetto that didn't have a family,</v>

4123
02:05:47.850 --> 02:05:49.830
<v Speaker 1>but also hypnotized him.</v>

4124
02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Tip Man ties them to be a destroyer.</v>

4125
02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:53.250
<v Speaker 1>He specifically was saying to him,</v>

4126
02:05:53.251 --> 02:05:54.270
<v Speaker 1>you don't exist.</v>

4127
02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:55.740
<v Speaker 1>The task exists.</v>

4128
02:05:55.950 --> 02:05:56.940
<v Speaker 1>You're going to move forward.</v>

4129
02:05:56.941 --> 02:05:58.740
<v Speaker 1>You're going to Bob and weave and rip the body,</v>

4130
02:05:58.890 --> 02:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>and he was programming this kid to get incredible amounts of positive response</v>

4131
02:06:04.081 --> 02:06:05.640
<v Speaker 1>from violent acts.</v>

4132
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Violent acts in a boxing ring,</v>

4133
02:06:07.381 --> 02:06:08.910
<v Speaker 1>and that's where he got his identity.</v>

4134
02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:12.630
<v Speaker 1>That's where he got all of his love and so he became this guy and one of the</v>

4135
02:06:12.631 --> 02:06:13.351
<v Speaker 1>things that I said to him,</v>

4136
02:06:13.351 --> 02:06:14.184
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

4137
02:06:14.250 --> 02:06:16.470
<v Speaker 1>did anybody ever teach teach you how to turn it off?</v>

4138
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:17.590
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

4139
02:06:17.590 --> 02:06:18.080
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4140
02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Nobody did.</v>

4141
02:06:18.620 --> 02:06:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4142
02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

4143
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not Mike Tyson and I was never like that.</v>

4144
02:06:22.550 --> 02:06:23.341
<v Speaker 1>I was never like that,</v>

4145
02:06:23.341 --> 02:06:27.750
<v Speaker 1>but I was far more violent when I was fighting far more violent,</v>

4146
02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:29.550
<v Speaker 1>far more prone to violence.</v>

4147
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:33.750
<v Speaker 1>It was my trigger was very short because I was thinking about it all the</v>

4148
02:06:34.170 --> 02:06:35.840
<v Speaker 1>fighting all the time I fought.</v>

4149
02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.680
<v Speaker 1>I probably had 100 fights.</v>

4150
02:06:38.070 --> 02:06:39.330
<v Speaker 1>I was ready to go.</v>

4151
02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:40.141
<v Speaker 1>Like your.</v>

4152
02:06:40.141 --> 02:06:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Your brain has a.</v>

4153
02:06:41.290 --> 02:06:41.790
<v Speaker 1>If you're.</v>

4154
02:06:41.790 --> 02:06:45.630
<v Speaker 1>If you're getting kicked in the face and punched in the face a lot and you're</v>

4155
02:06:45.631 --> 02:06:48.960
<v Speaker 1>doing it through your developmental period from the time you 50 for me was 15.</v>

4156
02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:50.370
<v Speaker 1>From him it was like 12 or 13.</v>

4157
02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:55.740
<v Speaker 1>You have a different way of looking at the world because this is also in the</v>

4158
02:06:55.741 --> 02:06:57.780
<v Speaker 1>recipes in the recipes are also.</v>

4159
02:06:57.781 --> 02:06:59.250
<v Speaker 1>You might get knocked the fuck out.</v>

4160
02:06:59.430 --> 02:07:00.720
<v Speaker 1>You might get head kicked,</v>

4161
02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:03.740
<v Speaker 1>you might get kicked in the neck with a Shin and you know,</v>

4162
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:06.660
<v Speaker 1>you wake up and your friends are slapped me in the face of putting ice on you.</v>

4163
02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:09.750
<v Speaker 1>This is all real and when you have that,</v>

4164
02:07:10.450 --> 02:07:12.420
<v Speaker 1>the positive that comes from that.</v>

4165
02:07:12.421 --> 02:07:17.100
<v Speaker 1>When you were a 12 year old boy and you're hypnotized by this great man who's</v>

4166
02:07:17.130 --> 02:07:19.590
<v Speaker 1>teaching you how to fight and you're getting so much love,</v>

4167
02:07:19.591 --> 02:07:20.790
<v Speaker 1>you've never gotten love in your life,</v>

4168
02:07:20.940 --> 02:07:24.900
<v Speaker 1>you've never gotten positive feedback and you're getting so much of it from this</v>

4169
02:07:25.170 --> 02:07:27.780
<v Speaker 1>and then no one's teaching you how to turn it off and you're wondering why this</v>

4170
02:07:27.781 --> 02:07:31.110
<v Speaker 1>guy would he grows up to become a fucking maniac is punching people in the</v>

4171
02:07:31.111 --> 02:07:31.510
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

4172
02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:34.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just just crazy and yelling at reporters.</v>

4173
02:07:34.501 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck you in the ass white boy.</v>

4174
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:37.090
<v Speaker 2>All that crazy shit that he did.</v>

4175
02:07:37.470 --> 02:07:38.620
<v Speaker 2>He was a maniac.</v>

4176
02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:39.513
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no.</v>

4177
02:07:39.610 --> 02:07:42.340
<v Speaker 2>No one taught him how to reflect.</v>

4178
02:07:42.430 --> 02:07:46.930
<v Speaker 2>There was no Sam Harris App for meditation for Mike Tyson in 1986.</v>

4179
02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:47.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4180
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:48.490
<v Speaker 2>he was just a maniac.</v>

4181
02:07:50.220 --> 02:07:50.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4182
02:07:50.770 --> 02:07:55.770
<v Speaker 2>one problem we have here is that we don't have a norm around a good norm around</v>

4183
02:07:57.281 --> 02:08:01.630
<v Speaker 2>mental health and we have zero norms around mental training.</v>

4184
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:01.931
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4185
02:08:01.931 --> 02:08:02.764
<v Speaker 2>So mean.</v>

4186
02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:04.030
<v Speaker 2>So physical training.</v>

4187
02:08:04.730 --> 02:08:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Very good analogy between meditation as mental training,</v>

4188
02:08:09.011 --> 02:08:12.010
<v Speaker 2>which sounds just like esoteric and woo.</v>

4189
02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:13.510
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like new age,</v>

4190
02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:15.820
<v Speaker 2>specious nonsense to many people,</v>

4191
02:08:16.420 --> 02:08:20.200
<v Speaker 2>but if you roll back the clock 100 years physical training,</v>

4192
02:08:20.830 --> 02:08:21.850
<v Speaker 2>which made no sense,</v>

4193
02:08:21.851 --> 02:08:25.090
<v Speaker 2>there were no norms around him and the only guy lifting a dumbbell was that guy</v>

4194
02:08:25.091 --> 02:08:27.400
<v Speaker 2>with the handlebar mustache and the leopard,</v>

4195
02:08:27.401 --> 02:08:27.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4196
02:08:27.730 --> 02:08:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Bikini or whatever.</v>

4197
02:08:28.571 --> 02:08:30.190
<v Speaker 2>He was wearing the freak show,</v>

4198
02:08:30.191 --> 02:08:30.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4199
02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:31.793
<v Speaker 2>The singlet.</v>

4200
02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:32.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4201
02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:34.830
<v Speaker 2>And now we have a,</v>

4202
02:08:34.930 --> 02:08:38.890
<v Speaker 2>we have a total understanding of the norms around physical training.</v>

4203
02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:39.230
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4204
02:08:39.230 --> 02:08:39.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4205
02:08:39.340 --> 02:08:39.580
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

4206
02:08:39.580 --> 02:08:40.130
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

4207
02:08:40.130 --> 02:08:40.690
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>

4208
02:08:40.690 --> 02:08:43.300
<v Speaker 2>you're actually a freak if you don't do some kind of exercise.</v>

4209
02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:47.320
<v Speaker 2>They have even changed and evolved over the last decade or so.</v>

4210
02:08:47.650 --> 02:08:49.930
<v Speaker 2>It's gotten far more complicated in nuance.</v>

4211
02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:50.950
<v Speaker 2>It's continually evolving,</v>

4212
02:08:50.951 --> 02:08:51.550
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

4213
02:08:51.550 --> 02:08:53.830
<v Speaker 2>the framework that the paradigm,</v>

4214
02:08:53.831 --> 02:08:58.180
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there's something to do to get better physically and that,</v>

4215
02:08:58.181 --> 02:08:58.380
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

4216
02:08:58.380 --> 02:09:00.250
<v Speaker 2>those changes matter,</v>

4217
02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:00.900
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4218
02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:01.650
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4219
02:09:01.650 --> 02:09:06.650
<v Speaker 2>you can engage your body intelligently so as to improve it in all across many</v>

4220
02:09:06.791 --> 02:09:07.511
<v Speaker 2>different variables.</v>

4221
02:09:07.511 --> 02:09:08.231
<v Speaker 2>Flexibility,</v>

4222
02:09:08.231 --> 02:09:09.064
<v Speaker 2>strength,</v>

4223
02:09:09.390 --> 02:09:10.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4224
02:09:10.150 --> 02:09:11.680
<v Speaker 2>that's all totally understood.</v>

4225
02:09:11.681 --> 02:09:16.240
<v Speaker 2>And now we're just refining the protocol with mental training,</v>

4226
02:09:17.050 --> 02:09:17.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4227
02:09:17.450 --> 02:09:22.450
<v Speaker 2>and specifically the training of attention and how you respond to the uprising</v>

4228
02:09:26.591 --> 02:09:28.000
<v Speaker 2>of your own negative emotion,</v>

4229
02:09:28.210 --> 02:09:29.043
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4230
02:09:29.170 --> 02:09:32.200
<v Speaker 2>That is something that has been going on for thousands of years in</v>

4231
02:09:32.201 --> 02:09:33.011
<v Speaker 2>contemplative,</v>

4232
02:09:33.011 --> 02:09:34.750
<v Speaker 2>mostly eastern context.</v>

4233
02:09:34.751 --> 02:09:35.291
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that,</v>

4234
02:09:35.291 --> 02:09:35.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4235
02:09:35.471 --> 02:09:40.471
<v Speaker 2>Buddhism really has a lot of specifically an asymmetric amount of wisdom to,</v>

4236
02:09:41.620 --> 02:09:41.951
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

4237
02:09:41.951 --> 02:09:42.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4238
02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:43.383
<v Speaker 2>share on.</v>

4239
02:09:43.690 --> 02:09:45.820
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

4240
02:09:45.821 --> 02:09:46.654
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4241
02:09:46.900 --> 02:09:47.141
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4242
02:09:47.141 --> 02:09:47.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4243
02:09:47.381 --> 02:09:47.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4244
02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:48.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4245
02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:52.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm very excited to be spending more time on it because it's that the locus of</v>

4246
02:09:52.631 --> 02:09:55.740
<v Speaker 2>so much of the fragmentation or in our lives now is the smartphone.</v>

4247
02:09:55.890 --> 02:09:56.710
<v Speaker 2>So what's happening,</v>

4248
02:09:56.710 --> 02:09:57.160
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>

4249
02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:02.160
<v Speaker 2>what this thing is doing to us is continually amplifying not only our desire for</v>

4250
02:10:04.491 --> 02:10:05.650
<v Speaker 2>our approval,</v>

4251
02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:10.860
<v Speaker 2>but the ability to react in a like.</v>

4252
02:10:11.530 --> 02:10:16.030
<v Speaker 2>So there's just no reason to hesitate to condemn this thing that you're seeing</v>

4253
02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:17.320
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

4254
02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:20.650
<v Speaker 2>This upwelling of negative emotion you see the out of the outrage,</v>

4255
02:10:20.651 --> 02:10:22.930
<v Speaker 2>you feel when you see something on twitter,</v>

4256
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:24.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4257
02:10:24.070 --> 02:10:24.903
<v Speaker 2>Is,</v>

4258
02:10:26.230 --> 02:10:28.000
<v Speaker 2>it's shortening everybody's views,</v>

4259
02:10:28.210 --> 02:10:28.511
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4260
02:10:28.511 --> 02:10:31.900
<v Speaker 2>It's making road rage more of a kind of a general feature of our,</v>

4261
02:10:31.930 --> 02:10:32.763
<v Speaker 2>of our lives.</v>

4262
02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:34.300
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

4263
02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:35.660
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

4264
02:10:35.660 --> 02:10:36.800
<v Speaker 2>this is all trainable,</v>

4265
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:38.120
<v Speaker 2>like you can actually,</v>

4266
02:10:38.121 --> 02:10:43.121
<v Speaker 2>you can actually learn that when you suddenly feel anger in response to</v>

4267
02:10:43.401 --> 02:10:45.980
<v Speaker 2>something that seems to have happened in the world,</v>

4268
02:10:47.210 --> 02:10:50.360
<v Speaker 2>if you just pay attention to the experience of anger,</v>

4269
02:10:50.361 --> 02:10:51.290
<v Speaker 2>he just feel the,</v>

4270
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4271
02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:51.730
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4272
02:10:51.730 --> 02:10:53.390
<v Speaker 2>the mirror physiology of it.</v>

4273
02:10:54.230 --> 02:10:55.690
<v Speaker 2>And get out of your thoughts about it.</v>

4274
02:10:56.180 --> 02:10:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Like you actually,</v>

4275
02:10:57.291 --> 02:10:59.060
<v Speaker 2>you notice thought as a process,</v>

4276
02:10:59.540 --> 02:11:00.380
<v Speaker 2>you let that go.</v>

4277
02:11:00.381 --> 02:11:03.680
<v Speaker 2>You're not continuing to have a conversation with yourself about all the reasons</v>

4278
02:11:03.681 --> 02:11:07.640
<v Speaker 2>why you should be angry or you should attack this person and you just become</v>

4279
02:11:07.670 --> 02:11:08.503
<v Speaker 2>interested in,</v>

4280
02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:10.250
<v Speaker 2>in anger as response.</v>

4281
02:11:10.670 --> 02:11:14.240
<v Speaker 2>The half life of the emotion is like seconds,</v>

4282
02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:14.541
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4283
02:11:14.541 --> 02:11:17.240
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to stay angry for very long.</v>

4284
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:20.270
<v Speaker 2>If you get out of the story you're telling yourself about why you should be</v>

4285
02:11:20.271 --> 02:11:20.601
<v Speaker 2>angry.</v>

4286
02:11:20.601 --> 02:11:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Now there are certain situations where anger is,</v>

4287
02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:27.170
<v Speaker 2>is appropriate and it's good to have access to that energy.</v>

4288
02:11:27.171 --> 02:11:27.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

4289
02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:31.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not advocating that everyone just get labatt automized and not react to</v>

4290
02:11:31.661 --> 02:11:32.091
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

4291
02:11:32.091 --> 02:11:37.091
<v Speaker 2>But until you can actually be mindful.</v>

4292
02:11:37.731 --> 02:11:40.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean mindfulness is the technical word for what this is.</v>

4293
02:11:40.671 --> 02:11:42.860
<v Speaker 2>And until you can actually get out of the,</v>

4294
02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:46.160
<v Speaker 2>the thoughts and just pay attention to,</v>

4295
02:11:46.810 --> 02:11:47.643
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

4296
02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:49.160
<v Speaker 2>in this case a negative emotion,</v>

4297
02:11:49.820 --> 02:11:50.870
<v Speaker 2>you have zero choice.</v>

4298
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:53.840
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna stay angry for as long as you stay angry for and people have this</v>

4299
02:11:53.841 --> 02:11:58.430
<v Speaker 2>experience of being angry for days about things or being angry for hours.</v>

4300
02:11:58.970 --> 02:12:02.060
<v Speaker 2>There's no way to stay angry for more than moments if,</v>

4301
02:12:02.090 --> 02:12:02.450
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

4302
02:12:02.450 --> 02:12:04.400
<v Speaker 2>unless you're just lost in the story.</v>

4303
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:05.600
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

4304
02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:08.790
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a kind of superpower to,</v>

4305
02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:10.130
<v Speaker 2>to be able to say,</v>

4306
02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:12.620
<v Speaker 2>do I need to be angry about this?</v>

4307
02:12:12.770 --> 02:12:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Or like how useful is it to stay angry about this?</v>

4308
02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:15.711
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

4309
02:12:15.711 --> 02:12:15.951
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4310
02:12:15.951 --> 02:12:18.290
<v Speaker 2>and you can just get off the ride,</v>

4311
02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:18.801
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4312
02:12:18.801 --> 02:12:19.401
<v Speaker 2>You can literally,</v>

4313
02:12:19.401 --> 02:12:19.980
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

4314
02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:24.830
<v Speaker 2>I see a tweet from somebody who's trying to destroy my life and I feel this</v>

4315
02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:29.920
<v Speaker 2>initial contraction and I can decide how long I want to feel that way for.</v>

4316
02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:32.751
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4317
02:12:32.751 --> 02:12:35.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's an amazing thing to be able to do.</v>

4318
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:40.030
<v Speaker 2>And it's based on a kind of training that very few people know even exists and</v>

4319
02:12:41.031 --> 02:12:41.180
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

4320
02:12:41.180 --> 02:12:42.050
<v Speaker 2>And so again,</v>

4321
02:12:42.051 --> 02:12:42.741
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're like,</v>

4322
02:12:42.741 --> 02:12:43.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm now the guy in the,</v>

4323
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:44.310
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

4324
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:45.170
<v Speaker 2>the Leopard singlet,</v>

4325
02:12:45.171 --> 02:12:45.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4326
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:46.701
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

4327
02:12:46.701 --> 02:12:47.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4328
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4329
02:12:47.691 --> 02:12:48.511
<v Speaker 2>more and more,</v>

4330
02:12:48.511 --> 02:12:48.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4331
02:12:48.650 --> 02:12:48.910
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

4332
02:12:48.910 --> 02:12:52.250
<v Speaker 2>we're going to understand that this is just has to be part of everybody's</v>

4333
02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:53.113
<v Speaker 2>toolkit.</v>

4334
02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:53.961
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4335
02:12:53.961 --> 02:12:56.630
<v Speaker 2>it would be amazing if they taught kids that in school,</v>

4336
02:12:56.690 --> 02:12:59.330
<v Speaker 2>if you have to learn that when you're learning math and history,</v>

4337
02:12:59.331 --> 02:12:59.991
<v Speaker 2>people are doing that.</v>

4338
02:12:59.991 --> 02:13:03.100
<v Speaker 2>But my wife actually does that really in high school.</v>

4339
02:13:03.810 --> 02:13:04.520
<v Speaker 2>Six-Year-Olds.</v>

4340
02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:05.420
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

4341
02:13:05.450 --> 02:13:05.930
<v Speaker 2>You can teach,</v>

4342
02:13:05.930 --> 02:13:07.880
<v Speaker 2>you can teach mindfulness to.</v>

4343
02:13:07.930 --> 02:13:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean in the beginning,</v>

4344
02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:14.680
<v Speaker 2>what they're learning is just basic awareness of their inner lives are like just</v>

4345
02:13:14.690 --> 02:13:19.690
<v Speaker 2>being able to name the emotion they're feeling is an amazing capacity and a six</v>

4346
02:13:20.781 --> 02:13:25.781
<v Speaker 2>year old and a six year old is just acting out something and you're now teaching</v>

4347
02:13:25.881 --> 02:13:26.510
<v Speaker 2>them to,</v>

4348
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:31.510
<v Speaker 2>to know in that moment that what's pushing them from behind his sadness or anger</v>

4349
02:13:33.630 --> 02:13:35.130
<v Speaker 2>or embarrassment or cycling.</v>

4350
02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Just to be able to have that recursive ability to reflect.</v>

4351
02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:42.600
<v Speaker 2>That's already a major gain in,</v>

4352
02:13:42.601 --> 02:13:43.110
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

4353
02:13:43.110 --> 02:13:43.880
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

4354
02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:44.011
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4355
02:13:44.011 --> 02:13:44.731
<v Speaker 2>kids that age.</v>

4356
02:13:44.731 --> 02:13:44.971
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

4357
02:13:44.971 --> 02:13:46.110
<v Speaker 2>you can learn it very early.</v>

4358
02:13:46.130 --> 02:13:46.471
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

4359
02:13:46.471 --> 02:13:50.370
<v Speaker 2>this was something I was talking about with Stephen Fry on,</v>

4360
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:53.750
<v Speaker 2>on my podcast as Steven was very scared and he,</v>

4361
02:13:53.751 --> 02:13:54.031
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

4362
02:13:54.031 --> 02:13:54.864
<v Speaker 2>he's actually,</v>

4363
02:13:55.380 --> 02:13:56.040
<v Speaker 2>he's adorable.</v>

4364
02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:57.930
<v Speaker 2>He's starting the blog cast.</v>

4365
02:13:57.931 --> 02:14:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoyed that is just,</v>

4366
02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:03.210
<v Speaker 2>you're in the presence of just such a nice guy.</v>

4367
02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Guys radiates you no decency.</v>

4368
02:14:05.950 --> 02:14:06.783
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4369
02:14:06.930 --> 02:14:07.763
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

4370
02:14:07.770 --> 02:14:08.130
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

4371
02:14:08.130 --> 02:14:08.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4372
02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:09.660
<v Speaker 2>fairly skeptical of just like,</v>

4373
02:14:09.661 --> 02:14:13.070
<v Speaker 2>why would you ever have to train mindfulness or meditation and I mean,</v>

4374
02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:16.170
<v Speaker 2>the analogy that came up came up to me,</v>

4375
02:14:16.230 --> 02:14:20.460
<v Speaker 2>he came up for me on the fly there was that it is actually a lot like learning</v>

4376
02:14:20.461 --> 02:14:24.380
<v Speaker 2>to read in the sense that none of us remember having the,</v>

4377
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:27.390
<v Speaker 2>having gone through the ordeal of learning to read right now,</v>

4378
02:14:27.391 --> 02:14:29.280
<v Speaker 2>that learning to read was a hassle,</v>

4379
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4380
02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Like that did not come easily to most people and he had now is just now you,</v>

4381
02:14:34.021 --> 02:14:37.890
<v Speaker 2>if you look at a page of text in a language you understand you can't help but</v>

4382
02:14:37.891 --> 02:14:38.490
<v Speaker 2>decode it,</v>

4383
02:14:38.490 --> 02:14:38.701
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4384
02:14:38.701 --> 02:14:39.534
<v Speaker 2>It's just effortless.</v>

4385
02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:40.800
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

4386
02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:41.041
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4387
02:14:41.041 --> 02:14:45.930
<v Speaker 2>this is these kinds of emotional tools and cognitive tools,</v>

4388
02:14:45.931 --> 02:14:46.231
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>

4389
02:14:46.231 --> 02:14:49.380
<v Speaker 2>the ability to self regulate emotion in,</v>

4390
02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:51.570
<v Speaker 2>by becoming aware of it as a process,</v>

4391
02:14:52.180 --> 02:14:52.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4392
02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:57.210
<v Speaker 2>that is something that I think we could teach kids much earlier and then we</v>

4393
02:14:57.211 --> 02:14:58.740
<v Speaker 2>would be in the presence of,</v>

4394
02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:02.670
<v Speaker 2>of young adults who would naturally have a facility,</v>

4395
02:15:02.671 --> 02:15:04.620
<v Speaker 2>a facility for it that,</v>

4396
02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:05.490
<v Speaker 2>where they won't even,</v>

4397
02:15:05.490 --> 02:15:07.770
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't even remember how hard it was to acquire it.</v>

4398
02:15:08.380 --> 02:15:08.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4399
02:15:08.730 --> 02:15:11.380
<v Speaker 2>What it was talking about earlier with Mike Tyson and you know,</v>

4400
02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:12.270
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

4401
02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:13.920
<v Speaker 2>his coaching and his,</v>

4402
02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:18.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean he essentially got mental coaching on how to accomplish one thing,</v>

4403
02:15:19.070 --> 02:15:22.770
<v Speaker 2>a mental coaching on how to have the perfect mindset for one thing.</v>

4404
02:15:22.770 --> 02:15:23.100
<v Speaker 2>How to,</v>

4405
02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:23.790
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>

4406
02:15:23.790 --> 02:15:24.870
<v Speaker 2>how to kick people's ass.</v>

4407
02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:29.340
<v Speaker 2>What he didn't have was mental coaching on how to deal with the pressures of</v>

4408
02:15:29.341 --> 02:15:29.970
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

4409
02:15:29.970 --> 02:15:30.930
<v Speaker 2>especially live.</v>

4410
02:15:30.931 --> 02:15:31.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4411
02:15:31.190 --> 02:15:35.460
<v Speaker 2>and almost no one really understands what life is like to be a famous 20 year</v>

4412
02:15:35.461 --> 02:15:37.470
<v Speaker 2>old heavyweight champion of the world.</v>

4413
02:15:37.530 --> 02:15:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4414
02:15:37.950 --> 02:15:40.120
<v Speaker 2>there's no one had to be salient.</v>

4415
02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4416
02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:41.310
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be alien.</v>

4417
02:15:41.550 --> 02:15:46.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean at the end to ask this kid to manage this state when you know you're</v>

4418
02:15:46.141 --> 02:15:51.141
<v Speaker 2>talking about someone who just six years prior was virtually homeless and had no</v>

4419
02:15:52.141 --> 02:15:57.141
<v Speaker 2>love in his life at all and was being hypnotized by some madman who a,</v>

4420
02:15:57.640 --> 02:15:57.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4421
02:15:57.931 --> 02:16:02.931
<v Speaker 2>a boxing wizard who lives in the catskills and did what we were talking about</v>

4422
02:16:03.031 --> 02:16:07.380
<v Speaker 2>earlier about who you are now versus who you were 20,</v>

4423
02:16:07.381 --> 02:16:09.390
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago when you meet Mike Tyson.</v>

4424
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson is the sweetest,</v>

4425
02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:12.121
<v Speaker 2>nicest,</v>

4426
02:16:12.121 --> 02:16:13.140
<v Speaker 2>friendliest guy.</v>

4427
02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:14.790
<v Speaker 2>He's so soft spoken.</v>

4428
02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.170
<v Speaker 2>He's really kind.</v>

4429
02:16:16.171 --> 02:16:17.250
<v Speaker 2>He hugs people.</v>

4430
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:18.660
<v Speaker 2>He's a really nice guy,</v>

4431
02:16:18.990 --> 02:16:19.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4432
02:16:19.321 --> 02:16:22.680
<v Speaker 2>and at one point in time he was the scariest motherfucker on the planet earth.</v>

4433
02:16:23.610 --> 02:16:23.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4434
02:16:23.881 --> 02:16:24.421
<v Speaker 2>There's actually,</v>

4435
02:16:24.421 --> 02:16:27.210
<v Speaker 2>there's another sort of uncanny valley here in,</v>

4436
02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:31.570
<v Speaker 2>in martial arts training that I spend a lot of time in when you're training in</v>

4437
02:16:31.571 --> 02:16:36.571
<v Speaker 2>martial arts and seeing the world through this lens of violence and potential</v>

4438
02:16:36.641 --> 02:16:37.121
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>

4439
02:16:37.121 --> 02:16:41.560
<v Speaker 2>but you're training in a way that's never really putting your skills to the</v>

4440
02:16:41.561 --> 02:16:41.981
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>

4441
02:16:41.981 --> 02:16:42.400
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

4442
02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:43.121
<v Speaker 2>you're basically,</v>

4443
02:16:43.121 --> 02:16:43.810
<v Speaker 2>you're as a,</v>

4444
02:16:43.810 --> 02:16:44.830
<v Speaker 2>as a young man,</v>

4445
02:16:45.370 --> 02:16:48.910
<v Speaker 2>you're living with this fundamental uncertainty as to whether or not you</v>

4446
02:16:48.911 --> 02:16:50.530
<v Speaker 2>actually are capable of anything.</v>

4447
02:16:50.750 --> 02:16:52.540
<v Speaker 2>So you're training like fake martial arts,</v>

4448
02:16:52.541 --> 02:16:52.701
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4449
02:16:52.701 --> 02:16:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4450
02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Or at least martial arts where most of it is it kind of pantomime of violence</v>

4451
02:16:57.851 --> 02:16:58.930
<v Speaker 2>and it's not being pressured,</v>

4452
02:16:58.931 --> 02:16:59.261
<v Speaker 2>tested.</v>

4453
02:16:59.261 --> 02:17:00.280
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like you were,</v>

4454
02:17:00.281 --> 02:17:02.800
<v Speaker 2>you're competing and you know what it's like to kick someone in the head and it</v>

4455
02:17:02.801 --> 02:17:03.431
<v Speaker 2>actually works,</v>

4456
02:17:03.431 --> 02:17:03.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4457
02:17:03.670 --> 02:17:05.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is your sparring,</v>

4458
02:17:05.591 --> 02:17:06.550
<v Speaker 2>but it's all,</v>

4459
02:17:06.940 --> 02:17:08.020
<v Speaker 2>you have to keep everything safe.</v>

4460
02:17:08.050 --> 02:17:08.321
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4461
02:17:08.321 --> 02:17:09.154
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4462
02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:09.993
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4463
02:17:10.090 --> 02:17:11.200
<v Speaker 2>or even if it's full contact,</v>

4464
02:17:11.201 --> 02:17:13.750
<v Speaker 2>you have headgear and you've got this just like you're not.</v>

4465
02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:18.100
<v Speaker 2>There's still basic uncertainty about what's going to go down on the street,</v>

4466
02:17:18.101 --> 02:17:18.370
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

4467
02:17:18.370 --> 02:17:18.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4468
02:17:18.970 --> 02:17:22.510
<v Speaker 2>if it's in the presence of real violence and they are your,</v>

4469
02:17:23.310 --> 02:17:23.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4470
02:17:23.690 --> 02:17:25.060
<v Speaker 2>especially as a teenager,</v>

4471
02:17:25.540 --> 02:17:30.540
<v Speaker 2>you're in this fairly toxic state of like sort of always preparing for violence</v>

4472
02:17:31.301 --> 02:17:32.134
<v Speaker 2>that is still is in,</v>

4473
02:17:32.170 --> 02:17:32.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4474
02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:33.580
<v Speaker 2>in most people's lives,</v>

4475
02:17:33.970 --> 02:17:36.820
<v Speaker 2>a pretty low order of probability that it's going to occur.</v>

4476
02:17:37.450 --> 02:17:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4477
02:17:38.110 --> 02:17:40.030
<v Speaker 2>and yet it's all,</v>

4478
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:42.850
<v Speaker 2>it's also backed by this fear of,</v>

4479
02:17:43.690 --> 02:17:43.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4480
02:17:43.991 --> 02:17:47.660
<v Speaker 2>you just kind of the ego fear of maybe you're just full of Shit and you're just</v>

4481
02:17:47.670 --> 02:17:47.840
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

4482
02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:48.940
<v Speaker 2>you're just gonna get your ass kicked.</v>

4483
02:17:48.941 --> 02:17:49.990
<v Speaker 2>If this ever happens.</v>

4484
02:17:49.991 --> 02:17:51.430
<v Speaker 2>And with someone like,</v>

4485
02:17:51.450 --> 02:17:51.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4486
02:17:51.850 --> 02:17:52.790
<v Speaker 2>someone who's a real,</v>

4487
02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:54.580
<v Speaker 2>obviously someone like Mike Tyson,</v>

4488
02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:55.870
<v Speaker 2>there shouldn't,</v>

4489
02:17:55.870 --> 02:17:58.780
<v Speaker 2>there shouldn't be any uncertainty about like,</v>

4490
02:17:58.781 --> 02:18:00.640
<v Speaker 2>he's got nothing to prove these in a bar.</v>

4491
02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:01.391
<v Speaker 2>And somebody says,</v>

4492
02:18:01.391 --> 02:18:01.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4493
02:18:01.630 --> 02:18:02.463
<v Speaker 2>what are you looking at?</v>

4494
02:18:03.130 --> 02:18:06.550
<v Speaker 2>At minimum he doesn't have this fear of like if he,</v>

4495
02:18:06.551 --> 02:18:08.380
<v Speaker 2>if he walks away from that challenge,</v>

4496
02:18:08.830 --> 02:18:10.780
<v Speaker 2>he knows he's walking away,</v>

4497
02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:12.250
<v Speaker 2>not because he was scared,</v>

4498
02:18:12.251 --> 02:18:12.790
<v Speaker 2>maybe he,</v>

4499
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:14.440
<v Speaker 2>he's going to lose a fistfight with this guy,</v>

4500
02:18:14.441 --> 02:18:14.681
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4501
02:18:14.681 --> 02:18:16.360
<v Speaker 2>He's the best boxer on earth at that moment.</v>

4502
02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:17.270
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4503
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:18.280
<v Speaker 2>it's that he's,</v>

4504
02:18:18.350 --> 02:18:18.730
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

4505
02:18:18.730 --> 02:18:20.500
<v Speaker 2>he's got way more to lose than the other guy.</v>

4506
02:18:20.530 --> 02:18:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Like I felt like,</v>

4507
02:18:21.010 --> 02:18:23.890
<v Speaker 2>why does he want to be rolling around in the parking lot with some stranger,</v>

4508
02:18:23.891 --> 02:18:24.640
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

4509
02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:25.450
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4510
02:18:25.450 --> 02:18:26.283
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4511
02:18:26.710 --> 02:18:27.543
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>

4512
02:18:27.610 --> 02:18:28.230
<v Speaker 2>So there's this,</v>

4513
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:31.210
<v Speaker 2>this is a very unhappy place that a lot of martial artists are in,</v>

4514
02:18:31.211 --> 02:18:32.044
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

4515
02:18:32.590 --> 02:18:32.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4516
02:18:32.951 --> 02:18:37.930
<v Speaker 2>they don't actually know what they are capable of and they're living all the</v>

4517
02:18:37.931 --> 02:18:39.400
<v Speaker 2>time with this,</v>

4518
02:18:39.630 --> 02:18:40.040
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4519
02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:40.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4520
02:18:40.380 --> 02:18:43.390
<v Speaker 2>just kind of training software running in their heads and it's,</v>

4521
02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:44.321
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4522
02:18:44.321 --> 02:18:44.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4523
02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:45.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird space to be in.</v>

4524
02:18:46.180 --> 02:18:46.511
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4525
02:18:46.511 --> 02:18:48.790
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things that's so great about Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>

4526
02:18:48.970 --> 02:18:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4527
02:18:49.510 --> 02:18:50.470
<v Speaker 2>The Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</v>

4528
02:18:50.471 --> 02:18:53.230
<v Speaker 2>You mean you're not getting punched and you're not getting kicked,</v>

4529
02:18:53.231 --> 02:18:57.280
<v Speaker 2>but you are absolutely going full blast and you have 100 percent confidence when</v>

4530
02:18:57.281 --> 02:19:01.080
<v Speaker 2>she reached a certain level that you could do that to an untrained person within</v>

4531
02:19:01.090 --> 02:19:01.990
<v Speaker 2>his frame.</v>

4532
02:19:02.450 --> 02:19:03.730
<v Speaker 2>You are pressure testing it,</v>

4533
02:19:03.770 --> 02:19:05.060
<v Speaker 2>you know that it works now.</v>

4534
02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:05.903
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>

4535
02:19:06.340 --> 02:19:11.230
<v Speaker 2>I would argue there people still lose sight of the fact that in reality people,</v>

4536
02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:14.140
<v Speaker 2>people are punching and they're not training a lot of punching or defense.</v>

4537
02:19:14.141 --> 02:19:17.230
<v Speaker 2>And then there are weapons and then there's the guy's friend who can come up and</v>

4538
02:19:17.231 --> 02:19:18.280
<v Speaker 2>start kicking you in your head.</v>

4539
02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Just so you know,</v>

4540
02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:19.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4541
02:19:19.410 --> 02:19:22.570
<v Speaker 2>like how good an idea was it to pull guard when you know someone else can walk</v>

4542
02:19:22.571 --> 02:19:23.300
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

4543
02:19:23.300 --> 02:19:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4544
02:19:23.710 --> 02:19:25.390
<v Speaker 2>but you know.</v>

4545
02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:26.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4546
02:19:26.111 --> 02:19:26.711
<v Speaker 2>It's within,</v>

4547
02:19:26.711 --> 02:19:28.670
<v Speaker 2>it's within its purview.</v>

4548
02:19:28.671 --> 02:19:28.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4549
02:19:28.971 --> 02:19:29.510
<v Speaker 2>You're not the,</v>

4550
02:19:29.510 --> 02:19:29.671
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

4551
02:19:29.671 --> 02:19:32.240
<v Speaker 2>you're working out all of your illusions and that's,</v>

4552
02:19:32.380 --> 02:19:32.710
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

4553
02:19:32.710 --> 02:19:35.690
<v Speaker 2>that's one reason why so many of us find it addictive.</v>

4554
02:19:35.850 --> 02:19:36.100
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

4555
02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:36.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4556
02:19:36.461 --> 02:19:36.941
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>

4557
02:19:36.941 --> 02:19:41.620
<v Speaker 1>And there's also the so nice Jujitsu people are so friendly and I think that's</v>

4558
02:19:41.621 --> 02:19:42.880
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why they're so friendly.</v>

4559
02:19:42.881 --> 02:19:45.880
<v Speaker 1>They're not carrying around all that bullshit that a lot of people carry around,</v>

4560
02:19:45.881 --> 02:19:46.600
<v Speaker 1>including,</v>

4561
02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:47.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4562
02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:50.380
<v Speaker 1>there's some grown men that have never been in a fight in their life and they</v>

4563
02:19:50.381 --> 02:19:53.320
<v Speaker 1>get a couple of beers in them and they start talking crazy shit came in.</v>

4564
02:19:53.321 --> 02:19:54.430
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know how to fight.</v>

4565
02:19:54.910 --> 02:19:55.180
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

4566
02:19:55.180 --> 02:19:56.260
<v Speaker 1>What do you see?</v>

4567
02:19:56.590 --> 02:19:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Someone who wants to jump into a nascar race.</v>

4568
02:19:58.931 --> 02:19:59.950
<v Speaker 1>He never driven a car,</v>

4569
02:20:00.220 --> 02:20:03.220
<v Speaker 1>like stop talking to some guy with cauliflower ear.</v>

4570
02:20:03.450 --> 02:20:04.211
<v Speaker 1>Even know what that means.</v>

4571
02:20:04.211 --> 02:20:05.044
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4572
02:20:05.380 --> 02:20:06.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4573
02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:06.581
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4574
02:20:06.581 --> 02:20:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4575
02:20:07.180 --> 02:20:09.910
<v Speaker 1>to be a human being is complicated,</v>

4576
02:20:09.911 --> 02:20:14.770
<v Speaker 1>to be a man and in the face of altercations with other men is uniquely</v>

4577
02:20:14.771 --> 02:20:15.604
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

4578
02:20:15.890 --> 02:20:16.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4579
02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:20.830
<v Speaker 1>the kind of altercations that men get into the kind of bravado and chest puffing</v>

4580
02:20:20.831 --> 02:20:23.560
<v Speaker 1>and shit talking and the consequences of those things.</v>

4581
02:20:23.561 --> 02:20:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Like you were talking about Liam Neeson,</v>

4582
02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:27.760
<v Speaker 1>his wife falling down and hitting her head.</v>

4583
02:20:28.090 --> 02:20:33.090
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine was working in a bar and in Long Island and one of the bouncers</v>

4584
02:20:33.191 --> 02:20:35.020
<v Speaker 1>got in a fight with some guy and punched the guy,</v>

4585
02:20:35.021 --> 02:20:35.681
<v Speaker 1>knocked him out.</v>

4586
02:20:35.681 --> 02:20:36.514
<v Speaker 1>The guy fell back,</v>

4587
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:38.080
<v Speaker 1>hit his head off the curb and died,</v>

4588
02:20:38.590 --> 02:20:40.100
<v Speaker 1>and that happens all the time.</v>

4589
02:20:40.150 --> 02:20:41.320
<v Speaker 1>When people get knocked out,</v>

4590
02:20:41.321 --> 02:20:42.190
<v Speaker 1>they hit their head on the ground.</v>

4591
02:20:42.191 --> 02:20:42.890
<v Speaker 1>They die.</v>

4592
02:20:42.890 --> 02:20:43.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4593
02:20:43.820 --> 02:20:44.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4594
02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:44.401
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

4595
02:20:44.401 --> 02:20:44.950
<v Speaker 2>I did when I,</v>

4596
02:20:44.950 --> 02:20:46.220
<v Speaker 2>before I had a podcast,</v>

4597
02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:48.600
<v Speaker 2>I was getting my midlife crisis,</v>

4598
02:20:48.601 --> 02:20:53.601
<v Speaker 2>took the form of beginning really back into martial arts again for after a</v>

4599
02:20:53.700 --> 02:20:55.290
<v Speaker 2>hiatus of maybe 25 years.</v>

4600
02:20:56.280 --> 02:20:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

4601
02:20:57.090 --> 02:20:58.370
<v Speaker 2>a lawyer who,</v>

4602
02:20:58.400 --> 02:21:01.980
<v Speaker 2>who focused on kind of self defense law.</v>

4603
02:21:02.130 --> 02:21:02.281
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4604
02:21:02.281 --> 02:21:05.940
<v Speaker 2>he was constantly dealing with cases where someone is either either claiming</v>

4605
02:21:05.941 --> 02:21:08.490
<v Speaker 2>self defense or legit self defense claim,</v>

4606
02:21:09.150 --> 02:21:10.230
<v Speaker 2>but they're basically screwed.</v>

4607
02:21:10.231 --> 02:21:10.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>

4608
02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:14.260
<v Speaker 2>like they punch someone and that person fell down on the hit a fire hydrant and</v>

4609
02:21:14.261 --> 02:21:14.641
<v Speaker 2>died,</v>

4610
02:21:14.641 --> 02:21:15.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4611
02:21:15.100 --> 02:21:15.933
<v Speaker 2>So they're,</v>

4612
02:21:16.140 --> 02:21:17.520
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to beat a murder rap,</v>

4613
02:21:17.610 --> 02:21:18.443
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

4614
02:21:18.510 --> 02:21:21.120
<v Speaker 2>And so I just had him in a blog post,</v>

4615
02:21:21.121 --> 02:21:24.180
<v Speaker 2>had him walk me and I had a bunch of.</v>

4616
02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:25.710
<v Speaker 2>I had two people comment,</v>

4617
02:21:26.490 --> 02:21:27.630
<v Speaker 2>ask questions as well.</v>

4618
02:21:27.631 --> 02:21:28.464
<v Speaker 2>I had um,</v>

4621
02:21:32.180 --> 02:21:32.460

02:21:35.400 --> 02:21:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm a ask questions in this blog post and I had rory Miller who's a self defense</v>

4625
02:21:41.911 --> 02:21:45.360
<v Speaker 2>trainer and just just to try to flesh out all of the things you should be</v>

4626
02:21:45.361 --> 02:21:48.990
<v Speaker 2>thinking about when you're the kind of person who</v>

4627
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:56.030
<v Speaker 2>use at all preparing for the possible eventuality of violence because people who</v>

4628
02:21:56.731 --> 02:22:01.731
<v Speaker 2>trained with guns or own own guns or carry knives or do martial arts don't</v>

4629
02:22:02.490 --> 02:22:06.990
<v Speaker 2>actually understand what happens when,</v>

4630
02:22:07.470 --> 02:22:08.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4631
02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:09.320
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>

4633
02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:12.060
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4634
02:22:12.060 --> 02:22:12.370
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4635
02:22:12.370 --> 02:22:13.310
<v Speaker 2>like in,</v>

4636
02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:13.801
<v Speaker 2>unless you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and this should be your emo to avoid violence at all.</v>

4639
02:22:18.540 --> 02:22:19.800
<v Speaker 2>Virtually any cost,</v>

4640
02:22:19.801 --> 02:22:19.981
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4641
02:22:19.981 --> 02:22:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Like you're always just trying to leave the premises.</v>

4642
02:22:22.650 --> 02:22:24.990
<v Speaker 2>If there's some sort of challenge that could become,</v>

4643
02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:26.700
<v Speaker 2>if that's not your,</v>

4644
02:22:26.760 --> 02:22:27.600
<v Speaker 2>your emo,</v>

4645
02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:32.790
<v Speaker 2>you're just wandering into potential situations where you can find yourself in</v>

4646
02:22:32.791 --> 02:22:35.010
<v Speaker 2>court for having shoved a guy and he,</v>

4647
02:22:35.011 --> 02:22:35.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4648
02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:37.020
<v Speaker 2>fell into the street and got run over,</v>

4649
02:22:37.050 --> 02:22:37.311
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4650
02:22:37.311 --> 02:22:37.530
<v Speaker 2>You're like.</v>

4651
02:22:37.530 --> 02:22:41.610
<v Speaker 2>And then now you're the guy who's looking at the prospect of going to prison</v>

4652
02:22:41.730 --> 02:22:42.130
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

4653
02:22:42.130 --> 02:22:42.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4654
02:22:42.650 --> 02:22:44.790
<v Speaker 2>for a murder or,</v>

4655
02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:45.270
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

4656
02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:45.930
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

4657
02:22:45.930 --> 02:22:46.763
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4658
02:22:47.160 --> 02:22:47.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4659
02:22:47.341 --> 02:22:48.270
<v Speaker 2>second degree murder.</v>

4660
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:50.400
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>

4661
02:22:50.401 --> 02:22:53.040
<v Speaker 2>I had him walk me through all of the INS and outs of all of that.</v>

4662
02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:54.900
<v Speaker 2>It was a fascinating conversation because yeah,</v>

4663
02:22:54.901 --> 02:22:56.040
<v Speaker 2>there are people who,</v>

4664
02:22:56.940 --> 02:22:57.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4665
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:58.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are extreme cases,</v>

4666
02:22:58.770 --> 02:23:00.480
<v Speaker 2>there are women who have shot,</v>

4667
02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:05.100
<v Speaker 2>they're totally crazy husband who's like waving a baseball bat at their heads</v>

4668
02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:09.120
<v Speaker 2>and they're in prison for years for this,</v>

4669
02:23:09.150 --> 02:23:09.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4670
02:23:09.740 --> 02:23:13.350
<v Speaker 2>just real miscarriages of justice where like the like you would think that the,</v>

4671
02:23:14.090 --> 02:23:14.280
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4672
02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:14.610
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4673
02:23:14.610 --> 02:23:15.443
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4674
02:23:15.550 --> 02:23:16.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4675
02:23:16.030 --> 02:23:19.470
<v Speaker 2>it would be very easy to prove that she was in fear for her life in this case.</v>

4676
02:23:19.470 --> 02:23:22.830
<v Speaker 2>And this was a legitimate use of lethal force.</v>

4677
02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:24.750
<v Speaker 2>It's just so hard with no one's there.</v>

4678
02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4679
02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:25.791
<v Speaker 2>If no one's there.</v>

4680
02:23:25.791 --> 02:23:29.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you have eyewitnesses or if it's a public thing that happens and</v>

4681
02:23:29.551 --> 02:23:30.540
<v Speaker 2>there's video of it,</v>

4682
02:23:31.170 --> 02:23:32.160
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

4683
02:23:32.820 --> 02:23:36.090
<v Speaker 2>someone does something to someone and no one's around and you punch someone and</v>

4684
02:23:36.100 --> 02:23:37.920
<v Speaker 2>they get knocked out and they die.</v>

4685
02:23:38.130 --> 02:23:38.491
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

4686
02:23:38.491 --> 02:23:38.641
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4687
02:23:38.641 --> 02:23:40.620
<v Speaker 2>this guy was threatening to kill me.</v>

4688
02:23:40.860 --> 02:23:42.030
<v Speaker 2>He was chasing me.</v>

4689
02:23:42.031 --> 02:23:43.260
<v Speaker 2>He was threatening to kill me.</v>

4690
02:23:43.261 --> 02:23:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I was terrified for my life.</v>

4691
02:23:44.820 --> 02:23:46.020
<v Speaker 2>He lunged towards me.</v>

4692
02:23:46.021 --> 02:23:46.950
<v Speaker 2>I saw the opening,</v>

4693
02:23:46.951 --> 02:23:47.491
<v Speaker 2>I took it,</v>

4694
02:23:47.491 --> 02:23:48.324
<v Speaker 2>and now he's dead.</v>

4695
02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:49.740
<v Speaker 2>You can go to jail forever.</v>

4696
02:23:50.130 --> 02:23:51.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's that.</v>

4697
02:23:51.020 --> 02:23:51.930
<v Speaker 2>That's a reality.</v>

4698
02:23:51.931 --> 02:23:52.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4699
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:55.920
<v Speaker 2>you should absolutely without a doubt avoid violence at all costs,</v>

4700
02:23:56.550 --> 02:23:57.900
<v Speaker 2>but you should also know how to fight.</v>

4701
02:23:58.320 --> 02:24:00.450
<v Speaker 2>I definitely think that's very important.</v>

4702
02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:01.440
<v Speaker 2>It's very important,</v>

4703
02:24:02.780 --> 02:24:04.130
<v Speaker 2>but very few people trained.</v>

4704
02:24:04.170 --> 02:24:06.240
<v Speaker 2>So it's like in the curriculum of,</v>

4705
02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:08.640
<v Speaker 2>of learning how to fight training in,</v>

4706
02:24:08.730 --> 02:24:11.760
<v Speaker 2>in whatever martial art or arts.</v>

4707
02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:14.040
<v Speaker 2>There's in most cases,</v>

4708
02:24:14.041 --> 02:24:18.030
<v Speaker 2>very little time spent training avoidance.</v>

4709
02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:18.600
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4710
02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:18.871
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4711
02:24:18.871 --> 02:24:19.704
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

4712
02:24:19.930 --> 02:24:20.340
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

4713
02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:24.090
<v Speaker 2>that's a real missing piece because that is the most important thing to train.</v>

4714
02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:24.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like,</v>

4715
02:24:25.040 --> 02:24:26.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4716
02:24:26.521 --> 02:24:28.710
<v Speaker 2>especially if you have real skills,</v>

4717
02:24:28.711 --> 02:24:28.981
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4718
02:24:28.981 --> 02:24:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're walking around armed,</v>

4719
02:24:30.810 --> 02:24:31.051
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4720
02:24:31.051 --> 02:24:31.291
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

4721
02:24:31.291 --> 02:24:31.960
<v Speaker 2>that was the one,</v>

4722
02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:36.930
<v Speaker 2>the one in interesting psychological corrective that concealed carry does for</v>

4723
02:24:36.931 --> 02:24:41.040
<v Speaker 2>many people is that once you're squawking around with a gun,</v>

4724
02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:45.540
<v Speaker 2>you realize what the problem of,</v>

4725
02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:46.411
<v Speaker 2>of what,</v>

4726
02:24:46.411 --> 02:24:48.420
<v Speaker 2>what any altercation can become.</v>

4727
02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Like A,</v>

4728
02:24:49.060 --> 02:24:52.350
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get into a shoving match with somebody if you're wearing a</v>

4729
02:24:52.351 --> 02:24:54.970
<v Speaker 2>gun in your belt because you like it.</v>

4730
02:24:55.010 --> 02:24:56.190
<v Speaker 2>If that escalates,</v>

4731
02:24:56.250 --> 02:24:59.340
<v Speaker 2>you're pulling out your gun and then as a decision of whether to kill somebody</v>

4732
02:24:59.420 --> 02:25:00.090
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

4733
02:25:00.090 --> 02:25:01.140
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

4734
02:25:01.220 --> 02:25:02.180
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

4735
02:25:02.220 --> 02:25:04.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a ton of experience in this area,</v>

4736
02:25:04.951 --> 02:25:05.490
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

4737
02:25:05.490 --> 02:25:08.190
<v Speaker 2>for all the firearm training I've done with people,</v>

4738
02:25:08.670 --> 02:25:09.503
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4739
02:25:09.930 --> 02:25:10.411
<v Speaker 2>I just get,</v>

4740
02:25:10.411 --> 02:25:11.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4741
02:25:11.180 --> 02:25:11.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4742
02:25:11.370 --> 02:25:11.541
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4743
02:25:11.541 --> 02:25:16.541
<v Speaker 2>I know like former swat operators who are just out there constantly armed and</v>

4744
02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:23.770
<v Speaker 2>these are like the last guys who are going to get involved in anything.</v>

4745
02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:25.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean they used to be cops,</v>

4746
02:25:25.031 --> 02:25:28.160
<v Speaker 2>but now they don't even feel any burden to police any.</v>

4747
02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like they're just,</v>

4748
02:25:29.860 --> 02:25:30.641
<v Speaker 2>they're retired,</v>

4749
02:25:30.641 --> 02:25:31.780
<v Speaker 2>emphatically retired,</v>

4750
02:25:31.810 --> 02:25:32.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4751
02:25:32.610 --> 02:25:33.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4752
02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:37.210
<v Speaker 2>because they just recognize how haywire anything can go for them.</v>

4753
02:25:37.211 --> 02:25:37.510
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

4754
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:37.930
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

4755
02:25:37.930 --> 02:25:38.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4756
02:25:38.330 --> 02:25:38.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4757
02:25:38.650 --> 02:25:39.130
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

4758
02:25:39.130 --> 02:25:40.810
<v Speaker 2>any process of conflict gets started.</v>

4759
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:41.261
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

4760
02:25:41.261 --> 02:25:44.380
<v Speaker 2>I think this goes back to understanding how to manage your mind.</v>

4761
02:25:44.500 --> 02:25:44.831
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4762
02:25:44.831 --> 02:25:47.800
<v Speaker 2>when the shit hits the fan and things go crazy,</v>

4763
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:48.090
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4764
02:25:48.090 --> 02:25:53.090
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for people to maintain a rational state of mind and things</v>

4765
02:25:54.011 --> 02:25:56.050
<v Speaker 2>can escalate so quickly.</v>

4766
02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:58.600
<v Speaker 2>Things can turn to violence so quickly,</v>

4767
02:25:58.601 --> 02:26:02.200
<v Speaker 2>especially with irrational people or untrained people or people that aren't</v>

4768
02:26:02.201 --> 02:26:07.201
<v Speaker 2>aware of consequences or maybe can't process it well by and the crucial piece</v>

4769
02:26:07.481 --> 02:26:08.314
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

4770
02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:09.153
<v Speaker 2>many</v>

4771
02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:13.570
<v Speaker 2>seasoned fighters and,</v>

4772
02:26:13.660 --> 02:26:14.140
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

4773
02:26:14.140 --> 02:26:19.140
<v Speaker 2>professionals don't have area I would think many don't have is this sort of</v>

4774
02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:20.561
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4775
02:26:20.561 --> 02:26:25.090
<v Speaker 2>this valley where your ego concerns are not worked out.</v>

4776
02:26:25.150 --> 02:26:25.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you,</v>

4777
02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:26.620
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

4778
02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:30.820
<v Speaker 2>when you feel the emotional burden of a loss of face,</v>

4779
02:26:30.910 --> 02:26:31.121
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4780
02:26:31.121 --> 02:26:36.121
<v Speaker 2>So like if Jocko willink is in a bar and someone says something nasty to him or</v>

4781
02:26:36.670 --> 02:26:37.503
<v Speaker 2>to his wife,</v>

4782
02:26:38.650 --> 02:26:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Jocko doesn't have anything to prove.</v>

4783
02:26:41.020 --> 02:26:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Like Jocko knows he's a bad ass,</v>

4784
02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:43.001
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4785
02:26:43.001 --> 02:26:44.590
<v Speaker 2>So jocko knows that he just,</v>

4786
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:47.920
<v Speaker 2>it's time to get out of the bar because he doesn't want to deal with the</v>

4787
02:26:47.921 --> 02:26:49.870
<v Speaker 2>psychopath who doesn't know who he's dealing with.</v>

4788
02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:53.890
<v Speaker 2>A by someone who's not trained like Jocko.</v>

4789
02:26:53.980 --> 02:26:54.813
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4790
02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Could feel that backing down,</v>

4791
02:26:57.401 --> 02:27:00.220
<v Speaker 2>especially back in down in front of your wife or your girlfriend.</v>

4792
02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:05.020
<v Speaker 2>That is such an ego blow that the temptation to get into this,</v>

4793
02:27:05.050 --> 02:27:07.090
<v Speaker 2>this monkey dance with the other person is just,</v>

4794
02:27:07.300 --> 02:27:09.090
<v Speaker 2>is a.</v>

4795
02:27:09.900 --> 02:27:12.910
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to recover from the very dangerous game.</v>

4796
02:27:13.060 --> 02:27:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4797
02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:13.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4798
02:27:13.661 --> 02:27:16.630
<v Speaker 2>And people get into it all the time and I've seen so many people get into it</v>

4799
02:27:16.631 --> 02:27:17.290
<v Speaker 2>that just don't.</v>

4800
02:27:17.290 --> 02:27:18.190
<v Speaker 2>They don't have any cards.</v>

4801
02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Literally bluffing a God damn it,</v>

4802
02:27:21.161 --> 02:27:21.520
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4803
02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:22.600
<v Speaker 2>to stop doing this.</v>

4804
02:27:22.930 --> 02:27:23.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4805
02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:24.190
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4806
02:27:24.190 --> 02:27:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing martial arts my whole life and I'm terrified of fights.</v>

4807
02:27:27.540 --> 02:27:27.881
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

4808
02:27:27.881 --> 02:27:28.511
<v Speaker 2>Fides is like,</v>

4809
02:27:28.511 --> 02:27:32.500
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here before this goes bad when it goes sideways,</v>

4810
02:27:32.950 --> 02:27:33.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4811
02:27:33.310 --> 02:27:34.143
<v Speaker 2>men are just,</v>

4812
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:37.960
<v Speaker 2>we have thousands of years of awful DNA,</v>

4813
02:27:38.340 --> 02:27:38.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4814
02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:39.783
<v Speaker 2>we really do.</v>

4815
02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:41.140
<v Speaker 2>We were violent.</v>

4816
02:27:41.141 --> 02:27:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds of thousands.</v>

4817
02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Millions.</v>

4818
02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Violence was imperative.</v>

4819
02:27:45.310 --> 02:27:46.780
<v Speaker 2>It was imperative for survival.</v>

4820
02:27:46.810 --> 02:27:47.570
<v Speaker 2>You had,</v>

4821
02:27:47.570 --> 02:27:51.040
<v Speaker 2>he had to be able to react and react quickly and yet you had to know what to do</v>

4822
02:27:51.041 --> 02:27:52.050
<v Speaker 2>with your genes are never gonna.</v>

4823
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Make it to the next stage,</v>

4824
02:27:54.100 --> 02:27:54.933
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

4825
02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:56.860
<v Speaker 2>this is a controversial thing to say.</v>

4826
02:27:56.861 --> 02:27:58.000
<v Speaker 2>And I got in trouble,</v>

4827
02:27:58.001 --> 02:27:59.770
<v Speaker 2>or one of my podcast guests,</v>

4828
02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Gavin de Becker,</v>

4829
02:28:00.730 --> 02:28:00.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4830
02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:01.673
<v Speaker 2>the security,</v>

4831
02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:07.080
<v Speaker 2>a guru got in trouble in my podcast talking about the primacy of,</v>

4832
02:28:08.170 --> 02:28:09.220
<v Speaker 2>of intuition here.</v>

4833
02:28:09.290 --> 02:28:10.123
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4834
02:28:10.180 --> 02:28:15.180
<v Speaker 2>our intuitions are actually really good for detecting something that makes us</v>

4835
02:28:16.541 --> 02:28:18.100
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable about another person.</v>

4836
02:28:18.220 --> 02:28:18.521
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4837
02:28:18.521 --> 02:28:19.354
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

4838
02:28:19.570 --> 02:28:22.370
<v Speaker 2>this becomes politically incorrect really fast,</v>

4839
02:28:22.371 --> 02:28:22.581
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4840
02:28:22.581 --> 02:28:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Because it's like,</v>

4841
02:28:23.481 --> 02:28:23.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4842
02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:27.800
<v Speaker 2>if you see a guy on an elevator who makes you uncomfortable,</v>

4843
02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:28.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4844
02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Gavin's advice,</v>

4845
02:28:29.571 --> 02:28:30.090
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>

4846
02:28:30.090 --> 02:28:32.840
<v Speaker 2>I think the real sane advice is just don't get on,</v>

4847
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:36.680
<v Speaker 2>but there are many people who get on just because they want to prove they're not</v>

4848
02:28:36.681 --> 02:28:37.251
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>

4849
02:28:37.251 --> 02:28:37.521
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4850
02:28:37.521 --> 02:28:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Or they're not.</v>

4851
02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.410
<v Speaker 2>It's psych.</v>

4852
02:28:38.410 --> 02:28:38.630
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

4853
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:39.870
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

4854
02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:44.150
<v Speaker 2>I actually know someone who was in a situation like that and it didn't work out</v>

4855
02:28:44.151 --> 02:28:44.450
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

4856
02:28:44.450 --> 02:28:49.130
<v Speaker 2>And so intuition is bad for so many things.</v>

4857
02:28:49.131 --> 02:28:53.180
<v Speaker 2>We have terrible intuitions for statistics and probability theory,</v>

4858
02:28:53.181 --> 02:28:54.620
<v Speaker 2>and it's like word over reliant.</v>

4859
02:28:54.670 --> 02:28:55.390
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

4860
02:28:55.390 --> 02:28:56.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4861
02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.120
<v Speaker 2>whole careers and Nobel prizes have been won on,</v>

4862
02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:00.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4863
02:29:00.020 --> 02:29:05.020
<v Speaker 2>people like Danny Conoman have have shown us how.</v>

4864
02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:08.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not only that our intuitions are bad for,</v>

4865
02:29:08.150 --> 02:29:09.200
<v Speaker 2>for these judgments,</v>

4866
02:29:09.530 --> 02:29:10.700
<v Speaker 2>but the reliably bad,</v>

4867
02:29:10.701 --> 02:29:11.820
<v Speaker 2>and we can understand there's this,</v>

4868
02:29:11.850 --> 02:29:13.760
<v Speaker 2>there's a structure to how bad they are.</v>

4869
02:29:14.300 --> 02:29:19.300
<v Speaker 2>But for judging people who are dangerous,</v>

4870
02:29:20.070 --> 02:29:20.690
<v Speaker 2>who gives us the,</v>

4871
02:29:20.690 --> 02:29:21.170
<v Speaker 2>who makes,</v>

4872
02:29:21.170 --> 02:29:25.160
<v Speaker 2>who makes the hair stand up on the back of our neck for reasons we can't</v>

4873
02:29:25.370 --> 02:29:26.203
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

4874
02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:27.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4875
02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:27.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4876
02:29:27.420 --> 02:29:29.410
<v Speaker 2>for where the eye contact was wrong or though,</v>

4877
02:29:29.460 --> 02:29:32.410
<v Speaker 2>or just the way they were just like a,</v>

4878
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:33.980
<v Speaker 2>what's called a witness check,</v>

4879
02:29:33.981 --> 02:29:34.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4880
02:29:34.191 --> 02:29:38.810
<v Speaker 2>like someone comes up to you and engages you and then they look to,</v>

4881
02:29:39.130 --> 02:29:41.750
<v Speaker 2>they just kind of look to check for witnesses right now.</v>

4882
02:29:41.751 --> 02:29:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Like people don't,</v>

4883
02:29:43.010 --> 02:29:45.980
<v Speaker 2>aren't aware that that's even a thing,</v>

4884
02:29:46.370 --> 02:29:47.203
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4885
02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:52.240
<v Speaker 2>But when like that body language is very salient to us.</v>

4886
02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:53.000
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

4887
02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:53.820
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

4888
02:29:53.820 --> 02:29:54.090
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

4889
02:29:54.090 --> 02:29:55.790
<v Speaker 2>there are hundreds of things like that that,</v>

4890
02:29:56.510 --> 02:29:56.901
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

4891
02:29:56.901 --> 02:29:57.734
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4892
02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:00.920
<v Speaker 2>we immediately feel that prompt,</v>

4893
02:30:01.030 --> 02:30:01.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4894
02:30:01.370 --> 02:30:02.630
<v Speaker 2>an intuitive response.</v>

4895
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:05.840
<v Speaker 2>And these are intuitions that are from a self defense point of view are worth</v>

4896
02:30:05.841 --> 02:30:09.200
<v Speaker 2>listening to because it's like the worst case scenario is you wind up being a</v>

4897
02:30:09.201 --> 02:30:09.740
<v Speaker 2>little rude.</v>

4898
02:30:09.740 --> 02:30:10.680
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

4899
02:30:10.730 --> 02:30:11.021
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

4900
02:30:11.021 --> 02:30:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

4901
02:30:11.220 --> 02:30:11.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4902
02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:12.233
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk,</v>

4903
02:30:12.710 --> 02:30:14.900
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a.</v>

4904
02:30:15.620 --> 02:30:16.220
<v Speaker 2>people are,</v>

4905
02:30:16.220 --> 02:30:16.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4906
02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:21.700
<v Speaker 2>people are very dogmatically being kind of trained to ignore those,</v>

4907
02:30:22.850 --> 02:30:23.900
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of intuitions.</v>

4908
02:30:23.901 --> 02:30:25.430
<v Speaker 2>And what do you think those intuitions are like?</v>

4909
02:30:25.431 --> 02:30:26.600
<v Speaker 2>What do you think intuitions are?</v>

4910
02:30:26.690 --> 02:30:27.620
<v Speaker 2>But when you meet someone,</v>

4911
02:30:27.621 --> 02:30:28.040
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

4912
02:30:28.040 --> 02:30:28.241
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

4913
02:30:28.241 --> 02:30:29.630
<v Speaker 2>this person feels dangerous.</v>

4914
02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:29.901
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4915
02:30:29.901 --> 02:30:30.734
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

4916
02:30:30.770 --> 02:30:31.603
<v Speaker 2>What's happening?</v>

4917
02:30:31.850 --> 02:30:32.031
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4918
02:30:32.031 --> 02:30:33.040
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of it,</v>

4919
02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:33.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4920
02:30:33.980 --> 02:30:36.260
<v Speaker 2>gays detection is a big one.</v>

4921
02:30:36.261 --> 02:30:36.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4922
02:30:36.411 --> 02:30:38.150
<v Speaker 2>we know what people do with their eyes is a,</v>

4923
02:30:38.151 --> 02:30:38.720
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

4924
02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:41.360
<v Speaker 2>is a major variable in just how we feel that,</v>

4925
02:30:41.990 --> 02:30:42.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4926
02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:42.741
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4927
02:30:42.741 --> 02:30:44.060
<v Speaker 2>the relationship is going.</v>

4928
02:30:44.730 --> 02:30:45.563
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4929
02:30:45.650 --> 02:30:48.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's a.</v>

4930
02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:53.720
<v Speaker 2>and there's their micro expressions that we notice in people that were not aware</v>

4931
02:30:53.721 --> 02:30:54.321
<v Speaker 2>of noticing,</v>

4932
02:30:54.321 --> 02:30:54.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4933
02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:55.251
<v Speaker 2>but like there's just,</v>

4934
02:30:55.251 --> 02:30:55.670
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

4935
02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:56.370
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

4936
02:30:56.370 --> 02:30:57.860
<v Speaker 2>this is not well understood.</v>

4937
02:30:58.470 --> 02:30:59.303
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4938
02:30:59.600 --> 02:31:03.050
<v Speaker 2>and we're bad judges of whether someone is telling the truth.</v>

4939
02:31:03.051 --> 02:31:03.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4940
02:31:03.201 --> 02:31:03.470
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4941
02:31:03.470 --> 02:31:04.880
<v Speaker 2>this has been fairly well studied.</v>

4942
02:31:04.881 --> 02:31:05.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are people who,</v>

4943
02:31:06.330 --> 02:31:08.840
<v Speaker 2>even people who work for the FBI or not,</v>

4944
02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:09.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4945
02:31:09.290 --> 02:31:12.140
<v Speaker 2>much better than chance and detecting whether somebody is lying.</v>

4946
02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:14.060
<v Speaker 2>But that's just,</v>

4947
02:31:14.061 --> 02:31:17.330
<v Speaker 2>we get so much information by,</v>

4948
02:31:17.570 --> 02:31:17.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4949
02:31:17.920 --> 02:31:22.920
<v Speaker 2>body language and being somebody's presence and we get it so fast that it's,</v>

4950
02:31:24.151 --> 02:31:24.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4951
02:31:24.540 --> 02:31:25.130
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

4952
02:31:25.130 --> 02:31:26.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean there,</v>

4953
02:31:27.390 --> 02:31:28.770
<v Speaker 2>whether we understand it or not,</v>

4954
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:31.200
<v Speaker 2>they're evolutionary reasons why this is so.</v>

4955
02:31:31.201 --> 02:31:31.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4956
02:31:31.411 --> 02:31:31.520
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

4957
02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:35.040
<v Speaker 2>if we've evolved for anything as social primates,</v>

4958
02:31:35.490 --> 02:31:40.490
<v Speaker 2>we have evolved to detect stuff that just is a precursor to violent intent in,</v>

4959
02:31:42.620 --> 02:31:43.340
<v Speaker 2>in others.</v>

4960
02:31:43.340 --> 02:31:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's just gaze or do you think you can send the energy of someone?</v>

4961
02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:51.210
<v Speaker 2>There's certain movements that people make when they're thinking about hitting</v>

4962
02:31:51.211 --> 02:31:51.360
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

4963
02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:51.751
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

4964
02:31:51.751 --> 02:31:52.021
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4965
02:31:52.021 --> 02:31:52.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4966
02:31:52.210 --> 02:31:54.360
<v Speaker 2>There's certain like there's like a twitchiness to them.</v>

4967
02:31:54.361 --> 02:31:57.750
<v Speaker 2>I got while pulled back like almost like a spring or a bow.</v>

4968
02:31:57.960 --> 02:32:00.780
<v Speaker 2>There's like a feeling you get around people that are looking to hit people.</v>

4969
02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:00.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4970
02:32:00.961 --> 02:32:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Well there's again,</v>

4971
02:32:02.101 --> 02:32:03.180
<v Speaker 2>all of that still vision,</v>

4972
02:32:03.181 --> 02:32:03.571
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

4973
02:32:03.571 --> 02:32:03.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4974
02:32:03.860 --> 02:32:04.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean who,</v>

4975
02:32:04.210 --> 02:32:08.130
<v Speaker 2>who knows where to texting pheromones where we could be detecting people's level</v>

4976
02:32:08.131 --> 02:32:09.420
<v Speaker 2>of stress.</v>

4977
02:32:09.421 --> 02:32:10.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean just how to end up there.</v>

4978
02:32:12.100 --> 02:32:12.300
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4979
02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:13.530
<v Speaker 2>and this goes beyond,</v>

4980
02:32:13.531 --> 02:32:16.230
<v Speaker 2>this is beyond just physical violence.</v>

4981
02:32:16.231 --> 02:32:17.064
<v Speaker 2>This is just,</v>

4982
02:32:17.160 --> 02:32:17.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4983
02:32:17.940 --> 02:32:21.330
<v Speaker 2>detecting psychopaths who are being manipulated.</v>

4984
02:32:21.331 --> 02:32:21.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4985
02:32:21.481 --> 02:32:23.150
<v Speaker 2>just detecting mean there,</v>

4986
02:32:23.180 --> 02:32:25.050
<v Speaker 2>there are ways to spot people line,</v>

4987
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.823
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4988
02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:27.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4989
02:32:27.460 --> 02:32:27.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean just,</v>

4990
02:32:27.950 --> 02:32:28.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4991
02:32:28.240 --> 02:32:28.630
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

4992
02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:31.440
<v Speaker 2>they're tells like too much information,</v>

4993
02:32:31.500 --> 02:32:31.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4994
02:32:31.681 --> 02:32:36.150
<v Speaker 2>like people who are giving you support the superfluous information,</v>

4995
02:32:36.760 --> 02:32:37.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4996
02:32:37.480 --> 02:32:37.820
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

4997
02:32:37.820 --> 02:32:41.070
<v Speaker 2>as an overcorrection because they're anticipating that you're going to doubt</v>

4998
02:32:41.130 --> 02:32:45.420
<v Speaker 2>their story and so they're filling in blanks that you don't even need filled in.</v>

4999
02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5000
02:32:45.810 --> 02:32:46.010
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

5001
02:32:46.010 --> 02:32:47.970
<v Speaker 2>and it's the sort of patterns to,</v>

5002
02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:50.340
<v Speaker 2>to sort of to that.</v>

5003
02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:52.020
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

5004
02:32:52.380 --> 02:32:52.660
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

5005
02:32:52.660 --> 02:32:53.070
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

5006
02:32:53.070 --> 02:32:57.120
<v Speaker 2>we pick up on a lot of this stuff without consciously being aware of what's</v>

5007
02:32:57.121 --> 02:32:57.601
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

5008
02:32:57.601 --> 02:33:01.020
<v Speaker 2>We just know that that's not a person I want to spend anymore time with.</v>

5009
02:33:01.050 --> 02:33:01.883
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5010
02:33:01.900 --> 02:33:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5011
02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:03.533
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

5012
02:33:03.630 --> 02:33:06.450
<v Speaker 2>there may be more of a literature on this than I know about,</v>

5013
02:33:06.451 --> 02:33:11.451
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of this is not well understood and people like Paul Ekman have done a</v>

5014
02:33:12.391 --> 02:33:17.391
<v Speaker 2>lot of stuff on micro micro expressions that goes back probably 30 years at this</v>

5015
02:33:20.131 --> 02:33:20.964
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

5016
02:33:21.150 --> 02:33:25.280
<v Speaker 2>And there are people who are outliers who are great at detecting micro</v>

5017
02:33:25.300 --> 02:33:26.400
<v Speaker 2>expressions where they really,</v>

5018
02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:29.370
<v Speaker 2>they really just understand what's going on,</v>

5019
02:33:29.371 --> 02:33:30.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

5020
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.880
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

5021
02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:34.680
<v Speaker 2>and ai eventually will be if it is not there already,</v>

5022
02:33:34.681 --> 02:33:36.630
<v Speaker 2>we'll be much better than we are doing this.</v>

5023
02:33:36.660 --> 02:33:39.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm so scared of that service here that I'm getting that wrong.</v>

5024
02:33:40.590 --> 02:33:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Micro expressions are funny because they remind me of microaggressions,</v>

5025
02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:44.850
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the,</v>

5026
02:33:45.150 --> 02:33:45.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5027
02:33:45.630 --> 02:33:49.260
<v Speaker 2>one of the weirder social justice warrior things like things that used to be</v>

5028
02:33:49.261 --> 02:33:52.080
<v Speaker 2>just slights where someone was just like slightly rude.</v>

5029
02:33:52.081 --> 02:33:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

5030
02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:53.520
<v Speaker 2>not even slice,</v>

5031
02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:54.031
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

5032
02:33:54.031 --> 02:33:54.860
<v Speaker 2>where do you come from?</v>

5033
02:33:54.860 --> 02:33:55.693
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5034
02:33:56.760 --> 02:33:57.593
<v Speaker 2>Speaking with an accent.</v>

5035
02:33:58.130 --> 02:33:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Where are you from?</v>

5036
02:33:59.050 --> 02:33:59.883
<v Speaker 2>Where are your parents from?</v>

5037
02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:01.553
<v Speaker 2>Dare you?</v>

5038
02:34:01.950 --> 02:34:03.690
<v Speaker 2>How dare you question my authenticity?</v>

5039
02:34:04.230 --> 02:34:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5040
02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:05.830
<v Speaker 2>no aggression.</v>

5041
02:34:06.060 --> 02:34:07.740
<v Speaker 2>It's weird that that's actually accepted,</v>

5042
02:34:07.741 --> 02:34:11.640
<v Speaker 2>that this is something that they're actually pushing in certain schools that</v>

5043
02:34:11.641 --> 02:34:13.050
<v Speaker 2>microaggressions are a real,</v>

5044
02:34:13.140 --> 02:34:13.973
<v Speaker 2>a real thing.</v>

5045
02:34:14.220 --> 02:34:17.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm Christina Hoff summers just wrote something about,</v>

5046
02:34:17.670 --> 02:34:18.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5047
02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:18.580
<v Speaker 2>or she,</v>

5048
02:34:18.580 --> 02:34:22.150
<v Speaker 2>she put something on her twitter today about a Yale article that was written</v>

5049
02:34:22.151 --> 02:34:27.151
<v Speaker 2>today that was put out today about documenting politically incorrect behavior.</v>

5050
02:34:28.601 --> 02:34:32.650
<v Speaker 2>So that someday in the future when someone is running for Congress or is up for</v>

5051
02:34:32.651 --> 02:34:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Supreme Court or something that you could go back to their college days.</v>

5052
02:34:36.220 --> 02:34:40.030
<v Speaker 2>And remember when they said something and I mean one of the examples is woman</v>

5053
02:34:40.031 --> 02:34:43.990
<v Speaker 2>uses in this post was compared to a woman to a large animal,</v>

5054
02:34:43.991 --> 02:34:47.890
<v Speaker 2>a woman's body to large animal in a private text message that she should have.</v>

5055
02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:48.641
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5056
02:34:48.641 --> 02:34:49.474
<v Speaker 2>I should have.</v>

5057
02:34:50.350 --> 02:34:53.930
<v Speaker 2>I should've and calls this guy in this,</v>

5058
02:34:53.990 --> 02:34:56.050
<v Speaker 2>this article white boy,</v>

5059
02:34:56.350 --> 02:34:57.760
<v Speaker 2>this white boy does this.</v>

5060
02:34:57.761 --> 02:35:00.250
<v Speaker 2>And the white boy with a saccharin smile does that.</v>

5061
02:35:00.251 --> 02:35:00.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

5062
02:35:00.730 --> 02:35:02.470
<v Speaker 2>which is like overtly racist.</v>

5063
02:35:02.830 --> 02:35:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Like they'll just the expression like in the way she's describing it like a</v>

5064
02:35:07.660 --> 02:35:07.910
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

5065
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:12.790
<v Speaker 2>if this evil character slowly makes his way to run the world and he's been</v>

5066
02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:15.100
<v Speaker 2>engineered since the time he was in college.</v>

5067
02:35:16.220 --> 02:35:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Well that's going to happen just by,</v>

5068
02:35:21.370 --> 02:35:24.190
<v Speaker 2>just based on just based on everyone's use of the tools.</v>

5069
02:35:24.460 --> 02:35:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

5070
02:35:25.150 --> 02:35:28.720
<v Speaker 2>people are not diligently scrubbing their,</v>

5071
02:35:28.970 --> 02:35:33.970
<v Speaker 2>their digital history and there may in fact be no way to actually do it.</v>

5072
02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:34.641
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5073
02:35:34.641 --> 02:35:35.710
<v Speaker 2>And so they're just,</v>

5074
02:35:35.711 --> 02:35:36.550
<v Speaker 2>they're trailing the,</v>

5075
02:35:37.270 --> 02:35:39.700
<v Speaker 2>they're not even aware of what they're trailing in social media,</v>

5076
02:35:39.701 --> 02:35:40.534
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

5077
02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:43.150
<v Speaker 2>so I mean maybe maybe that is,</v>

5078
02:35:43.630 --> 02:35:48.310
<v Speaker 2>that will just be a cure for the problem because at a certain point we'll be</v>

5079
02:35:48.311 --> 02:35:51.070
<v Speaker 2>dealing with people who were basically born.</v>

5080
02:35:51.100 --> 02:35:52.450
<v Speaker 2>They were born on facebook,</v>

5081
02:35:52.610 --> 02:35:52.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5082
02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't even have a moment.</v>

5083
02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Like they've got their baby picture there and everything that followed and</v>

5084
02:36:00.610 --> 02:36:02.800
<v Speaker 2>then it'll just seem completely untenable.</v>

5085
02:36:03.070 --> 02:36:04.720
<v Speaker 2>Like choose people who've everything.</v>

5086
02:36:04.721 --> 02:36:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5087
02:36:04.930 --> 02:36:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Just everyone's guilty.</v>

5088
02:36:05.771 --> 02:36:10.771
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has said that dumb thing matter of taken the worst possible way.</v>

5089
02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:15.460
<v Speaker 2>And if they're going to be hung from that then you know,</v>

5090
02:36:15.540 --> 02:36:15.820
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5091
02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:16.810
<v Speaker 2>no one will survive.</v>

5092
02:36:16.990 --> 02:36:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Well it seems like that's what we're dealing with right now in a lot of cases.</v>

5093
02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:20.973
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5094
02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:22.653
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5095
02:36:23.350 --> 02:36:26.620
<v Speaker 2>what I think is really important that what you were saying earlier was that</v>

5096
02:36:26.621 --> 02:36:30.860
<v Speaker 2>there has to be some sort of path to redeeming themselves that there,</v>

5097
02:36:30.861 --> 02:36:35.080
<v Speaker 2>there has to be some accepted way that someone can go about redeeming themselves</v>

5098
02:36:35.081 --> 02:36:39.580
<v Speaker 2>and we can allow them to reenter society without constantly bringing it up or</v>

5099
02:36:39.581 --> 02:36:40.570
<v Speaker 2>judging them by it.</v>

5100
02:36:40.570 --> 02:36:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Or always a attributing their past behavior to who they are right now.</v>

5101
02:36:45.930 --> 02:36:46.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5102
02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:47.073
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>

5103
02:36:47.410 --> 02:36:48.480
<v Speaker 2>they should be so simple.</v>

5104
02:36:48.490 --> 02:36:50.530
<v Speaker 2>But look at my collaboration with Majid Nawaz,</v>

5105
02:36:50.590 --> 02:36:50.831
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5106
02:36:50.831 --> 02:36:53.860
<v Speaker 2>So like we were on this podcast together.</v>

5107
02:36:54.250 --> 02:36:58.510
<v Speaker 2>Majid was scheming to form a global caliphate.</v>

5108
02:36:58.511 --> 02:36:58.741
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

5109
02:36:58.741 --> 02:36:58.951
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5110
02:36:58.951 --> 02:36:59.980
<v Speaker 2>the organization,</v>

5111
02:36:59.981 --> 02:37:00.611
<v Speaker 2>he was part of him.</v>

5112
02:37:00.611 --> 02:37:02.300
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't a jihadist thankfully,</v>

5113
02:37:02.301 --> 02:37:04.150
<v Speaker 2>and he wasn't actually blowing people up,</v>

5114
02:37:04.690 --> 02:37:08.520
<v Speaker 2>but he was trying to get nuclear weapons in,</v>

5115
02:37:08.530 --> 02:37:13.270
<v Speaker 2>in Pakistan into the hands of the worst possible theocrats right?</v>

5116
02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:14.553
<v Speaker 2>This was his,</v>

5117
02:37:15.470 --> 02:37:18.020
<v Speaker 2>with all of his charisma and all of his energy.</v>

5118
02:37:18.021 --> 02:37:19.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's like a mantra.</v>

5119
02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:20.270
<v Speaker 2>It is fantastic.</v>

5120
02:37:21.140 --> 02:37:25.610
<v Speaker 2>And he used to eight utterly nefarious purpose in my world,</v>

5121
02:37:25.630 --> 02:37:25.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5122
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:26.061
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5123
02:37:26.061 --> 02:37:28.340
<v Speaker 2>if you know how much that is an issue for me,</v>

5124
02:37:28.670 --> 02:37:30.050
<v Speaker 2>it's like Majid Majid,</v>

5125
02:37:30.051 --> 02:37:30.291
<v Speaker 2>nih,</v>

5126
02:37:30.291 --> 02:37:32.240
<v Speaker 2>or are just buddies now,</v>

5127
02:37:32.241 --> 02:37:32.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5128
02:37:32.780 --> 02:37:37.780
<v Speaker 2>So all I need is a clear path that he took out of the darkness to understand why</v>

5129
02:37:39.021 --> 02:37:40.460
<v Speaker 2>he's a valid collaborator.</v>

5130
02:37:40.460 --> 02:37:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

5131
02:37:40.850 --> 02:37:42.770
<v Speaker 2>And actually on that point,</v>

5132
02:37:42.771 --> 02:37:42.950
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5133
02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I've got people breathing down my neck to tell you that we're telling your</v>

5134
02:37:46.221 --> 02:37:46.611
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>

5135
02:37:46.611 --> 02:37:47.510
<v Speaker 2>this is how powerful you are,</v>

5136
02:37:47.511 --> 02:37:48.344
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan.</v>

5137
02:37:49.260 --> 02:37:52.640
<v Speaker 2>That the documentary is coming out on the collaboration and it's,</v>

5138
02:37:52.641 --> 02:37:53.281
<v Speaker 2>it's out now,</v>

5139
02:37:53.281 --> 02:37:54.290
<v Speaker 2>and so it can be found out,</v>

5140
02:37:54.291 --> 02:37:56.750
<v Speaker 2>there is what's called Islam in the future of tolerance.</v>

5141
02:37:56.930 --> 02:37:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

5142
02:37:57.470 --> 02:37:58.303
<v Speaker 2>And it's actually,</v>

5143
02:37:58.350 --> 02:37:59.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not bad.</v>

5144
02:37:59.601 --> 02:38:02.570
<v Speaker 2>It actually captures the spirit of our collaboration very well.</v>

5145
02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:03.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5146
02:38:03.530 --> 02:38:04.430
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

5147
02:38:04.460 --> 02:38:08.720
<v Speaker 2>see it if only to recognize how awesome modular because modular is just a</v>

5148
02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:13.990
<v Speaker 2>superstar and the scariest thing about the state of public opinion in the Muslim</v>

5149
02:38:14.481 --> 02:38:16.730
<v Speaker 2>world from my point of view is just how,</v>

5150
02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:23.750
<v Speaker 2>how hard a job he has to just to have a conversation in that community.</v>

5151
02:38:23.751 --> 02:38:24.291
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>

5152
02:38:24.291 --> 02:38:24.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5153
02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:29.210
<v Speaker 2>he's so marginalized and he's so reasonable,</v>

5154
02:38:29.540 --> 02:38:29.990
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

5155
02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:30.940
<v Speaker 2>But let me take,</v>

5156
02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:32.330
<v Speaker 2>come back to that original point.</v>

5157
02:38:33.620 --> 02:38:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Here's someone who was,</v>

5158
02:38:35.450 --> 02:38:38.940
<v Speaker 2>whose life was purposed toward what,</v>

5159
02:38:39.530 --> 02:38:44.530
<v Speaker 2>what I view as one of the most toxic projects I can think of.</v>

5160
02:38:46.430 --> 02:38:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5161
02:38:46.910 --> 02:38:47.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5162
02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:51.290
<v Speaker 2>give the nuclear weapons to the people who want to die as martyrs.</v>

5163
02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:51.711
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5164
02:38:51.711 --> 02:38:52.700
<v Speaker 2>That's the project,</v>

5165
02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:53.553
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5166
02:38:53.630 --> 02:38:58.630
<v Speaker 2>And Majid has just absolutely awesome collaborator now.</v>

5167
02:38:58.820 --> 02:38:59.031
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5168
02:38:59.031 --> 02:39:00.920
<v Speaker 2>So there's like we have to,</v>

5169
02:39:01.850 --> 02:39:06.850
<v Speaker 2>there has to be a path through some sane conversation to a reboot the wheel.</v>

5170
02:39:08.380 --> 02:39:13.380
<v Speaker 2>The worry though for a lot of folks is that you are not really being honest</v>

5171
02:39:13.701 --> 02:39:13.960
<v Speaker 2>about you,</v>

5172
02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:15.020
<v Speaker 2>who you are currently.</v>

5173
02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:17.510
<v Speaker 2>You just want an excuse for,</v>

5174
02:39:17.540 --> 02:39:17.900
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

5175
02:39:17.900 --> 02:39:19.670
<v Speaker 2>to be relieved.</v>

5176
02:39:19.900 --> 02:39:21.860
<v Speaker 2>It's so clear in some of these cases,</v>

5177
02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:23.330
<v Speaker 2>like it's clear me,</v>

5178
02:39:23.331 --> 02:39:24.051
<v Speaker 2>take him in the norm.</v>

5179
02:39:24.051 --> 02:39:26.420
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald case is just utterly clear.</v>

5180
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:27.703
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5181
02:39:27.770 --> 02:39:28.603
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5182
02:39:28.610 --> 02:39:29.950
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

5183
02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.300
<v Speaker 2>even though it may in Megan Kelly's case,</v>

5184
02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:33.290
<v Speaker 2>utterly clear,</v>

5185
02:39:33.350 --> 02:39:38.090
<v Speaker 2>like I don't think unless she's got some white supremacist side Gig that I,</v>

5186
02:39:38.180 --> 02:39:39.013
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aware of.</v>

5187
02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:40.550
<v Speaker 2>She's just like,</v>

5188
02:39:40.850 --> 02:39:41.331
<v Speaker 2>listened,</v>

5189
02:39:41.331 --> 02:39:42.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm clueless.</v>

5190
02:39:42.201 --> 02:39:42.561
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

5191
02:39:42.561 --> 02:39:42.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5192
02:39:42.741 --> 02:39:43.610
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize.</v>

5193
02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Well they were looking for an excuse to get rid of her honestly.</v>

5194
02:39:46.970 --> 02:39:48.350
<v Speaker 2>But I think that even if they weren't,</v>

5195
02:39:48.351 --> 02:39:50.570
<v Speaker 2>I think that still very likely would have been the end.</v>

5196
02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:53.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like even if her show had had better ratings,</v>

5197
02:39:53.570 --> 02:39:55.970
<v Speaker 2>still that could have been an unrecoverable error.</v>

5198
02:39:56.340 --> 02:40:00.120
<v Speaker 2>What if she was black when it doesn't work the other direction?</v>

5199
02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:02.120
<v Speaker 2>They reverted back and she said,</v>

5200
02:40:02.121 --> 02:40:03.690
<v Speaker 2>what's so bad about blackface?</v>

5201
02:40:04.430 --> 02:40:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Well that she could stay on the air.</v>

5202
02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:08.150
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

5203
02:40:08.270 --> 02:40:09.103
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5204
02:40:09.220 --> 02:40:11.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean it certainly would've been easier.</v>

5205
02:40:14.250 --> 02:40:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5206
02:40:14.780 --> 02:40:15.600
<v Speaker 2>What have overstaying.</v>

5207
02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

5208
02:40:17.250 --> 02:40:19.200
<v Speaker 2>You want to pretend to be Diana Ross because that was the,</v>

5209
02:40:19.201 --> 02:40:19.630
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5210
02:40:19.630 --> 02:40:22.170
<v Speaker 2>the thing was pretending to be Diana Ross for Halloween,</v>

5211
02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:22.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5212
02:40:22.700 --> 02:40:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5213
02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:24.150
<v Speaker 2>You want to be Diana Ross,</v>

5214
02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:24.601
<v Speaker 2>who was I?</v>

5215
02:40:24.601 --> 02:40:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean I got to think they could get away with it,</v>

5216
02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:28.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

5217
02:40:28.900 --> 02:40:30.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was interesting the,</v>

5218
02:40:30.090 --> 02:40:34.080
<v Speaker 2>the thing that happened with Louis ck and Ricky Gervais' and Jerry Seinfeld and</v>

5219
02:40:34.081 --> 02:40:34.914
<v Speaker 2>Chris Rock,</v>

5220
02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:35.753
<v Speaker 2>that was.</v>

5221
02:40:35.850 --> 02:40:37.290
<v Speaker 2>Because I remember when that aired,</v>

5222
02:40:37.350 --> 02:40:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 2011 and I remember there was nothing around that.</v>

5223
02:40:42.241 --> 02:40:42.590
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

5224
02:40:42.590 --> 02:40:43.620
<v Speaker 2>it was totally fine.</v>

5225
02:40:43.621 --> 02:40:43.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5226
02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:44.570
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5227
02:40:44.570 --> 02:40:45.780
<v Speaker 2>They were using the n word.</v>

5228
02:40:45.810 --> 02:40:46.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean the problem,</v>

5229
02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:50.720
<v Speaker 2>the thing that was kind of dishonest about the,</v>

5230
02:40:50.830 --> 02:40:51.150
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5231
02:40:51.150 --> 02:40:56.150
<v Speaker 2>the re scandalizing of it was that in the context of that conversation,</v>

5232
02:40:57.150 --> 02:40:58.890
<v Speaker 2>it was framed by</v>

5233
02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:01.381
<v Speaker 2>the fact that they,</v>

5234
02:41:01.381 --> 02:41:06.260
<v Speaker 2>they really were ref referencing one of the more famous pieces of comedy and in</v>

5235
02:41:06.300 --> 02:41:07.200
<v Speaker 2>history and they read,</v>

5236
02:41:07.230 --> 02:41:10.380
<v Speaker 2>they were referencing Chris Rock's act using the n word.</v>

5237
02:41:10.610 --> 02:41:15.610
<v Speaker 2>They're the black people and then their ends and you Louis Rnn,</v>

5238
02:41:15.720 --> 02:41:16.051
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5239
02:41:16.051 --> 02:41:16.151
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

5240
02:41:16.151 --> 02:41:16.650
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

5241
02:41:16.650 --> 02:41:17.940
<v Speaker 2>you're the only white guy I know who.</v>

5242
02:41:18.390 --> 02:41:19.500
<v Speaker 2>And then they're.</v>

5243
02:41:19.501 --> 02:41:23.970
<v Speaker 2>So they're talking to in that context and anyway.</v>

5244
02:41:23.971 --> 02:41:24.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5245
02:41:24.121 --> 02:41:24.241
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

5246
02:41:24.241 --> 02:41:26.310
<v Speaker 2>it was interesting how that almost,</v>

5247
02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:30.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean that blew back against ricky and one of those things where they're just</v>

5248
02:41:30.961 --> 02:41:33.090
<v Speaker 2>looking for more things to be mad at Louis for.</v>

5249
02:41:33.630 --> 02:41:33.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5250
02:41:33.931 --> 02:41:34.530
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

5251
02:41:34.530 --> 02:41:35.370
<v Speaker 2>but ricky was also,</v>

5252
02:41:36.090 --> 02:41:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I think Chris Rock was a lot of shit.</v>

5253
02:41:38.461 --> 02:41:38.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5254
