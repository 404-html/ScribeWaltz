<v Speaker 1>These socks are acceptable sucks either </v>

46
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.490

<v Speaker 1>ball on rabbit tail on the end,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you've shorts barely covered your junk.</v>

51
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now everybody's shorts go down on their </v>

52
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>knees and their socks are nonexistent </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

53
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 1>but the short to coming back up and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like that.</v>

54
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I know there's a,</v>

55
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of that and then they</v>

56
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:27.411
<v Speaker 1>said that's the anti man man who's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with his masculinity and </v>

57
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 1>those hips to Douche bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they like literally wearing like the </v>

58
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 1>old running shorts with the slit going </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the side,</v>

59
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>like Macho Comacho.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

60
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck's wearing those?</v>

61
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Not a bunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've just seen enough and you just </v>

62
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.071
<v Speaker 1>look at the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they literally look like </v>

63
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>they're going to go do some Ron Burgundy</v>
<v Speaker 1>sketch or something,</v>

64
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's how they walk around and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>act like,</v>

65
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just I liked these shorts.</v>

66
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I put a picture of my sneakers and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>socks on instagram the other day,</v>

67
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>which is not a smart move anyway.</v>

68
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Like why did I even do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just went running for three miles in </v>

69
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.471
<v Speaker 1>my sneakers and socks recover with dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the amount of people to shed a my </v>

70
00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>socks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

71
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:02.910
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with it?</v>

72
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>If they covered it rankles that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That what's wrong with those socks?</v>

73
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.260

<v Speaker 1>but I don't know,</v>

74
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:10.010
<v Speaker 1>but there is something wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

75
00:03:10.011 --> 00:03:11.500

76
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.810
<v Speaker 1>That ribbon around the ribbed for her </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure at the top and then like your </v>

77
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:21.030
<v Speaker 1>sneakers to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That looks like some shit.</v>

80
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>My wife would appreciate if it was on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>canvas,</v>

81

<v Speaker 1>modern art thing.</v>

83
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.950

<v Speaker 1>that way much like life and then they </v>

84
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.950
<v Speaker 1>intersect,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

88
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Older women with like ridiculously weird</v>

94
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

95
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 1>the color of the frames is always some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>some statements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

97
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Some splash of color to let you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have a personality or maybe on</v>

98
00:04:11.031 --> 00:04:12.880
<v Speaker 1>this usage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably just intimidated.</v>

99
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not intimidated.</v>

100
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>It's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went there and there.</v>

101
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a,</v>

102
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 1>there was a box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a plexiglass box on the ground.</v>

103
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.460
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And amber plexiglass box and I thought </v>

104
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.521
<v Speaker 1>it was like some sort of a like maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand and then like the exhibit's going </v>

105
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:29.521
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

106

<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>

107
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The box was the art.</v>

108
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.020
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

109
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Nothing in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every art form has that.</v>

110
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Every art form has their plastic box </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

111

184
00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:51.611
<v Speaker 1>other day of Elon Musk from 1998 when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was first becoming a billionaire and a,</v>

185
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.340
<v Speaker 1>he bought a million dollar car and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had his million dollar car delivered </v>

186
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 1>with his girlfriend at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got rid of,</v>

<v Speaker 1>My girlfriend put her in the trunk,</v>

188
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:07.270

<v Speaker 1>dollar car delivered.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Have you seen what he's doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The boring company.</v>

196
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:23.780

<v Speaker 1>Where they make like electric jets or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's gonna bore these earthquake proof </v>

200
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.041
<v Speaker 1>tunnels and they're going to put sleds </v>
<v Speaker 1>on these tunnels that go 125 miles an </v>

201
00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:37.370
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you drive onto the sled,</v>

202
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.400
<v Speaker 1>it locks you in and it shoots you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>like downtown La to wherever the fuck </v>

203
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 1>you're going in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

204
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Is this it Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is how it works.</v>

205
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.610
<v Speaker 1>You drive onto this sled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it drops you down,</v>

206
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:56.650
<v Speaker 1>guy just gets it lists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It drops you down below the surface of </v>

207
00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

208
00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 1>one of these others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

209
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.460
<v Speaker 1>These are sleds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your car is amazing.</v>

210
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 1>I want that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna happen,</v>

211
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 1>this crazy fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna make it and these sleds,</v>

212
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't crash into anybody so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can go stupid fast.</v>

213
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 1>So they're going 125 miles an hour now.</v>

214
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they're created by men.</v>

215
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 1>So at some point somebody is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not tighten something down.</v>

216
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those teslas don't have the best service</v>

217
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.200
<v Speaker 1>record as far as or reliability record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris has broke down twice already </v>

218
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.840
<v Speaker 1>and I know other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another guy who got one in the handle,</v>

219
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 1>stop coming out like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go near it and handle comes out.</v>

220
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.060
<v Speaker 1>He can break into your own an electric </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

221
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.830
<v Speaker 1>But look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another guy gets to get in.</v>

222
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:41.700
<v Speaker 1>There was going to be align traffic jam </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get onto these fucking things,</v>

223
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:46.170
<v Speaker 1>but look at this passage way system that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's devising is going to be crazy.</v>

224
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.160
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be these passageways </v>
<v Speaker 1>all throughout the bottom of the earth.</v>

225
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.610
<v Speaker 1>So underneath the surface of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Los Angeles will be on the streets,</v>

226
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.830
<v Speaker 1>but of course it's going to cave in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

227
00:09:55.831 --> 00:09:56.250
<v Speaker 1>It's going to.</v>

228
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.730
<v Speaker 1>It's got to somehow compromise the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

229
00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:59.430
<v Speaker 1>The city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

230
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.170
<v Speaker 1>All those building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting on top of it.</v>

231
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if anybody can figure it </v>

232
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.470
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be.</v>

233
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that's beyond my pay grade </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

234
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.010
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:13.011
<v Speaker 1>is most more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even more amazing than that is that </v>

236
00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:15.081
<v Speaker 1>Japanese built billionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like the Japanese Charles </v>

237
00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:15.081
<v Speaker 1>Bronson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go back,</v>

238
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I love Charles Bronson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does a little bit.</v>

239
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Speaker 1>He looks tough like Charles Bronson and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mechanic.</v>

240
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Like that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen all his fucking movie.</v>

241
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I love all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

242
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've even watched his Cologne ad that he</v>

243
00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:27.650
<v Speaker 1>did over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

244
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.070
<v Speaker 1>What he saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he saw the,</v>

245
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:31.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw the softest side of.</v>

246
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's taking his shirt off.</v>

247
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 1>You spin it around this realignment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

248
00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:37.110
<v Speaker 1>It was very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Charles Bronson.</v>

249
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:41.370
<v Speaker 1>That's back when stars would do for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason only in this country.</v>

250
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:46.370
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hurt your career if you did a </v>

251
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:46.370
<v Speaker 1>commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could always overseas,</v>

252
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something like that you could just </v>

253
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.440
<v Speaker 1>use to hurt their career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't seem to anymore.</v>

254
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Like not only does it not now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a move.</v>

255
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't you just going up vacuuming,</v>

256
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.070
<v Speaker 1>vacuuming up this cash?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

257
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Like now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>matthew mcconaughey.</v>

258
00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

259
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I nailed it.</v>

260
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.860
<v Speaker 1>He's got to Charles Bronson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to work on the hair though.</v>

261
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.180
<v Speaker 1>He's got the fucking mustache is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little too humble with a smile.</v>

262
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.600
<v Speaker 1>He used to be a little more solemn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just just accept the fact you're a </v>

263
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.261
<v Speaker 1>baller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billionaire pays $110 for a stupid </v>

264
00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:21.261
<v Speaker 1>painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

265
00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going back to what he does look a little</v>

266
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:27.621
<v Speaker 1>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he just doesn't like his picture </v>

267
00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:29.271
<v Speaker 1>taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always looking to give somebody the </v>

268
00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:29.970
<v Speaker 1>benefit of the doubt here or maybe he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing they just spent $110,000,000</v>

269
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:31.620
<v Speaker 1>on a stupid fucking painting and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

270
00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:33.630
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did it sell for the last time?</v>

271
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

272
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.360
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good question.</v>

273
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what he saw and see if he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>find that commercial.</v>

274
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:47.451
<v Speaker 1>The Charles Bronson Cologne commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say that it's got to be </v>

275
00:11:47.451 --> 00:11:51.171
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you tell people that you </v>

276
00:11:51.171 --> 00:11:54.861
<v Speaker 1>bought that and then that's in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>house like didn't nobody learned </v>

<v Speaker 1>piece of art with.</v>

283
00:12:06.331 --> 00:12:11.331
<v Speaker 1>The crazy thing about the Kardashian </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing was that it was in Paris and she </v>

284
00:12:11.331 --> 00:12:14.521
<v Speaker 1>brought security with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had security with her and they </v>

285
00:12:14.521 --> 00:12:14.590
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to get past security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

286
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 1>but everything's better in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't what?</v>

287
00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Everybody says that the criminals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than our security.</v>

288
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 1>There's Charles Bronson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

297
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.100
<v Speaker 4>The guide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That gate.</v>

298
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.090
<v Speaker 4>Good night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mr Bronson sleep tight.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Now we're driving off drives a command.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now all of a sudden it gets,</v>

300
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.280
<v Speaker 4>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>What in the fuck is this?</v>

302
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:18.820
<v Speaker 4>This is a man getting paid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got his pipe on his shirt off.</v>

303
00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:23.470
<v Speaker 4>He's by himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't realize how jack this guy was.</v>

305
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.760
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was probably 60 at the time,</v>

306
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.920
<v Speaker 4>like Charles Bronson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe when he watched him to </v>

307

<v Speaker 4>Tarantino Shit here with shooting guns </v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you,</v>

309
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:42.601
<v Speaker 4>he might've been 60 here because when he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was in hard times he was 50</v>

310
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.260

<v Speaker 1>But then it becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you do when you were there when</v>

348
00:15:26.441 --> 00:15:27.470
<v Speaker 1>it was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the,</v>

349
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

350
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:29.530
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

351
00:15:29.531 --> 00:15:31.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure or whatever.</v>

352
00:15:31.581 --> 00:15:33.740
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually like,</v>

353
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.750
<v Speaker 1>upfront this is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy he was,</v>

354
00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:43.940
<v Speaker 1>he became a movie star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at all this stuff on his </v>

355
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:43.940
<v Speaker 1>coat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must've done something over there.</v>

356
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.620
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a decorated.</v>

357
00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:50.621
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's one of the most decorated </v>

358
00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:50.621
<v Speaker 1>American combat soldiers in World War </v>
<v Speaker 1>Two.</v>

359
00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:53.600
<v Speaker 1>And then a single handedly held off an </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire German.</v>

360
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy ran up with the Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers for an hour.</v>

361
00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

362
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.540
<v Speaker 1>So then he came back and became a movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>star and like people knew he enjoyed a </v>

363
00:16:04.611 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 1>21 year acting career and then it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped.</v>

364
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even like the Congressional </v>

365
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Medal of honor is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people don't win that and they're </v>

366
00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:14.950
<v Speaker 1>still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

367
00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.630
<v Speaker 1>So back then that was like a celebrity </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

368
00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:20.150
<v Speaker 1>you had to hold off an entire platoon </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a German platoon two,</v>

369
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.720
<v Speaker 1>it makes Porsche's and Mercedes like </v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

370
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:28.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their level of guns that they had over </v>

371
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.521
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like our machine guns overheated and </v>

372
00:16:30.521 --> 00:16:30.521
<v Speaker 1>theirs didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you killed a German guy,</v>

373
00:16:30.521 --> 00:16:34.601
<v Speaker 1>you threw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you threw away the American shit and </v>

374
00:16:34.601 --> 00:16:34.601
<v Speaker 1>picked up their stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>

375
00:16:34.601 --> 00:16:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite quotes ever,</v>

376
00:16:34.731 --> 00:16:37.610
<v Speaker 1>one of the German tank commanders was </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying every one of their,</v>

377
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:38.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they,</v>

378
00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:40.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pantsers is that what this was called?</v>

379
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.410
<v Speaker 1>And I was with the Sherman tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a German tiger.</v>

380
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.740
<v Speaker 1>A tiger was worth like four American </v>
<v Speaker 1>tanks,</v>

381
00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:50.741
<v Speaker 1>but the Americans always had five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just totally McDonald's to billions </v>

382
00:16:50.741 --> 00:16:50.960
<v Speaker 1>and billions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah,</v>

383
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.640
<v Speaker 1>we just kept cranking it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like we got them right.</v>

384
00:16:53.641 --> 00:16:55.460
<v Speaker 1>And then they'd always be that last one </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming over the hill.</v>

385
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had some massive canon in world war</v>

386
00:16:58.671 --> 00:17:03.671
<v Speaker 1>one that apparently you took like 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>men to move this enormous fucking cannon</v>

387
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.210
<v Speaker 1>and a Dan Carlin was talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little hard men.</v>

388
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Hardcore history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's 100 blue white men to move it?</v>

389
00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.080
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't let anybody without blue </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes moved.</v>

390
00:17:13.081 --> 00:17:15.320
<v Speaker 1>The thick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did hit live in have blue eyes.</v>

391
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.910
<v Speaker 1>That was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>

392
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.500
<v Speaker 1>He was a dark haired guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

393
00:17:18.501 --> 00:17:20.900
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like a cab driver in Germany.</v>

394
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:27.460
<v Speaker 1>He was everything he hated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the funny thing about it was </v>

395
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:27.460
<v Speaker 1>not a good dancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever saw him do his victory.</v>

396
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Jigs definitely was afraid of dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

397
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm just repeating shit that said </v>
<v Speaker 1>jeopardy.</v>

398
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.710
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing to kind of engineering </v>
<v Speaker 1>that German people have come up with.</v>

399
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.600
<v Speaker 1>When you think about Mercedes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Porsche,</v>

400
00:17:41.601 --> 00:17:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Audi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>BMW,</v>

401
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.920
<v Speaker 1>out of this one part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

402
00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:48.920
<v Speaker 1>and they evidently a lot of the leaders </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt,</v>

403
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.110
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at that fucking cannon.</v>

404
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.560
<v Speaker 5>What is that thing called most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 5>gun ever built?</v>

405
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.460
<v Speaker 5>Heavy Gustov railway gun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they put this thing on.</v>

406
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.210
<v Speaker 5>It looks like it's on tractor tires,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it looks like a tractor.</v>

407
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're there.</v>

408
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.370
<v Speaker 5>I guess they drove this thing up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

409
00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.080
<v Speaker 5>it just had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

410
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.720
<v Speaker 5>just the way Dan Carlin described it as </v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible,</v>

411
00:18:13.721 --> 00:18:16.630
<v Speaker 5>like this unbelievable shockwave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody,</v>

412
00:18:16.631 --> 00:18:21.631
<v Speaker 5>you have to run a mile away when the </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing was going off and plug your ears </v>

413
00:18:22.151 --> 00:18:25.240
<v Speaker 5>up just because it'll blow your eardrums</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally apart.</v>

414
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.490
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

415
00:18:28.491 --> 00:18:31.940
<v Speaker 6>They show this thing going off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's wrong with people?</v>

416
00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.220
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how is war still legal?</v>

417
00:18:34.221 --> 00:18:36.920
<v Speaker 6>I just don't get how that's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

418
00:18:36.921 --> 00:18:39.230
<v Speaker 6>Like I can't walk into a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

419
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.330
<v Speaker 6>it punch somebody in the face if they </v>
<v Speaker 6>punched me,</v>

420
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.000
<v Speaker 6>be like fucking go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But like this shit is like,</v>

421
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.350
<v Speaker 6>can't these leaders just kind of solve </v>
<v Speaker 6>things amongst themselves?</v>

422
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.630
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can't carve it up a little.</v>

423
00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:55.660
<v Speaker 6>Just I listen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You take the Philippines and now you </v>

424
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.560
<v Speaker 6>give us Guam for the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

425
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.230
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

426
00:18:57.231 --> 00:18:58.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>owners of football.</v>

427
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.890
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it amazing that we even have </v>
<v Speaker 5>what's legal and what's not legal?</v>

428
00:19:03.891 --> 00:19:04.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does that mean?</v>

429
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:06.530
<v Speaker 5>Wrote it down on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all agreed,</v>

430
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:11.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean thinking about the shit that </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't isn't legal and the fact that war </v>

431
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:12.560
<v Speaker 5>is on that list at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like laws to you.</v>

432
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.730
<v Speaker 5>Like what ones</v>

433
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:19.710
<v Speaker 6>you can't beat the shit out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He can't come into my house and take my </v>

434
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:20.200
<v Speaker 6>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What am I going to do?</v>

435
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.030
<v Speaker 6>What am I honestly going to do about it?</v>

436
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.350
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking about that when I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>watching the UFC this past weekend.</v>

437
00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:31.740
<v Speaker 5>I was watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a frightful beating that Alexander </v>

438
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.430
<v Speaker 5>Gustafson put on glover to share and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was just a ruthless knockout,</v>

439
00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:39.450
<v Speaker 5>just fucking vicious beat down and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>eventually stopped him and I was </v>

440
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.710
<v Speaker 5>thinking it's kind of crazy that these </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys agreed to do this.</v>

441
00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:47.010
<v Speaker 5>They agree to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody signs away and then you go do </v>

442
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:47.070
<v Speaker 5>something that anywhere else in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world you would get locked down.</v>

443
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:47.490
<v Speaker 5>You arrested.</v>

444
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.780
<v Speaker 6>That happens in hockey every once in </v>
<v Speaker 6>awhile where somebody goes too far and </v>

445
00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.750
<v Speaker 6>then the government gets involved.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

446
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what do they do if you hit somebody</v>

447
00:19:57.751 --> 00:20:02.751
<v Speaker 6>in the head with a stick that goes </v>
<v Speaker 6>outside the boundaries of a setting,</v>

448
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:05.390
<v Speaker 6>the tone that seems like a pussy move </v>
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>

449
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 6>Hit Him with a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're supposed to punch.</v>

450
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.560
<v Speaker 6>It's so weird when you got the stick in </v>
<v Speaker 6>your hand,</v>

451
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:17.060
<v Speaker 6>you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it just the shit that you sometimes </v>

452
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.060
<v Speaker 6>think of doing it each other in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>balls.</v>

453
00:20:18.061 --> 00:20:20.950
<v Speaker 6>They fucking whack at the bay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no padding behind your legs.</v>

454
00:20:20.951 --> 00:20:23.880
<v Speaker 6>And just imagine that just taken,</v>
<v Speaker 6>taking a would stick it just ah,</v>

455
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.150
<v Speaker 6>with NHL level strength and just given </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone a two hander,</v>

456
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.490
<v Speaker 6>the backlight they break people's finger</v>
<v Speaker 6>crosby on was,</v>

457
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:30.870
<v Speaker 6>took somebody's finger off this year.</v>

458
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.500
<v Speaker 5>If they get too far,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

459
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:37.700
<v Speaker 5>if it gets really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they just opened the rules up a </v>

460
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:37.700
<v Speaker 5>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what's gonna Happen?</v>

461
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.051
<v Speaker 5>They're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bring in figure skaters and they're </v>

462
00:20:41.051 --> 00:20:42.961
<v Speaker 5>going to teach them taekwondo and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to cut people's fucking </v>

463
00:20:42.961 --> 00:20:42.961
<v Speaker 5>heads off the</v>

464
00:20:42.961 --> 00:20:45.220
<v Speaker 6>skates.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>

465
00:20:45.221 --> 00:20:46.550
<v Speaker 6>you're spinning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

466
00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 6>If you ever learned how to skate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd</v>

467
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.320
<v Speaker 1>be fucking dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever did that with skates on,</v>

468
00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:51.520
<v Speaker 1>that would be it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

469
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 1>If you teach that to somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach that to somebody with skates.</v>

470
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:57.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you could hit someone with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey stick,</v>

471
00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.740
<v Speaker 1>why can't you hit him on skate on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line here?</v>

472
00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Can hit them with this slip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it.</v>

473
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Somebody does it to you now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They slashed and they do stuff like </v>

474
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:06.480
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't club somebody over.</v>

475
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean even slashing so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

476
00:21:07.631 --> 00:21:10.450
<v Speaker 1>I'll just slash your leg out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you rather have?</v>

477
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Would you rather have tickets get hit by</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of wood and you don't have a </v>

478
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.300
<v Speaker 1>bruise there or have somebody slashy </v>
<v Speaker 1>with escape?</v>

479
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I would absolutely rather get hit by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of wood,</v>

480
00:21:18.371 --> 00:21:19.930
<v Speaker 1>but I shouldn't get hit by the piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wood.</v>

481
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't play hockey,</v>

482
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:23.290
<v Speaker 1>but if I did play hockey I'd be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>pissed.</v>

483
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:28.290
<v Speaker 1>If somebody hit me with a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I built like you fucking pussy and I'd </v>

484
00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.190
<v Speaker 1>want to hit a like the second coming of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thai Domi.</v>

485
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:34.230
<v Speaker 1>You have the exact same build.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking guy who somehow was like </v>

486
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:39.450
<v Speaker 1>my height and was considered a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight fighter and he's the guy </v>

487
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.150
<v Speaker 1>according to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came up with the,</v>

488
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.530
<v Speaker 1>grab them by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

489
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:50.710
<v Speaker 1>right underneath your collar and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn all the way sideways because he </v>

490
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:51.610
<v Speaker 1>didn't have the reach advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

491
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:56.820
<v Speaker 1>And then he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would wait for them to throw he duck </v>

492
00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:56.820
<v Speaker 1>under and then come over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Dude,</v>

493
00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met him one time,</v>

494
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.190
<v Speaker 1>great fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

495
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.900
<v Speaker 1>he's got these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has like your hands,</v>

496
00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:02.980
<v Speaker 1>use your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make like that.</v>

497
00:22:02.981 --> 00:22:04.600
<v Speaker 1>It turns into a hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

498
00:22:04.601 --> 00:22:09.601
<v Speaker 1>He has like these inexplicable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like bare fucking pause and I might be a</v>

499
00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:11.710
<v Speaker 1>little taller than him.</v>

500
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.450
<v Speaker 1>And I remember when he's tried to show </v>
<v Speaker 1>me when he grabbed the front of my shirt</v>

501
00:22:16.451 --> 00:22:17.440
<v Speaker 1>to show me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

502
00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:19.700
<v Speaker 1>I literally felt like an adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a flashback.</v>

503
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I hope this guy doesn't snap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's one of the,</v>

504
00:22:22.291 --> 00:22:24.580
<v Speaker 1>like these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the toughest guys that ever,</v>

505
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever played.</v>

506
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

507
00:22:26.951 --> 00:22:28.840
<v Speaker 1>when Rocky Marciano was the heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion,</v>

508
00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:32.890
<v Speaker 1>he was the only 185 pounds is 185 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was 5:10.</v>

509
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.130
<v Speaker 1>He was the heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because it wasn't Tim Horton's on</v>

510
00:22:36.131 --> 00:22:41.131
<v Speaker 1>everybody's every fucking corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't feed and cows the other </v>

511
00:22:41.131 --> 00:22:41.220
<v Speaker 1>cows and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had needed.</v>

512
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.110
<v Speaker 1>See what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids hit puberty at like eight.</v>

513
00:22:44.111 --> 00:22:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Now you got to like teach them how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shave.</v>

514
00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what is in a hormones.</v>

515
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what it is,</v>

516
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:54.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's no lump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monsanto change their,</v>

517
00:22:54.161 --> 00:22:55.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their name.</v>

518
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.430
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they know?</v>

519
00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what shit that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the genius of it.</v>

520
00:22:59.681 --> 00:23:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Because then you don't know it the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

521
00:23:01.691 --> 00:23:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Halliburton changed the same way Nissan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nissan changed from,</v>

522
00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.550
<v Speaker 1>from Dotson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

523
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:07.420
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

524
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.460
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wonder why they do that.</v>

525
00:23:09.461 --> 00:23:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Dotson do made some good cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

526
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:12.850
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always go over the cliff.</v>

527
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Toyota did that too with Alexis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dots and I want to get fucking sued.</v>

528
00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Honda and Toyota in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both do the same thing.</v>

529
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.650
<v Speaker 1>They have this weird division where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a luxury brand for Americans.</v>

530
00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:25.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't do like Acura and Honda.</v>

531
00:23:25.631 --> 00:23:28.630
<v Speaker 1>They don't do that in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you buy an Nsx in Japan,</v>

532
00:23:28.631 --> 00:23:30.640
<v Speaker 1>which the top end car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a Honda.</v>

533
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a Honda Nsx.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

534
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.880
<v Speaker 1>But in America we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

535
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.110
<v Speaker 1>you need something.</v>

536
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:35.890
<v Speaker 1>You need a better name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

537
00:23:35.891 --> 00:23:40.891
<v Speaker 1>but we have this space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you saying that they can't get a </v>

538
00:23:40.891 --> 00:23:40.891
<v Speaker 1>luxury car over there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

539
00:23:40.891 --> 00:23:40.960
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

540
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.500
<v Speaker 1>They changed the name in America because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>

541
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.930
<v Speaker 1>We don't want buy a Toyota.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We assume a Toyota is a cheap car.</v>

542
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 1>So they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

543
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.730
<v Speaker 1>well we're going to make a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>brand of Toyota and call it a lexis.</v>

544
00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:53.450
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

545
00:23:53.451 --> 00:23:55.100
<v Speaker 1>we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So long as he changed the name.</v>

546
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

547
00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:01.230
<v Speaker 1>I always list literally gonna make up </v>
<v Speaker 1>without any research that because they </v>

548
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:03.950
<v Speaker 1>weren't an island want to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have anywhere to drive,</v>

549
00:24:03.951 --> 00:24:05.960
<v Speaker 1>so they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't let them fast cars.</v>

550
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Even that guy with $110,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to buy a picture,</v>

551
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.860
<v Speaker 1>it's got nowhere to go now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has like a civic.</v>

552
00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.870
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't spend his money on cars,</v>

553
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.130
<v Speaker 1>so that's why buys the art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a car guy though,</v>

554
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have pretty fast cars.</v>

555
00:24:20.841 --> 00:24:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have ridiculously fast cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the GTR.</v>

556
00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:24.710
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the fastest cars in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

557
00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.240
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never been there.</v>

558
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.650
<v Speaker 1>So you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

559
00:24:27.651 --> 00:24:32.651
<v Speaker 1>I just started to listen to what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying and then then that whole </v>

560
00:24:32.651 --> 00:24:32.651
<v Speaker 1>theory developed in my head.</v>

561
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Japan is small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that small.</v>

562
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:37.510
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it isn't.</v>

<v Speaker 6>But it isn't work though.</v>

578
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:19.600

<v Speaker 6>like it takes a year to make,</v>

579
00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:21.310
<v Speaker 6>but how much does it take?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How long does it take you?</v>

580
00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.410
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you just keep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you rewrite and then you watch and </v>

588
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.390
<v Speaker 6>stuff and it doesn't play and then you </v>
<v Speaker 6>rewrite it and it just.</v>

589
00:25:46.391 --> 00:25:47.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it takes a year,</v>

590
00:25:47.231 --> 00:25:52.231
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It takes like 10 months and then the </v>

591
00:25:52.231 --> 00:25:53.611
<v Speaker 6>last two months is just going okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Deciding on strategies on how they're </v>

592
00:25:53.611 --> 00:25:58.231
<v Speaker 6>going to a promoted,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which amazed me because I'm like,</v>

593
00:25:58.961 --> 00:26:03.961
<v Speaker 6>well we'll fucking do what we always do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like this business just changes so </v>

594
00:26:03.961 --> 00:26:07.351
<v Speaker 6>rapidly that even how we promoted it </v>
<v Speaker 6>when it first came out in December 2015,</v>

595
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is almost 2016.</v>

596
00:26:10.451 --> 00:26:15.451
<v Speaker 6>So now we're in 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's a bunch of other stuff has </v>

597
00:26:15.451 --> 00:26:16.840
<v Speaker 6>changed since then.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I don't know like what,</v>

598
00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.070
<v Speaker 6>what's changed?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you mean?</v>

599
00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.160
<v Speaker 6>I fucking knew you were gonna ask me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>

600
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll just let you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

601
00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.310
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more questions.</v>

602
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:29.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would just go in like they brought </v>

603
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:29.950
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they</v>

604
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:29.950
<v Speaker 6>brought me in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe this is my standup special.</v>

605
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.470
<v Speaker 6>That's why they brought me in and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>showed.</v>

606
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:37.950
<v Speaker 6>They basically showed me how everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 6>Netflix screen is different.</v>

607
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 6>Like yours is different than your </v>
<v Speaker 6>homepage is different because it's all </v>

608
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 6>there just watching you watch</v>

609
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.070
<v Speaker 1>tv or they got this fucking thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>watches it.</v>

610
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:52.071
<v Speaker 1>So the only way our screen within our </v>
<v Speaker 1>top whatever be the exact same as if we </v>

611
00:26:52.071 --> 00:26:54.570
<v Speaker 1>watch the exact same shit at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

612
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:56.460
<v Speaker 1>And maybe even the same age group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea,</v>

613
00:26:56.461 --> 00:26:58.810
<v Speaker 1>but I was blown away by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just thought like,</v>

614
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would look and be,</v>

615
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.620
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my specials on,</v>

616
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.630
<v Speaker 1>on the cover of Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

617
00:27:03.631 --> 00:27:04.830
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on the cover of yours.</v>

618
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:10.730
<v Speaker 1>And whoever else is in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that vibe of like you're gonna like </v>

619
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:15.441
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have three different profiles of one </v>

620
00:27:15.441 --> 00:27:15.450
<v Speaker 1>profile and then I have one profile for </v>
<v Speaker 1>each of my kids.</v>

621
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I see different stuff.</v>

622
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.430
<v Speaker 1>So I see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I go to my kid's homepage,</v>

623
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:23.070
<v Speaker 1>like if they want to watch a show that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they watch and I go there,</v>

624
00:27:23.071 --> 00:27:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I see just a bunch of little kids show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever see anything that I watch.</v>

625
00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I go to mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see house,</v>

626
00:27:27.361 --> 00:27:32.361

<v Speaker 1>the car special as the other people's </v>

627
00:27:32.361 --> 00:27:32.361
<v Speaker 1>specials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

628
00:27:32.361 --> 00:27:32.361
<v Speaker 1>that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

629
00:27:32.361 --> 00:27:33.360
<v Speaker 1>they're very smart with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithms.</v>

630
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:36.120
<v Speaker 1>But what I don't like is this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>thumbs up,</v>

631
00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:37.590
<v Speaker 1>thumbs down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

632
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

633
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.340
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was joking about that on my podcast.</v>

634
00:27:41.341 --> 00:27:44.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Adolf Hitler,</v>

635
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:47.460
<v Speaker 1>thumbs down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>orange juice after brushing your teeth,</v>

636
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:48.240
<v Speaker 1>thumbs down.</v>

637
00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.340
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

638
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Ice Cream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thumbs up threesome with supermodel.</v>

639
00:27:56.491 --> 00:27:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Thumbs up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

640
00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

641
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Did they really do that because of Amy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schumer.</v>

642
00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:02.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

643
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.270
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>

644
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.730
<v Speaker 1>That was already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

645
00:28:04.731 --> 00:28:06.440
<v Speaker 1>they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they do that?</v>

646
00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.880
<v Speaker 1>The hemophilia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're that fucking big,</v>

647
00:28:08.881 --> 00:28:13.881
<v Speaker 1>you can't make decisions that quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody wanted it to be done for </v>

648
00:28:13.881 --> 00:28:14.150
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Identify.</v>

649
00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

650
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.140
<v Speaker 1>they got to bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The star system is a perfect system.</v>

651
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

652
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Has been using it forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

653
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is this star is starts.</v>

654
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Somebody told me the star system only </v>
<v Speaker 1>applies.</v>

655
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like geared towards what you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

656
00:28:29.191 --> 00:28:34.191
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck would they know that that </v>

657
00:28:34.191 --> 00:28:36.021
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I heard that that's not the </v>

658
00:28:36.021 --> 00:28:36.021
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's basically just a,</v>

659
00:28:36.021 --> 00:28:36.900
<v Speaker 1>an average of all the people.</v>

660
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Just like on Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to Amazon and you look at </v>

661
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.481
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see five stars and you see 175 </v>

662
00:28:44.481 --> 00:28:44.481
<v Speaker 1>reviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

663
00:28:44.481 --> 00:28:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But somebody told me that wasn't the </v>

664
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:48.900
<v Speaker 1>star system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't that.</v>

665
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:48.960
<v Speaker 1>See if he could find that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

666
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said the star system was based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on whether or not you would like it.</v>

667
00:28:52.771 --> 00:28:54.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems ridiculous because I've never</v>

668
00:28:54.361 --> 00:28:55.980
<v Speaker 1>rented a fucking thing in my life on </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

669
00:28:56.070 --> 00:29:01.070
<v Speaker 1>On netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get any of these places and I </v>

670
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.470
<v Speaker 1>don't understand how any of them fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

671
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.750
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go old school,</v>

672
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.390
<v Speaker 1>like I just tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever I'm doing,</v>

673
00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I try to make it as funny as I possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>can and try to work with the best people</v>

674
00:29:10.741 --> 00:29:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I possibly can and then just hope it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sticks.</v>

675
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.170
<v Speaker 1>If it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can always just keep telling jokes.</v>

676
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to tell you.</v>

677
00:29:18.301 --> 00:29:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fuck when I took that meeting with</v>

678
00:29:21.841 --> 00:29:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even like,</v>

679
00:29:23.281 --> 00:29:26.400
<v Speaker 1>this is a jerk off meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did I drive all the way over here to</v>

680
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:31.430
<v Speaker 1>fucking have a meeting on how to promote</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit and when they sat down and </v>

681
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Speaker 1>they were done with the presentation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always am.</v>

682
00:29:31.921 --> 00:29:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I allowed to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't do the men in black thing</v>

683
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:40.581
<v Speaker 1>to me before I walk out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I forget all that was fucking </v>

684
00:29:40.581 --> 00:29:40.581
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking amazing.</v>

685
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Like the with which every goddamn like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not one drop of water that rolls</v>

686
00:29:46.691 --> 00:29:47.820
<v Speaker 1>off the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd like their,</v>

687
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.890
<v Speaker 1>they're catching it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they,</v>

688
00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not wired that way.</v>

689
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Well that's probably good though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only so much</v>

690
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.670
<v Speaker 5>time of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like just to think about being funny and</v>

691
00:29:57.671 --> 00:30:00.790
<v Speaker 5>just concentrate and stay in your lanes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably the best option anyway</v>

692
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.460
<v Speaker 1>is that I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's working for me.</v>

693
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's working for me.</v>

694
00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:09.511
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithms and then there's also a </v>

695
00:30:09.511 --> 00:30:12.961
<v Speaker 1>certain level of known that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to get to because then it stops </v>

696
00:30:12.961 --> 00:30:14.980
<v Speaker 1>being fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Tom Cruise does A.</v>

697
00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well early Tom Cruise.</v>

698
00:30:17.501 --> 00:30:22.501
<v Speaker 1>It was fun to be that famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before social media and everybody </v>

699
00:30:22.501 --> 00:30:25.441
<v Speaker 1>had a camera that they could pull out </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Charles Bronson and that alone </v>

700
00:30:25.441 --> 00:30:27.700
<v Speaker 1>commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it just becomes.</v>

701
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.850
<v Speaker 1>It's just something completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

702
00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Like when we started in this business </v>
<v Speaker 1>like being famous</v>

703
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:38.170
<v Speaker 5>court side seats and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at the shock and mountains of blow.</v>

704
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.660
<v Speaker 5>Here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It says Netflix star systems.</v>

705
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:44.260
<v Speaker 5>Star Star ratings were personalized and </v>
<v Speaker 5>had been from the start.</v>

706
00:30:44.261 --> 00:30:48.160
<v Speaker 5>That means when you saw a movie on </v>
<v Speaker 5>Netflix rated four stars didn't mean the</v>

707
00:30:48.161 --> 00:30:50.470
<v Speaker 5>average of all the ratings were forced </v>
<v Speaker 5>ours,</v>

708
00:30:50.471 --> 00:30:55.471
<v Speaker 5>and instead it meant that Netflix </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought you'd rate it four stars based </v>

709
00:30:55.471 --> 00:30:56.560
<v Speaker 5>on your habits and other people's </v>
<v Speaker 5>ratings,</v>

710
00:30:56.561 --> 00:31:01.561
<v Speaker 5>but many people didn't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how the fuck was Amy Schumer's </v>

711
00:31:01.561 --> 00:31:02.140
<v Speaker 5>Onestar?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody gave it one star.</v>

712
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:03.190
<v Speaker 5>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How's that work?</v>

713
00:31:03.191 --> 00:31:08.191
<v Speaker 5>That was Sandinista rebels just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just all got on and then they </v>

714
00:31:08.191 --> 00:31:09.180
<v Speaker 5>threatened the people that liked her </v>
<v Speaker 5>specialty.</v>

715
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:10.360
<v Speaker 5>That's how it went down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

716
00:31:10.361 --> 00:31:12.370
<v Speaker 5>I guess in that case what they did was </v>
<v Speaker 5>they just said,</v>

717
00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:14.350
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Greenpeace attacked by so many,</v>

718
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.230
<v Speaker 5>it just ruined all my chances for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rest.</v>

719
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.170
<v Speaker 5>I did this joke about trees and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>just didn't like it.</v>

720
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.590
<v Speaker 5>And that's it for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That works.</v>

721
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.530
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a whole new world.</v>

722
00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

723
00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:35.340
<v Speaker 5>that seems weird though to me that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't like let it actually be rated </v>

724
00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:41.030
<v Speaker 5>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ratings were personalized based on </v>

725
00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:44.280
<v Speaker 5>the shit that you liked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But how the fuck do they know what you </v>

726
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:44.280
<v Speaker 5>like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just know what I watched it.</v>

727
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.070
<v Speaker 5>So it's a riddle wrapped up in an </v>
<v Speaker 5>enigma.</v>

728
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.770
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to figure out a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>worldwide.</v>

729
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:50.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to.</v>

730
00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.370
<v Speaker 1>All I know is I went and I took the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting.</v>

731
00:31:52.371 --> 00:31:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking unbelievable.</v>

732
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Or they're on top of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

733
00:31:55.941 --> 00:31:58.100
<v Speaker 1>the weirdest one is Alexa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexa,</v>

734
00:31:58.101 --> 00:31:59.840
<v Speaker 1>the Amazon one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're using it.</v>

735
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.280
<v Speaker 1>The trainings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like a porn star.</v>

736
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

737
00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's a bunch of the stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexa.</v>

738
00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:11.740
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to use that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexa is a thing that you talk to you </v>

739
00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:11.740
<v Speaker 1>like Alexa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play bill burrs album,</v>

740
00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:16.900
<v Speaker 1>and you know I have no sympathy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that bring that in their house </v>

741
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.720
<v Speaker 1>and because those mouth breathing </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking morons will someday will be </v>

742
00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.571
<v Speaker 1>mandatory that I do and get microchipped</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that's going to be the end of </v>

743
00:32:22.571 --> 00:32:24.290
<v Speaker 1>any sort of rebellion and whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck they want to do,</v>

744
00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:29.740
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The emperor can literally fuck a </v>

745
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.421
<v Speaker 1>flounder on TV at that point and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be able to stop any sort of like </v>

746
00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:33.020
<v Speaker 1>fucking any dissent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any dissent.</v>

747
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.730
<v Speaker 1>They'll turn off your chip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is your money.</v>

748
00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.070
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna rebel against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>slip with a slingshot.</v>

749
00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.560
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a rap,</v>

750
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

751
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.070
<v Speaker 5>there's too many mouth breather and </v>
<v Speaker 5>morons being like,</v>

752
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.060
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do I care if somebody,</v>

753

<v Speaker 5>Those people.</v>

755
00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:53.150

756
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:55.271
<v Speaker 5>person when the NSA shit went down and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they found that they were listening to </v>

757
00:32:55.271 --> 00:32:55.271
<v Speaker 5>the calls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guys like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>attacking,</v>

760
00:32:56.901 --> 00:32:58.520
<v Speaker 5>go ahead and listen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing anything wrong,</v>

761
00:32:59.060 --> 00:32:59.600

<v Speaker 5>That's not what it is.</v>

763
00:33:01.461 --> 00:33:04.500
<v Speaker 5>Like anybody could find out your email,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can go in your email,</v>

764
00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:09.530
<v Speaker 5>look at your emails and decide whether </v>
<v Speaker 5>or not you're doing something wrong or </v>

765
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:09.950
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Decide they don't like that.</v>

766
00:33:09.951 --> 00:33:11.630
<v Speaker 5>Once they have that jurisdiction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that could even.</v>

767
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.520
<v Speaker 5>Even if it didn't have anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they could say you did.</v>

768
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely.</v>

769
00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:15.620
<v Speaker 5>Kit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get they.</v>

770
00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.840
<v Speaker 5>They could alter your emails.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could do whatever they want.</v>

771
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.780
<v Speaker 5>That's nobody gets whacked anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People used to get whacked.</v>

772
00:33:20.781 --> 00:33:22.890
<v Speaker 5>You don't get whacked anymore in any </v>
<v Speaker 5>kill.</v>

773
00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:28.260
<v Speaker 5>You though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Will they think that seth rich guy got </v>

774
00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:28.260
<v Speaker 5>killed?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who said paying attention to that?</v>

775
00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.630
<v Speaker 5>Listen to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just talk.</v>

776
00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:35.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm just gonna say you could just kill </v>
<v Speaker 5>them in the media one dick pic.</v>

777
00:33:35.841 --> 00:33:37.250
<v Speaker 5>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is his dick.</v>

778
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.470
<v Speaker 5>I'll give you the conspiracy theory and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I gave you what they know.</v>

779
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:44.500
<v Speaker 5>There's a guy named seth rich.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's apparently a Bernie Sanders </v>

780
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:44.500
<v Speaker 5>supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's working for the DNC.</v>

781
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.810
<v Speaker 5>Found out that the DNC was democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>National Convention.</v>

782
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.650
<v Speaker 5>Natural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

783
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:50.120
<v Speaker 5>National Chanel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

784
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.270
<v Speaker 5>He found out that they were fucking over</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bernie Sanders,</v>

785
00:33:53.271 --> 00:33:57.860
<v Speaker 5>and so he supposedly was giving this </v>
<v Speaker 5>information to wikileaks.</v>

786
00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.070
<v Speaker 5>All that information got out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it hurt Hillary because it turned and it</v>

787
00:34:01.071 --> 00:34:03.860
<v Speaker 5>hurt the DNC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the DNC head of the DNC left,</v>

788
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:07.790
<v Speaker 5>and when she resigned and immediately </v>
<v Speaker 5>went to work for Hillary Clinton.</v>

789
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.910
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy who wiki leaks and there was no</v>

790
00:34:10.911 --> 00:34:13.700
<v Speaker 5>followup because once she resides in </v>
<v Speaker 5>mainstream news.</v>

791
00:34:13.701 --> 00:34:15.170
<v Speaker 5>That's the end of the fucking story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

792
00:34:15.171 --> 00:34:20.171
<v Speaker 5>There was no follow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty outrageous that she </v>

793
00:34:20.171 --> 00:34:20.171
<v Speaker 5>immediately got hired by Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 5>Clinton.</v>

794
00:34:20.171 --> 00:34:20.171
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>

795
00:34:20.171 --> 00:34:21.890
<v Speaker 5>the kid who was as Bernie Sanders </v>
<v Speaker 5>support,</v>

796
00:34:21.891 --> 00:34:24.620
<v Speaker 5>his name is seth rich,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was murdered outside of his house,</v>

797
00:34:24.621 --> 00:34:25.370
<v Speaker 5>4:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the morning.</v>

798
00:34:25.371 --> 00:34:27.410
<v Speaker 5>They said it was a robbery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They left his money.</v>

799
00:34:27.411 --> 00:34:28.730
<v Speaker 5>He left his wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he left his phone,</v>

800
00:34:28.731 --> 00:34:30.590
<v Speaker 5>they left his watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing was taken from him,</v>

801
00:34:30.591 --> 00:34:32.870
<v Speaker 5>but he was shot in the back at 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the morning.</v>

802
00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:38.320
<v Speaker 5>So Julian Assan from wikileaks said that</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are consequences for working with </v>

803
00:34:38.901 --> 00:34:40.660
<v Speaker 5>us and providing us information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're saying,</v>

804
00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.290
<v Speaker 5>are you saying this guy provided him </v>
<v Speaker 5>information?</v>

805
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:44.180
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just what I'm saying,</v>

806
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:46.700
<v Speaker 5>there's calm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's consequences to work with us,</v>

807
00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.270
<v Speaker 5>and then there's this other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kim dot was this famous,</v>

808
00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.080
<v Speaker 5>a multimillionaire internet character </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's hiding.</v>

809
00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.390
<v Speaker 5>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after he lets the information out,</v>

810
00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:01.600
<v Speaker 5>what is the purpose of killing the guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're not going to stop the </v>

811
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.541
<v Speaker 5>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What it is is to stop other people from </v>

812
00:35:04.541 --> 00:35:06.431
<v Speaker 5>doing it because it'll all get creeped </v>
<v Speaker 5>out by to stop what you're saying here </v>

813
00:35:06.431 --> 00:35:10.150
<v Speaker 5>to stop other people from doing it one </v>
<v Speaker 5>and two so that he can't testify on the </v>

814
00:35:10.611 --> 00:35:15.611
<v Speaker 5>depth of all the corruption that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>going on in the DNC and who had </v>

815
00:35:15.611 --> 00:35:16.290
<v Speaker 5>organized it and who had orchestrated </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

816
00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.160
<v Speaker 5>That's what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what the fuck who the.</v>

817
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:21.020
<v Speaker 5>But there's a lot of people that dispute</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

818
00:35:21.021 --> 00:35:26.021
<v Speaker 5>And also there was a redacted FBI report</v>
<v Speaker 5>that people were touting out that turned</v>

819
00:35:26.421 --> 00:35:31.421
<v Speaker 5>out to be bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so now they found out that that was </v>

820
00:35:31.421 --> 00:35:34.361
<v Speaker 5>a fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the FBI report was a bullshit FBI </v>

821
00:35:34.361 --> 00:35:34.361
<v Speaker 5>reports.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they don't know what the fuck's going</v>

822
00:35:34.361 --> 00:35:35.210
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this guy's dead.</v>

823
00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 5>So my point is he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he got whacked whether</v>

824
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 1>or not he got whacked because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>working with.</v>

825
00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.300
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Federal prosecutor found dead.</v>

826
00:35:42.301 --> 00:35:44.170

<v Speaker 1>apparently.</v>

827
00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.800

<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

829

<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

832
00:35:55.801 --> 00:35:57.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

833
00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.580

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially,</v>

923
00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.570
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of them,</v>

924
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.570
<v Speaker 6>the caliber of actors that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the material that they've looked at.</v>

925
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.430
<v Speaker 6>So for them to say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he can tell,</v>

926
00:39:30.431 --> 00:39:31.600
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>anybody can say,</v>

927
00:39:31.601 --> 00:39:32.500
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is great.</v>

928
00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:35.470
<v Speaker 6>But when you really make them laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't fake that.</v>

929
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.610
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I,</v>

930
00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:42.700
<v Speaker 6>I read the table reads of fun because I </v>
<v Speaker 6>think that's more like a standup show </v>

931
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:47.100
<v Speaker 6>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really rehearsed my lines and I make </v>

932
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:47.100
<v Speaker 6>sure that I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

933
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:50.350
<v Speaker 6>I sell the shit out of him because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't have to go back and fix them,</v>

934
00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.410
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they don't work at the table reading,</v>

935
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:56.050
<v Speaker 6>that's something that I did accidentally</v>
<v Speaker 6>early in my career.</v>

936
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.580
<v Speaker 6>And then I learned what a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

937
00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.000
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I learned what a big thing that is,</v>

938
00:40:02.001 --> 00:40:07.001
<v Speaker 6>like the first acting gig that I got,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was doing some small movie or </v>

939
00:40:07.001 --> 00:40:07.001
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

940
00:40:07.001 --> 00:40:10.260
<v Speaker 6>They had a table read and I got there </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I was overly prepared and the lines </v>

941
00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.200
<v Speaker 6>worked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then there was more stuff for me.</v>

942
00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.490
<v Speaker 6>And this guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>

943
00:40:12.491 --> 00:40:17.491
<v Speaker 6>the writers love you man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just selling the shit out of your </v>

944
00:40:17.491 --> 00:40:19.591
<v Speaker 6>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm thinking my head as I was just </v>

945
00:40:19.591 --> 00:40:19.591
<v Speaker 6>trying not to get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I,</v>

946
00:40:19.591 --> 00:40:22.410
<v Speaker 6>then I was able to see how the game </v>
<v Speaker 6>works because there's,</v>

947
00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.330
<v Speaker 6>there's actors that will go to a table </v>
<v Speaker 6>reading if they don't like the material,</v>

948
00:40:25.331 --> 00:40:30.331
<v Speaker 6>they don't sell the stuff and the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they understand how hard </v>

949
00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:33.380
<v Speaker 6>people work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So at least give it a fucking yes.</v>

950
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.260
<v Speaker 6>Swing out of your cleat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>see what happens,</v>

951
00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:40.290
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But to go there and just sort of mumble </v>

952
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:40.290
<v Speaker 6>your way through it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the that's,</v>

953
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:45.060
<v Speaker 6>it's not a good position to get yourself</v>
<v Speaker 6>into as an actor of the whole writing </v>

954
00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:45.060
<v Speaker 6>room.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Writer's room was like,</v>

955
00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:45.060
<v Speaker 6>Oh</v>

956
00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.790
<v Speaker 5>fuck this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

957
00:40:46.791 --> 00:40:50.960
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't that an issue on what was that</v>
<v Speaker 5>girl on one of those cop shows,</v>

958
00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.090
<v Speaker 5>not cop shows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of those hospital shows,</v>

959
00:40:53.091 --> 00:40:58.091
<v Speaker 5>grey's anatomy was that girl said she </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted to be removed from consideration </v>

960
00:40:58.091 --> 00:41:02.290
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the Emmy's because she didn't think </v>

961
00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:02.290
<v Speaker 5>the material is strong enough that year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they were like,</v>

962
00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:02.650
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

963
00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.220
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>

<v Speaker 5>and how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how writers?</v>

966

967
00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:11.340
<v Speaker 5>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

968
00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:15.040
<v Speaker 5>Obviously it had been on a hit show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you're an emmy award winning </v>

986
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:05.270
<v Speaker 5>She's 38.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well basically 10 years ago,</v>

<v Speaker 5>40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>30 eight mean I'm 49.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That 10 years flies by and nobody wants </v>

990
00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:18.410
<v Speaker 5>to do shit with you anymore and now </v>
<v Speaker 5>she's got a tainted word.</v>

<v Speaker 5>She's got a tainted name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

992
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:26.470
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's apparently softened their stance </v>

993
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.470
<v Speaker 5>and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

994
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:28.250
<v Speaker 5>apologized for her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her youthful exuberance.</v>

995
00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.580
<v Speaker 6>But Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're dumb.</v>

1003
00:42:45.741 --> 00:42:45.741
<v Speaker 6>twenties.</v>

1004
00:42:45.741 --> 00:42:45.770
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not like a rash decision.</v>

1005
00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:49.130
<v Speaker 5>That's something that was thought over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Decided,</v>

1006
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:52.800
<v Speaker 5>reinforced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Said it more than one time and then.</v>

1007
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:58.090
<v Speaker 6>But there's a certain level of like not </v>
<v Speaker 6>only ego mania was celebrity with Asos,</v>

<v Speaker 6>He got that fucking going on.</v>

1013
00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:19.640
<v Speaker 6>If you're just remotely a pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 6>person when you get to a certain level </v>

1014
00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:24.441
<v Speaker 6>of fame,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people just like you are just the most </v>

<v Speaker 6>barely even be a fucking decent human </v>

1018
00:43:33.051 --> 00:43:34.320
<v Speaker 6>being to just get this avalanche of </v>
<v Speaker 6>compliments.</v>

1019
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.950
<v Speaker 6>If you got that going on and then you </v>

<v Speaker 6>with this man?</v>

1022

<v Speaker 6>You just start fucking heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your own inside the actor's studio with </v>

1023
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:49.860
<v Speaker 6>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's just a diss on the writers.</v>

1024
00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:55.070
<v Speaker 6>That's what I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say what she's doing is dissing </v>

1025
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:55.070
<v Speaker 6>the writers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's just saying when your world,</v>

1026
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:55.260
<v Speaker 6>it's a sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For me,</v>

1027
00:43:55.261 --> 00:43:55.870
<v Speaker 6>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1028
00:43:55.890 --> 00:44:00.890
<v Speaker 6>it was a trilogy of a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was really going somewhere with </v>

1029
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:00.890
<v Speaker 6>trilogy three,</v>
<v Speaker 6>three parter.</v>

1030
00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:03.140
<v Speaker 6>I was just joking how I built it all up </v>
<v Speaker 6>in her head.</v>

1031
00:44:03.141 --> 00:44:03.720
<v Speaker 6>And you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1032

<v Speaker 6>I think you're just being a cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They call them all brass tacks.</v>

1033
00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:12.870
<v Speaker 6>Rogan just gets right down to it.</v>

1034
00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.460
<v Speaker 5>That is my method.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm more of a bro.</v>

1035
00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm not really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not grounded.</v>

1036
00:44:17.581 --> 00:44:18.270
<v Speaker 5>Pumped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You grounded,</v>

1037
00:44:18.271 --> 00:44:20.520
<v Speaker 5>pounded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't feel them out in the first round.</v>

1038
00:44:20.521 --> 00:44:23.220
<v Speaker 5>You take them right down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Back when it comes to people like that.</v>

1039
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:25.080

<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

1041
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:29.050
<v Speaker 5>Especially with the actors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've met a lot of Nice actors,</v>

1043
00:44:30.811 --> 00:44:34.440
<v Speaker 5>don't me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but maybe it's fifth 50 percent of them.</v>

1044
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:39.620
<v Speaker 5>That's a bad number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like 50 percent of actors are pretty </v>

1045
00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:39.620
<v Speaker 5>fucked up.</v>

1046
00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:42.640
<v Speaker 6>But you worked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You worked back when they could be a </v>

<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1052
00:44:46.831 --> 00:44:51.831
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just because everybody's stole all </v>

1053
00:44:51.831 --> 00:44:52.950
<v Speaker 6>the movies and they stole all the music.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1054
00:44:52.951 --> 00:44:57.951
<v Speaker 6>there's people like weasel.</v>

1055
00:44:57.951 --> 00:44:57.951
<v Speaker 6>grunge era.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1057
00:45:01.371 --> 00:45:01.371
<v Speaker 6>would have ruined that too because you </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't pay for anything.</v>

1058
00:45:01.371 --> 00:45:03.060

<v Speaker 1>a sock on his junk.</v>

1151
00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:18.850
<v Speaker 1>It convinced everyone else in the band </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it and they did it.</v>

1152
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.730

<v Speaker 1>They all walked out with this socks and </v>

1155
00:49:27.691 --> 00:49:30.391
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there like the fuck am I </v>

<v Speaker 1>have to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you play the drums?</v>

1157
00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:33.100
<v Speaker 1>I played drums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't go wrong though,</v>

1158
00:49:33.101 --> 00:49:34.690
<v Speaker 1>and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're back there with the drums.</v>

1159
00:49:34.691 --> 00:49:38.080

<v Speaker 1>It's not the same a dude.</v>

1160
00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:41.080
<v Speaker 1>You're talking to the level of energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the level of the crowd being like,</v>

1161
00:49:41.081 --> 00:49:46.081
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck show is over to the show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why did they have him go last?</v>

1163
00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:54.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the exact question I </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked Josh.</v>

1164
00:49:54.701 --> 00:49:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Adam Meyers who also does expose also </v>
<v Speaker 1>does a voice on how when Hank,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the Dj had the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he came up with a DJ character.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got the guy with the perfect voice.</v>

<v Speaker 1>going on la.</v>

1170
00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they view that show more like,</v>

1171
00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.750
<v Speaker 1>how many years have you been doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup?</v>

1172
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:14.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1173
00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:19.711
<v Speaker 1>this is not a standup to save music show</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has the most musical ability or like</v>

1174
00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:23.350
<v Speaker 1>it's going to make the crowd go the </v>
<v Speaker 1>craziest.</v>

1175
00:50:23.351 --> 00:50:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on dude.</v>

1176
00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:28.160

<v Speaker 1>show business guys with these</v>

1177
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.370
<v Speaker 6>guys are going to come out with nothing </v>
<v Speaker 6>but socks on their dicks.</v>

1178
00:50:30.371 --> 00:50:31.690
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I did have two that play the drums.</v>

1184
00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.980
<v Speaker 6>Why did some stuff I did enough standup </v>
<v Speaker 6>to try and make them forget about what </v>

1185
00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:45.110
<v Speaker 6>they saw before that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I don't remember what song I played.</v>

<v Speaker 6>played in or some of the concert you </v>

<v Speaker 1>You guys spend like 500.</v>

1606
01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Then they listened</v>

1607
01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:17.120
<v Speaker 5>to $150.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One.</v>

1608
01:08:17.121 --> 01:08:22.121
<v Speaker 5>It's like a vague suggestion and once it</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets more than a few hundred feet away </v>

1609
01:08:22.121 --> 01:08:27.011
<v Speaker 5>from you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that fucking thing is not listening </v>

1610
01:08:27.011 --> 01:08:27.011

<v Speaker 5>It just sailed right into her tree.</v>

1611
01:08:27.011 --> 01:08:30.080
<v Speaker 5>So I had to go down and get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Amazing video and those things you.</v>

1612

<v Speaker 5>you can if you get a good one.</v>

1613
01:08:32.031 --> 01:08:36.680
<v Speaker 5>Not wanting to be video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is fucking weird man.</v>

1614
01:08:36.681 --> 01:08:39.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean there was a town in Colorado that</v>
<v Speaker 5>passed a law letting you hunt them.</v>

1615
01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.320
<v Speaker 5>So if you see one of the sky,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

1617
01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:49.660
<v Speaker 5>I liked that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to have a bit about that when </v>

1618
01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.450
<v Speaker 5>Amazon was going to start delivering </v>

<v Speaker 6>the pool looking at.</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's like a fucking party.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I had my usual overreaction.</v>

1631
01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:26.490
<v Speaker 6>Like it's just hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's go to big.</v>

1632
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:29.490
<v Speaker 6>It's just the future.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I will get a fucking gun.</v>

1633
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:34.950
<v Speaker 6>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll have a cardboard cutout of me so I </v>

1634
01:09:34.981 --> 01:09:37.740
<v Speaker 6>can see in the video or some shit </v>
<v Speaker 6>somehow was going to get it.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Get</v>

1636
01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.660
<v Speaker 5>Away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just in a good bird gun,</v>

1637
01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:41.130
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

1638
01:09:41.131 --> 01:09:44.670
<v Speaker 5>A 20 gauge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just shoot it out of the sky.</v>

1639
01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:46.440
<v Speaker 5>Something that's scattered,</v>
<v Speaker 5>scatters good,</v>

1640
01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:53.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'd be great is if you knew whose it </v>

1641
01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.730
<v Speaker 5>was and you could have somebody filming </v>
<v Speaker 5>their face when you shut this shit out </v>

1642
01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:59.421
<v Speaker 5>of the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>despite their invasion of your own </v>

1643
01:09:59.421 --> 01:10:00.600
<v Speaker 5>proper property.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How wrong that they would feel.</v>

1644
01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:01.920
<v Speaker 5>What's weird?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not.</v>

1645
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:06.950
<v Speaker 5>There's no law above your house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if someone flew that into your </v>

1646
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:09.330
<v Speaker 5>house would be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If someone drove it into your yard,</v>

1647
01:10:09.331 --> 01:10:12.590
<v Speaker 5>it'd be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if they hover over your house space.</v>

1648
01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:13.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1649
01:10:13.081 --> 01:10:15.330
<v Speaker 5>It's airspace.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking weird.</v>

1650
01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:20.420
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How does that work with like say if you </v>

1651
01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:22.491
<v Speaker 5>wanted to fly over Kim Kardashians house</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a helicopter and take pictures of </v>

1652
01:10:22.491 --> 01:10:22.491
<v Speaker 5>her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you allowed to.</v>

1653
01:10:22.491 --> 01:10:22.910

1655
01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:27.240
<v Speaker 5>There's noise ordinances or like you can</v>
<v Speaker 5>only fly so fucking low.</v>

1656
01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:32.330
<v Speaker 5>How low a helicopter usually it's like I</v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't go lower than 700 feet.</v>

1657
01:10:33.151 --> 01:10:35.100
<v Speaker 5>Especially in Santa Monica.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those people,</v>

1658
01:10:35.101 --> 01:10:37.910
<v Speaker 5>they hate that airport there and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>want all of those people out of there.</v>

<v Speaker 5>slash 20.</v>

1666
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.890

<v Speaker 6>way to bribe their way.</v>

<v Speaker 6>but three years is a long fucking time.</v>

1682

<v Speaker 6>Do you remember in New York City when </v>
<v Speaker 6>they first had those videos,</v>

1683
01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:33.260
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>advertising in the back of cabs and </v>

<v Speaker 6>these are making me car sick at these </v>

1685
01:11:35.301 --> 01:11:35.301
<v Speaker 6>things to fuck out of here.</v>

1686
01:11:35.301 --> 01:11:38.220
<v Speaker 6>they went away and then like a few years</v>

1689
01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:44.940

<v Speaker 6>It's bad enough being in the cabinets.</v>

1690
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:50.030
<v Speaker 6>You just see the fingerprints.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's bad enough opening and closing the </v>

01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.030
<v Speaker 6>door.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I can't see the fingerprints.</v>

<v Speaker 5>that that's what they used to think.</v>

1797
01:15:57.830 --> 01:16:02.830
<v Speaker 5>They used to think that someone was </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing witchcraft when things would go </v>

1798
01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:05.341
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's amazing because I </v>

1799
01:16:05.341 --> 01:16:07.531
<v Speaker 5>think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That kind of thought is just slid into </v>

1800
01:16:07.531 --> 01:16:08.950
<v Speaker 5>other shit that people think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1801
01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:12.280
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what the root of it was in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Salem witch trials?</v>

1802
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:17.910
<v Speaker 5>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got a late frost and they're bread </v>

1803
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:20.760
<v Speaker 5>like apparently when you get a late </v>
<v Speaker 5>frost and wheat you can get some weird </v>

1804
01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.290
<v Speaker 5>mold that grows on the wheat and this </v>
<v Speaker 5>wheat was growing.</v>

1805
01:16:23.291 --> 01:16:28.291
<v Speaker 5>This type of mold called Ercot in Ercot </v>
<v Speaker 5>has the same properties as LSD.</v>

1806
01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:32.020
<v Speaker 5>So these people were eating the bread </v>
<v Speaker 5>and tripping their fucking balls off and</v>

1807
01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:37.021
<v Speaker 5>they thought that keep dm hat's really </v>
<v Speaker 5>freaky with a belt buckle on your hat of</v>

1808
01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:39.820
<v Speaker 5>the belt buckle and your shoes.</v>

1809
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:41.890
<v Speaker 5>And we used to have those stupid buckles</v>
<v Speaker 5>on their shoes.</v>

1810
01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did the go,</v>

1811
01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.250
<v Speaker 5>go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did the comedy comic thing.</v>

1812
01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:47.360
<v Speaker 5>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>

1813
01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:52.370
<v Speaker 5>so they're tripping on this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they thought that these people </v>

1814
01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:52.370
<v Speaker 5>were bewitched,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they thought they were getting,</v>

1815
01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:57.151
<v Speaker 5>which they were getting hex by witches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so they had these people that they </v>

1816
01:16:57.151 --> 01:16:58.120
<v Speaker 5>didn't trust and they were freaking out </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they were on acid.</v>

1817
01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:02.980
<v Speaker 5>And that's one of the primary theories </v>
<v Speaker 5>that crazy.</v>

1818
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:05.320
<v Speaker 5>You imagine being on acid in the 17 </v>
<v Speaker 5>hundreds,</v>

1819
01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:08.080
<v Speaker 5>how much you'd be freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1820
01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.370

1821
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:12.030

<v Speaker 1>Once I actually,</v>

1822
01:17:12.031 --> 01:17:12.920
<v Speaker 1>I thought some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:43.500
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you.</v>

1949
01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they mocked him,</v>

1950
01:22:45.151 --> 01:22:46.710
<v Speaker 1>made fun of them because that was during</v>
<v Speaker 1>the birth,</v>

1951
01:22:46.730 --> 01:22:51.730
<v Speaker 1>put him right in the middle of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know every roast is always that </v>

1952
01:22:51.730 --> 01:22:55.461
<v Speaker 1>raw meat guy and you don't realize you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that guy until all of a sudden the </v>

1953
01:22:55.461 --> 01:22:55.461
<v Speaker 1>roast starts as just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>

1954
01:22:55.461 --> 01:22:59.781
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy for when everybody runs out </v>

1955
01:22:59.781 --> 01:23:00.390
<v Speaker 1>of jokes for the guy that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hosting that,</v>

1956
01:23:00.410 --> 01:23:01.900
<v Speaker 1>that they're roasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1957
01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1958
01:23:03.421 --> 01:23:04.350
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal.</v>

1959
01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1960
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:07.240
<v Speaker 5>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>

1961
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:10.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they said one thing to them that was</v>

1962
01:23:10.631 --> 01:23:11.620
<v Speaker 5>hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1963
01:23:11.770 --> 01:23:16.770
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one thing that you'll never be the </v>

1964
01:23:16.770 --> 01:23:18.871
<v Speaker 5>president of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was one of the things that Obama </v>

1965
01:23:18.871 --> 01:23:19.300
<v Speaker 5>said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1966
01:23:19.301 --> 01:23:20.960
<v Speaker 5>And he shot them all and he</v>

1967
01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:23.420
<v Speaker 1>the fucking hand over the keys to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

1968
01:23:23.421 --> 01:23:24.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had to abandon.</v>

1969
01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never saw it coming.</v>

1970
01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:29.840
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

1971
01:23:29.841 --> 01:23:32.480
<v Speaker 1>This guy's gonna run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No of this guy's gonna win.</v>

1972
01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:33.830
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a weird way,</v>

1973
01:23:33.831 --> 01:23:38.831
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of like a reverse like bully</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie because it was the liberals don't </v>

1974
01:23:38.831 --> 01:23:39.890
<v Speaker 1>want it to them and they were totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullying the guy 100 percent,</v>

1975
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:42.410
<v Speaker 1>but he was bullying Obama with the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing,</v>

1976
01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:43.880
<v Speaker 1>the birther thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1977
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000
<v Speaker 1>So I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still going after that birth is </v>

1978
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.231
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw something yesterday on some </v>

1979
01:23:52.231 --> 01:23:54.041
<v Speaker 1>website that was showing how they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different confirmed sources </v>

1980
01:23:54.621 --> 01:23:59.621
<v Speaker 1>that are showing that the Obama birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>certificate was fake and I hope it was </v>

1981
01:23:59.621 --> 01:24:03.881
<v Speaker 1>fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hope you unto his presidency and </v>

1982
01:24:03.881 --> 01:24:03.881
<v Speaker 1>already happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

1983
01:24:03.881 --> 01:24:03.881
<v Speaker 1>what can you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I hope it was fake.</v>

1984
01:24:03.881 --> 01:24:05.630
<v Speaker 1>I hope he scammed the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1985
01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.300
<v Speaker 1>the fucking the NBA had that mobbed up </v>
<v Speaker 1>ref.</v>

1986
01:24:08.301 --> 01:24:10.700
<v Speaker 1>And he said that he fucked the warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean the,</v>

1987
01:24:10.701 --> 01:24:13.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kings out of that series against the</v>

1988
01:24:13.041 --> 01:24:18.041
<v Speaker 1>Lakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to take the fucking </v>

1989
01:24:18.041 --> 01:24:18.041
<v Speaker 1>Lakers title away for that year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1990
01:24:18.041 --> 01:24:18.041
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1991
01:24:18.041 --> 01:24:22.870
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a referee who's fucking fixing </v>

1992
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.870
<v Speaker 1>games?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1993
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:24.670
<v Speaker 1>really that's how much you don't watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>

1994
01:24:24.671 --> 01:24:27.050
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would fit him.</v>

1995
01:24:27.051 --> 01:24:30.650
<v Speaker 1>Donna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he 100 percent of NBA reps gamble,</v>

1996
01:24:33.650 --> 01:24:35.510
<v Speaker 1>but he's also like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in jail now.</v>

1997
01:24:35.511 --> 01:24:40.511
<v Speaker 1>He's just trying to say shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like this is the guy that was the </v>

1998
01:24:40.511 --> 01:24:40.511
<v Speaker 1>ref that was in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1999
01:24:40.511 --> 01:24:41.870
<v Speaker 1>But like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sat him right there.</v>

2000
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fixed gay.</v>

2001
01:24:43.191 --> 01:24:44.840
<v Speaker 1>He used to say from in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2002
01:24:44.841 --> 01:24:47.120
<v Speaker 1>you tell me who's reffing the game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you who wins.</v>

2003
01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He spent 15 months in prison after </v>

2004
01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:52.790
<v Speaker 1>pleading guilty to charges the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's out freedom.</v>

2005
01:24:52.791 --> 01:24:53.300
<v Speaker 1>How much you do</v>

2006
01:24:53.370 --> 01:24:56.620
<v Speaker 5>you think he made?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He joined callen.</v>

2007
01:24:56.970 --> 01:25:00.960
<v Speaker 5>Colin cowherd Wednesday afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Had a fascinating answer.</v>

2008
01:25:00.961 --> 01:25:03.420
<v Speaker 5>When asked what percentage?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said 100.</v>

2009
01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:05.340
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

2010
01:25:05.370 --> 01:25:06.410
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2011
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:07.320
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not true.</v>

2012
01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:09.820
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just a fucking jail bird.</v>

2013
01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:14.860
<v Speaker 5>Talk it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to gamble on UFC fights way back </v>

2014
01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:15.150
<v Speaker 5>in the early days when I first started </v>
<v Speaker 5>working for them.</v>

2015
01:25:15.570 --> 01:25:16.980
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who gives a shit?</v>

2016
01:25:16.981 --> 01:25:19.650
<v Speaker 5>I can't really affect the outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like in many,</v>

2017
01:25:19.651 --> 01:25:20.970
<v Speaker 5>many years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I would,</v>

2018
01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:22.620
<v Speaker 5>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they bring in these guys,</v>

2019
01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:27.860
<v Speaker 5>like they bring in some guy from Brazil </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I knew about and I would look at </v>

2020
01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:29.430
<v Speaker 5>the line of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you guys are out of your fucking mind,</v>

2021
01:25:29.431 --> 01:25:34.431
<v Speaker 5>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she'd be like a 10 to one favorite and </v>

2022
01:25:34.431 --> 01:25:34.431
<v Speaker 5>you've got an underdog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2023
01:25:34.431 --> 01:25:34.500
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm putting some money on that.</v>

2024
01:25:34.770 --> 01:25:36.660
<v Speaker 5>And I put some money on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then after awhile it's like,</v>

2025
01:25:36.661 --> 01:25:38.790
<v Speaker 5>this is probably not smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2026
01:25:38.791 --> 01:25:41.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's illegal because I </v>
<v Speaker 5>can't speak for the company.</v>

2027
01:25:41.730 --> 01:25:43.440
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also not good for me.</v>

2028
01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:46.470
<v Speaker 5>See if I come off as biased anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2029
01:25:46.530 --> 01:25:49.050
<v Speaker 5>I've been accused of being a biased </v>
<v Speaker 5>commentator anyway.</v>

2030
01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Tap Out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

2031
01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:52.940
<v Speaker 1>come by.</v>

2032
01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:55.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2033
01:25:55.721 --> 01:25:57.400
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>

2034
01:25:57.401 --> 01:26:02.401
<v Speaker 5>that's a different kind of thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gambling when you're a referee is a big </v>

2035
01:26:02.401 --> 01:26:02.401
<v Speaker 5>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2036
01:26:02.401 --> 01:26:04.610
<v Speaker 6>And that's a game that's easily fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do they fix it?</v>

2037
01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.320
<v Speaker 6>What do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because you can,</v>

2038
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:09.350
<v Speaker 6>you can take stars out of the game by </v>
<v Speaker 6>giving them false.</v>

2039
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:10.640
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that what they did?</v>

2040
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:12.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We just,</v>

2041
01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:16.430
<v Speaker 6>you just sit people down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just like if you're the best player</v>

2042
01:26:16.431 --> 01:26:18.980
<v Speaker 6>on the team and the first quarter I give</v>
<v Speaker 6>you two quick fouls,</v>

2043
01:26:18.981 --> 01:26:23.981
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to see you again until the</v>
<v Speaker 6>second quarter and I've never fixed a </v>

2044
01:26:23.981 --> 01:26:24.410
<v Speaker 6>fucking game,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I mean I'm just,</v>

2045
01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:25.530
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just,</v>

2046
01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:27.710
<v Speaker 6>I give you another one in the second </v>
<v Speaker 6>quarter.</v>

2047
01:26:27.711 --> 01:26:32.711
<v Speaker 6>I don't see it to the next half and at </v>
<v Speaker 6>some point you're going to get mad if I </v>

2048
01:26:32.711 --> 01:26:34.250
<v Speaker 6>keep calling bullshit files,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might get you in a technical foul that</v>

2049
01:26:34.251 --> 01:26:39.251
<v Speaker 6>saves me a ticky tack file that counts </v>
<v Speaker 6>towards your files and then two files to</v>

2050
01:26:40.170 --> 01:26:42.020
<v Speaker 6>tacticals you're out of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're rejected.</v>

2051
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:44.630
<v Speaker 6>So was it obvious that this guy was </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing files that it was.</v>

2052
01:26:44.650 --> 01:26:47.710
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was obvious that the NBA </v>
<v Speaker 6>was kind of fixed for a while.</v>

2053
01:26:47.711 --> 01:26:49.300
<v Speaker 6>Like I was sitting going late.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2054
01:26:49.301 --> 01:26:50.620
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went to a game one time,</v>

2055
01:26:50.621 --> 01:26:55.621
<v Speaker 6>the Celtics versus Utah Jazz and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>watching the fucking game and like just </v>

2056
01:26:55.621 --> 01:26:59.911
<v Speaker 6>like the game starts that letting them </v>
<v Speaker 6>play and then they're calling it tight </v>

2057
01:26:59.911 --> 01:27:04.020
<v Speaker 6>and then they're letting them play.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then they're calling it tight and it's </v>

2058
01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:04.180
<v Speaker 6>like there was never an ebb and flow and</v>
<v Speaker 6>how they will call in a game.</v>

2059
01:27:04.181 --> 01:27:05.410
<v Speaker 6>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an empire,</v>

2060
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:10.830
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've seen the first day and it got </v>

2061
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:10.830
<v Speaker 6>step out of the box going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2062
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:10.830
<v Speaker 6>that's a strike tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

2063
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:14.401
<v Speaker 6>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just finding out where you strike zone </v>

2064
01:27:14.401 --> 01:27:14.401
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like an empire,</v>

2065
01:27:14.401 --> 01:27:16.900
<v Speaker 6>if you start changing the strike zone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of change in sports on your hair,</v>

2066
01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:19.150
<v Speaker 6>like people are going to know like what </v>
<v Speaker 6>the fuck's going on?</v>

2067
01:27:19.150 --> 01:27:22.080
<v Speaker 6>You got to be consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like with um,</v>

2068
01:27:23.170 --> 01:27:24.040
<v Speaker 6>NBA reps,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

2069
01:27:24.090 --> 01:27:25.840
<v Speaker 6>NBA Games you would watch and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2070
01:27:25.841 --> 01:27:27.070
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're calling a close tonight.</v>

2071
01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.170
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's letting the boys play.</v>

2072
01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:34.440
<v Speaker 6>And like that was the game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They wouldn't just keep obviously if it </v>

2073
01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.410
<v Speaker 6>got really out of hand they would </v>
<v Speaker 6>tighten down.</v>

2074
01:27:35.411 --> 01:27:38.170
<v Speaker 6>But I never saw a game where it's just </v>
<v Speaker 6>like you're pulling back on the range,</v>

2075
01:27:38.171 --> 01:27:39.470
<v Speaker 6>you'll let them run,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you pulling back,</v>

2076
01:27:39.471 --> 01:27:44.471
<v Speaker 6>you letting them run.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it just made me feel like they were </v>

2077
01:27:44.471 --> 01:27:44.471
<v Speaker 6>shaving points is something I remember </v>
<v Speaker 6>for years.</v>

2078
01:27:44.471 --> 01:27:48.601
<v Speaker 6>I said the game was fixed and um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody said I was out of my fucking </v>

2079
01:27:48.601 --> 01:27:50.860
<v Speaker 6>mind and then they find a guy who's all </v>
<v Speaker 6>mobbed up,</v>

2080
01:27:50.861 --> 01:27:52.540
<v Speaker 6>but I go there vindication.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They go,</v>

2081
01:27:52.690 --> 01:27:53.510
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just one guy.</v>

2082
01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:56.220
<v Speaker 6>Now when you say mobbed up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like how was he mobbed up?</v>

2083
01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.600
<v Speaker 6>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what was the issue with Dr?</v>

2084
01:27:57.710 --> 01:28:02.710
<v Speaker 6>I was just an expression,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to get in trouble with </v>

2085
01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:04.521
<v Speaker 6>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he was basically working for other </v>

2086
01:28:04.521 --> 01:28:05.760
<v Speaker 6>people that were part of a gambling that</v>
<v Speaker 6>took a bookies or whatever.</v>

2087
01:28:06.810 --> 01:28:09.550
<v Speaker 6>And he did something to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2088
01:28:09.630 --> 01:28:13.350
<v Speaker 6>the game leaned in that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you couldn't totally fix it.</v>

2089
01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:17.250
<v Speaker 6>So if a team was favored by eight and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they want them to win by eight,</v>

2090
01:28:17.251 --> 01:28:22.251
<v Speaker 6>he'd make sure it happened to probably.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's probably easier to make sure they </v>

2091
01:28:22.251 --> 01:28:23.490
<v Speaker 6>didn't buy fucking over their offense </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then they were just,</v>

2092
01:28:23.491 --> 01:28:26.280
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they try to get money,</v>

2093
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.730
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2094
01:28:26.731 --> 01:28:27.900
<v Speaker 6>if you're legit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bookie,</v>

2095
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:31.320
<v Speaker 6>all you're trying to do is get an even </v>
<v Speaker 6>amount of money on each side.</v>

2096
01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.360
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

2097
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:36.300
<v Speaker 6>Because with the combination of people </v>
<v Speaker 6>teasing it and plus the juice and all of</v>

2098
01:28:36.301 --> 01:28:38.130
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to end up on top.</v>

2099
01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:41.430
<v Speaker 6>You don't want a bunch of money all on </v>
<v Speaker 6>one side and losing your fucking shirt.</v>

2100
01:28:41.431 --> 01:28:45.040
<v Speaker 6>So what these guys would do is you get </v>
<v Speaker 6>greedy after awhile.</v>

2101
01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:46.680
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sick of this ticky tack Shit.</v>

2102
01:28:46.681 --> 01:28:49.830
<v Speaker 6>Let's go for a big fucking score.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they wouldn't do it every game.</v>

2103
01:28:50.250 --> 01:28:51.840
<v Speaker 6>They just every once in a while and be </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2104
01:28:51.841 --> 01:28:54.330
<v Speaker 6>alright listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here's a gay probably,</v>

2105
01:28:54.331 --> 01:28:55.830
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

2106
01:28:55.831 --> 01:28:57.420
<v Speaker 6>I don't have that fixed the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>game.</v>

2107
01:28:57.421 --> 01:29:00.060
<v Speaker 6>I'm just guessing how they would go </v>
<v Speaker 6>about doing it to fix this one.</v>

2108
01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:01.260
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

2109
01:29:01.261 --> 01:29:04.680
<v Speaker 6>These guys don't win by eight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So this guy admitted that he fixed it.</v>

2110
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.740
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

2111
01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:08.740
<v Speaker 5>The J was somebody went to jail for </v>
<v Speaker 5>gambling on it.</v>

2112
01:29:08.741 --> 01:29:11.530
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For fixing or fixing it.</v>

2113
01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:16.680
<v Speaker 5>So what did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said like he made fouls that weren't </v>

2114
01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:16.680
<v Speaker 5>really fouls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2115
01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:16.680
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2116
01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:21.520
<v Speaker 5>You do whatever he had to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This attorney submitted saying the </v>

2117
01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:22.960
<v Speaker 5>manipulation that happened during one </v>
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>

2118
01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:28.660
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So officiating playoff series feeding </v>

2119
01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:30.930
<v Speaker 5>team five and team six in May of 2002 as</v>
<v Speaker 5>a six game of a seven game series and a </v>

2120
01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:32.680
<v Speaker 5>team five victory that night would have </v>
<v Speaker 5>ended the series.</v>

2121
01:29:32.681 --> 01:29:37.681
<v Speaker 5>However tim learned from referee a that </v>
<v Speaker 5>referees a and f wanted to extend the </v>

2122
01:29:37.681 --> 01:29:40.810
<v Speaker 5>series of seven games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tim knew referees a and F to B company,</v>

2123
01:29:40.811 --> 01:29:42.490
<v Speaker 5>men in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2124
01:29:42.491 --> 01:29:44.500
<v Speaker 5>always acting in the interest of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>NBA.</v>

2125
01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:47.710
<v Speaker 5>And that night it was the NBA is </v>
<v Speaker 5>interest add another game.</v>

2126
01:29:47.711 --> 01:29:50.920
<v Speaker 5>So the NBA wanted to fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>follow the NBA,</v>

2127
01:29:50.921 --> 01:29:54.030
<v Speaker 5>fixing referees a and f heavily favored </v>
<v Speaker 5>teams.</v>

2128
01:29:54.031 --> 01:29:59.031
<v Speaker 5>Six personal fouls resulting in </v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously injured players were ignored </v>

2129
01:29:59.031 --> 01:30:00.340
<v Speaker 5>even when they occurred in full view of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the referees.</v>

2130
01:30:00.341 --> 01:30:03.040
<v Speaker 5>Conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the referees called meetup fouls on team</v>

2131
01:30:03.041 --> 01:30:03.410
<v Speaker 5>flower.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2132
01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:07.660
<v Speaker 6>the highlights of the Lakers kings game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was ridiculous.</v>

2133
01:30:07.661 --> 01:30:10.300
<v Speaker 6>The files that they will come.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's my thing is when they said it</v>

2134
01:30:10.301 --> 01:30:11.530
<v Speaker 6>was just one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

2135
01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:14.750
<v Speaker 6>how long could you be on an officiating </v>
<v Speaker 6>crew while the in,</v>

2136
01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:18.460
<v Speaker 6>in one of your guys is dirty before </v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd realize like,</v>

2137
01:30:18.461 --> 01:30:19.780
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is this guy doing?</v>

2138
01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:25.260
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what about the guys that we're betting </v>

2139
01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:25.260
<v Speaker 5>on the other team?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd want to kill that fucking referee.</v>

2140
01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:29.330
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine if you saw him call </v>
<v Speaker 5>fouls and weren't really fouls in you </v>

2141
01:30:29.330 --> 01:30:33.090
<v Speaker 5>knew,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you knew your money was going out the </v>

2142
01:30:33.090 --> 01:30:34.951
<v Speaker 5>window.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think they're really susceptible </v>

2143
01:30:34.951 --> 01:30:34.951
<v Speaker 5>to it because like the amount of money </v>
<v Speaker 5>that NBA players</v>

2144
01:30:34.951 --> 01:30:37.280
<v Speaker 6>because fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They make like,</v>

2145
01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:42.580
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some of the contracts that they have </v>

2146
01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:44.261
<v Speaker 6>coming up and this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's so few guys on the team and </v>

2147
01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:48.610
<v Speaker 6>there's like every year the draft is </v>
<v Speaker 6>like two rounds in the draft.</v>

2148
01:30:48.611 --> 01:30:53.611
<v Speaker 6>Like fucking nfl goes on forever is 40 </v>
<v Speaker 6>something guys on a team in the NFL.</v>

2149
01:30:53.691 --> 01:30:56.720
<v Speaker 6>There's 20 something in baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 6>20 something in,</v>

2150
01:30:56.721 --> 01:30:58.730
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the NHL.</v>

2151
01:30:58.731 --> 01:31:00.290
<v Speaker 6>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think basketball,</v>

2152
01:31:00.291 --> 01:31:05.291
<v Speaker 6>it's no more than 11 or 12 guys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's a very small group of people in </v>

2153
01:31:06.710 --> 01:31:10.520
<v Speaker 6>the income that they're generating their</v>
<v Speaker 6>revenue share.</v>

2154
01:31:10.521 --> 01:31:12.920
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how I like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to all that's all like super sports nerd</v>

2155
01:31:12.921 --> 01:31:14.360
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I don't know how that works,</v>

2156
01:31:14.361 --> 01:31:19.361
<v Speaker 6>but some of the contracts that they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that some of these guys have been </v>

2157
01:31:19.361 --> 01:31:19.361
<v Speaker 6>signing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they can afford to fucking pay that</v>

2158
01:31:19.361 --> 01:31:24.011
<v Speaker 6>guy that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So now you're a ref and you're running </v>

2159
01:31:24.011 --> 01:31:26.120
<v Speaker 6>with your fucking black aerobic reebok </v>
<v Speaker 6>sneakers up and down the court,</v>

2160
01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:29.260
<v Speaker 6>you know the velcade yet.</v>

2161

2162
01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:35.120
<v Speaker 6>getting in and all the women hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you're on the stage two,</v>

2163
01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:38.300
<v Speaker 6>you're running up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one gives a fuck about you.</v>

2164
01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:41.210
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the pension is for the</v>

2165
01:31:41.211 --> 01:31:43.910
<v Speaker 6>NBA,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like if I was in the NBA I would,</v>

2166
01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:48.940
<v Speaker 6>if I was running I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we gotta fucking triple these guys' </v>

<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

2169
01:31:51.521 --> 01:31:52.760

<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2171
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:58.970
<v Speaker 6>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's just what he makes the play hoop.</v>

2172
01:31:59.350 --> 01:32:00.200

01:36:32.211 --> 01:36:34.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like you built that whole fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>

2287
01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Know you built that whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I just watched him play golf.</v>

2288
01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:43.160
<v Speaker 1>All I ever want to do when I watch golf </v>
<v Speaker 1>is watched those guys fucking crush it.</v>

2289
01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Like I love John Daly and I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2290
01:36:46.161 --> 01:36:47.050
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like drank.</v>

2291
01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:49.100
<v Speaker 1>And he just kept drinking and smoking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes.</v>

2292
01:36:49.101 --> 01:36:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Cigarettes big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2293
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:55.750
<v Speaker 1>When he hit it a fucking mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I loved watching it.</v>

2294
01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiger always had a very bizarre style.</v>

2295
01:36:58.971 --> 01:37:03.971
<v Speaker 1>Apparently I don't play golf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently people that I've talked </v>

2296
01:37:03.971 --> 01:37:05.740
<v Speaker 1>to that explained to me the way he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit the ball like this,</v>

2297
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:09.320
<v Speaker 1>not the way they teach you to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he could do it so well that way,</v>

2298
01:37:09.650 --> 01:37:12.050
<v Speaker 1>but he would put like ridiculous amounts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Torque.</v>

2299
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On his,</v>

2300
01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:14.280
<v Speaker 1>on his boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

2301
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:17.570
<v Speaker 1>they said from the beginning that his </v>
<v Speaker 1>body was going to break down if he keeps</v>

2302
01:37:17.571 --> 01:37:17.960
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

2303
01:37:18.230 --> 01:37:20.600
<v Speaker 1>There was a period where he adjusted his</v>
<v Speaker 1>swing and he stopped.</v>

2304
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:23.420
<v Speaker 1>He stopped winning and then he came back</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2305
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:28.990
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that what they said there </v>

2306
01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:29.720
<v Speaker 1>was a bunch of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earl Campbell,</v>

2307
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:32.180
<v Speaker 1>they said if he keeps running like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's wide open.</v>

2308
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:37.390
<v Speaker 1>He's going to have problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bobby or the way he played hockey with </v>

2309
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:40.671
<v Speaker 1>you throw yourself around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really beat the shit out of your </v>

2310
01:37:40.671 --> 01:37:40.671
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that happens.</v>

2311
01:37:40.671 --> 01:37:44.060
<v Speaker 1>And it just coincided with his personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>life falling apart.</v>

2312
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:45.560
<v Speaker 1>So everybody goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2313
01:37:45.561 --> 01:37:49.370
<v Speaker 1>that's the reason why you know somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>wins.</v>

2314
01:37:49.371 --> 01:37:50.660
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why somebody loses </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2315
01:37:50.661 --> 01:37:55.661
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you don't go to a couple </v>

2316
01:37:55.661 --> 01:37:55.661
<v Speaker 1>of your funk if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2317
01:37:55.661 --> 01:37:55.661
<v Speaker 1>your life falls apart in the personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>

2318
01:37:55.661 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like</v>

2319
01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:59.040
<v Speaker 6>the rest of that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2320
01:37:59.041 --> 01:38:00.960
<v Speaker 6>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's just a bunch of hype.</v>

2321
01:38:00.961 --> 01:38:02.130
<v Speaker 6>Like for him it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2322
01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.540
<v Speaker 5>doubled dump though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2323
01:38:03.541 --> 01:38:08.541
<v Speaker 5>I mean the thing happens personally with</v>
<v Speaker 5>his personal life and it happens </v>

2324
01:38:08.541 --> 01:38:11.841
<v Speaker 5>publicly where everybody gets to see it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then on top of that his body's </v>

2325
01:38:11.841 --> 01:38:11.841
<v Speaker 5>falling apart at the same time</v>

2326
01:38:11.841 --> 01:38:12.440
<v Speaker 6>no matter what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2327
01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:15.180
<v Speaker 6>No matter where you went to church every</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking week he was going to fuck up his</v>

2328
01:38:15.181 --> 01:38:16.710
<v Speaker 6>back and his knees and they.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it did.</v>

2329
01:38:16.711 --> 01:38:18.810
<v Speaker 6>But then they're trying to equate it to </v>
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>

2330
01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:20.890
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2332
01:38:25.891 --> 01:38:25.891
<v Speaker 6>business.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's none of my fucking business.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I feel bad.</v>

<v Speaker 6>but like the cops are handling it.</v>

01:38:37.050 --> 01:38:39.540
<v Speaker 6>They arrested him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the courts will handle it.</v>
