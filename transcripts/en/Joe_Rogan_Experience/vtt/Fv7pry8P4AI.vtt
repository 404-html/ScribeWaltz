00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Did I ever show you the picture of the tree that was growing in my toilet pipe</v>

2
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.840
<v Speaker 1>now tree now dude,</v>

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I was having a problem.</v>

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.030
<v Speaker 1>My toilet wouldn't flush correctly,</v>

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>so I had a fellow come over to take care of it and he said,</v>

6
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.751
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

8
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

9
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>That's an actual picture of the thing that was in my bathroom.</v>

10
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.610
<v Speaker 1>What is it that is a tree that that's roots got into a small crack in the water</v>

11
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>pipe and then it grows where the water up the pipe.</v>

12
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>So the pipe was clogged with like a tree.</v>

13
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>It looked like an animal.</v>

14
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

15
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:41.460
<v Speaker 1>It's disgusting.</v>

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.421
<v Speaker 1>That's so big.</v>

17
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it has a personality.</v>

18
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Tell him the rest of the trees get in here,</v>

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>He made his way up to ship pipe here about Harry.</v>

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah Bro.</v>

41
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:15.721
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

42
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>You got to admit the dude put his timing.</v>

43
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.331
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

44
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weeds out there that are complaining about Harry,</v>

45
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>but these fuckers,</v>

46
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 1>they grow real fast and then they just stay the same size.</v>

47
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>They're not hustlers.</v>

48
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.133
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

49
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Harry seems happy,</v>

50
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 1>but could he be the,</v>

51
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

52
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.280
<v Speaker 1>I would miss the sun personally.</v>

53
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>I'd miss the sunshine.</v>

54
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:34.254
<v Speaker 1>You say that.</v>

55
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

56
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>But Harry's mostly a route could be out there in the dirt and occasionally peak</v>

57
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:40.810
<v Speaker 1>up a little good,</v>

58

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Like they there were up above and the rest of the roots like what's going on up</v>
