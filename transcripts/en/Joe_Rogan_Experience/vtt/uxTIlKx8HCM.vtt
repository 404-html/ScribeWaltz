1
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.730
Hey,
you fuckers,
what's going on?
You I say that with all love,

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.840
all love and do respect.
Tom.
I freaks for free.

3
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:13.470
Gets this episode of the Joe Rogan,
his parents,
but all mine.
How gross is that?

4
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:18.030
If I treated you like your mind,
I call my people.
It's not your people's too,

5
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:20.810
but that's because people,
it's called talk.
Tell what it is.
Yeah.

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.780
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by

7
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:27.860
Squarespace.
Squarespace is a,

8
00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:32.861
a website making website that we've been super happy with here on the Joe Rogan

9
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:38.820
experience podcast.
It's a,
it makes it so that a person like you or I,
you know,

10
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:42.780
your typical knucklehead who's not exactly technologically proficient,

11
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.170
you can make a website super easy and it's integrated with everything iPod or

12
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:51.990
whether works with Ipod.

13
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.450
You can integrate it with Twitter and Facebook and stuff,

14
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:58.760
but it works with android phones,
works with windows,
works with Mac,
uh,

15
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.350
all platforms,
which is easy to do.
Now to God.

16
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:02.520
He used to be such a pain in the ass.

17
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.840
You would look up a website on internet explorer and it'd be all wonky and then

18
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:10.350
you look at it on safari and it would be perfect or vice versa.
It was a mess.

19
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.220
Coding websites.
It was like a super difficult task.
Just you know,
five,

20
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:17.490
10 years ago.
I say that as if I'm a coder,
you I know nothing.

21
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:19.290
I don't even know coding is.
They could be lying to me,

22
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.650
give you a bunch of magicians working behind the scenes with elves and I'm just

23
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:26.130
like,
well,
you know,
they it and develop this operating system.
Meanwhile,

24
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:28.170
it's all magic.
Could easily be magic.

25
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.350
It's because it's just as likely that it's magic as it is that a moron like me,

26
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:37.770
whatever creates something like anything you could download online.

27
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.700
I don't understand that.

28
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.170
That's so outside of my realm of thinking that a boy.

29
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.700
Anyway,
Squarespace is an extremely easy way to build an awesome website.

30
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.560
Everything is integrated free domains and great designs.

31
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.110
Hosting all in one place.

32
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.140
They provide everything you choose from over 20 Badass designs and they have a

33
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:05.040
new ecommerce product.
It's Galapagos and it's a hope.

34
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:07.800
That's how you say it.
That's how you spell it.
There's that word,

35
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.440
that word out loud.
You know there's a free words that like you,

36
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.720
you read and then he'd get to them and you're like,
hmm.

37
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.140
How do you say wall?
La V.
O.
I.
L.
L.
A.

38
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.240
Y is that wall law is at La La.
Yeah.
It's,
you know,

39
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.540
written probably better.
Meanwhile,

40
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.960
most people would have no idea how to spell that name.
That word while.
Ah,

41
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.750
that's one that you could get over on people.

42
00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:35.870
I get a spelling contest and then I'd be like,
Ooh,
good.
Everything.

43
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.900
Is it w it sounds like there's a w.
Yeah.
What is it?
Language.
French.
Those fucks.

44
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:42.170
They don't,
they don't agree.
They don't agree on how the war,

45
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.800
the use of words should sound Savio I l a.
Yeah.
That's ridiculous.

46
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.610
That's a boiler.
That's not wall La.
It's Voya.
What do you guys doing?

47
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:51.720
Why are we playing games?

48
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.320
Why do you have to use the same goddamn letters but make them sound different?

49
00:02:55.321 --> 00:03:00.230
Is it French or something?
Yeah,
French like Portuguese is interesting.
Like the,

50
00:03:00.231 --> 00:03:02.920
you just get used to the ar thing and it's pretty recognizable.

51
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.440
But like with Brazilians like hoists Gracie and Hixon Gracie,

52
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:10.060
those are ours and everybody was like why is it age?
Cause that's how they do it.

53
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.860
There's just as many of them.
Is there a bus?

54
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:14.050
You know South America is fucking gigantic.

55
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.480
It's a lot of God damn people down there.
You know,

56
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:19.450
if they say it's an h fucking learn it,
deal with it.

57
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.960
This has nothing to do with squarespace.com which is an awesome product.

58
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.430
Does Galapagos is a new template which will showcase your ecommerce products in

59
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:30.010
a more interesting way than the typical orderly grid.

60
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.340
And a Galapagos features a dynamic product mosaic with a custom rollover states

61
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.040
so he can roll over and allows you to display an alternate image.

62
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.390
So like if you're looking at a,
an item and then you roll over it with a cursor,

63
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.180
it will allow you to display an alternate image.

64
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:48.760
Like you can do one in color and one in black and white or something like that.

65
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.040
If you're one of those crafts,
he artsy fucks.

66
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.110
So when visitors hover over each item,

67
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.360
it gives you a different look and the template is also preset.

68
00:03:55.361 --> 00:04:00.190
With all the content pages you need to have your shop on up and running quickly.

69
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.450
So ecommerce,
super easy to do on Squarespace.
A No credit card is needed either.

70
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:07.120
You can just try it out and start building your website.
Um,

71
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.380
you try it and then if you don't like it,
you just go away.
But if you like it,

72
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.140
you enter in your credit card information after you've already tried out the

73
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:17.410
product,
they're that confident in it and they should be.
It's pretty bad ass.

74
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.890
And if you use the offer code,
J r e,

75
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.050
well actually no for GRE listeners,

76
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.350
if you go to use the offer code Joe and the number 12 Joe 12 one word Joe number

77
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:32.290
1212 for December,

78
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.350
you'll get 10% off your first purchase on new accounts.

79
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.200
So that's squarespace.com use the offer code,

80
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.030
all one word Joe and the number 12 and save yourself 10% you're freaks on an

81
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:47.080
awesome website.
It really works.
It's excellent.
Brian's done.
He's probably,

82
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:50.500
how many of you made a lot of time like Ari Shaffir,

83
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:54.450
his legs.com Bert squirt?
Bert?
I think it's one.
I don't even remember all that.

84
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.313
We just make group.

85
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.780
He makes nonsense websites while we're doing the commercial for the website.

86
00:04:58.781 --> 00:04:59.500
It's really that easy,

87
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.740
but they put this thing now on where they're not letting me go past it because I

88
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:06.070
think they've caught onto me.
Oh,
those sons of bitches.
Listen,
folks,

89
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:09.190
we're trying to sell your websites.
Don't do that.
I can't go anywhere.

90
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.970
Why would they do that too?
It kind of hurt my feelings.
Did they on,

91
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.960
do they understand that we're promoting them while we're doing this?

92
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.220
Maybe they just think we're assholes.

93
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.070
Like somebody just started complaining about US folks.

94
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:21.700
We're just promoting Squarespace.
Jesus.
Louisa's

95
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.250
so sad.
So sad that Squarespace doesn't like your work.

96
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.340
I think I figured out what it is.
A work around.
Yeah.
What's the work around?

97
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.530
Hit the x in the corner.
Oh,
there's an x.

98
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.210
They just the video,
but the need the x really hard to see.
Oh really?

99
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:43.960
It's one of those I get offended by those.
I'm sorry.
I know I shouldn't,

100
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:45.850
but I fucking do.
I get offended.

101
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.340
I find that those pop up videos that you make me x out of those are gross.

102
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.290
That's like showing me your Dick.
You know,
it's like,
Hey,
you know why I,
you know,

103
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:58.160
I didn't come for that video.
Why

104
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.410
<v 1>is it video popping up in the middle of your screen?</v>

105
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.790
It's one thing if it's like an add on the beginning of the video because then I

106
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:09.620
went to a video,
I don't mind watching 15 seconds of whatever the fuck it is.

107
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:11.990
It's just,
you know,
I understand you have to sell advertisement,

108
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.770
but when a video comes out of nowhere,
that's rude.
Yeah.

109
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.400
That shits grows and if it crashes your system and you lose your work,
oh my God,

110
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:23.210
you want to fucking kill somebody.
But who's fault is that?
That's your fault.

111
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:27.050
Stupid.
Okay.
Don't get hostile.
Hope he,
uh,

112
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.760
that'd be blaming other people for your issues

113
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.620
were also brought to you by lumosity.com Lumosity is another new sponsor here at

114
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:40.910
the Joe Rogan experience podcast and it's essentially a gym for your brain.

115
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.840
It's a really cool setup.
I really enjoy it.
And uh,
I've,

116
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.990
I've done it and they're like little cool games that you play.

117
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.940
And the idea behind it is based on the science of neuroplasticity,

118
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:57.180
which is just a bunch of words I don't understand because I'm not that smart.

119
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.010
But uh,
according to smart people,
that's impressive.

120
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.880
And if you go to lumosity.com you can learn all about what,

121
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.010
what they can do and how customizable it is.

122
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.480
What they've done is they've set up their website.

123
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:18.110
If you go to lumosity.com what you see is a bunch of different options.

124
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:22.970
You have a bunch of different options on how to,
how to set up your,

125
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.660

126
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:28.640
It's all based on what you're looking for.

127
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.090
And if you're looking for like saying here,
I'm going here,
right?

128
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.660
Like if you're looking from memory,
they have like these options.

129
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:36.630
Like what are you looking to do?

130
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.900
You were looking to recall the location of objects.

131
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.360
Are you looking to remember names after the first introduction?

132
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.550
They have a bunch of different offerings like this,

133
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:47.030
a bunch of different options for each different facet of,

134
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.350
of training your brain like attention,
memory,
speed,

135
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.960
flexibility and the the,

136
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.020
the interesting thing about it is that it's not boring.

137
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:02.030
It's fun to do so you enjoy doing it while you're exercising your brain and

138
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:03.830
that's something we can all use folks.

139
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.010
Most of us have jobs that are kind of like similar,

140
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:10.100
a lot like days sort of melt in today's,

141
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.820
I think that Shit's bad for your brain and I think your brain needs a little

142
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:16.940
exercise and if you can't give it exercise in life,

143
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.340
it's probably good to give it exercise in the form of,

144
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.180
of games or have tests or play a little chess or something like that.

145
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.750
Just think you use it because I think it's like everything else.

146
00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:29.600
I think it's like your lungs.
I think it's like your cardiovascular system.

147
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:31.580
I think the more you use it,
the healthier it is.

148
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.200
And I think when you don't use it,
it's,

149
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.380
there's a reason why so many fucking people are stupid.
Let's just say it.

150
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.340
If they went to lumosity.com and looked up problem solving,

151
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.110
they would have all sorts of options like dissecting complex arguments,

152
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:47.150
making quick and accurate estimations.

153
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.070
What I'm basically saying is get your shit together and go to lumosity.com Jesus

154
00:08:52.071 --> 00:08:56.130

161
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.650
He just gets so wrapped up in them.

162
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:22.530
You don't give a fuck about your plane flight or or anything else.

This is along those lines,
but actually good for you.

So that's lumosity.com forward slash.

165

166
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.790
This is the last day of the big on its sale.

167
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:40.980
If you're listening to this live,
it's a,

168
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.940
today is December 2nd,
2013.
Um,

169
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.500
and uh,
on,

170
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:50.460
it's big sale ends tonight at midnight and it's like up to 25% off on a lot of

171
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:51.294
shit.

172
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.250
We have all sorts of shit on it would on is basically what we like to call it as

173
00:09:56.251 --> 00:09:59.010
a human optimization website,
for lack of a better word.

174
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.400
And we just tried to sell you the best shit that we find as far as strength and

175
00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:05.940
conditioning equipment,
vitamins,
nutrients,
things that I use,

176
00:10:05.941 --> 00:10:09.090
things that I promote,
things that I think are important to recognize.
There's,

177
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.820
there's some supplements out there that fucking work all right,

178
00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:14.010
and they're not dangerous,
they're not bad for you,

179
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:17.430
but they can give you a nice little boost and a lot of different areas in your

180
00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:17.941
mood.

181
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:22.941
It's been proven that certain nutrients stimulate the production of brain

182
00:10:23.131 --> 00:10:27.540
chemicals like Serotonin and five HTP is one of those.

183
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.540
And we have that in new mood,
which is a five HTP and l Tryptofan,

184
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:37.080
a supplement l Tryptofan,
which apparently converts to five HTP.
Again,

185
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.330
I'm just repeating shit that I don't even understand.

186
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.890
Just making words with my face.
He's,

187
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:44.680
when is on it going to step up their garlic game.
Still bump your garlic James.

188
00:10:44.681 --> 00:10:48.250
It sounds like a pizza ad.
Super garlic pizza.

189
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.980
I'd teach her Rio who no fucks.

190
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.110
I've been taking this garlic supplements so like 1,002 thousand a day.

191
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.760
That's great.
Yeah.
That's good for you.
And I just went to a vitamin Shoppe,

192
00:10:59.761 --> 00:11:00.610
you know,
and,

193
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.270
and there was some stuff that already had from on it but there was some stuff

194
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:06.390
that I couldn't find on on it.
Yeah.
We don't have everything that's for sure.

195
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.900
There's definitely room for a lot of new shit but um,

196
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.710
garlic is a super useful thing to take but I would recommend if you can deal

197
00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:18.060
with it,
take it raw.
The life.
Yeah.
Because if you have any like stomach issues,

198
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:21.930
garlic is fantastic for like dealing with like food poisoning and stuff like

199
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:22.590
that.

200
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:27.270
Apparently garlic is just nuclear war for like bad bacteria.

201
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.510
And why and why is that not?
That should be more known.

202
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.080
I think super healthy plant,
you know,
super healthy Pete.

203
00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:37.410
Pardon nature interacts with our body really well then fucking tastes great.

204
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.380
Yeah.
Cause we,
we grow up thinking mostly garlic,
you know,

205
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.400
it's like vampires and stuff like that thing and stinky breath.

206
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.610
I remember thinking stinky breath but there's a lot of shit that smells worse

207
00:11:47.611 --> 00:11:50.600
than garlic breath,
like garlic press and of that bad,
you know,

208
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.300
it's not as bad as like,
you know a girl throws up a lot.
Yeah.
But now you,

209
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.460
do you ever have the girl that I had like a yeast problem where there they tell

210
00:11:57.461 --> 00:12:01.630
you to put garlic in her vagina like you take,

211
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.530
what kind of crazy bitch are you dating and what mood doctor is she going to

212
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.840
know?
It's an unknown picking crops that are pussy.
You put a couple a glitter.

213
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.420
They loaves are a
couple of loaves and garlic,

214
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.470
clove,
cloves,
but a couple of cloves of garlic in there overnight and then,

215
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.470
but that,
that kills everything.
Yeah.
But that hasn't been horrible.

216
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.990
I wonder if it tastes bad when you go down on her,
whatever it has,

217
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:24.790
it changes the flavor of our vagina.
It's like,

218
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:26.460
imagine if your vagina was like Jello.

219
00:12:26.461 --> 00:12:29.320
It just absorb whatever flavor you're toss anyway.
Like,
well,

220
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.910
garlic probably would do that for a while.

221
00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.550
Wouldn't it would absorb into those lips?
No.
Well,

222
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.280
that's the thing that the vagina is very absorbable.

223
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:39.550
That's how you can get pregnant.
Super easy with it.
Like it's open tissue.

224
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.870
That's also why women are more susceptible to catching HIV,
apparently.
Allegedly.

225
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.740
Because you know God comes inside of them.
Their body absorbs it.
Wow.
Yeah.

226
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.770
I would think,
I would think garlic would have a little bit of an impact,

227
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.080
but like if I like it a little bit of 22 it anyway,

228
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.200

My night all day

235
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:27.180
<v 0>today.
Ladies and gentlemen,
today is December 2nd,</v>

236
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.610
2013 and 50 years ago today,

237
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:35.250
the first mixed martial arts fight was fought in America 60,
right?

238
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.320
60 years ago today.
What does the,
what is the date of it?

239
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:42.050
<v 3>Uh,
December 2nd,
1963.
Yeah,</v>

240
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.560
so was 50 years ago.
Yeah,
I was three at the time

241
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.520
<v 0>and the man in front of me,
uh,
judo,
gene labelle,
who,
uh,</v>

242
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.010
I've known and I've been very fortunate to be your friend for it,
right.

243
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.500
A number of years and it's been a real honor.
I'm your guide that,
uh,

244
00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:59.920
amongst like mixed martial arts fighters,
like especially even early in the day,

245
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.370
you were like really keenly involved in,

246
00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:04.720
I don't know if [inaudible] the right word to use there,

247
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.750
but very involved in the education of martial artists about grappling.

248
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.610
<v 3>Uh,
Joe,</v>

249
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.820
what I always liked to do when I was a kid to get the point over,

250
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.610
you shouldn't just do grappling,
which I know you're a great,

251
00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:25.140
you're an expert at grappling and I,

252
00:14:25.141 --> 00:14:28.790
I admire you because you've been there and done that.

253
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.630
But along with grappling,
you should learn.
Boxing.

254
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.220
Campo showed a contact quando gung fu,
Greco Roman wrestling,

255
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.420
freestyle wrestling,
motorcycle riding.
Oh,

256
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:46.760
a little bit of everything.
And of course,
myself,
when I was young,

257
00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:51.761
I got kicked out of the judo gems because guys beating me up.

258
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.900
I hit him with the left talk,
then I'd go to the boxing gym.

259
00:14:56.901 --> 00:15:01.340
The guy beat me up there and I body slam him.
So,
and I got kicked out.

260
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:05.300
I got kicked out.
I got the Guinness Book of Records that get kicked out of gyms.

261
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.970
But you taught Bruce Lee,
uh,
some judo,
didn't you?
Yes,
I said,
dad,

262
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.390
what was that like?
Well,
he a great guy,

263
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:18.950
one of the best athletes you'd ever want to see.
A nice guy.

264
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.310
Uh,
I worked a lot.

265
00:15:21.311 --> 00:15:25.610
I have a TV shows with him and uh,

266
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.370
of course he was famous for doing enter the Dragon.

267
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:33.260
He wanted me to go on that show and he says,

268
00:15:33.261 --> 00:15:36.890
you'll make $200 a week now then,
you know,

269
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.250
30 years ago,
that was big money.
Uh,

270
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:44.930
but I was making a thousand a week doing westerns.
And so,
uh,

271
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.080
I says,
I think I'll stay.
But,
uh,
it became,
um,

272
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:56.050
a call to the most famous martial arts movie ever was enter the Dragon,

273
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.240
but it was done in Hong Kong,

274
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.010
not union.
And you know the difference between Union and non union.

275
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.400
So you don't really get a piece of that.
You don't get any residuals.

276
00:16:10.401 --> 00:16:15.350
Look at these pictures of you.
Handsome Young,
pastored a beautiful man.
Oh yeah.

277
00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:20.240
Now you can see how actually small,
uh,
go co,
uh,
this guy,

278
00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:24.310
uh,
Bruce Lee was,
while he was a very small man,
uh,

279
00:16:24.311 --> 00:16:29.311
it short Gretta athletes and I ran this dance on this where he picks me up.

280
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.390
<v 1>Well,
you,
you know,</v>

281
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:37.540
it's really fascinating that there was so much learning going on at the time and

282
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:41.700
that's one of the things that I think people are so compelled to,
uh,
to,

283
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.540
it's one of the reasons why they're so compelled to learn about Bruce Lee

284
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.360
because he was really the first guy that said,

285
00:16:47.361 --> 00:16:50.120
let's just try everything and mix it all together.

286
00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:52.370
And was like really public and out front about it.

287
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.720
And his martial arts that he created called Jeet Cuno.

288
00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.910
The whole philosophy is that it was used what is useful and he credits you with

289
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:05.090
a,
a lot of the,
uh,
development of his,
uh,
grappling,
understanding,
grappling.

290
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.790
I think a lot of fighters back in that day,

291
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:11.480
they didn't really understand that you needed to know all aspects of martial

292
00:17:11.481 --> 00:17:13.160
arts.
And if you didn't know how to grapple,

293
00:17:13.161 --> 00:17:15.650
you fairly help us when a grappler gets a hold of you.

294
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:20.460
<v 3>Yeah.
And they did a lot of forms there.
But uh,
with all due respect,
uh,</v>

295
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.560
uh,

296
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:26.560
Bruce taught me a lot of techniques that I use in the movies.

297
00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.970
Jumping,
spinning kicks course.
I launched that about 20 years ago.

298
00:17:31.971 --> 00:17:36.200
I still look all over the kitchen floor for my spinning kick,

299
00:17:36.201 --> 00:17:37.970
but it's gone.
Uh,

300
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:43.050
he was a great athlete and any can beat a guy or a woman you learn from what

301
00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:50.880
they have to teach,
then use cause.
Say,
well now that I know what,

302
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.190
I'll just tell everybody I invented it.

303
00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.920
<v 1>And when you're training with him,
you know,
was,</v>

304
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.280
was there this sense of who he was at that time?

305
00:18:01.281 --> 00:18:04.640
Did anybody have any idea how that was all going to go down and how he was going

306
00:18:04.641 --> 00:18:05.540
to,
essentially,

307
00:18:05.541 --> 00:18:09.830
for a lot of people represent martial arts when we talk about martial arts
today,

308
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.670
still to this day in 2013,
people bring up Bruce Lee.

309
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:19.140
<v 3>Uh,
he is a god now,
you know?
Yeah.</v>

310
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.140
And,
uh,

311
00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.910
he was just a little guy that put too much starch in my shirt.

312
00:18:24.911 --> 00:18:28.300
So once a week,
uh,
uh,

313
00:18:28.301 --> 00:18:33.301
he didn't have it sense of humor until he stayed with me for a while and found

314
00:18:34.841 --> 00:18:39.060
out it was just a tease.
Greg,
he would have been a,
uh,

315
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.890
a champion in the martial arts,
the MMA,

316
00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.940
and you'll be interviewing him instead of me if he was still alive.

317
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.380
So you knew at the time while you were working with them that he was a unique

318
00:18:50.381 --> 00:18:54.610
guy,
very unique,
very well coordinated.

319
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:55.780
Uh,

320
00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.780
he was creator and a lot of the people that did his style,

321
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.530
I sort of didn't,

322
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:07.060
didn't like him because he wasn't traditional.

323
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.340
He learned to do boxing,

324
00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:14.420
he learned to do a grappling for me,
uh,

325
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.230
judo.
And as you can see earlier,

326
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:22.090
some of those judo moves that we did 104 years ago.

327
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.250
Yeah.
But it was still a in color.
Maybe the color colored it,

328
00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.050
but uh,
he loved that.
He loved that because he was a good athlete.

329
00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.190
He was a good tumbler and a great human being.

330
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.390
I have been blessed a Joe and uh,

331
00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:45.400
meeting people and they'd come family like your family to me.
Oh,

332
00:19:45.401 --> 00:19:49.750
thank you.
Yeah.
Family to me.
Yeah.
What do I call you?
Well,
uncle gene,

333
00:19:49.751 --> 00:19:53.920
uncle gene.
Rhonda does what has forever.

334
00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.420
Everybody has.
Yeah.

335
00:19:55.421 --> 00:19:58.960
All the stunt guys on fear factor used to call you uncle genes ad sent.
Uh,

336
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.880
but with you,
you know,
you have to,
I want to raise in my allowance,

337
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.313
you know.

338
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.770
<v 1>Um,
so when you are,
are you training with any fighters today?</v>

339
00:20:15.771 --> 00:20:17.810
Like I know you've done some work with Rhonda and the past.

340
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.950
<v 3>I train with guys,</v>

341
00:20:21.951 --> 00:20:25.180
but mostly beginners.
The,

342
00:20:25.181 --> 00:20:27.410
the thing is what I try to do.

343
00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:32.740
So many people helped me when I was beginning in the martial art world and in

344
00:20:34.971 --> 00:20:38.870
this dot worker world.
Now it's payback time.

345
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.750
And uh,
I tried to help people out.

346
00:20:41.751 --> 00:20:46.580
I do judge here in California and uh,

347
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:51.010
I did used to referee.
Um,

348
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.120
and that was hard.
I had to learn to count to 10.
Uh,

349
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.900
I was lucky to referee Muhammad Ali in a Gnocchi,

350
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:04.180
which was a big thing,
mixed martial light event in Tokyo,
Japan,

351
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.260
you know,
and uh,
so I've been there.
I had done that.

352
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.740
So anytime I can help somebody out,
hey,

353
00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:13.870
I get a pleasure out of it.

354
00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.920
<v 1>Yeah,
I'm sure you do.
You,
you really enjoy teaching and you always have taught,</v>

355
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:18.970
uh,
Silvio Pimento,

356
00:21:18.971 --> 00:21:23.500
who I trained with Silverado Silverado over John jocks.

357
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.680
He was one of your black belts,
right?
That's true.
Great Guy.
Very,

358
00:21:26.681 --> 00:21:29.800
very intelligent guy.
Very technical guy.
I learned a lot from that guy.

359
00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:32.080
I learned a lot of what you taught them as well.

360
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:35.300
<v 3>A lot of our leg locks,
which uh,</v>

361
00:21:35.301 --> 00:21:38.420
the Brazilians long time ago didn't do lake locks.

362
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:43.750
And now they're into it and they're into a lot of things that were not

363
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.990
sanctioned by their methods.

364
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.760
<v 1>Yeah,
there was a time,
it was a lot of folks don't realize this,
that Jujitsu,</v>

365
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.970
they had a bias against attacking the legs.

366
00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.230
Like if he went for a leg lock or a heel hook,
the crowd would boo and hiss.

367
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:03.100
And it became like a weird thing because it didn't make any sense because like

368
00:22:03.101 --> 00:22:05.290
the Samba guys were using leg locks,

369
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:08.270
the catch guys were using leg locks and they would go in against Jujitsu guys.

370
00:22:08.271 --> 00:22:10.930
And a lot of Jujitsu guys were not prepared for it because they didn't really

371
00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:13.540
think that it was a valid technique.
For whatever reason.

372
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:16.540
It didn't make any sense.
But now you got guys like Paul Harris,

373
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.120
who's a Brazilian guy who was probably one of the best in the world at it.

374
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:23.650
<v 3>Fantastic.
He's,
uh,
he's great.
Uh,</v>

375
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.480
one of my coach,
uh,
was,
uh,

376
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:32.050
Karl gotch was his name passed away a few years ago.
Uh,

377
00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:37.051
he used to take Olympic champions and having for lunch and the Brazilian guys

378
00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:42.010
that did the guard,
he loved it.
They roll on the back,

379
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.050
put the feed up,
and he would break her leg.

380
00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:48.690
I never saw him miss breaking your leg.
Wow.
And uh,
you know,

381
00:22:48.691 --> 00:22:53.470
as a sexual thing for me at all,
he was an animal.

382
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.720
Well,
breaking a leg means good luck.
And uh,

383
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.880
before it was the guard in wrestling,

384
00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:04.690
they called it foot and leg control and uh,

385
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.690
but it's all the same thing.
Uh,

386
00:23:07.691 --> 00:23:12.610
you control the lower body theoretically with your legs and,

387
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.900
and just attack the joint from an angle.
And then you go into a,

388
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:22.260
you can switch and go into a triangle net joke or an arm bar or a,

389
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:27.430
if you're good at spinning to decide,
you can also get a knee lock.

390
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.050
<v 1>So there's basically a lot of the techniques that you see today,</v>

391
00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.910
you Jitsu techniques like the guard there really,

392
00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:33.830
they were really kind of always around and catch.

393
00:23:33.831 --> 00:23:37.680
They just had different names and they just were more,
maybe more,
uh,

394
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.520
observe today are more analyzed today,

395
00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:45.300
<v 3>uh,
and improved on the MMA.
And uh,</v>

396
00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.420
<v 0>uh,
Dana white is,
I mean,
he's the best promoter that ever lived.</v>

397
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.930
And I liked the gentlemen,
uh,

398
00:23:55.010 --> 00:24:00.010
he's got all these guys together and they have to [inaudible] improvement.

399
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:04.880
You have to,
every year somebody comes up with a new technique,

400
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:09.680
which is an old technique with a different name.
Uh,

401
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:13.820
it's,
it's kind of a important now years ago,

402
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:18.620
uh,
you know how they got the name that you use all the time?
The camera?

403
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:24.290
Yeah.
From the guy who fought Helio Gracie.
Yes.
But he was a judo champion.

404
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.800
And in judo they kicked him out of Japan because he wanted to go pro as a

405
00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:31.850
wrestler,
which he did.

406
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:37.010
So he go down and he'd beat everybody with a double wrist lock,

407
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.370
a dominant arm crank.
And uh,

408
00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.210
so they couldn't pronounce double wrist lock or downward arm crank.

409
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.480
So they said the camera,
you know,

410
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:50.960
and that's based on the move that beat Leo.
He,
yeah,

411
00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:54.440
but he beat a lot of guys and the,
the progress,

412
00:24:54.441 --> 00:24:57.560
there's a Karl Gotch,
uh,

413
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.470
he'd beat everybody with that hold,

414
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.770
but he did it a little bit different.
He had braked the wrist,
the elbow,
the,

415
00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:10.810
and the shoulder where most of the people,
they just,
uh,

416
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.820
break the elbow and the shoulder.
We,
you know,

417
00:25:13.821 --> 00:25:16.940
when I talked to Josh Barnett about the difference between catch wrestling and

418
00:25:16.941 --> 00:25:20.960
Brazilian Jujitsu of being charged about as big an expert as any you could ask

419
00:25:20.961 --> 00:25:23.370
for in this country,
like active fighters that really understands,

420
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.450
catch what he calls catch the violent art.
He's like,

421
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.700
Jujitsu is a general art catches the violent art.

422
00:25:28.701 --> 00:25:31.460
It's much more violent approach.
It's all just grappling.

423
00:25:31.461 --> 00:25:32.600
It's still just grappling,

424
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.480
but a much more violent approach to attaining the positions,

425
00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:38.150
wrestling based attacks to attain the positions.

426
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.710
Whereas Jujitsu guys try to move around things.
A wrestler who go through it.

427
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:48.340
Josh Burnett has been a friend of mine for 104 years.

428
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.960
He's a young man and it looks beautiful for a hundred,
four years old.

429
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.990
Is he a vampire or perhaps a way he takes that botox so bad for you?

430
00:25:56.391 --> 00:26:00.650
Some time to stop and look.
He gave passes for still in his late thirties.

431
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:05.750
Uh,
but he did work a little bit of Karl gotch and the feel good,
uh,

432
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:10.270
pros.
He's got a great trainer now and uh,

433
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.180
uh,
I,
I can hardly wait to,
uh,
uh,

434
00:26:14.181 --> 00:26:18.650
December 28th and watch him.
He's on that card.
Yeah.

435
00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:21.730
Against Travis Browne should be very,
very interesting.
Well,
it,

436
00:26:21.731 --> 00:26:25.100
Travis Browne is no slouch.
Oh,
he's as tough as they come.

437
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.970
It doesn't get any tougher than that guy.
Oh,
well how about you?
Never impossible.

438
00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.960
I'm too dumb for that.
Um,
the,
uh,
Travis Browne,

439
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.030
Alistair Overeem fight highlighted.
Dot.
I mean,

440
00:26:35.031 --> 00:26:38.780
he took just tremendous shots to the body that a lot of people would have folded

441
00:26:38.781 --> 00:26:40.030
up shop on.
I've,

442
00:26:40.031 --> 00:26:43.530
I've never seen anybody take dot kind of a beating and the beginning around and

443
00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:46.470
come back to knock guy out with a head kick afterwards.
It was incredible.

444
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.890
That's his,
that's like heart and will,
you know that you can't,

445
00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:54.000
you can't measure that.
But Barnett,
Scott that to Barnett's an animal,
you know,

446
00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:57.210
if you don't beat Barnett and he comes back,
I mean,
he's always in that fight.

447
00:26:57.211 --> 00:27:01.860
He's not,
he doesn't fold up shop ever.
He sees a solid,
solid veteran too.

448
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.280
He's a sneaky dude.
Like he knows his way around shit.

449
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.640
He's in there and done that.
Very,
very smart guy.
You know,

450
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:11.370
we had him on the podcast and people were blown away.

451
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.820
I get so many text messages and tweets from people going,
how is it?

452
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.640
This guy gets punched in the head for a living and he's 10 times smarter than
me.

453
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:21.310
Like five different people said that to me.
Uh,

454
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:25.800
drastic Jasper net.
I'll go up to them,
I'll say,
Hey Josh,

455
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.650
show me the comber.
And he had grabbed me.

456
00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:33.690
There's an outside child as a double rich slide downward.

457
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.460
I'm Craig and then he'll put it on me.
I loved the man.
Yeah,

458
00:27:38.461 --> 00:27:41.930
he's all catch.
He keeps the torch lit,
right?
Yeah.
Well the,

459
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.670
as far as like top level fighters,
he certainly does well.

460
00:27:44.671 --> 00:27:47.810
He's been alarmed a long time and he's got a lot to teach.

461
00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:52.140
There's a lot to talk about and a lot to show.
Very,
very smart guy too.

462
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.690
What do you think?
Like as far as like Karl Gotch,

463
00:27:54.691 --> 00:27:57.330
one of the things that he's known for is not just a teaching,

464
00:27:57.331 --> 00:28:01.230
a lot of guys catch wrestling submissions,
but also it's conditioning Regina.

465
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.430
It's conditioning regimen.
It's supposed to be one of the most grueling ever.

466
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.540
Like they said that they would,

467
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:11.010
he would make guys do 500 bodyweight squats before they could even practice.

468
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:16.260
Uh,
he did,
he had me working for a few years with,
uh,

469
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:21.270
these weights with a handle on it.
Mace balls.

470
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:26.300
We sell those@ana.com as a manger or the whatever he used,

471
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:32.130
um,
night 90 a white kettle balls.

472
00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:36.930
He called 90 pounds.
Yeah.
Kettlebells.
And uh,
I still have 40 fives.

473
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.720
Um,
but when I worked with him,

474
00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:44.700
I was 180 pounds and he was like two 60.
Jesus Christ.

475
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:48.750
He's a giant man too.
It was a big,
like a big,

476
00:28:48.751 --> 00:28:51.900
like European boned to 60.
Yeah.

477
00:28:51.901 --> 00:28:56.670
But [inaudible] he was,
you didn't see any fat or no,
none at all.

478
00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.800
And the thing I liked about him,

479
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.140
he was a sadistic bastard.
I've heard that about you.

480
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:05.480
Uh,

481
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:11.060
you must have the Silverado bus go that and I'm just a little trivia.

482
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:15.690
Everybody wants to know why they call you uncle gene.

483
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:21.240
While I've been in 13 hall of Fames,
I've won tournaments all over the world.

484
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:26.930
My proudest thing is when people call me uncle gene because with the old

485
00:29:27.001 --> 00:29:29.790
restors,
the real,
what they called shooters,

486
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.710
you finally got to a stage which nobody got too,

487
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:40.100
and if you could get a bunch of guys and make them yell uncle like I,

488
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.670
uh,
then afterwards they awarded me,
uh,

489
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:50.380
now your uncle jade,
how did it become uncle?
One of them cry uncle.
But,

490
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:53.260
but how did that figure of speech is so strange?

491
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.540
Like why would you cry uncle to get someone to stop?

492
00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.490
Which doesn't make any sense.
I don't know.
But at that time,
that's what they say.

493
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.990
I instead I give up.
They say uncle,
I remember that from,

494
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.380
I don't know if kids didn't even understand that cry uncle,
do they?

495
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:12.730
I grew up with it.
Yeah,
but you're a 40,
and I'm talking about like 20 year olds.

496
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:15.010
Like he forgets he's not a kid anymore.

497
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.730
He's the kids in a perpetual state of kidneys.
Um,

498
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.080
I only think kids today use that expression.
No.
Well,
uh,

499
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:24.460
<v 3>uh,</v>

500
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:29.460
expressions change since in the last 20 years.

501
00:30:29.591 --> 00:30:33.130
You know,
you got to have a,
a cell phone.
You got to

502
00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:36.820
<v 0>[inaudible] do all those things on the Internet.
Do you take selfies?</v>

503
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.420
Do you do like selfies for Instagram ever?
No.
No.

504
00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:43.510
I'm from the old school where you have to die all the phone.

505
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.370
I got up to draw pictures of people.
Oh no cameras.
Ghada Ghada

506
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:53.500
and I think you taught it to me.
When you use the change,
buy diapers,

507
00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:59.260
what is it like going through a,
all these different generations?

508
00:30:59.261 --> 00:31:04.090
Like I grew up in the 70s and uh,
you know,
I,
uh,

509
00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.820
I was around before the Internet was around,
you know,

510
00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:09.500
I went to high school in the 80s and uh,

511
00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.600
I graduated from high school in 1985.
So I've been around a long time to the,

512
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.100
the change has been pretty interesting.

513
00:31:15.101 --> 00:31:19.870
But for you like being from the error of like Bruce Lee movies and like you
were,

514
00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:24.370
you were a national judo champion in 1954 and that's incredible.

515
00:31:24.371 --> 00:31:26.230
That's a long time ago.
I mean,
how much,

516
00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.090
how much different is the world today than it was then?

517
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:35.290
<v 3>Um,
everything changes.
And uh,
you got to change with it.</v>

518
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:40.480
54 and 55,
two years.
And then I turned pro.
Um,

519
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:46.750
things change and you gotta be up on it.
I,
uh,

520
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:51.520
I'm not,
I try,
I've got computers all over the place and,

521
00:31:51.521 --> 00:31:54.100
uh,
all I look at it,

522
00:31:54.101 --> 00:31:58.600
you got mail and see who the hell I hates me today.

523
00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:03.190
Uh,
and a few other little things,
but the kids nowadays,

524
00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:04.480
the teachings,

525
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:09.520
they have to learn how to do a computer cell phones.

526
00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.370
<v 0>There is,
there's more to everything.</v>

527
00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:15.130
So that you think is the biggest difference between when you were a kid in

528
00:32:15.131 --> 00:32:19.750
today's just the Internet.
Uh,
the Internet technology,
uh,

529
00:32:19.751 --> 00:32:20.584
the cars,

530
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.830
<v 3>the gadget,
look at the electrical stuff.</v>

531
00:32:23.831 --> 00:32:26.740
They have the flat screen TV.

532
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.580
I had to be on steroids to pick up a TV

533
00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.440
<v 0>20 years ago.
They used to be big giant cabinets.
Remember those things.</v>

534
00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:37.840
They're like furniture and a little tiny screen in it.

535
00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.590
Screen was only about 12 inches wide

536
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.130
<v 1>and the TV thing was huge.
All that equipment and everything back there.</v>

537
00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:48.220
<v 3>Now everything's flat screen and uh,
had a record player on the top.
Oh yeah,</v>

538
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:52.000
always record.
You are old.
And they had cabinet doors.

539
00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:56.200
Remember they had cabinet doors,
they swung open things,

540
00:32:56.230 --> 00:33:00.300
slides so you can hide the TV.
You know,
I kind of just like weird.
Yeah.

541
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.213
The old days.

542
00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:03.600
<v 1>Um,
for me it's fascinating.
But for you,</v>

543
00:33:03.601 --> 00:33:06.780
I mean I'm watching these videos of you when you were young man and you're doing

544
00:33:06.781 --> 00:33:10.020
these fight scenes with Bruce Lee and I think,
wow,
this guy is,

545
00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.360
you've seen everything.
I mean you've seen so much.

546
00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.680
You've seen the changing of the perceptions of martial arts for the first time

547
00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.910
with those Bruce Lee movies.

548
00:33:17.911 --> 00:33:19.980
That was the first changing of perception of martial arts.

549
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.970
The first real introduction to the Western world and a mainstream way was Bruce

550
00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:24.600
Lee movies.

551
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.030
Cause before that none of those other martial arts things ever really got

552
00:33:27.031 --> 00:33:30.120
traction.
Like he did,
but he was all a sudden,
it was like,
Whoa,

553
00:33:30.121 --> 00:33:32.880
I want to learn how to do that.
That guy's amazing.

554
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:37.730
The showmanship and his dynamic presence and his speed and his techniques.

555
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.390
Like nobody had ever seen anything like that before.

556
00:33:39.391 --> 00:33:42.570
So we saw this Bruce Lee guy and all of a sudden everybody's talking about

557
00:33:42.571 --> 00:33:43.770
martial arts and then,

558
00:33:43.771 --> 00:33:47.100
but you've had a chance to see that you've had a chance to see,
like I said,

559
00:33:47.101 --> 00:33:50.700
you were involved in the first ever mixed martial arts fight and now seeing the

560
00:33:50.701 --> 00:33:52.830
UFC grow to become what it is today.

561
00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.820
You've been there through the introduction to the latest evolution.

562
00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:00.510
<v 3>Uh,
it's a changing experience.</v>

563
00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.730
Like my event,
uh,

564
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.760
50 years ago today was the first sanctioned televised,

565
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.010
uh,
mixed martial art event.

566
00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:15.890
And now the rules have changed.
That's why I say,
uh,
uh,

567
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.860
when I choke the guy out and he was a great,
great,

568
00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.490
great fighter.
Milo savage,
uh,

569
00:34:23.491 --> 00:34:28.200
and the referee who was also a doctor,
couldn't revive him.

570
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:30.150
If as somebody like

571
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:36.510
a big John McCarthy was there,
he'd,
he'd had been able to revive the guy.

572
00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:40.120
You mean not,
not dead.
You mean speeding?
It was unconscious.
Oh yeah,

573
00:34:40.121 --> 00:34:41.190
give cops too,

574
00:34:41.191 --> 00:34:46.191
which is a arted reviving a called Kaatsu Kaatsu and that was just,

575
00:34:46.531 --> 00:34:48.180
was that rubbing the neck or something like?
Well,

576
00:34:48.181 --> 00:34:53.181
it's getting the heart going where it pumps blood to the head.

577
00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.970
When you choke a man out,
you're not choking him.

578
00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:02.270
You're slowing down the blood supply to his head til he passes unconscious.

579
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.740
Now I broke guys legs and arms and stuff like that and they got a permanent

580
00:35:07.741 --> 00:35:10.590
injury.
You choke a guy out,
ted,

581
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:15.030
seconds later you'll revive him.
He's okay ghetto

582
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:18.050
<v 1>rather than getting knocked out to a lot of people think it's the same thing.</v>

583
00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:21.290
The people that don't understand martial arts,
so big,
big,
big difference.

584
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.920
Getting choked out like this.
Really no ill effects.
The real effects,
uh,

585
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.000
come from striking.

586
00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.690
<v 3>Really?
Oh I agree with you.</v>

587
00:35:28.691 --> 00:35:32.280
And that's how you get brain concoctions and that dead.

588
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.280
Then you're having trouble when you're talking gun.

589
00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:39.220
Bit Punchy and guys wrong me there and got gone

590
00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.980
<v 1>up there.
You guys,
are you making fun of guys with brain damage?
That's weird.</v>

591
00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:49.790
I only saw gene,
this,
uh,
we've,

592
00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:53.800
we've all known guys that have gotten punching and that's the dirty aspect of

593
00:35:53.801 --> 00:35:57.010
this.
This game of mixed martial arts itself is like,

594
00:35:57.070 --> 00:36:00.040
there's guys that do the wrong thing and they stay when they shouldn't have

595
00:36:00.041 --> 00:36:01.990
stayed and they take shots it shouldn't have taken.

596
00:36:01.991 --> 00:36:04.720
And then we get to see that damage.
And it's very disturbing.

597
00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.270
It's something that people don't ever want to think is going to happen to them.

598
00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:11.800
And that's why I always give this encouragement that if anybody's thinking of

599
00:36:11.801 --> 00:36:15.880
retiring,
retire,
if you're thinking of it at all,
retire,

600
00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.420
<v 3>I,
you know,
something,
you,</v>

601
00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:23.920
you're right on the numbers right down the numbers.
You're never,

602
00:36:23.921 --> 00:36:27.280
you're always have the feeling.
Now in my eighties,

603
00:36:27.281 --> 00:36:30.370
I still have the feeling of getting on the mat and I said,

604
00:36:30.371 --> 00:36:33.340
Jesus guys making a mistake,
you know,

605
00:36:33.341 --> 00:36:38.341
but I gotta concentrate on teaching the guy and not trying to prove myself.

606
00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.160
<v 1>Well,
you just,
competitive fires never really,
totally burned out.</v>

607
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:47.660
<v 3>No.
Uh,
the rest of my is burned out though.
Um,</v>

608
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.260
it's important.
That's why I say to Rhonda,

609
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:57.710
I'm sure glad she got into the movies and so when the time comes,

610
00:36:58.681 --> 00:37:02.370
like Joe Lewis or Cassius clay,

611
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:07.590
they have another place to go.
Randy couture was a good friend of mine.

612
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:12.460
Now he does.
He's not competing anymore,
but he does a movie.
Yeah,

613
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:14.080
<v 1>he's translated the best.</v>

614
00:37:14.081 --> 00:37:18.600
He's done the very best job of transferring from MMA stardom to movie stardom,

615
00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:23.470
enacting stardom.
And he's,
he's works a lot now.
I have more power to him.

616
00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:28.300
He's good too.
You know,
he was good,
very bendable.
He's very calm,
very relaxed.

617
00:37:28.301 --> 00:37:32.290
Like you know what made him a great fighter will make him a great actor.
I think

618
00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:37.890
<v 3>that's good.
You when you,
Amanda doesn't think of the future,
doesn't have one.</v>

619
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.380
Yeah.
So,
uh,

620
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.630
<v 1>well he's a terrible example to use though because the guy fought til he was 48.</v>

621
00:37:42.631 --> 00:37:45.540
I mean [inaudible] he was just incredible.
He's a terrible example.

622
00:37:45.541 --> 00:37:47.790
And you used to get out when you,
you know,
when you think you should get out,

623
00:37:47.791 --> 00:37:49.970
get out because he came back,
you know,

624
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:53.400
he was going to retire after the second chocolate Dell fine.
Then he came back,

625
00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:57.840
won the heavyweight title.
Randy coture has gone through a whole whirlwind.

626
00:37:57.841 --> 00:37:59.610
So maybe I really should just shut the fuck up.

627
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.240
I tell people when to retire and whatnot.

628
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.190
Randy's also fine.
I mean,
you talked to him,
he's totally lucid speaks clearly.

629
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.400
You know,
he did a good job of protecting himself with a lot of his grappling,

630
00:38:11.401 --> 00:38:15.420
you know,
because he was a very good grappler.
Always very solid and intelligent,

631
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:19.580
really good at executing g game plans.
But everybody takes shots.
You just got,

632
00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.630
they got to know when to not take anymore.

633
00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:26.190
It's so hard to figure out to staff who wants to retire when they're on top.
Yup.

634
00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.550
And he wants to retire when they still feel like they can beat a lot of dudes

635
00:38:29.551 --> 00:38:30.190
acids.

636
00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:34.930
<v 3>And you know,
a lot of guys that just for one or two times too long.
Yup,</v>

637
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:36.160
Yup.
Or more,

638
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.550
<v 0>you know,
unfortunately we were the money's there and uh,</v>

639
00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.220
it's hard to pass up a yeah.
But when you're putting you the only initiative,

640
00:38:43.221 --> 00:38:47.080
the veteran you have in life is your body,

641
00:38:47.081 --> 00:38:49.440
you got to take care of it the best way you can.

642
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.370
This weird things that happened to like,
uh,

643
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:55.000
like Bob Sapp is an example of one of the weird things that happened in MMA

644
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.720
where the guy becomes sort of a traveling road show and just goes and fights

645
00:38:58.721 --> 00:39:03.130
guys and tops quick and moves onto the next town and sort of like selling the

646
00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:05.080
name that he made when he was in pride,

647
00:39:05.081 --> 00:39:07.120
when he was one of the scariest guys on earth.

648
00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.590
And He seems like he's just not really there competitively anymore,

649
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.020
but he does a lot of fights,
has a lot of fights.

650
00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:18.340
And that's how he's making a living,
I guess.
Well,
let's help.
Uh,
pray to God.

651
00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:23.140
He doesn't get a permanent,
uh,
damage,
uh,
injury.
Yeah.
Like,

652
00:39:23.141 --> 00:39:27.100
um,
unfortunately,
one of the great old school legends,
uh,
Gary Goodrich,

653
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:31.430
he's been real public about his issues and how,
how much,
um,

654
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:36.670
pugilistic dementia,
which is what the medical term for punching punch truck.

655
00:39:36.671 --> 00:39:40.210
Yeah.
And He,
he's talking pretty openly about it to,
you know,

656
00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:43.060
alert young fighters to the,
the risks and you know,

657
00:39:43.061 --> 00:39:47.740
and talk about what he basically says it was k one that did the men basically

658
00:39:47.741 --> 00:39:49.870
says that fighting and MMA was one thing,

659
00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:52.810
but the amount of blows that he would take and k one was just substantially

660
00:39:52.811 --> 00:39:56.080
greater.
You know what I mean?
Those guys were so high level too.

661
00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:01.450
That's why it is so important to have a great referee.

662
00:40:01.451 --> 00:40:06.451
And there's a lot of good ones here in Nevada all over the world.

663
00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.150
And there's a lot of ones that aren't that sharp.
Uh,

664
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:14.200
they don't know when to stop a fight and a guy,

665
00:40:14.201 --> 00:40:19.201
I'll take just one or two blows where he's can't protect himself and a then

666
00:40:20.231 --> 00:40:23.230
it's,
she had rummy.
Yeah.
And those,

667
00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:27.640
those blows after guys are out,
are very dangerous.
You know,
those are,

668
00:40:27.641 --> 00:40:30.940
those are really bad ones.
That was the ones,
the rep,
and it's oftentimes,

669
00:40:30.941 --> 00:40:32.110
it's not the fighters fault.

670
00:40:32.111 --> 00:40:34.960
The fighter is hitting them because they're in a zone and they don't even know

671
00:40:34.961 --> 00:40:37.900
what they're doing.
They're trying to finish this guy.
They're not even thinking.

672
00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.900
They're barely even aware.
They might,
they might think he's almost out.

673
00:40:40.901 --> 00:40:43.420
But what if he wakes up?
What if he wakes up and does this to me?

674
00:40:43.421 --> 00:40:44.650
And they're trying to end that fight.

675
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:48.430
It's the referee's job to be objective and to see it and to get in there before

676
00:40:48.431 --> 00:40:52.090
those unnecessary blows take place.
But that's a tough gig.
I mean,

677
00:40:52.091 --> 00:40:56.050
you've done it before and you've been there for a hundred MMA fights or at least

678
00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:56.651
a hundred events.
I mean,

679
00:40:56.651 --> 00:41:00.610
I've seen you at so many of them when there's moments where a guy just isn't in

680
00:41:00.611 --> 00:41:01.570
the right position,

681
00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:06.370
maybe a strange technique lands and no one expects a head kick that no one saw

682
00:41:06.371 --> 00:41:09.460
common and the guy goes down and by the time the referee gets to him,

683
00:41:09.461 --> 00:41:13.000
he's already getting hit two and three times while he's already unconscious.

684
00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.310
It's really common.
Yeah,
that's,

685
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.191
that's a,

686
00:41:18.191 --> 00:41:23.191
that's a fact that I've seen so many guys that are injured and I was,

687
00:41:23.471 --> 00:41:27.220
had a judging one of the,
uh,
tournaments.

688
00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:32.770
Uh,
and one of the competitors had a Hematoma,

689
00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.220
which is a blood pressure.

690
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.040
<v 3>Claire around his head.
Worst I've ever seen.</v>

691
00:41:37.041 --> 00:41:40.190
I've seen a lot of them from boxing and uh,

692
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:46.060
the doctor was playing with a ring girls and uh,

693
00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:51.510
they didn't,
uh,
stop the fight and I said,
Jesus,

694
00:41:51.511 --> 00:41:55.110
they should have stopped the fight.
And uh,
you know,

695
00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:59.070
he went the full three rounds,
but I mean,

696
00:41:59.071 --> 00:42:01.350
he looked like a hamburger.

697
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:05.130
<v 1>You,
there's a,
some people get busted up.
There's a weird moment,</v>

698
00:42:05.131 --> 00:42:06.480
like when do you stop a fight?

699
00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.780
Do you stop a fight when a guy's head is swollen misshapen?

700
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.110
Like did you see a mark harmonic versa?
Josie Aldo.
Yeah,

701
00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:16.450
he had that crazy giant lump on his head that looked like yet,

702
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.140
like someone had inserted a small football underneath his forehead.

703
00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:23.160
Remember that?
But he fought well,
even though he had that,
he fought well.

704
00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.940
So that's like one of those things where it gets that weird blurry line.
Like,

705
00:42:26.941 --> 00:42:30.030
how do you stop this fight?
Like he's,
he won the last round.
I mean,
Hammock took,

706
00:42:30.031 --> 00:42:33.870
although down here it was in his guard,
he was ground and pounding him pretty,

707
00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:38.760
pretty clearly one the last round.
So,
even with this big giant lump on his head,

708
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:42.180
you know,
he's still doing well in the fight.
Yeah,
he's doing well.

709
00:42:42.181 --> 00:42:44.700
Wait 10 years when he starts having headaches.

710
00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:47.160
So you think that like when you see like an outside thing,

711
00:42:47.161 --> 00:42:50.130
swelling outside the skin where all that blood,
they should just stop a fight.

712
00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.530
Well,
uh,
let me put it this

713
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:57.860
<v 3>and I have debates and it's my opinion,
right?
I've had debates with doctors.</v>

714
00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:01.400
When a guy gets hit from football,

715
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.260
he gets knocked out or a glove.

716
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:10.400
What happens if you get hit in the arm?
It swells up.

717
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.420
Same thing with the uh,
brain.
It swells up.

718
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:17.990
And a lot of people,
they won't do anything right away.

719
00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:22.670
Cause I'm from the boxing ward world,

720
00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:27.260
we put ice on right away.
Now here's what happens.

721
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.830
I was told by Dr. Bernard Swartz

722
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.480
50 or 60 years ago that

723
00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:39.180
when the brain swells it,

724
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:44.230
there's bones around your head and it pushes the brain,

725
00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:49.901
pushes against the bones of your head and it gives you a brain injury.

726
00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:51.890
It kills

727
00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:53.570
<v 4>okay</v>

728
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.870
<v 3>part of your brain.
So,
you know,</v>

729
00:43:56.871 --> 00:44:01.190
make sure that I put ice,
always carry ice.

730
00:44:01.191 --> 00:44:05.590
If a guy gets knocked out from a blow,
you put ice on his head,

731
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:08.900
<v 1>try to get the swelling down that keep the swelling down like you would do for a</v>

732
00:44:08.901 --> 00:44:11.840
need,
just like you would do for an elbow.
You do it for the head as well.

733
00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.140
Absolutely.
How come people don't know that?

734
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:19.260
<v 3>Well,
people do.
I,
I've talked to a newer surgeons,
doctors did they puff,</v>

735
00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.140
puff,
they say they,
that that isn't what I do.

736
00:44:22.141 --> 00:44:24.060
I give them this medicine or that medicine.

737
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:28.680
And I said by that time he's already screwed up yet.
Oh.
And uh,

738
00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.510
I've been there,
I've done that.

739
00:44:30.511 --> 00:44:35.511
I've been around boxing and wrestling for 75 years.

740
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.330
Wow.
And,
uh,

741
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:43.920
and that just not once every month.
That's every day.

742
00:44:43.921 --> 00:44:46.830
That's my life,
you know.
And,
uh,

743
00:44:46.831 --> 00:44:49.460
I've see injuries and I,

744
00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.560
I've seen being doing stunts.

745
00:44:52.561 --> 00:44:57.561
I be see people that have crashed cars and they just,

746
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:02.730
they want to put them on a Gurney to put ice on their head.

747
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000
And I've seen a stuntman come out punchy from impacts for,

748
00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:12.830
<v 1>so the people don't realize how many stuntman get injured every year.</v>

749
00:45:12.831 --> 00:45:15.710
I mean people,
a lot of them die as well.

750
00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.910
I mean I've heard of many stunt men dying while filming crazy action for scenes

751
00:45:19.911 --> 00:45:24.140
in movies,
especially car accidents,
motorcycle accidents.
It's very common.

752
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:26.060
It's a very,
very,
very rough business.

753
00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:31.100
<v 3>I had a friend of mine,
Mike Tillman was his name and he,
he uh,</v>

754
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:33.470
had a freak accident and the car,

755
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:38.330
it's split his helmet and um,
uh,

756
00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.330
they didn't put ice on them and then wondered why.

757
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:45.290
And he finally came out of it long time,

758
00:45:45.291 --> 00:45:49.760
but later he only lived at year admin.
I knew him real well.

759
00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:55.180
We used to go motorcycle riding racing every weekend and he didn't even know me.

760
00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:59.090
And I says,
wow.

761
00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:03.620
So the most dangerous thing to me is a brain injury.

762
00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.970
I agree.
I agree hard.
A lot more research on it.

763
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:10.920
<v 1>Is that you and Rodney Dangerfield?
Did you double as Rodney?</v>

764
00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.050
<v 3>I did double him a few times.
Oh God.</v>

765
00:46:15.051 --> 00:46:18.850
A couple of TV shows I had was a picture of you guys up there.
What's that?

766
00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:22.820
My God.
Can you say,
uh,
yeah,
I uh,
yeah,
we,

767
00:46:22.821 --> 00:46:26.390
I was doing sword fighting then sword fighting.
Oh yeah,

768
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.860
definitely him and uh,
he was quite a character,
quite a character.

769
00:46:30.861 --> 00:46:34.770
He would always leave his pants unzip and um,

770
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:39.570
I had uh,
one of the actors of,
I'm saying,
hey,
his pants inside zip.

771
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:43.970
He'd go up and he says,
I'm getting air conditioning.
Don't bother me.

772
00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.420
And he just did it as a swerve a joke,

773
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:50.780
right?
With like the robes and stuff.

774
00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:55.750
<v 1>Well,
I've talked about this before,
but I worked at great woods,</v>

775
00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:00.320
a concert center and Mansfield,
Massachusetts.
When I was a kid I was a,

776
00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:01.960
amongst the security personnel there.

777
00:47:01.961 --> 00:47:06.070
And so I was backstage and I got to see Rodney as he was preparing for a show.

778
00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:08.440
He would just have a robe on and nothing else.

779
00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:11.740
And we were wearing slippers and he had a robe on and he was walking around back

780
00:47:11.741 --> 00:47:14.890
there.
This is before I'd ever done standup comedy,
but I was like,

781
00:47:14.891 --> 00:47:17.710
that guy is the shit.
Like,
look at him.
He's just,

782
00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:20.200
he's literally as comfortable as you can get.

783
00:47:20.201 --> 00:47:23.860
He's wearing a bathrobe on purpose and it's because he could,
you know,

784
00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:26.740
he was like,
cause I can whatever,
I'm just gonna wear a bathrobe.

785
00:47:26.741 --> 00:47:28.220
It's comfortable and light the

786
00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.070
<v 3>way I,
the way you'll</v>

787
00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:34.490
<v 1>roared.
He does it because he can because he keeps fucking Ronnie did.</v>

788
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:36.660
He knew he was Rodney Dangerfield and no,

789
00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:41.590
never said anything and he played it straight.
And apparently a super nice guy.

790
00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:45.190
I like everybody I know that did business with them or had any interactions with

791
00:47:45.191 --> 00:47:48.520
them,
always came away from it.
Same Rodney,
he's a great guy.

792
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:53.410
My friend Jeff,
my manager Jeff,
he was with one of,
uh,

793
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.880
one of his clients was one of Rodney's original,
um,
uh,

794
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.300
comics on the Hbo Comedy Series that he did.
And uh,

795
00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:04.000
he said that Rodney was just the best,
just the coolest,
nicest guy.

796
00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:08.730
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
And what I've said to you,</v>

797
00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:12.550
<v 1>a lot of sense of humor.
He was in a real original too.
He was a handle,</v>

798
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:16.610
but a stand up comedian.
And of course he's not as good as you.

799
00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:20.930
You're my hero,
I get out of here.
But he was also a great actor too.

800
00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.470
Did you ever see back back to school?

801
00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:25.290
The movie with him and Kinison was in that movie?
Yeah.

802
00:48:25.291 --> 00:48:29.600
It was fucking hilarious in that movie.
Those were classics when I was a kid.

803
00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:32.990
You know,
those were like,
those are some of the,
in my opinion,

804
00:48:32.991 --> 00:48:36.710
some of the most enjoyable comedy moves that I ever saw was a Rodney Dangerfield

805
00:48:36.711 --> 00:48:39.020
once.
It was just a feeling that you had for the whole thing.

806
00:48:39.021 --> 00:48:42.140
Like it would just see the guy and you would want a laugh.
You know,

807
00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:46.220
you don't see a lot of the like the old comedians,

808
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:51.020
<v 3>uh,
anymore.
Very seldom.
What do you mean?</v>

809
00:48:51.021 --> 00:48:55.470
Like which guys?
Well,
anything that I got a Bob Hope,
uh,

810
00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:56.960
they like that kind of

811
00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:04.030
a Rodney Dangerfield,
Jack Benny,
uh,

812
00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:08.360
people that were stand up comedians.
Uh,

813
00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:13.670
there is no show that I know that really

814
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.840
<v 1>showboats I know he's saying like,
um,</v>

815
00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.690
you used to be the tonight show with Johnny Carson.

816
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:23.860
That was like the big thing that was like the big show boat or showcase.

817
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.590
Have you got on the tonight show with Johnny Carson and Johnny Carson pulled you

818
00:49:26.591 --> 00:49:31.450
next to him on the couch.
Whoa.
Wow.
You're made.
You're made man.

819
00:49:31.451 --> 00:49:34.570
You,
you made it.
You've gone through the hallowed halls,
the guy,

820
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.390
the man gave you the seat on the couch.
That was a big deal.

821
00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:39.340
This is not really a thing like that anymore.

822
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:42.700
But now there's the internet and the Internet has kind of changed the whole

823
00:49:42.701 --> 00:49:45.910
rules for how media gets out there to people.

824
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:49.930
And there's a lot of people that the odds of you being at home and 11 o'clock on

825
00:49:49.931 --> 00:49:52.630
a Wednesday night,
those are not that good.
You know,

826
00:49:52.631 --> 00:49:54.940
you probably have things to do.
You're probably up in your round.

827
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:57.460
They a number of actual people who are going to see that.
It's very limited.

828
00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:02.670
But if you went on some TV show somewhere and then they put the clip online,

829
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:06.010
then the clip online,
you could watch anytime you want.

830
00:50:06.011 --> 00:50:07.900
So then it spreads like wildfire.

831
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:11.380
So now all you have to do is have something online and all it is is judo.

832
00:50:11.381 --> 00:50:14.740
Gene Lebell says,
this is hilarious.
And He sends it to Brian Red Band.

833
00:50:14.741 --> 00:50:16.030
Brian Red Band sends it to me.

834
00:50:16.031 --> 00:50:20.860
I sent it to Brian Callen and goes across the country.
That's what happens today.

835
00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:24.850
And you'd get these unheralded kids that,
uh,
do a stand up on,

836
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:28.130
on like a youtube channel.
They're like doing it to a camera

837
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.030
<v 3>and they get hundreds of thousands of views,
seats,
codes,
and we're very,</v>

838
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:37.010
very strict as famous.
You can get famous real easy.
Now I get a kick out.

839
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:41.170
I shouldn't say that.
That doesn't make sense.
Well,
when I say accessible,
famous,

840
00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:44.720
like when I'm judging around California,
people come up,

841
00:50:44.721 --> 00:50:49.040
they want to take a picture.
I'm in my eighties,
and they wanted an autograph.

842
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:53.500
Uh,
something like that.
And I says to my wife,
Jesus,

843
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:57.830
at that age,
uh,
the before I was,
when I was good,

844
00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.120
these people weren't even born.
And it makes you feel good.

845
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:04.880
She calls me [inaudible] center of attraction.

846
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:08.100
You're the center of attraction.
Jolene.

847
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:13.820
And I want to thank you again for that tape.
You did me.
We won't get into it.

848
00:51:13.821 --> 00:51:16.730
But it was Oh,
the documentary on you?
Yeah,

849
00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.920
that was hilarious.
I,

850
00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:25.220
I've got it on my computer and if somebody wants to see who my hero is,

851
00:51:26.331 --> 00:51:30.080
I says,
here's Joe Rogan and how dare you.
Yeah.

852
00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:35.050
<v 1>There Eugene Labelle.
Um,
there's a,
a documentary on you that,
uh,</v>

853
00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.600
that roots of fight did write the,
the tee shirt company.

854
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:41.570
<v 3>I,
yeah.
When is that out now?
I don't know.</v>

855
00:51:41.571 --> 00:51:45.350
The first thing I gotta buy.
Your business partner doesn't tell me anything.

856
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:48.980
She just says,
sign here and your business partner,

857
00:51:48.981 --> 00:51:52.670
your wife and the whole God know what she used to Canadian.
Uh,

858
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:58.820
uh,
no,
her name is Kelly and a lover of mad late.

859
00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:01.790
Uh,
but,
uh,
she,
uh,

860
00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.040
she says this is the way it's going to be done.

861
00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:08.420
I've been in business with so many different people that I got the short end of

862
00:52:08.421 --> 00:52:11.720
the stick,
so she doesn't let me know too much.

863
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:16.990
But I did see the tape of different people talking about me,

864
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:22.130
uh,
that I was in pressed,
uh,

865
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:26.390
you know,
kind of funny.
Uh,
uh,

866
00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:32.020
Ge,
uh,
Bj Penn and I didn't think a lot of these people would remember me.

867
00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:35.000
Of course Rhonda does a Rhonda

868
00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:39.410
<v 1>as Mother Anna Maria who was a world champion.
Hey Brian,</v>

869
00:52:39.411 --> 00:52:44.360
I'm sending you a link right now on your,
uh,
Gmail to,
uh,
that,
uh,

870
00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:48.050
the documentary.
It's an email.
I forwarded you the email,

871
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:52.400
but inside the email there's a link to the film that the roots of fight guys

872
00:52:52.401 --> 00:52:53.000
have done.

873
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.810
They've done a quite a few of these documentaries on a bunch of different

874
00:52:56.811 --> 00:52:59.510
martial artists.
So this one that they're doing on you,

875
00:52:59.511 --> 00:53:00.470
they're real excited about,

876
00:53:00.471 --> 00:53:04.850
especially considering today is the big 50th anniversary that Milo savage fight.

877
00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:08.820
<v 3>That's a law a lot of years.
Uh,
in fact,
uh,</v>

878
00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:13.770
John McCarthy was wearing one of those t shirts.
Uh,
and I said,
sure,

879
00:53:13.771 --> 00:53:18.180
this is great.
How do I,
uh,
by one?
And he says,
well,

880
00:53:18.181 --> 00:53:23.160
I'll fix it up and I must,
uh,
sounded stupid.
And to him,

881
00:53:23.161 --> 00:53:27.690
cause I didn't even know it was they were making him at the time.
Here it is.

882
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:29.460
Here's the,
this is the video itself.

883
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:36.290
<v 5>Jean overcame an enormous amount of racism throughout his career.</v>

884
00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:40.570
He was a real ground breaker and just so many ways.

885
00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:45.140
Judo gene is overload.
The guy can do it all.
He can do submissions,

886
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:48.940
you can do judo,
you can do MMA.
He's a real deal.

887
00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:54.370
I'm very lucky to have somebody like oncogene in my life to really be a guide

888
00:53:54.371 --> 00:53:58.870
and a mentor back in the forties and fifties before the term is cross training

889
00:53:58.871 --> 00:54:00.460
and mixed martial arts existed.

890
00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:04.610
Gene labelle was already doing it and this is a guy who at the age of seven and

891
00:54:04.611 --> 00:54:08.110
started training with Ed Strangling Lewis who's arguably the greatest catches

892
00:54:08.111 --> 00:54:09.820
catch can wrestler his generation.

893
00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:14.620
Then he moved on at the age of 11 to train in the main street boxing gym where

894
00:54:14.621 --> 00:54:17.920
some of the greatest boxers of all time trained and he even ended up sparring

895
00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:18.820
with sugar ray Robinson.

896
00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:25.650
<v 3>I was a young kid at main street gym and a sugar Ray Robinson came in with his</v>

897
00:54:26.141 --> 00:54:29.470
hair grease down and he looked beautiful.

898
00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:34.560
He had his initials on his convertible Cadillac and he got on the ring and his

899
00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:38.950
sparring partner in show out.
So,
uh,
how he's Diana says,

900
00:54:38.951 --> 00:54:43.570
anybody want to work out with the sugar man as is.
Yeah.
If he isn't afraid of me.

901
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:46.330
And other words when your head is this big,

902
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:51.130
no good boxes [inaudible] and the first round he hit me 300 times.

903
00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:54.370
He taught me a couple of things.

904
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:59.950
<v 5>Gene's decision to take up judo in addition to boxing and catch wrestling was a</v>

905
00:54:59.951 --> 00:55:01.870
tougher one to make them.
A lot of people realize

906
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:04.960
<v 6>he comes in this big white guy,
red hair,</v>

907
00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:07.960
obviously not Japanese and wants to learn their thing.

908
00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:10.410
And a lot of people just said go away.

909
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.170
<v 5>Gene went to train at a predominantly Japanese Dojo.</v>

910
00:55:13.171 --> 00:55:16.200
Some of the people who trained there had even been held in American internment

911
00:55:16.201 --> 00:55:18.360
camps.
Even the ones that let him work out,

912
00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:22.020
she's tried to beat the crap out of it,
but gene willingly went in there.

913
00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:26.250
He took a students role.
He got his black kick day after day after day,
and yes,

914
00:55:26.251 --> 00:55:30.450
endured discrimination in order to pick up the skills that he needed to call

915
00:55:30.451 --> 00:55:32.880
himself a judo guy in essentially a judo champion.

916
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:35.730
Not only did he win the national championship,

917
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:39.520
but then they also had a grand champion ship pulls with the winner all the way

918
00:55:39.521 --> 00:55:41.490
to patients and he won that too.

919
00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:44.490
This guy went against the grain at every single opportunity.

920
00:55:44.491 --> 00:55:45.930
He never took the easy road.

921
00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:49.800
That attitude translates directly into why he picked up the Milo savage

922
00:55:49.801 --> 00:55:50.634
challenge.

923
00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:57.410
There was a magazine called rogue magazine and it said judo bumps.

924
00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:02.920
Jim Beck offered a thousand dollars Danny [inaudible],

925
00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:07.770
he couldn't be fed.
Parker came to me with his magazine and he says,

926
00:56:07.771 --> 00:56:12.060
we want you to buy it as why me?
He says,
Jane,

927
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:16.230
everybody knows you the most sadistic bastard in the world.

928
00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:21.450
So he ended up in 1963 Salt Lake City,

929
00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.560
Utah.

930
00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:33.050
This is a time weight watchers were considered to be the 100% best all round

931
00:56:33.481 --> 00:56:35.700
fighters in the world,
but gene didn't care.

932
00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:39.540
He was willing to take his style and put it into the competitive arena with the

933
00:56:39.541 --> 00:56:43.830
whole world watching.
So when I'm going to fight instead of Jim Beck,

934
00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:45.150
they do in a ringer,

935
00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:50.600
Milo savage and Michael Savage was a rated rider,

936
00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:53.550
number five in the world at the time.

937
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:57.240
A guy who had a pedigree of putting people to sleep with 10 ounce gloves on and

938
00:56:57.241 --> 00:57:00.180
he's only wearing force.
My coach said,

939
00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:04.500
you're not going to fight this guy.
Did he ever hit you in the face?

940
00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:09.780
They'll come out the other side.
This is a 100% pro boxing crowd.

941
00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:11.910
People were talking a lot of shit and saying that like,
you know,

942
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.660
Gina fires from bombs and I got there,
they said no kicking.

943
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:17.940
It was strictly judo.

944
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:22.080
Gene wasn't supposed to punch me low and Bulow had to wear the jeans,
you know,

945
00:57:22.081 --> 00:57:25.490
top and stuff.
So your gene was at a real serious disadvantages.

946
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:29.640
He had to get a closer space without being able to throw his hands.

947
00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:34.740
So when we get in the ring,
he has a karate,
he builds the Greece.

948
00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.890
And I don't mean to put Vaseline,
it get,

949
00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:41.760
it wasn't a judo gear was a chronic givers was like a very thin material,

950
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:44.690
<v 3>but it was salt lake city.
You could do what you want,</v>

951
00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:50.390
you don't win.
It may have to have a plan.

952
00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:55.400
I didn't get close to him and when I got close a drop my left arm,

953
00:57:55.401 --> 00:57:56.360
so he'd throw a right,

954
00:57:56.990 --> 00:58:01.030
so when you throw away and it went underneath and hook them and clenched him.

955
00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:03.410
Jean threw him around a couple of times.

956
00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:08.920
I have some to get lucky and throw them in a judo throw and land on him and then

957
00:58:09.771 --> 00:58:14.771
I got behind him to choke him and he grabbed my thumb and started to bite it.

958
00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:18.980
I said,
Milo,
you bite my finger.

959
00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:22.770
I'm going to take your eye out his mouth.

960
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.150
<v 5>When gene finally came to grips on that top and got ahold of savages,
drove,</v>

961
00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:31.320
it was all over and I reached down and I choked him out.

962
00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:35.970
It was a boxing embrace it and I want to choke was and so Jean Chunk of out for

963
00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:39.030
awhile.
He did not get up.
One Minute,
two minutes,

964
00:58:39.031 --> 00:58:43.920
five minutes after he was choked out for my elbow was sitting down there and

965
00:58:43.921 --> 00:58:46.500
when I walked I accidentally stepped up.

966
00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:47.363
<v 3>Dynamo,</v>

967
00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.270
<v 5>good guy,
bad guy.</v>

968
00:58:51.271 --> 00:58:55.530
Dynamic flights at the crowd just became completely unhinged.

969
00:58:55.620 --> 00:59:00.620
People started throwing chairs and pillows and in Salt Lake City,

970
00:59:01.411 --> 00:59:05.490
that's the way of saying,
Oh you put on a great show.
We loved him.

971
00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:07.530
They didn't want to acknowledge the result.

972
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:12.670
You didn't want to acknowledge that an Asian martial art had overcome what is

973
00:59:12.811 --> 00:59:16.830
essentially an American martial art box and you take nothing away from Milo

974
00:59:16.831 --> 00:59:21.060
savage.
You'd knocked out quite a few of martial artists before he met,

975
00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:26.760
but the other marker water said he beach didn't grow up in boxing and uh,

976
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:28.213
I did.

977
00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:32.600
You can't really understate the importance of the savage versus labelle fight.

978
00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.440
That was the first time that somebody stepped up and said,
look,

979
00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:41.660
grappling styles can overcome boxing.
I know that UFC one was a watershed moment,

980
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:45.620
but gene labelle did that 30 years previously.

981
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:49.520
This guy really is a founding father of modern name mixed martial arts.

982
00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:54.790
That's the guy that stepped in and did MMA before there was ever MMA.

983
00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:59.480
He really stood up for us and showed everybody that carried you down,
guy.

984
00:59:59.481 --> 01:00:01.130
You really are someone to be back in Flint.

985
01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:06.160
I can't thank him enough for that because adoptions had fairly effected me so

986
01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:08.260
many years later and now as well.

987
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:14.270
<v 0>You're part of history,
sir.
That was amazing,
man.
You're part of the history.</v>

988
01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:16.910
That's fascinating.
I can't believe it.

989
01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:21.260
You know what,
what makes you so sadistic?

990
01:00:21.261 --> 01:00:25.970
You've always had that reputation for being you.
You enjoy like net cranks and

991
01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.210
<v 3>uh,
it's the,
uh,</v>

992
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:34.870
ed teachers I've had being a sadistic and uh,

993
01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:40.420
like
it doesn't matter how the game is played,

994
01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.070
it's the final score.

995
01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:47.200
And I think they say that with these sudden they should say,

996
01:00:47.201 --> 01:00:51.070
I'm nice.
I'm good looking.
I am a technician,

997
01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:55.510
not a [inaudible] bastard.
Ah,
that's terrible.

998
01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.520
But you say yourself,
well,
the,
you know,
because you know,

999
01:01:00.521 --> 01:01:04.150
you have to go to confession.
If you go to church and yes,

1000
01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:08.890
a dear God,
I have a sadistic bastard cure me,

1001
01:01:08.891 --> 01:01:13.720
cure me,
and they,
you know,
uh,
I'm sure the Lord will do it,

1002
01:01:13.721 --> 01:01:16.270
but it takes time.
And,
uh,

1003
01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.970
I don't know how much time I have left.

1004
01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:23.190
<v 0>When you were going to Japan and you were learning too though from the Japanese</v>

1005
01:01:23.191 --> 01:01:27.570
and you're experiencing all that anti American hate when you were learning
Judah,

1006
01:01:27.571 --> 01:01:28.404
what was that like?

1007
01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.250
<v 3>It's a challenge,
but to me there's,</v>

1008
01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:39.650
it's like a small dog,
a big dog,
a cocker Spaniel,

1009
01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:44.870
a great day.
And they're all dogs as people.

1010
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:49.370
If we're black,
white,
Chinese,
Hispanic,
we're all people,

1011
01:01:49.371 --> 01:01:53.660
we're all equal.
And uh,
so,
uh,

1012
01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:56.210
but when I worked with them,

1013
01:01:56.211 --> 01:02:01.211
it was like at the end of World War Two there a lot of the,

1014
01:02:01.701 --> 01:02:02.360
uh,

1015
01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:07.360
my teachers were in man's dinar at camp for a few years and they had

1016
01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:12.620
hostilities,
but don't take it out on me.
I,
you know,

1017
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:17.090
and I never paid attention to it.
She did the get over it after a while.

1018
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.680
Like they accept you after a while,
you sure.

1019
01:02:19.681 --> 01:02:23.710
When I got good enough to beat the hell out of them.
Uh,

1020
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:27.550
but meanwhile I was a cannon fodder.
I,
uh,

1021
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.340
they had me for lunch for a year or two.
And then I,
uh,

1022
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:34.770
I worked out seven days a week.

1023
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.740
I was only one that worked out six or eight hours a day.
Uh,
and,
uh,

1024
01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.920
go to different gyms this before and after you had met Karl Gotch,

1025
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:48.240
uh,
during,
during the same time,

1026
01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:52.590
but call a at Luther says different coaches.

1027
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:57.180
It's a whole new world in judo.
They didn't allow leg locks.

1028
01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:01.260
Okay.
And Carl was great at leg locks.

1029
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:04.390
Luther says was great at our inbox,

1030
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.370
arm locks and neck locks at back locks.

1031
01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:13.590
And Luther says,
was like a boxer.
Uh,

1032
01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:17.190
Karl gotch was like a slugger.
And you learn,

1033
01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:19.200
I can't learn everything.

1034
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:23.070
I take the things that work for me.

1035
01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.770
I eliminate the forms had,

1036
01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:30.330
I don't think people should eliminate the forums because a lot of people can't

1037
01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:35.840
compete because their body or they're not coordinated enough.

1038
01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:40.650
So they do the forums and they exercise to me.

1039
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:46.110
You're wasting your time if you don't spar.
You know.
That's why I say,

1040
01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:51.090
um,
if somebody got our judge or referee,

1041
01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:58.160
they should have the background of being in the ring or on the mat.

1042
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:01.530
Okay.

1043
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:04.470
<v 1>And learn it all and they have to have something.
Oh yeah.</v>

1044
01:04:04.471 --> 01:04:05.990
But he's so many times like I,

1045
01:04:05.991 --> 01:04:08.400
there was a recent fight I want to mention or reference name,

1046
01:04:08.401 --> 01:04:11.220
but there was a situation where a guy was setting up an arm triangle.

1047
01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:13.770
He had the head and arm choke.
He had it locked in.

1048
01:04:13.771 --> 01:04:17.100
He was pinning it down and he was moving to try to get out of half guard and

1049
01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.000
they were stood up and I started going crazy.
I'm like,
what are you doing?

1050
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.460
The guy got like three quarters of the way there to the arm triangle.

1051
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:26.910
He got to the toughest spot,
which is isolating that arm with your head trapping,

1052
01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.150
trapping the arm and head together and he's getting out of the half guard and

1053
01:04:30.151 --> 01:04:32.040
you're standing him up.
That means you don't know shit.

1054
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:35.010
Like you shouldn't be refereeing a fight if that's your,
your move.

1055
01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.430
<v 3>I could not agree with you more.</v>

1056
01:04:38.431 --> 01:04:43.431
And a lot of times I feel like jumping in the ring and when this guy had the

1057
01:04:44.731 --> 01:04:47.490
Hematoma,
I went to the head commissioner.
I said,

1058
01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:52.350
they just stopped the fight before there's a permanent injury.
And uh,

1059
01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:57.750
you know,
I have learned though,
keep your mouth shot.
Uh,

1060
01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.380
our,
uh,
people want to sue you.

1061
01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:03.240
They want to fire you.

1062
01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:08.730
Yet when you still say like you just said the guy he's doing a triangle,

1063
01:05:10.891 --> 01:05:15.030
he could have choked him.
Armbar them.
Uh,

1064
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:19.720
<v 1>yeah,
I get upset at too.
I get upset when they,
uh,</v>

1065
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:23.020
they make people stand up.
I think that's silly.
I think,

1066
01:05:23.021 --> 01:05:26.260
I know that people want it to be exciting,
but my opinion and this,

1067
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.850
I think this is very valid.

1068
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:33.150
There's parts of MMA that are not going to be as exciting as people want them to

1069
01:05:33.761 --> 01:05:37.750
be.
People love of a slug out,
you know,
chocolate Dell style fight.

1070
01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.240
They love a Stephan Bonner Forrest Griffin style fight.

1071
01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:44.470
But there's real validity to a guy being able to take you down and hold you in

1072
01:05:44.471 --> 01:05:48.220
position.
It's,
it should be up to you to get out from under there.

1073
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.660
And if you can't get out from under there,

1074
01:05:49.661 --> 01:05:53.050
I don't agree that a referee should be able to come over and stand you guys up

1075
01:05:53.051 --> 01:05:56.710
and artificially create this situation where you're striking now just because

1076
01:05:56.711 --> 01:06:00.730
the,
the guy,
the guy can get up,
he gets up.
If he can't get up,

1077
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:04.000
the guys on top wins.
I mean,
it's,
it's really simple.

1078
01:06:04.001 --> 01:06:07.390
If a guy can hold you down and punch you in the face,
even if it's boring,

1079
01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.420
he's still holding you down and punch you in the face.
That's realistic.

1080
01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.440
It's reality.

1081
01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:16.240
<v 3>Absolutely.
I mean,
I mean you're,</v>

1082
01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:20.580
the thing I admire about you and there's very few things,
uh,

1083
01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:24.490
but you've been there,
you've done that.
And you know,

1084
01:06:24.491 --> 01:06:28.510
if a guy's screwing up a judge or a referee,

1085
01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.000
and like he said,
he made him stand.

1086
01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:36.360
A lot of times the referee is compelled by the audience as Saturday.

1087
01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:43.180
He says his fighter or the people that are cheering through four,

1088
01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:47.560
they're there on the ground,
they can't get up and they'll,
they all get up,

1089
01:06:47.561 --> 01:06:51.190
stand up.
And the referee,
I've seen it a million times,

1090
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:55.960
will stand the guy up,
sending them both up and uh,

1091
01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.200
<v 1>no reason for it.
And it's the rules.
I mean,</v>

1092
01:06:59.201 --> 01:07:02.290
it's in the rules of the referee can do that and they do get encouraged to do

1093
01:07:02.291 --> 01:07:05.590
that by promoters and commissions and the like,
people want to see a stand.

1094
01:07:05.591 --> 01:07:08.140
They don't want to see a fight that gets really boring and you can make a fight

1095
01:07:08.141 --> 01:07:10.840
more exciting with a good referee.
But my point is,

1096
01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:16.080
mixed martial arts is supposed to be realistic outside of I gouges and groin

1097
01:07:16.661 --> 01:07:19.520
kicks.
What can we do to make it more realistic?
Well,

1098
01:07:19.521 --> 01:07:22.270
one thing we could do is don't have artificial standups.

1099
01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:23.650
If a guy like Ben Aspirin,

1100
01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:27.570
like Ben Aspirin is a guy who gets tossed around a lot lately and um,

1101
01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:30.460
I think there,
there's rumors that he's going to sign somewhere else,

1102
01:07:30.461 --> 01:07:32.710
but Bella toward let them go in the UFC didn't pick them up.

1103
01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.980
That's one of the best grapplers in the world.
He takes talented strikers,

1104
01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:40.420
takes them down at will and hammer fists him in the face as long as he wants to.

1105
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:43.030
And even though he has been stopping a lot of guys,

1106
01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:46.600
just the fact he's able to do that over and over and over and over and over.

1107
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:49.150
He's winning against high level competition too.

1108
01:07:49.151 --> 01:07:52.450
Dangerous strikers rag dolls and take some down,

1109
01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:55.900
gets on top of them leg rides,
them,
hammer fists,
him in the face.
Hey,

1110
01:07:55.901 --> 01:07:57.220
maybe he's not knocking anybody out,

1111
01:07:57.221 --> 01:08:00.670
but I don't see anybody stopping that either.
That's a realistic technique.

1112
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:02.210
<v 3>Well,
uh,
you know,</v>

1113
01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:07.211
I think the fans should learn a little bit more about Brazilian Jujitsu.

1114
01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:13.160
I how to get a iron bar,
a neck lock.

1115
01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.980
<v 1>Well,
even wrestling and control the way aspirin is</v>

1116
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.210
<v 0>able to control guys on the ground.
Not Impressive.
That's impressive technique.</v>

1117
01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:24.240
<v 3>No,
they'll get a crouching Nelson and they'll crank the guy like pitting his</v>

1118
01:08:24.241 --> 01:08:25.074
shoulders.

1119
01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:30.260
But I personally like I want to see somebody hurt or be in a position where they

1120
01:08:34.741 --> 01:08:39.741
have to give up and yell uncle where you get a guy in a back lock or an

1121
01:08:40.261 --> 01:08:44.550
abdominal stretch or a a heel hook or a knee bar.

1122
01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:45.960
I want to see that.

1123
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:51.480
I it cause that's action to be along with the,
you know,
the standing,

1124
01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:56.280
you see guys throw punches.
Uh,
but you see a lot of steady guys,

1125
01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:59.550
they run away the cause so they don't get hurt.

1126
01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:03.810
Did they come in and throw a few punches and kicks then back off again?

1127
01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:08.690
<v 0>What was it like for you to see the UFC erupt when 1993 when it first came</v>

1128
01:09:08.691 --> 01:09:11.330
around and it was like real primitive,
like much more,

1129
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:15.230
much closer to what you engaged in in 1963.

1130
01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:20.510
<v 3>Uh,
I loved it.
You know,
I'm a fan.
A lot of people say,
ah,</v>

1131
01:09:20.511 --> 01:09:24.100
it's just a fad.
It just a fad.
It's too late.
I say that anymore.

1132
01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:29.270
It out draws professional boxing and wrestling together.

1133
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.720
MMA does.
And uh,
uh,

1134
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:35.450
I owe that all to Dana White.

1135
01:09:35.830 --> 01:09:39.340
<v 0>No doubt him.
And the fatigue was,
well,
the big thing is,</v>

1136
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:42.720
the big thing about those guys is they're really fans and to,

1137
01:09:42.730 --> 01:09:47.110
to have people who are really fans of mixed martial arts being in charge of the

1138
01:09:47.111 --> 01:09:50.770
biggest mixed martial arts organization that's so important.
So key.

1139
01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:54.670
Those guys love fights.
They love him.
I mean,
I talk,
I've called Dana Up,

1140
01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.410
I'll call him up at one o'clock in the morning.

1141
01:09:56.411 --> 01:10:00.370
We'll talk about fights for three hours.
We just go on and on it.
What about this?

1142
01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.820
Oh man,
it's got,
I'm telling you,
man,
we'll just have these crazy fights about,

1143
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:07.240
and you got to remember he's coming off of this loss.
And you know,
those,

1144
01:10:07.241 --> 01:10:09.580
those conversations you don't have with someone who doesn't really love the

1145
01:10:09.581 --> 01:10:11.920
sport.
And it's one of the reasons why they're so good at promoting it.

1146
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:15.190
They fucking love it.
Well,
if they'd love it,
it makes,
uh,

1147
01:10:15.610 --> 01:10:19.510
makes me happy now.
Just not all the for the money.

1148
01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:23.800
How happy are you that the women's MMA is being dominated by a judo woman?

1149
01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:27.620
It isn't a judo woman,
just,

1150
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:31.630
<v 3>it's a person that I've loved forever,</v>

1151
01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:36.550
since she was a baby.
Wow.
Uh,
she couldn't speak until

1152
01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.500
she was six,
you know,

1153
01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:44.580
she had heard about the bear local courts around her neck and now she would as

1154
01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.860
stop.
And I think,

1155
01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:53.260
I think it's classic.
I love her as an individual,

1156
01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:57.040
love his mother as an individual.
And to me,

1157
01:10:57.041 --> 01:11:02.041
she's the best a woman that I've ever seen it mixed martial arts.

1158
01:11:02.890 --> 01:11:06.760
What about Cyborg?
Cyborg is very,
very,

1159
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:11.470
very good.
And probably the second best fighter in the world today.

1160
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:14.190
Uh,
next to she's fucking

1161
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:18.180
<v 0>dangerous.
Oh yeah,
she is.
But uh,</v>

1162
01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.540
she has weaknesses.
Oh,
they all do.
Everybody's human.

1163
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:26.370
Everybody has has weaknesses.
You Go,
the thing about Cyborg is,
in my opinion,

1164
01:11:26.371 --> 01:11:28.930
if you go back to the Gina Carano fight,
there's like Gina Carano.

1165
01:11:28.931 --> 01:11:32.820
I had moments where she was controlling her on the ground,
but,
and people say,
oh,

1166
01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:34.530
well,
you know,
Gina Carano controller on the ground,

1167
01:11:34.531 --> 01:11:37.110
but cyborgs Jujitsu game was a lot better than that.

1168
01:11:37.111 --> 01:11:40.860
Now cyborg is one like some serious tournament as a brown belt.
And she's,

1169
01:11:40.861 --> 01:11:43.530
I've seen videos of her grappling throwing men around.

1170
01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:48.830
She's scary and she is dangerous.
Very,
very good,
very good strike anything.

1171
01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:54.380
But she's a lot heavier that Rhonda and Rhonda does it need to go into,

1172
01:11:54.931 --> 01:11:56.480
uh,
uh,

1173
01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:01.230
the 105 she can make one 35 and this cheek can't,
I mean,

1174
01:12:01.231 --> 01:12:01.681
and you know,

1175
01:12:01.681 --> 01:12:05.640
the thought is the smart money would be that they'll probably going to have to

1176
01:12:05.641 --> 01:12:10.560
fight one day,
uh,
after they're both over the hill.
But by over the hill,

1177
01:12:10.561 --> 01:12:13.770
I mean,
I think once women's MMA starts getting the respect that it deserves.

1178
01:12:13.771 --> 01:12:15.180
And I think this first episode,

1179
01:12:15.181 --> 01:12:18.150
the first season rather when the ultimate fighter with women kind of proved that

1180
01:12:18.151 --> 01:12:22.440
because I think five fights on the main card or three out of five fights were

1181
01:12:22.441 --> 01:12:25.260
women.
You know,
they're,
they're having more fights with women.

1182
01:12:25.261 --> 01:12:28.010
Now it's becoming a,
a point where some UFC is,

1183
01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:31.500
have two women fights at a 10 or 11,
and it's pretty interesting.

1184
01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:36.430
And I think that as women's MMA grows,
there's going to be some,

1185
01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.810
we're going to need some new new blood and new challenges.
And New,

1186
01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:44.070
really scary individuals knew like clubber Lang's for women and she's the

1187
01:12:44.071 --> 01:12:49.050
clubber Lang for women.
You know,
Cyborg is,
she's the Mr t in the background,

1188
01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.390
you know,
put your food,
you know,
she's there,

1189
01:12:51.391 --> 01:12:56.270
the angry hungry fighter waiting to get in.
It's just dangerous striker.
I,

1190
01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.750
she's dangerous and a lot of the people that she went against,

1191
01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.110
she outclassed.
Yeah.
It was at a different class.
Yup.

1192
01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:09.330
She went in and gets a lot out of the people that weren't that good.
Well,

1193
01:13:09.331 --> 01:13:13.080
they're not that.
She's so strong for a woman.
She's so strong.

1194
01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:18.030
I've seen her lift up a certain people,
Ben,
uh,

1195
01:13:18.031 --> 01:13:22.710
that had a short arm scissors on him and she had physically,
she's strong,

1196
01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:25.860
ridiculously strong and she cuts wait to get to one 45.

1197
01:13:25.861 --> 01:13:30.420
So she's walking around one 60 whatever and,
and big as a house and,

1198
01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:34.680
and has hammers.
She,
she's a very dangerous striker.
Well,
the whole thing is,

1199
01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.270
it's nice to be a dangerous striker,
but the bottom line is,

1200
01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.180
is she going to make it easy money?
Right.
Well,

1201
01:13:42.181 --> 01:13:46.050
that's my point was that like if these guys were going to really keep building

1202
01:13:46.051 --> 01:13:46.920
the way they're building,

1203
01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:50.820
I feel like it's one of those inevitable fights like Marlos Koonin you know who

1204
01:13:50.821 --> 01:13:55.050
she is,
caught her in Invicta and Cyborg smashed her in the last fight.
It was,

1205
01:13:55.051 --> 01:13:58.500
it was really shocking.
I was like,
wow,
like this one,
she's getting better.

1206
01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.290
You know,
she's really physically strong and she's getting better.

1207
01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:03.210
I think one day they're going to have to see that.

1208
01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:07.830
But there's all a lot of talk too because cyborg tested positive for some male

1209
01:14:07.831 --> 01:14:09.450
hormones or what have you.

1210
01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.980
Some some sort of steroids and there's a lot of talk that

1211
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.290
<v 1>when you do something like that,
when you take some performance enhancing drugs,</v>

1212
01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:20.440
it's been recent studies on it that show that some of the effects are actually

1213
01:14:20.441 --> 01:14:24.670
permanent.
Some of the enhancing effects that they don't go away.

1214
01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:29.370
<v 3>Well,
I don't know that for sure if you say so.
I don't know either.</v>

1215
01:14:29.371 --> 01:14:33.330
I'm not just talking shit,
uncle gene.
I'm gonna be honest with you.
I always do.

1216
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:37.380
Uh,
it's to me,

1217
01:14:38.010 --> 01:14:42.660
I know the lion was ada used to play football and he died of,

1218
01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:47.420
you know,
uh,
steroids.
Well,
I don't know what he's got to have brain something in.

1219
01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.670
And the steroids evidently went to the brainy.

1220
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.420
I can talk to about work the movie with him.
And he said that,

1221
01:14:54.810 --> 01:14:59.810
how am I going to compete when this guy had crossed the lines on a juice yet?

1222
01:15:00.791 --> 01:15:04.590
Oh,
uh,
so to compete they have to do it,

1223
01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:09.270
but gosh darn you're putting your body on the line.

1224
01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.890
He was only 43 when he died.

1225
01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:11.890
<v 1>Um,</v>

1226
01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:16.300
there's a lot of people back then apparently also that we're taking human growth

1227
01:15:16.301 --> 01:15:19.280
hormone that was coming out of cadavers and uh,

1228
01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:21.690
they were catching diseases from that,
allegedly.

1229
01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:24.310
Did I just read that online or did someone tell me?

1230
01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:25.810
And they could have been totally full of shit.

1231
01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:28.600
Disregard that until you Google search.
It lays laser gentleman,

1232
01:15:28.601 --> 01:15:33.430
but he died fairly young.
43 years old is a very young time to die from a

1233
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.160
<v 3>brain cancer.
Yeah.</v>

1234
01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:39.620
He was enormous at one point in time to talk about was huge.
Yeah.

1235
01:15:40.730 --> 01:15:42.260
And very talented.

1236
01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:45.530
<v 1>My point was,
you can't bring up Cyborg and not be,</v>

1237
01:15:45.531 --> 01:15:47.540
she could because she's so physically strong.

1238
01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:51.590
He can't not mention the fact that she tested positive for something.
You know,

1239
01:15:51.591 --> 01:15:54.320
you can't because there's always,
it's always the allegation.

1240
01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:56.640
When you look at her,
you're seeing pictures of her,
you see,

1241
01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:59.570
pull up a picture of sight.
Was this,
this her grappling with Tito Ortiz?

1242
01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:02.540
How ridiculous.
I think this is the show,

1243
01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:07.140
<v 3>uh,
where uh,
she,
uh,
picks up up,</v>

1244
01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:11.670
uh,
that run.
Yeah.

1245
01:16:11.671 --> 01:16:14.220
They're working in the gym and uh,

1246
01:16:14.221 --> 01:16:18.900
he had her down and she physically picked up up.
She's hot,
strongest Shit,
man.

1247
01:16:19.290 --> 01:16:22.150
For a woman.
That's ridiculous.
I mean,
obviously their training,
I mean,

1248
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:24.780
Tito's helping her here.
Yeah.
But at Tito's,

1249
01:16:24.781 --> 01:16:29.340
a 200 plus 200 plus and a wicked grappler.
Yeah.

1250
01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:30.380
Good guy.

1251
01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:33.590
<v 1>But pull up a picture of her like Cyborg muscular.</v>

1252
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:35.690
He could see how ridiculous she's strong.

1253
01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:39.410
She was like back when she was beating Gina.
Carano.
Alright.
But I don't know.

1254
01:16:39.411 --> 01:16:41.420
You know,
I don't,
I don't know what,

1255
01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:46.230
how much is natural and how much of is it is enhanced chemically how much,

1256
01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:50.240
how much was,
but whatever it is,

1257
01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.740
the package has left is a pretty damn impressive.
She's scary for a woman.

1258
01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:56.520
I think she's one of the most dangerous women

1259
01:16:56.690 --> 01:16:59.150
<v 3>planet.
Oh,
uh,
you know,</v>

1260
01:16:59.151 --> 01:17:03.560
if she ever went against Rhonda and catch weights or whatever,

1261
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:06.770
it'd be the biggest,
uh,
show in the world,

1262
01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:09.440
<v 1>especially if Rhonda continues to keep winning the wishes winning,</v>

1263
01:17:09.441 --> 01:17:10.010
and she's got a tough

1264
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:12.350
<v 0>fight coming up against me.
Should take,
that's going to be interesting.</v>

1265
01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:14.630
It should take,
it is a very,
very good,

1266
01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.690
<v 3>good,
uh,
uh,
fighter.
Very talented.
In fact,</v>

1267
01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:23.720
I didn't know you probably got a Christmas card and part of it was a design

1268
01:17:23.771 --> 01:17:25.920
that,
uh,
uh,

1269
01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:28.930
don't let the enemy get behind Ya.

1270
01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.210
<v 0>You have all these crazy patches.</v>

1271
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:34.360
Every year I bake out like 20 of these at my house.
Oh yeah.

1272
01:17:34.361 --> 01:17:38.200
Don't let the enemy get behind,
you know,
bull.
And he's got a,
you got,

1273
01:17:38.201 --> 01:17:42.880
this wasn't here.
What does this one,
uh,

1274
01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:45.550
Rhonda,
the American beauty Roundhill wow.

1275
01:17:45.610 --> 01:17:49.210
Brian's going to t he's gonna tape that to his underwear from no.
And I said,
oh,

1276
01:17:49.211 --> 01:17:54.010
can I watch his underwear and shit or why?
I think this is your favorite tape.

1277
01:17:54.011 --> 01:17:57.850
Right.
A patch there.
If he could get a picture of it,

1278
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:59.920
when in doubt choked them out yet.
That's my favorite.

1279
01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.550
<v 3>And uh,
uh,
that's good.
But I tell Ya,</v>

1280
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:11.160
do you have one of these solid cold,
uh,

1281
01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:17.220
<v 0>cauliflower ears?
Solid gold,
cauliflower ears?
Well,
I call it solid gold.</v>

1282
01:18:17.221 --> 01:18:20.610
It's made of a brass,
uh,
Jay.

1283
01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.330
It's not magnetic cater,
but it's a cauliflower ear and a,

1284
01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:28.920
some a replica of your ear.
Yeah.
And he has a lovely four.

1285
01:18:28.921 --> 01:18:33.760
I had a them operated on.
It almost can be work as it work.
As an earring.
Huh?

1286
01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:38.190
Would be a pretty ironic if you were a cauliflower ear as an earring on like

1287
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:43.170
each side
you had yours operated on.
Well,
what I did not

1288
01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:47.430
<v 3>beauty,
uh,
cause have just a natural good looking guy.</v>

1289
01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:52.680
Um,
I had allergies and,
uh,
the doctor says,

1290
01:18:52.681 --> 01:18:57.060
well,
I'll take the cartridge out of your ear and put it in your nose so you can

1291
01:18:57.061 --> 01:18:57.894
breathe.

1292
01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:02.580
And that was about 20 years ago and I haven't been able to breathe since.

1293
01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:03.700
Yeah.

1294
01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:05.390
<v 0>The deviated septum operations.</v>

1295
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:10.290
<v 3>Well,
hey,
it's a,
he said it was the turbinates.
Yeah.</v>

1296
01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:14.780
And uh,
evidently it wasn't,
it wasn't,

1297
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:18.090
uh,
another words the operation did.

1298
01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:21.680
<v 0>That's a common thing with those nose operations.</v>

1299
01:19:21.681 --> 01:19:24.670
If you don't go to the right doctor or,
and you know,
if it doesn't work out well,

1300
01:19:25.090 --> 01:19:29.450
I made a mistake.
I went to,
uh,
always for all your fans,

1301
01:19:29.451 --> 01:19:34.451
I'd say get a second and third opinion and the operation is the last thing you,

1302
01:19:35.421 --> 01:19:39.920
uh,
uh,
consider.
Yeah,
well,
there's a lot of people that have gone through,
um,

1303
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:43.850
the wrong doctors or,
or it didn't work with them for whatever reason.

1304
01:19:43.851 --> 01:19:47.000
But for me it was a life changer,
boy.
And getting,
getting my nose opened up.

1305
01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:51.710
I think most boys,
by the time you reach a certain amount of,
uh,

1306
01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.250
age 25 years old,
you've been hitting the nose.
It kanga times.

1307
01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.770
And a lot of times when you've been hitting the nose,
there's probably been some,

1308
01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:01.250
some bleeding inside there and you get sort of the same effect that you get in

1309
01:20:01.251 --> 01:20:04.250
your ears with cauliflower ears.
He can get that in your nose,

1310
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.440
swollen tissue and cranked up.
And that's why a lot of fighters,

1311
01:20:07.441 --> 01:20:10.140
they talk with a very nasally till like may hand Miller.

1312
01:20:10.141 --> 01:20:13.020
I was always telling him to get his nose fixed cause he had like this,
you know,

1313
01:20:13.021 --> 01:20:14.620
he would talk to you and you could hear the,

1314
01:20:14.630 --> 01:20:16.500
the fact that his nose was clogged up.

1315
01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:20.310
A lot of fighters have that vendor lay had to get his,
uh,
his nose operated on.

1316
01:20:20.311 --> 01:20:24.790
They took a piece of his rib cartilage and they use that to,
yeah,

1317
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:28.440
these deck to construct a new nose and he got a big one this time,

1318
01:20:28.441 --> 01:20:31.770
like nice and full.
So I couldn't really breathe out of it.
Oh,
that's good.

1319
01:20:31.771 --> 01:20:36.600
If he can.
Uh,
I've had a few and those operations in the,

1320
01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:40.640
with top doctors supposedly,
and they said nothing we could do about it.
Wow.

1321
01:20:40.690 --> 01:20:42.480
That's when doctor messed it up.

1322
01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:47.790
Understand what the cauliflower ear,
it bleeds into the side.

1323
01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:50.880
And if you don't drain it within a day or two,

1324
01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:55.340
it hardens up and turns into cartilage.
Is that,
is it Cartlidge?

1325
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:59.400
Is that what it is now?
You can feel both.
Certain parts of my here,

1326
01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:03.780
it's a hard as a rock.
It's a white weird shit that grows and salad.
It's,

1327
01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:07.440
it's in.
If you fell right here,

1328
01:21:07.441 --> 01:21:10.680
the inside of my ear,
um,

1329
01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.470
it's hard.
I mean,
you can use squeeze it.
It's just hard.

1330
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.960
You're Randy couture used to stick ton of people's heads.

1331
01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.270
Like when he would take them down,
you know,
he has his,

1332
01:21:21.271 --> 01:21:24.810
it looks like he has a mouse living in his ear and he would take guys down and

1333
01:21:24.811 --> 01:21:28.830
get that ear on their face,
grind them down with it if it,

1334
01:21:28.831 --> 01:21:33.420
if it had hurt him and hurt him.
No,
it was a,
it was like a rock on his head.

1335
01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:38.760
He had a rock thrown out of his head.
Well,
he has big ears.
Yeah.
But,

1336
01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:42.850
uh,
in the old pro wrestlers they'd ever dread there.
That was,
uh,

1337
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:48.210
an honor to have a cauliflower ear badge of courage.
I always wore a head gear,

1338
01:21:48.211 --> 01:21:51.210
like a pussy that see you're smart.

1339
01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:56.820
I like hearing things.
I liked my ears work in the way they're supposed to work.

1340
01:21:56.850 --> 01:21:59.640
And I've talked to a lot of guys that have like serious cauliflower ear and

1341
01:21:59.641 --> 01:22:02.040
they've been pretty adamant about it.
Like you're hearing changes,

1342
01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:06.420
like you don't hear it like,
like while eat Ishmael,
his,
you've seen his,

1343
01:22:06.570 --> 01:22:08.610
they're like literally cauliflower.

1344
01:22:08.611 --> 01:22:11.690
Like he's got cauliflower grown out of his head.
Oh Man.

1345
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:15.750
And your whole so tiny now too,
you know.
Uh,

1346
01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:19.590
actually when I had on the one side,

1347
01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:24.860
the year was a little too swollen and when I laid down on the bed and a hard

1348
01:22:25.801 --> 01:22:28.500
service without the pillow,
I could feel it.

1349
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:32.970
It sorta was very uncomfortable.
But,
uh,

1350
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:36.360
now I don't know the difference.

1351
01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:39.770
What a weird side effects of grappling the cauliflower ear.
Yeah.

1352
01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:43.230
But at least w we were talking about earlier about damage.

1353
01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:46.080
At least a grappling damage is pretty obvious.

1354
01:22:46.081 --> 01:22:49.560
Like your knees start going or your back is bothering you,
you got issues,

1355
01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:50.700
you kind of know what it is.

1356
01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.360
The real issue with MMA that is that the hidden issue is the,

1357
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:59.340
the impact,
the strikes,
taking shots and how dangerous it is.

1358
01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:02.460
And I'm really glad that you're,
uh,
adamant about that.

1359
01:23:02.461 --> 01:23:05.650
I'm really glad that you make a big deal about that cause he'd been around
there,

1360
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:06.040
you've

1361
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:10.810
<v 1>been around the fight game for a long time.
You know what's important and uh,</v>

1362
01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.900
you,
you speak out about it and I think that's really important.

1363
01:23:14.410 --> 01:23:19.330
<v 3>The only initial investment Joe you have in life is your body.</v>

1364
01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:24.790
If you don't take care of it,
nobody else will.
I mean,

1365
01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:29.440
if something's wrong with you,
I can't say,
hey,
something's wrong with you.

1366
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:35.360
I know if something's wrong with me,
I'll go to a doctor.
Uh,

1367
01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:39.400
he's a witch doctor,
but I'm not prejudice.
You understand,

1368
01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:42.070
you go to a doctor and uh,

1369
01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:47.580
he takes a care of you and then you know it.

1370
01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:52.930
Don't let it linger.
If you have a bad knee,
stay off it.

1371
01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:54.490
Rest is the best

1372
01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:55.510
<v 1>or get it fixed.</v>

1373
01:23:55.690 --> 01:23:59.020
Especially guys who try to fight without ACLC and they just don't want to go

1374
01:23:59.021 --> 01:24:01.660
through the Rehab.
Like get it fixed,
man.
You got to get it fixed.

1375
01:24:01.661 --> 01:24:04.810
Cause you'll chew the inside of your knee up while you're a while.
You're,

1376
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:06.550
you know,
we're trying to rehab it.

1377
01:24:06.551 --> 01:24:08.590
And if thinking eventually going to get surgery,

1378
01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:11.140
you're going to do irreversible damage to the inside of your knee.

1379
01:24:11.141 --> 01:24:12.010
If it's unstable.

1380
01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:15.730
<v 3>Ah,
well you gotta get a,
he,</v>

1381
01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:20.940
he old and a lot of people just don't want to get it healed.

1382
01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:26.480
My wife used to kick me in the butt for years and now she's got a bad knee.

1383
01:24:26.690 --> 01:24:30.800
I says,
go get a cortisone shot.
May God be bites,
judge.

1384
01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:35.150
I can't talk her into it.
She will not get a cortisone shot.
I says,
well,

1385
01:24:35.151 --> 01:24:39.710
you got to have the whole need cut off.
All not got to do it.
So,
uh,

1386
01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.260
another words,
I'm teasing naturally,

1387
01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:46.790
but a while she does have bad wheels,

1388
01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:51.560
uh,
you know,
uh,

1389
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:54.290
but it didn't really come from kicking you in the ass.
Well,

1390
01:24:54.710 --> 01:24:59.300
she missed a couple of times because I used to go down the stairs pretty fast,

1391
01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:03.910
you know?
But uh,
you gotta take care of it.

1392
01:25:03.911 --> 01:25:06.170
They only initial and ventured and you have in life.

1393
01:25:06.171 --> 01:25:09.410
I repeat this over and over at your body.
Take care of it.
You,

1394
01:25:09.650 --> 01:25:12.320
I love the fact that you say,
get that fixed.

1395
01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.590
<v 1>Get it fixed.
They can do it now.
They can fix a lot of things.
Yeah.</v>

1396
01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:18.550
There's a lot of surgeries they can do.
If you can afford it,
get effects.

1397
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:22.070
If you can't afford it,
don't fight.
Get it fixed before your fight.
Don't.
I know,

1398
01:25:22.071 --> 01:25:25.520
I know a bunch of guys who fought without ACLC and I'm like,
you're crazy.

1399
01:25:25.521 --> 01:25:27.800
They just tried to teach her knee up and go out there.
I'm like,

1400
01:25:27.801 --> 01:25:29.160
you're going to be unstable.
And it's,

1401
01:25:29.170 --> 01:25:33.410
it's a scary enough proposition to fight anyway to fight that compromise where

1402
01:25:33.411 --> 01:25:36.020
you can't move.
You can't move you up that leg.
Well,

1403
01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:37.370
it's going to give out and buckle on you.

1404
01:25:37.371 --> 01:25:41.860
That's one of your most important assets.
Your ability.
Yes.
It's got to get worse.

1405
01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:44.780
The ability to decide where you're going to be in a fight.

1406
01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:48.350
The ability to decide whether you're gonna be moving in or moving outside aside.

1407
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:51.860
That's very important.
If you can't do that,
you can't defend yourself properly.

1408
01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:56.450
And guys like they get real short sighted when it comes to,
oh,
I need the money.

1409
01:25:56.451 --> 01:25:58.760
Like you also need all your chips.

1410
01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.240
You're going to give away a lot of chips if you get knocked out because you've

1411
01:26:01.241 --> 01:26:04.620
got a bad wheel that's get it fixed.
Yeah.

1412
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:07.490
Get everything fixed.
What do you think about,

1413
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:11.900
this is the thing that we have to deal with today that didn't exist back in your

1414
01:26:11.901 --> 01:26:15.830
day,
but testosterone replacement therapy for athletes.
You know,

1415
01:26:15.831 --> 01:26:17.460
you're seeing a lot of that where they're,

1416
01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:22.470
they're talking about testosterone replacement for men who are in their

1417
01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.211
thirties,
twenties even.
I mean,

1418
01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:27.650
guys in their twenties have applied for it before and it's a very strange thing.

1419
01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:27.871
You're,

1420
01:26:27.871 --> 01:26:31.550
you're seeing all these young men that have testosterone issues and they're

1421
01:26:31.551 --> 01:26:34.760
getting this artificial testosterone injected into their body,

1422
01:26:34.761 --> 01:26:39.230
which a lot of people feel like it's an unfair advantage.
Uh,

1423
01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.340
<v 3>it depends what you use it for,</v>

1424
01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:45.480
for competition or just a walk around better.

1425
01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:49.210
<v 1>I have no problem with him.
In fact,
I use it myself.</v>

1426
01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:51.640
I use testosterone myself to walk around better,

1427
01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:54.670
but I'm not competing against anybody.
I just,
I go to a doctor,

1428
01:26:54.671 --> 01:26:58.390
I get my test levels measured and I keep them on the low side of like a healthy

1429
01:26:58.391 --> 01:27:02.560
male.
But I'm not competing.
And I think when,
when you're fighting,

1430
01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:07.000
I think either no one should be able to do it or everyone should be able to do

1431
01:27:07.001 --> 01:27:07.390
it.

1432
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:12.390
I think it gets real squirrely when you start like giving young men the ability

1433
01:27:13.031 --> 01:27:17.560
to add testosterone to their system allegedly because they had some sort of a

1434
01:27:17.561 --> 01:27:21.370
medical condition.
If you really did have a medical condition.
Okay.

1435
01:27:21.371 --> 01:27:24.340
I feel for you and I understand your desire to compete and it would certainly

1436
01:27:24.341 --> 01:27:27.280
help you if you had an artificial testosterone or you know,
uh,

1437
01:27:27.281 --> 01:27:30.430
x whatever exogenous put into your system.

1438
01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.790
But if your guy is abusing the system,
it seems easy to do.

1439
01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:37.300
All you would have to do is take a bunch of testosterone and then get off it.

1440
01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:40.000
Your levels are crash.
Then you go in and get tested,

1441
01:27:40.150 --> 01:27:42.700
they test your levels being low and then the lady said,
well,

1442
01:27:42.701 --> 01:27:44.110
I need some testosterone.

1443
01:27:44.230 --> 01:27:48.250
And then you get on it and now you have a ridiculous amount of recovery ability

1444
01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:49.860
because you're,
you have the hyper,

1445
01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:53.740
hyper natural levels of testosterone in your system and you're regulating it

1446
01:27:53.741 --> 01:27:57.640
yourself with injections as opposed to nature regulating it by making sure that

1447
01:27:57.641 --> 01:27:59.170
you're healthy with nutrients and what have you.

1448
01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:01.640
<v 3>When you say a injection,</v>

1449
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.140
injecting it yourself under doctor's supervision,
are you?

1450
01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:06.621
<v 1>No,</v>

1451
01:28:06.621 --> 01:28:10.760
they injected themselves where you were put cream on cream is the most common.

1452
01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:14.840
You take a testosterone cream and you rub it on yourself.
That's the most common.

1453
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:17.330
Or the,
you know,
there's a gel.
There's cream is actually,

1454
01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.620
they make a spray now you can,
uh,
Lyposomal you can put drops under your,

1455
01:28:21.621 --> 01:28:23.480
under your tongue and it gives you a testosterone.

1456
01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:27.800
The end of the problem with those is they get abused because guys do them and

1457
01:28:27.801 --> 01:28:31.130
then they cycle that you,
it only lasts,
like with,
with the oral ones,

1458
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:34.270
it's only stays in your system for about 24 hours.
So you're,

1459
01:28:34.370 --> 01:28:38.030
your levels will spike,
but then if you get tested 26,
27 hours later,

1460
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:39.960
it's not even in your system anymore.
You're,

1461
01:28:39.961 --> 01:28:42.980
your has already gotten rid of it and you're back down to a normal level.

1462
01:28:43.130 --> 01:28:45.320
Whereas that whole 24 hour period before that,

1463
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:49.610
your body's recovering at a very rapid pace and it gets out of your system in

1464
01:28:49.611 --> 01:28:52.640
and out very quickly.
You're supposed to take it every 24 hours,

1465
01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.420
but if you don't take it for a day or two,
you'll test like you,
you're a normal,

1466
01:28:56.421 --> 01:28:59.360
healthy person,
then you get out of there and then you take a bunch more.

1467
01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:02.700
So it gets real weird cause guys can,

1468
01:29:02.701 --> 01:29:06.240
if they know when they're going to get tested,
then they can kind of plan it.

1469
01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:11.160
<v 3>Well,
if you have 24 hours to get rid of it yet.
Oh yeah.</v>

1470
01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.250
And,
uh,
I,
uh,

1471
01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:18.780
I don't care that much if it helps you out,
go for it.

1472
01:29:18.810 --> 01:29:22.260
A go car.
One of the schools I teach at,

1473
01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:23.880
uh,

1474
01:29:24.330 --> 01:29:29.330
he went down to Mexico to get these shots and his leg and everybody laughed

1475
01:29:29.401 --> 01:29:33.600
about it,
but it was really bad and it cured it.

1476
01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:38.280
W what did he ever wrong with his leg?
The knee.
I'll get an injury.

1477
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:41.190
And so what were the shots that he got?
You know,

1478
01:29:42.850 --> 01:29:45.670
<v 1>it was like stem cells or something like that.
One of those things I've heard,</v>

1479
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:47.890
I've heard people doing that before in other countries,

1480
01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:51.400
but boss route and actually just got back from something like that.
His neck.

1481
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:56.080
Yeah,
he's had some serious issues.
I sent him to the guy,
um,
who's,
uh,

1482
01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:59.740
doing Regena keen,
that blood spinning stuff they're doing in Germany.

1483
01:29:59.741 --> 01:30:02.200
There was a guy who was doing that in Santa Monica that I actually had done on

1484
01:30:02.201 --> 01:30:03.460
my neck and it was amazing.

1485
01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:07.090
I sent boss down there to see if that could help him as well.

1486
01:30:07.690 --> 01:30:09.160
<v 3>Well,
how long ago did you send it?</v>

1487
01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:10.890
<v 1>Well,
he,
I don't know if he's gone there yet,</v>

1488
01:30:10.891 --> 01:30:14.430
but I know he was just gotten back from whatever he had done in another country

1489
01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:17.670
and he was saying it did miracles.
Like he's saying he's training again.

1490
01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:21.600
He feels great.
Like his body's starting to rebuild itself,
like whatever it did,

1491
01:30:21.601 --> 01:30:25.560
like you said,
pretty quick after the procedure,
he started feeling fantastic.

1492
01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:30.690
<v 3>I love Bossy is amazing guy.
Yeah,
he's a little sick,</v>

1493
01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:34.140
but he's bike kind of people,
you know?
Don't,

1494
01:30:34.141 --> 01:30:38.190
you kind of have to be able to just talk a little bit sick to be really good.
Uh,

1495
01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:43.140
different is a better word.
It's different.
Dignified.
Yes.
There we go.
Uh,

1496
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:48.180
you name a champion in any sport and

1497
01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:52.020
you get to know him and that they're a little different.

1498
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.110
They're driven in a different special boy.
Yeah,

1499
01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:59.760
<v 1>yeah.
In anything basketball,
track and field,
whatever it is.</v>

1500
01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:01.320
If there's somebody at the top of the heap,

1501
01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:04.820
<v 3>that guy's got a quirk.
That guy's got to be a little bit weird.</v>

1502
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:08.720
He's going to be a little bit different.
Uh,
according to your standards,

1503
01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:11.750
like there's a basketball player.
I had met one time,

1504
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.220
he's nothing but jelly beans.
He eats nothing but jelly beans.

1505
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:20.950
Well that's part of his diet of jelly beans.
And uh,

1506
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:23.720
I seem to live with it,
but

1507
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:26.920
<v 1>well,
you know that strong man,
God has been fighting in MMA now.</v>

1508
01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:29.590
Would it put Yanoski do you know who he is?

1509
01:31:30.130 --> 01:31:34.330
He was a winner of a strong man competition.
It was like huge,
enormous guy.
Well,

1510
01:31:34.331 --> 01:31:37.970
he started fighting,
MMA fought Tim Silvia got beat up,
but uh,
he's,

1511
01:31:37.971 --> 01:31:41.260
he's beat some guys too.
He,
so he's a big strong guy,
very dangerous,

1512
01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:45.400
eats a lot of candy.
It's candy all day.
And he said,
uh,

1513
01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.610
well I think what he's saying is that his lift,

1514
01:31:48.611 --> 01:31:50.120
he does so much lifting and his lifting,

1515
01:31:50.121 --> 01:31:53.350
it was so intense that he needs sugar all the time.

1516
01:31:53.351 --> 01:31:55.420
And he was getting a sugar in the form of candy bars.

1517
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:58.450
And a lot of people are like,
wow,
that's crazy.
Like that sounds so stupid.

1518
01:31:58.451 --> 01:31:59.990
But look,
the bottom line is

1519
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:04.480
<v 3>the guys world,
strong man champion,
obviously he knows what he's doing.
Uh,
yeah,</v>

1520
01:32:04.481 --> 01:32:06.280
but how long is he going to live?

1521
01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:10.210
I worked at a show with Arnold Schwarzenegger,

1522
01:32:10.211 --> 01:32:14.410
and there's a guy in there at jeep Swenson.
He was,
uh,
uh,

1523
01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:19.270
he chewed up every half hour,
and I know that name,
cheap Swenson.
He,

1524
01:32:19.271 --> 01:32:22.120
uh,
played,
uh,

1525
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:25.330
in one of the Arnold shows.

1526
01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:30.331
He pulls me through a wall and a is strong man,

1527
01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:35.130
but a nicest,
sweetest guy.
But he had a,

1528
01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:39.430
he had 26 in charms.
Nobody has 26 inch arms,

1529
01:32:39.730 --> 01:32:44.730
and they were ripped and he had so many things in the future and it went to his

1530
01:32:45.101 --> 01:32:48.040
heart and he killed them at as a,
as a young man.

1531
01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:52.660
He said he was taking it every half an hour,
every half hour.
He said,
excuse me,

1532
01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:57.430
but not a,
you know,
he just go in and give myself a shot.

1533
01:32:57.490 --> 01:33:00.310
So he was just completely off the rails.
Yeah.

1534
01:33:00.311 --> 01:33:05.311
But who knows what is practical and what is over the,

1535
01:33:05.631 --> 01:33:06.464
is that him?

1536
01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:07.933
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1537
01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:13.290
<v 3>Yeah.
Wow.
Could be,
that's a large man.</v>

1538
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:15.960
Well,
you can't tell.
She's not on.

1539
01:33:18.630 --> 01:33:20.040
How old was he when he passed?

1540
01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:28.950
How old was he when he died?
Does it say?
I don't know.

1541
01:33:29.010 --> 01:33:33.630
Jesus Christ.
Look at the size of that dude now God like that is very strong,

1542
01:33:33.631 --> 01:33:36.830
but you know it's short lived,

1543
01:33:36.930 --> 01:33:40.710
can only work for about 30 seconds and then it's got too much muscle to feed.
Uh,

1544
01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:45.570
they're trying to teach a guy that was the world's strongest man name Anderson.

1545
01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:50.400
He remains 40 for me many years ago and he had a,
he,

1546
01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:54.420
they wanted to make,
I'm a pro wrestler.
After 30 seconds,

1547
01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:58.860
he's out of gas and he trained for a different

1548
01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:04.920
quick boom boom.
They're just trying to get big and,
and strong.

1549
01:34:04.921 --> 01:34:09.150
But I train for the wind,

1550
01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:14.520
wind cardio.
If a car is out of gas,
it don't run.

1551
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:18.420
Nhler Christopher Cross song.
I like to win.
Yeah,

1552
01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:21.420
that's important.
That's a call.
God's thing as well.

1553
01:34:21.421 --> 01:34:25.260
Like he was a big stickler on,
on a conditioning type.

1554
01:34:25.261 --> 01:34:29.040
Hundred die body weight squats a,
is that true?

1555
01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:31.650
Did you have to do there before every training session?

1556
01:34:32.970 --> 01:34:34.410
That was the warmup.

1557
01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:37.650
500 body weight squats for folks who don't know how crazy that is.

1558
01:34:38.010 --> 01:34:42.240
That's so God damn hard to do.
And talk about about,
uh,
an hour or two with just,

1559
01:34:42.241 --> 01:34:44.550
uh,
just bodyweight warming up.

1560
01:34:44.730 --> 01:34:47.670
Show a lot of stretching exercises too.

1561
01:34:48.210 --> 01:34:51.390
I mean a lot of stretching exercises.

1562
01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:55.870
Well he was very aware of what benefit of the body.
He's a very,
very,
uh,

1563
01:34:56.130 --> 01:34:58.070
very well schooled

1564
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:02.150
<v 1>guy when it came to like techniques of training and one of the reasons why I</v>

1565
01:35:02.151 --> 01:35:04.490
endorsed things like the Mace Ball,
you know,

1566
01:35:04.570 --> 01:35:09.020
that he understood that doing difficult movements like kettlebells who's a big

1567
01:35:09.021 --> 01:35:13.640
proponent of kettlebells and along those lines that those full body movements

1568
01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:16.220
are the ones that translate directly to grappling,

1569
01:35:16.730 --> 01:35:21.140
<v 3>uh,
at other sports too.
Yeah.
Uh,</v>

1570
01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:22.640
I know when I was doing the,

1571
01:35:22.670 --> 01:35:27.670
all those kettlebells stuff and unbelievable how strong I was picking up things.

1572
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:34.130
If I grabbed the guy's wrist,
I had him,
you know,

1573
01:35:34.670 --> 01:35:36.980
and uh,
they don't seem to do that anymore.

1574
01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:38.970
<v 1>Well,
those are making a comeback.</v>

1575
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.060
Those things are actually becoming a really pretty popular lately.

1576
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:46.500
Kettle bells of,
um,
made a big comeback over the last like 10,
15 years.

1577
01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:48.330
And a lot of people are training with them.

1578
01:35:48.450 --> 01:35:52.380
Like there was always these photos of a fade or in Russia has a bunch of kettle

1579
01:35:52.381 --> 01:35:53.214
bells around him.

1580
01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:56.340
But although that I heard at towards the end of fate or his career that he

1581
01:35:56.341 --> 01:36:00.000
really didn't do much strength and conditioning,
he just did only fight training.

1582
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:04.540
<v 3>Uh,
I'll put it this way.
He was getting,</v>

1583
01:36:05.530 --> 01:36:09.490
he was one of the best of all types.
I can't take it no doubt.

1584
01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:14.870
But he fought too long.
You think so?
Oh,
of course.
The last few fights card,
what?

1585
01:36:14.871 --> 01:36:17.950
It flew by Dan Henderson and yeah.
Yeah.

1586
01:36:17.951 --> 01:36:21.620
I made it his last two or three fights.
What happened to him?

1587
01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:26.450
<v 1>Perdome beat him.
I mean he fought a few times in Russia on his own and did well.</v>

1588
01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:30.890
You know,
he fought,
knocked out Pedro,
his own,
um,
fought hustler hustley fight.

1589
01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:33.650
Did he fight Jeff Monson over there as well?

1590
01:36:33.651 --> 01:36:38.090
I believe he did and he fought quite a few times,
you know,
but yeah,

1591
01:36:38.091 --> 01:36:41.270
I think he was certainly,
he was out the door.

1592
01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:44.720
He mean you can only keep up that level.
The level that he hadn't pride,

1593
01:36:44.721 --> 01:36:48.620
like when he's beating Minataro and when he beat Zulu and all those guys,

1594
01:36:48.621 --> 01:36:51.710
like he was incredible.
I mean,
it was,
he was so good.

1595
01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:56.970
<v 3>He was good on the ground as could everywhere.
Sambo is hit.</v>

1596
01:36:57.390 --> 01:37:01.830
Yeah.
From a left field.
He swung from left field.
I says,
God,

1597
01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:05.470
I good boxes should be able to Bob and weave and get out of that way.

1598
01:37:05.530 --> 01:37:08.440
He's so dangerous.
Oh yeah.
Unbelievable

1599
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:11.470
<v 1>fight.
I mean,
he basically,
I'll kickbox cro cop,</v>

1600
01:37:11.550 --> 01:37:14.600
but he definitely took him down and beat him up on the ground a bit.
But the,

1601
01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:18.910
the majority of that fight was spent on the feet with him walking down,
Cro,
cop.

1602
01:37:19.190 --> 01:37:20.540
<v 3>Uh,
that's it.</v>

1603
01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:25.940
But when you're just over the hill,
and correct me if I'm wrong,

1604
01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:27.950
uh,

1605
01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:33.100
you still have enough ability to beat the average guy and you get your

1606
01:37:33.591 --> 01:37:36.200
confidence back by beating a Jib boney.

1607
01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:39.570
Then you go to the top guy and you've got to [inaudible]

1608
01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:44.620
<v 1>it hurt.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
you're,
you're absolutely correct.
And,
you know,
as you said,</v>

1609
01:37:44.890 --> 01:37:48.840
there's a time to get out,
you know,
and uh,
I mean I'm glad he's,

1610
01:37:48.970 --> 01:37:52.600
he decided to stay retired.
Um,
I'm glad you know,
he had a few fights pop man.

1611
01:37:52.601 --> 01:37:55.980
I would've loved to seen him in the UFC when he was his prime and

1612
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:59.380
<v 0>they were making an offer to have him versus Brock Lesnar.
Ooh.</v>

1613
01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.480
That would have been crazy.

1614
01:38:00.481 --> 01:38:02.670
That would have been maybe one of the greatest fights of all time are the

1615
01:38:02.671 --> 01:38:04.350
biggest fight rather of all time.

1616
01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:09.560
A Brock Lesnar that great a grappa he had the best.

1617
01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:10.950
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1618
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:15.930
<v 0>Tackles take downs.
That's all he had.
Uh,</v>

1619
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.591
that bad.

1620
01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:21.591
Anything he could take anybody down and he'd be a great football player,

1621
01:38:21.730 --> 01:38:24.270
a Lineman,
defensive lineman.

1622
01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:26.210
<v 5>But in</v>

1623
01:38:27.650 --> 01:38:29.700
<v 0>Brock he had a lot of publicity.</v>

1624
01:38:30.690 --> 01:38:31.130
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1625
01:38:31.130 --> 01:38:35.870
<v 0>If he's stuck around a little bit more and he had sicknesses and finishing</v>

1626
01:38:35.871 --> 01:38:36.704
holes,

1627
01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:38.470
<v 5>he'd be a</v>

1628
01:38:39.330 --> 01:38:43.410
<v 0>champion for a long time,
I believe.
I think so too.
I think,
well,
first of all,</v>

1629
01:38:43.411 --> 01:38:45.330
the stomach issue,
so a big one.

1630
01:38:45.331 --> 01:38:49.680
I mean they removed 12 inches of his colon and then you know,
he fought,

1631
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:51.600
I think it was like a year later.

1632
01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:54.570
It wasn't very much longer than a year if it was,

1633
01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:57.120
and that's just a long,

1634
01:38:57.170 --> 01:39:01.260
that's a long time to be off the game and not a long time.

1635
01:39:01.290 --> 01:39:03.240
When you have an injury like that to heal up,

1636
01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.420
when you're getting kicked and need in the body by a guy like Alistair Overeem,

1637
01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:08.730
I mean that just seems like a terrible idea.

1638
01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:12.630
And I think that if you are going to do a guy like that correctly,

1639
01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:15.590
like if you were the engineer of a Brock Lesnar,
you go,
okay,

1640
01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:19.050
here I have a thoroughbred.
I mean this is a stud.

1641
01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:21.750
You have a giant athlete who can walk on his hands.

1642
01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:24.870
He's an Ncaa Division one heavyweight champion wrestler APP.

1643
01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:28.080
Well we need to do here is do this the right way and they should have brought

1644
01:39:28.081 --> 01:39:31.530
him along slow.
They should have brought them to smaller organizations,

1645
01:39:31.710 --> 01:39:35.570
worked on his kickboxing,
had him in there with guys that he could beat and,

1646
01:39:35.571 --> 01:39:37.890
and build the hype up.
It kept,
but he was,

1647
01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:42.480
he jumped into the deepest end of the deep pool quicker than anybody ever second

1648
01:39:42.570 --> 01:39:46.590
MMA fight ever.
He's fighting frank fucking mirror in Vegas.

1649
01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:49.620
It wasn't a Vegas,
I think it was in Vegas and gets leg locked.

1650
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:54.830
I mean that's a big leap to go one MMA fight in next MMA fight your fight and

1651
01:39:55.021 --> 01:39:59.470
Frank Mir.
That's craziness.
Yeah.
Well it did.
Did he beat him?

1652
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:01.760
Beat him the second time.
Second time,

1653
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:05.160
smashed him the second time was frightening.
When you saw a massive improvement.

1654
01:40:05.161 --> 01:40:08.250
He got up in a Lake Lac right away.
Yes.

1655
01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:10.830
He got him in the leg lock pretty quickly in the five but a lot of the reasons

1656
01:40:10.831 --> 01:40:15.210
why it got him in the leg lock is because the referee told him he was hitting in

1657
01:40:15.211 --> 01:40:17.100
the bay.
I think it was hitting in the back of the head.

1658
01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:21.870
They did something where they stopped the exchange and then they restarted the

1659
01:40:21.871 --> 01:40:26.871
exchange where he was hammering on Frank Mir and then they broke it up and then

1660
01:40:27.961 --> 01:40:31.280
they re engaged it and mirror to is to crafty.

1661
01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:33.540
It was too crafty on the ground back then and then caught him.
I mean,

1662
01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.040
I'm not sure if I'm absolutely correct about that.
I think I am,
but I'm,

1663
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:39.480
I could be incorrect,
but I know that,
uh,

1664
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:43.230
that the referee stopped it way too late.
He got caught in that knee.

1665
01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:47.070
Bonnie tapped and tapped again and they tapped again and the referee finally got

1666
01:40:47.071 --> 01:40:49.260
in there.
And it's that kind of shit that we were talking about.

1667
01:40:49.261 --> 01:40:51.600
Like the referee has to be danced to protect a guy.

1668
01:40:51.810 --> 01:40:54.100
And when he see a guy getting tapped out

1669
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:58.240
<v 1>with a leg lock,
the moment he does this,
the next one,
it might be too late.</v>

1670
01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:00.880
Like you gotta be right there on that first one happens,

1671
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:05.680
snap those ligaments it out.
Yeah.
I mean,
you've seen it.

1672
01:41:05.681 --> 01:41:07.870
How many times?
1,000.
1 million.

1673
01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.240
How many guys have you seen get their knees exploded,

1674
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:13.630
<v 3>uh,
more than,
uh,</v>

1675
01:41:14.590 --> 01:41:18.500
you would expect I,
for years and years,
uh,

1676
01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:21.150
needlessly,
Ya know,
right.

1677
01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:25.130
Needlessly and guys kept back into the gym too soon.

1678
01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:30.530
And,
uh,
Eh,
you know,
you gotta take care of the,

1679
01:41:30.531 --> 01:41:34.790
uh,
your body.
That's everything.
And people pass it off,

1680
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:39.920
you know,
so with,
uh,
a guy like Karl Gotch,

1681
01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:44.330
I never saw him get hurt.
Guys that hit him or something.

1682
01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:48.110
It's like hitting the,
the table.

1683
01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:50.270
But he paid the price to when he got older.
I mean,

1684
01:41:50.271 --> 01:41:54.740
didn't he have a hip replacement?
So I believe he did that from that,
you know,

1685
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:59.240
over a period of years and not relaxing and resting.

1686
01:41:59.241 --> 01:42:03.450
If you're injured,
you're a you a cat.

1687
01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:06.480
He fees that he,
uh,

1688
01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:11.920
later on in his life I talked to him and his wife passed away and that,

1689
01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:14.600
I think that made him go down hill.

1690
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:19.730
And the only thing he had in his life,
he said,
what's a good cigar?

1691
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:25.390
And a cat from the neighborhood used to come over every day at night at five

1692
01:42:26.271 --> 01:42:30.330
o'clock,
he'd feed the cat and then he'd take off and he said,
he,

1693
01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:34.910
the cat never learned to say thank you.
You know,
uh,

1694
01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:37.530
that was his main source of company towards the end.

1695
01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:41.120
And he got a lot of invites to be with,
uh,

1696
01:42:41.810 --> 01:42:46.520
the wrestlers and he didn't want to be,
he says,

1697
01:42:46.521 --> 01:42:50.300
look up my body now.
I'm not there anymore,

1698
01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:54.530
you know.
And so he didn't want even be around it.
No,

1699
01:42:54.531 --> 01:42:56.060
he didn't want to be around it.

1700
01:42:56.061 --> 01:43:01.061
And it would make me cry to think there is a god and you know,

1701
01:43:05.121 --> 01:43:08.450
he should be put on a pedestal.
A man like that.

1702
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:13.370
Cause he taught a lot of guys.
Uh,
he went to Japan and taught soccer.

1703
01:43:13.371 --> 01:43:17.540
Robert Ryan.
Yeah.
A lot of those guys are,
they became good shooters.

1704
01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:21.520
<v 1>Yeah.
A lot of guys learned a lot of techniques at the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu guys</v>

1705
01:43:21.521 --> 01:43:24.970
weren't aware of as well.
Did a lot of sneaky shit that guys didn't see coming.

1706
01:43:24.971 --> 01:43:26.410
And it was a lot of it was Karl gotch.

1707
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:29.320
<v 3>Yeah.
A lot of it.
A lot of it.
Yeah.</v>

1708
01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:31.170
<v 1>Karl gotch.
Yeah.</v>

1709
01:43:31.171 --> 01:43:35.120
I'd love the fact that there's different schools of attack when it comes to,
uh,

1710
01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:38.490
to martial arts submissions especially,
I mean in the striking as well.

1711
01:43:38.491 --> 01:43:41.790
But I love that there's the judo attacks and then there's the Jujitsu attacks.

1712
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.150
The catch wrestling attacks and as far as like,
you know,
stand up.

1713
01:43:45.151 --> 01:43:48.570
Like I love the fact that you get a guy like Leo Machida who has a totally

1714
01:43:48.571 --> 01:43:49.111
different attack.

1715
01:43:49.111 --> 01:43:53.400
He's using a karate style attack or so many fighters are opting for a more,

1716
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:56.070
more Moitai centered.
No.

1717
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:58.540
<v 3>Well,
what I think of mode tie vote,</v>

1718
01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:03.100
I think of elbows and knees and a little bit different stance.

1719
01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:05.650
Learn it all,
learn it all.
Add,

1720
01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:08.860
learn what is effective for you.

1721
01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:14.640
I learn knees and elbows because the old wrestlers they used to like grab her

1722
01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:17.230
around the head,

1723
01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:21.220
jerk it down right into the d into it.

1724
01:44:21.221 --> 01:44:26.221
You have there goes your opponent's teeth or is those or very much into the

1725
01:44:28.181 --> 01:44:31.210
solar factors.
Once you hit it in the solar plexus,

1726
01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:33.670
the guy's down and out.
So

1727
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.250
<v 1>do it and make it seem like they were just grappling,</v>

1728
01:44:36.251 --> 01:44:38.320
but they're really slamming you into their knee.

1729
01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:43.050
<v 3>Oh yeah.
They uh,
uh,
they busted the stirred them.</v>

1730
01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:45.230
Uh,
you know,

1731
01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:50.780
I think it's a great move.
It might not be as spectacular,

1732
01:44:50.781 --> 01:44:55.781
but anytime you hear bones scratch and the guy's willing on the ground in pain,

1733
01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:03.210
it's sort of a,
it's nice.
It's a sexual thing for me.

1734
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:11.330
<v 1>You a fan of the Schultz brothers guys had that very aggressive wrestling style</v>

1735
01:45:11.331 --> 01:45:12.000
as well.

1736
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.190
<v 3>Yeah,
but one of them's dead down.
Yeah.</v>

1737
01:45:14.290 --> 01:45:17.420
<v 1>Unfortunately,
I think,
I believe they're making a movie about that.
Are they?
Yeah,</v>

1738
01:45:17.421 --> 01:45:21.340
I believe they are.
So the dupont guy was some freak who used to

1739
01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:26.430
<v 3>Russell,
uh,
with the,
uh,
what do you call it?</v>

1740
01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:29.720
The war machine.
Uh,

1741
01:45:30.170 --> 01:45:33.560
try to run everybody over with his tank.

1742
01:45:33.710 --> 01:45:38.060
<v 1>Yeah.
He was apparently completely crazy,
but he liked to,
uh,
he liked to Russell</v>

1743
01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:42.020
<v 3>and he had money and a Lotta history,
uh,</v>

1744
01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:46.100
with different people.
Like I say,
everybody or you say,

1745
01:45:46.101 --> 01:45:50.960
I say everybody has their own quirks or personality.

1746
01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:53.330
<v 1>Brian pull up,
um,</v>

1747
01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:58.740
pull up Mark Schultz disqualification and you could watch him use a double wrist

1748
01:46:00.251 --> 01:46:05.040
lock.
He actually used the Camorra to take this guy down and a,

1749
01:46:05.050 --> 01:46:09.700
it was in the 1984 Olympics and he hit the Camorra and just yanked the guy's arm

1750
01:46:09.701 --> 01:46:14.560
part.
Just smashed him.
You shouldn't have said that.
I just wet my pants.

1751
01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:19.870
Oh God.
It's a beautiful move.
And Schultz at the time,

1752
01:46:19.871 --> 01:46:23.290
Schultz did a little bit of competing in MMA as well and the early days the UFC.

1753
01:46:23.291 --> 01:46:26.650
But I think what happened was they threatened him to a,

1754
01:46:26.651 --> 01:46:30.340
that we're going to remove him as a wrestling coach if he continued.

1755
01:46:30.341 --> 01:46:33.930
This was during the dark ages of the UFC.
He fought Gary Goodrich and Gary Good.

1756
01:46:33.931 --> 01:46:37.330
Richard was still wearing a Geeky,
so that tells you like how long ago this was.

1757
01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:41.230
And Schultes just dominated them just with pure wrestling.
He was an animal

1758
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:47.170
not wearing any pants either.
I say,
ah,
that's mark.
I'm warming up.

1759
01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:51.960
He's getting ready.
If you to um,
you could see the,
the,

1760
01:46:51.970 --> 01:46:55.860
the hold at one 15 go to a one 15.

1761
01:46:55.861 --> 01:46:58.980
They show how he was a disqualified.

1762
01:46:59.190 --> 01:47:02.160
He gets a hold of this dude in the double wrist lock position.

1763
01:47:02.610 --> 01:47:04.890
And this is like a classic in MMA now.

1764
01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:09.920
Lucky hits this and he's got the leg in between and just smashes his arm apart.

1765
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:15.060
I mean that is absolute perfect technique in MMA.
But a,

1766
01:47:15.061 --> 01:47:19.560
in wrestling they weren't having it.
Look at the,
the technique here,

1767
01:47:20.370 --> 01:47:23.970
Emmy drops down perfectly.
It just mangles that dude's arm.

1768
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.210
I mean it was a beautiful way to take a guy down.
It's a beautiful technique

1769
01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:31.370
<v 3>but illegal and that sport.
Yeah.
Well the pro,</v>

1770
01:47:31.371 --> 01:47:36.020
the good shooters,
uh,
that's what they do.

1771
01:47:36.050 --> 01:47:39.230
That's a standard technique,
right?
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

1772
01:47:39.890 --> 01:47:41.270
I think it's great.

1773
01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:45.400
<v 1>Yeah.
It's interesting when you go,
when you look at the old catch wrestling,</v>

1774
01:47:45.401 --> 01:47:47.050
like farmer Burns' books,

1775
01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:50.350
which shows all the different positions that he was practicing and you see like

1776
01:47:50.351 --> 01:47:53.710
a lot of those are being used in MMA today.
The lockdown,
the half guard,

1777
01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:58.390
that was old school catch wrestling technique,
you know,
even saw triangles.

1778
01:47:58.391 --> 01:47:59.830
I didn't know that they had triangles.

1779
01:47:59.890 --> 01:48:03.310
<v 3>Oh yeah.
At triangle chokes.
Absolutely.</v>

1780
01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:06.710
<v 1>But they were sort of more refined by the Brazilian Jujitsu guys,</v>

1781
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:09.240
<v 3>right?
Yeah.
The A,
you can't knock that.</v>

1782
01:48:09.241 --> 01:48:14.100
They approved down it because there wasn't that many people that were really

1783
01:48:14.101 --> 01:48:14.934
experts.

1784
01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:18.760
<v 1>Is it real exciting for you now to see all these people today?</v>

1785
01:48:18.761 --> 01:48:21.660
Like d so many grappling tournaments.
Grapplers quest,

1786
01:48:21.661 --> 01:48:25.090
Naga regional championships,
Brazilian Jujitsu and submission,

1787
01:48:25.091 --> 01:48:28.040
wrestling championships all over the place.
It's amazing,
isn't it?
Yeah,

1788
01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:32.440
<v 3>it's,
it's,
it's amazing.
Uh,</v>

1789
01:48:33.190 --> 01:48:38.110
what is amazing to me how these people now wrestling's back in the Olympics.

1790
01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:40.900
Yeah.
Thank,
thank whoever.
Zeus,

1791
01:48:42.730 --> 01:48:46.180
I got a kick out of the Russians.
It says,
what are the crazy?

1792
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:50.260
Then he used a couple of your vocabulary and he says,

1793
01:48:50.261 --> 01:48:55.261
those people don't realize that's the oldest sport in the world is Greco Roman

1794
01:48:56.021 --> 01:48:56.854
wrestling.

1795
01:48:57.170 --> 01:49:02.060
<v 1>It's also one of the sports.
It's the most character building sport known to man.</v>

1796
01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:05.510
It's one of the most difficult sports at the highest level to compete at.

1797
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:09.320
You can't get by just on talent.
You have to work hard.
There's no way around it.

1798
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:10.670
No one rides for free.

1799
01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:13.400
And the guys who work harder are going to be the guys that got you out.

1800
01:49:13.401 --> 01:49:14.830
And when you,
they're going to beat you,

1801
01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:16.580
they're gonna figure out a way around your,
your,

1802
01:49:16.581 --> 01:49:19.010
your defense and they're going to push you just a little bit harder than you

1803
01:49:19.011 --> 01:49:21.380
want to be pushed and they're going to get you down,
they're going to beat you.

1804
01:49:21.381 --> 01:49:25.490
And that's the difference between champions and run her ups and that sport.

1805
01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:28.790
It's work,
work and will,
and it's a,

1806
01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:32.050
it's a like a hugely important part of the,

1807
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:35.340
the character of young men that go through that.
It,

1808
01:49:35.341 --> 01:49:37.220
it shows them what they're capable of,

1809
01:49:37.221 --> 01:49:40.730
shows them that they can overcome some seemingly insurmountable barriers.

1810
01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:46.500
<v 3>Absolutely.
Absolutely.
It's,
um,
again,</v>

1811
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:48.100
back to what you call the

1812
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:52.180
<v 0>cupbearer,
which is a double wrist lock,
uh,</v>

1813
01:49:52.330 --> 01:49:56.800
when it show's over with,
have I ever showed Ya how Carl got you?
Did it,

1814
01:49:57.690 --> 01:50:00.040
what was the variation in the car got stuck?
Yeah.

1815
01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:02.950
You'd be planning on putting me into submission once you show me on Brian,

1816
01:50:03.250 --> 01:50:06.730
you could tap him.
I will.
You'll be glad I've heard.
I've heard nevertheless,

1817
01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:10.840
allow you to put someone into a position.
Oh No,
no.
Nice to have a guy like Brian.

1818
01:50:11.950 --> 01:50:16.240
Brian,
you're so gummy,
you won't even get hurt.
He said it's a sexual thing,

1819
01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:17.693
but not for you.

1820
01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:20.980
<v 3>Yeah,
believe me,
you won't even get a wet.</v>

1821
01:50:23.230 --> 01:50:24.063
You know it

1822
01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:29.460
<v 0>like they do the cupbearer there and they grabbed the risks.</v>

1823
01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:31.920
Are you going to let them do it too?
Oh,
you're crazy.
Okay.

1824
01:50:31.921 --> 01:50:35.010
What does he have to do?
Oh,
I don't believe bullet.
Please be nice to him.

1825
01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:37.470
He's very delicate.
Don't hurt him.

1826
01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:42.210
Okay.
The Camorra like that.
Yeah.

1827
01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:47.180
<v 5>We're not going to do this hard.
This is what you do to put the pain on.</v>

1828
01:50:48.150 --> 01:50:52.080
Okay.
Now here's the difference.
I grower here.

1829
01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:53.513
Now tell me what it is.

1830
01:50:53.700 --> 01:50:56.460
<v 0>Oh,
you're doing a wrist lock as well.
Oh,
I see.</v>

1831
01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:59.350
<v 3>Wow.
The tap too</v>

1832
01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:05.540
outrageous.

1833
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:08.880
<v 0>So you're,
what you're doing is you're attacking the wrist as well.</v>

1834
01:51:08.881 --> 01:51:09.580
Is that what it is?

1835
01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:13.680
<v 5>See here I turn it and instead of going like this,</v>

1836
01:51:13.710 --> 01:51:14.760
it's just straight up.

1837
01:51:15.190 --> 01:51:17.760
<v 0>Oh,
I see.
Okay,
so you just,</v>

1838
01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:21.760
you have his hand twisted around and he's got no strength to get out of that.

1839
01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:25.540
That way your hands all twisted up like that.
Very hard to get any strength.

1840
01:51:25.541 --> 01:51:26.374
Right.

1841
01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:29.210
<v 5>I won't do it.
He's going to do it.
Shit.</v>

1842
01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:35.050
He could put his hand between my legs and roll me back,

1843
01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:38.330
but see that way you get the,

1844
01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:42.070
<v 0>don't let him see you doing that.
It's going to hurt you</v>

1845
01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:45.780
<v 5>here.
I'm not going to do it.</v>

1846
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:49.430
<v 3>Okay.
He's going to do it.
Go</v>

1847
01:51:49.690 --> 01:51:54.090
<v 5>going like this.
You know,
you're just go up.</v>

1848
01:51:54.250 --> 01:51:56.410
<v 0>Is it harder to hold onto it that way?
It seems like,</v>

1849
01:51:57.430 --> 01:52:01.970
especially with a sweaty hand might be a little difficult,
but good family may,

1850
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:04.780
right?
If you could get your thumb inside the glove and they don't catch you

1851
01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:08.880
<v 5>on the glove.
It depends how big your hand is.</v>

1852
01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:12.690
Karl gotch had a big hand and very small woman hands.

1853
01:52:12.990 --> 01:52:16.200
<v 0>Yeah.
Brian is a very small woman.
Hands.
You can let go of him.
Gene,</v>

1854
01:52:16.201 --> 01:52:19.350
you're making me uncomfortable.
I feel like you're gonna hurt my little buddy.

1855
01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:25.860
<v 3>Get out of there.
Brian,
quick.
You just wrestling with a crocodile.</v>

1856
01:52:25.861 --> 01:52:30.780
You fuck awesome.
Did it felt scary?
Do it tight?
No,
no,

1857
01:52:30.781 --> 01:52:34.890
no.
That was that.
No,
I could see where you could just,
no reason to be a bully.

1858
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:37.890
And that's what makes you feel good.

1859
01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:42.920
<v 0>Jean.
Um,
when you,
uh,
when you look at the state,
grab that microphone,
sir.</v>

1860
01:52:43.250 --> 01:52:46.250
Pull that towards you if you would hear.

1861
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:48.410
<v 3>Oh yeah.
That thing.</v>

1862
01:52:49.770 --> 01:52:53.190
<v 1>Round pear shape tolerance.
When you look at a MMA today,</v>

1863
01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:55.770
what do you see like the biggest area for growth?
What do you see?

1864
01:52:55.771 --> 01:52:57.600
Like when you see like the technique of fighters,

1865
01:52:57.690 --> 01:52:59.260
what's one thing that you would like to see guys

1866
01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:00.193
<v 3>improve on?</v>

1867
01:53:02.690 --> 01:53:06.560
What would I like to see him do?
Get more variety,

1868
01:53:07.570 --> 01:53:09.190
<v 1>more versatile and they're attacking me.</v>

1869
01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:12.570
<v 3>Uh,
there's some,
uh,</v>

1870
01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:17.600
things that are not used that I think are good finishing holds a,

1871
01:53:18.481 --> 01:53:23.481
they don't catapult off the turn buckle or the cage.

1872
01:53:26.730 --> 01:53:27.190
They don't

1873
01:53:27.190 --> 01:53:29.860
<v 1>pulled off the kids.
Like Anthony Pettis does like that kind of stuff.</v>

1874
01:53:30.110 --> 01:53:33.230
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean you're,
you're there.
Lean back,</v>

1875
01:53:33.231 --> 01:53:37.150
shoved the guy out and he comes back.
Then he's away.

1876
01:53:37.190 --> 01:53:41.810
You can do something.
Uh,
the cage doesn't have nearly as much give as ropes,

1877
01:53:41.811 --> 01:53:45.830
right.
Ropes out.
It's a little easier to do,
right?
Yeah,
it's easy.

1878
01:53:45.831 --> 01:53:49.310
You can kind of manipulate it a little and push guys by Moitai guys are great at

1879
01:53:49.311 --> 01:53:52.820
that.
The trips push guys off the rope and,
and trip them as they're doing it.

1880
01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:57.020
Yeah,
but in mood tie if the trip,
um,
it doesn't count.

1881
01:53:57.380 --> 01:54:02.380
I mean you could throw a person down and mood tie and they just say a stand,

1882
01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:06.380
<v 1>well actually in real moy time when they fight in Thailand and actually counts</v>

1883
01:54:06.381 --> 01:54:11.240
for a lot.
I mean the stuff they have in America,
like k one you mean?

1884
01:54:11.241 --> 01:54:12.290
Yeah.
Yeah.

1885
01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:15.890
Well that's one of the biggest arguments against k one is that they don't use

1886
01:54:15.891 --> 01:54:19.580
the full range of techniques and glory as well,
which I'm a big fan of.

1887
01:54:19.581 --> 01:54:23.650
I love that high level k one style kickboxing and I loved the tournament style

1888
01:54:23.651 --> 01:54:28.250
like Gloria is doing,
but really I'm a real boy.
Ty has elbows as well,

1889
01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:30.380
like standing elbows and I love it.

1890
01:54:30.410 --> 01:54:33.800
I think those elbows are very important and the ability to grab the back of the

1891
01:54:33.801 --> 01:54:35.450
head very important.
And when they,

1892
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:38.780
when they cut that out and say you can only grab the back of the head for like a

1893
01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:40.550
couple of seconds,
you taken away a lot of the fight.

1894
01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:44.180
That's a lot of the fight is that the pummeling and the trips and in,

1895
01:54:44.181 --> 01:54:47.150
in Muay Thai,
in Thailand,
those,
that's big.
That's very important.

1896
01:54:47.151 --> 01:54:50.060
The grappling is very important that being able to control the infighting and

1897
01:54:50.061 --> 01:54:53.630
the throwing each other down,
they'll slams mean something in,
in Thailand and

1898
01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:55.670
<v 3>yeah.
Well everywhere you go,</v>

1899
01:54:56.780 --> 01:55:01.500
they have different rules for the same sport in the Olympic,
uh,
uh,

1900
01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:06.500
knocked down is like a good hook or a jab.
It's the same thing.

1901
01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:07.820
Yeah.
It's crazy isn't it?

1902
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:11.630
And a guy could get knocked down three times and win the bout yet.
Oh yeah.

1903
01:55:11.690 --> 01:55:15.200
It's ridiculous.
They count how many times you touch a guy in the face.
Well,

1904
01:55:15.201 --> 01:55:16.970
it'd be better if,
uh,

1905
01:55:16.971 --> 01:55:21.520
they had international rules that were same.
Same.
Well,

1906
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:25.100
I think they've kind of changed the,
the style of Olympic boxing judging now,

1907
01:55:25.101 --> 01:55:29.090
right?
It's not,
it's not that that's straight forward just touching a guy.

1908
01:55:29.091 --> 01:55:31.670
I think they do count for damage.
Now I might be wrong though,

1909
01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:35.460
but it certainly varies between that and the way they judge professional boxer.

1910
01:55:35.570 --> 01:55:39.020
Well I only pay attention to that once every four years.

1911
01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:44.010
Professional boxing or the things I used to with guys that

1912
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:46.680
<v 0>were going to the Olympics and I think uh,</v>

1913
01:55:46.681 --> 01:55:50.460
the United States had better competitors then.

1914
01:55:50.461 --> 01:55:53.930
I don't think it's a challenge.
They should have MMA in the Olympics.
I believe.

1915
01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:58.530
I believe MMA is very pure and very popular sport.

1916
01:55:58.531 --> 01:55:59.670
And if it was in the Olympics,

1917
01:55:59.671 --> 01:56:02.460
boy I think there would be a lot of attention on it.

1918
01:56:02.461 --> 01:56:04.290
And I see these be some incredible fights.

1919
01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:09.000
The only thing that I liked better than MMA is synchronized swimming in the

1920
01:56:09.001 --> 01:56:13.350
Olympics.
Well it's more aggressive.
Uh,
you know,

1921
01:56:13.410 --> 01:56:15.900
you're fighting through water all the time.
Yeah,
that's true.

1922
01:56:15.901 --> 01:56:16.920
But the movement is a fight.

1923
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:20.520
If they have sports like that and I don't knock them,

1924
01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:25.800
why wouldn't they have that man may it says popular.
Yeah.
I think they think,

1925
01:56:25.801 --> 01:56:26.101
you know,

1926
01:56:26.101 --> 01:56:29.490
maybe at this point in time it just hasn't been accepted enough in the public.

1927
01:56:29.670 --> 01:56:31.590
I mean if they were thinking about taking wrestling out,

1928
01:56:31.591 --> 01:56:35.640
just showing that look how clueless that ideas and it's just ridiculous.

1929
01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:38.970
Well,
it depends what you're looking at.

1930
01:56:38.971 --> 01:56:41.970
When I look at the sports in the Olympics,

1931
01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:44.610
they don't show everything that I want to say.

1932
01:56:44.611 --> 01:56:48.480
They do show a lot of swimming and track and field,

1933
01:56:49.230 --> 01:56:53.280
which is good.
Two of my favorite things,
but uh,

1934
01:56:53.310 --> 01:56:56.480
the judo is very,
very sparse coverage.
Yeah.

1935
01:56:56.481 --> 01:57:00.420
Add boxing very sparse.
Yeah,
you're right.
And Taekwondo,
same thing.

1936
01:57:00.421 --> 01:57:04.410
Very hard to find a taekwondo match when the Olympics on television,

1937
01:57:04.830 --> 01:57:06.540
unless you're in Korea,
I'm sure South Korea,

1938
01:57:06.541 --> 01:57:10.530
they probably covered the shit out of taekwondo,
but I'm in America,

1939
01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:12.000
I think.
Um,

1940
01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:17.340
I think what you're seeing also is a lack of boxing talent from the United

1941
01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:19.860
States in a weird way that we haven't seen in a long time.

1942
01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:21.780
You're not seeing nearly as many gold medalists.

1943
01:57:21.781 --> 01:57:24.360
He remembered the days of like mark Breely and Meldrick Taylor,

1944
01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:27.210
those got pronounced Whitaker and they're all gold medal,
gold medal,
gold medal.

1945
01:57:27.210 --> 01:57:31.310
They were just dominating the Olympics.
Tyrrell bigs dominating the Olympics.
Yes.

1946
01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:34.620
And you don't really see that as much from the American boxers.

1947
01:57:34.621 --> 01:57:39.210
It's kind of unfortunate,
you know,
I think boxing is gone down the drain.

1948
01:57:39.630 --> 01:57:43.370
Uh,
and I mean at the Olympic Auditorium,

1949
01:57:43.380 --> 01:57:46.530
which my family had for 38 years,

1950
01:57:47.610 --> 01:57:49.470
every week was a boxing show.

1951
01:57:49.471 --> 01:57:53.580
Then they were back seeing shows back east every week.

1952
01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:57.990
And now where the boxing show to,
uh,

1953
01:57:58.260 --> 01:57:59.640
you have a big boxing show,

1954
01:57:59.641 --> 01:58:04.470
it's two guys that fight once every two years to build up something.

1955
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:09.030
If they don't have all the heroes,
there's definitely less boxing.

1956
01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:11.130
But you know what,
at the highest levels of the game,

1957
01:58:11.131 --> 01:58:14.940
I think Floyd Mayweather is the best boxer that's ever lived as far as like pure

1958
01:58:14.941 --> 01:58:18.420
boxing talent.
I think the guys almost untouchable.
He said,

1959
01:58:18.630 --> 01:58:23.280
I think he's the most best defensive boxer and the best use of like the

1960
01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:27.450
controlling what happens inside the boxing ring.
It's incredible boxer.

1961
01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:33.270
Okay.
Let me ask you,
I knew he was okay.
I agree with you.

1962
01:58:34.030 --> 01:58:38.250
I love that Guy Biting Sugar Ray Robinson.
No,
no,
no.

1963
01:58:38.251 --> 01:58:42.050
The wave others there different kinds of

1964
01:58:42.050 --> 01:58:44.980
<v 3>the guys we're talking about money.</v>

1965
01:58:46.450 --> 01:58:51.220
How much does he make?
He makes them all set of anybody ever.
Okay.

1966
01:58:51.550 --> 01:58:54.580
How come the MMA guys aren't making that kind of money?

1967
01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:59.080
<v 1>Well,
he gets Munster paper view numbers.
The numbers that he gets on paper view,</v>

1968
01:58:59.110 --> 01:58:59.811
if they're coming to their,

1969
01:58:59.811 --> 01:59:03.340
first of all they're coming there to see Floyd Mayweather jr him period.

1970
01:59:03.790 --> 01:59:06.610
And the numbers of paper you,
he broke the world record.

1971
01:59:06.611 --> 01:59:09.610
He got like 2.2 million in his last fight and maybe even more.

1972
01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:13.450
Might have been 2.4 million when he fought Canelo Alvarez and just shout them

1973
01:59:13.451 --> 01:59:16.190
out.
It's his production money team productions,
you know,

1974
01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:19.960
he's in charge of everything.
He also,
I'm sure has to pay for everything.

1975
01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:20.860
I mean I'm sure there's,

1976
01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:24.430
he's got a lot of costs involved in promoting these fights and whoever he's

1977
01:59:24.431 --> 01:59:28.750
doing it with,
whether it's a Bob Arum are,
you know,
de la Jolla there.

1978
01:59:28.810 --> 01:59:29.920
Everyone's making a lot of money.

1979
01:59:29.921 --> 01:59:31.900
It's an insane amount of money you're getting from this guy.

1980
01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:37.140
The UFC is a different world and the guys who draw big on paper view,

1981
01:59:37.601 --> 01:59:38.390
they make a lot of money.

1982
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:41.860
And like George Saint Pierre makes a lot of money and I don't know what that

1983
01:59:41.861 --> 01:59:46.720
number is,
but I know he said it's between four and $5 million per fight.

1984
01:59:47.110 --> 01:59:51.000
He also has a lot of sponsors,
big names,
sponsors,
you know,
the,

1985
01:59:51.010 --> 01:59:53.320
the champions at the top level make a lot.

1986
01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:56.800
But the difference between how many paper views he gets,

1987
01:59:56.890 --> 01:59:59.950
like maybe 500 thousands,
a really good one for George Saint Pierre,

1988
02:00:00.010 --> 02:00:04.360
maybe more 600,000 Floyd gets 2.2 million.
I mean that's,

1989
02:00:04.361 --> 02:00:08.140
those are bananas numbers.
And he's the only guy that does that.
Him and Pacquiao,

1990
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:12.310
he's the big guy obviously because he's the best marketer.
He,

1991
02:00:12.311 --> 02:00:16.060
and he's marketed himself that everybody hates him.
I mean,
it's really a genius.

1992
02:00:16.061 --> 02:00:19.270
Pro Wrestling move.
I mean,
you've got to appreciate that he's playing the heel.

1993
02:00:19.590 --> 02:00:24.570
<v 3>I love it.
I love it.
And same thing with Rhonda,
who I love,</v>

1994
02:00:25.020 --> 02:00:28.650
uh,
you say playing the heel.
Uh,

1995
02:00:30.090 --> 02:00:32.260
Rhonda says where it's at.
You know,

1996
02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:35.990
<v 1>Rhonda plays for keeps,
you know,
she's,
she's not trying to make friends.</v>

1997
02:00:35.991 --> 02:00:39.530
She's not trying to win any publicity events.
She's not trying to,
you know,

1998
02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:43.100
do PR and get everybody to love her.
She wants to break me.
She takes arm.

1999
02:00:43.130 --> 02:00:46.130
That's what she wants to do.
And she's pretty,
pretty,
pretty adamant about it.

2000
02:00:46.690 --> 02:00:49.810
<v 3>Meisha Tate's a great competitor and everything.
But</v>

2001
02:00:51.670 --> 02:00:54.520
if I was be should Tate,
I wouldn't show up that night.

2002
02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:00.190
Wow.
You,
but you can't tell what's going to happen but never tell.
Well,

2003
02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:03.400
you know she had Ron is back and the first fight.
Oh yeah.

2004
02:01:03.401 --> 02:01:08.401
Well Rhonda had to a couple of people that have had her back because she's got

2005
02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:12.910
so much confidence.
Uh,

2006
02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:16.600
and she's so strong confidence that she can,

2007
02:01:16.990 --> 02:01:21.940
she can get out of everything and anything.
Um,

2008
02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:25.320
there's a picture of you guys together.
Oh yeah.

2009
02:01:25.321 --> 02:01:29.650
It wasn't that I was a picture of somebody behind a,

2010
02:01:29.651 --> 02:01:32.440
that's a picture of Ronda.
Yup.
There she is with you.

2011
02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:37.060
I didn't know if they can picture.
Yeah,
zero is perfect.

2012
02:01:37.090 --> 02:01:39.280
My arm feels cold.
When you broken

2013
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:43.880
<v 0>judo gene,
the bell broker,

Don't let anybody get behind you.
Yeah.

2016
02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:54.660
You don't ever have let people do that again.
Hi
Jim.

2017
02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:57.440
What more can we say?
This was a lot of fun,
man.

Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

2020
02:02:05.770 --> 02:02:10.100
Day of Sabbath May.
If I never see the back of my neck again.

2021
02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:14.660
I,
I've done a lot of textbooks.
So what?

2022
02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:20.260
But I do a book just for gene labelle and the few very intimate friends.

2023
02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:22.633
Okay.

2024
02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:27.700
Now this is one of my very greatest teachers.

2025
02:02:28.190 --> 02:02:31.760
I learned this from
judo,

2026
02:02:31.770 --> 02:02:36.680
Joe Rogan.
Oh my screwed.

2027
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:41.420
Uh,
Kennedy Kennedy get that he had,
and this is like a leg,

2028
02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:45.670
a trip when someone takes and grab it.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I,

2029
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:50.840
why did I have to be the technique where you get your boobies grabbed?
Uh,
hey,

2030
02:02:50.841 --> 02:02:54.750
it works for me.
I feel terrible about this at an inside leg hook,
grapevine,

2031
02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:59.360
the color,
uh,
Occi Gary and,
uh,

2032
02:02:59.390 --> 02:03:02.780
Japanese,
uh,
judo.
So it's an inside grape vine,

2033
02:03:02.781 --> 02:03:05.270
and then a punch to the face as I would it is there.
Oh,

2034
02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:10.040
I only read the first page,
the second page too devastating.
Oh,

2035
02:03:10.041 --> 02:03:13.100
it goes to the balls to,
oh,
well let's see.
And then it guys,

2036
02:03:13.190 --> 02:03:17.990
can you get to the balls?
Yeah,
you could see the balls there right there.
Oh yeah,

2037
02:03:17.991 --> 02:03:22.970
that's wonderful.
And then the inside leg trip and then a punch.
Love it.

Well,
I'm honored.
