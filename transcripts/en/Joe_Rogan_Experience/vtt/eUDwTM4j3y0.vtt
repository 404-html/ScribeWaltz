<v Speaker 1>We can't do this.</v>

8
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get fired since last time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.680

<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

11
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

12
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Did you get any heat at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

15
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

16
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 1>know someone complained about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

17
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>One person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who was raised,</v>

18
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.550
<v Speaker 1>someone who was referenced in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not,</v>

19
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:46.000
<v Speaker 1>not by name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but someone who is referenced.</v>

20
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the people that we</v>

21
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:49.290
<v Speaker 1>complained about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone complained to the administration</v>

22
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>about what we talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

23
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>And what did they say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing was done to me.</v>

24
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just told that there was a</v>

25
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>complaint made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how does that work?</v>

26
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Did they have to examine every complaint</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a severely?</v>

27
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.360
<v Speaker 1>They did not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't pay us.</v>

28
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was totally,</v>

29
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>it was a formal complaint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then nothing,</v>

30
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>as far as I know it was done about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm still there,</v>

31
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 1>although I'm probably leaving Occidental</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

32
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this a news flash?</v>

33
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

34
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>it is actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I breaking news.</v>

35
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be taking a new position at</v>

36
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Willamette University in Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

37
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.320
<v Speaker 1>but you got to move up there and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to split time between Lin and</v>

38
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.871
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

39
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:29.130
<v Speaker 1>you're a glutton for punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

40
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>my son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my son is here,</v>

41
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:31.760
<v Speaker 1>so I got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

42
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>that's how long commute isn't that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

43
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>actually hours in a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an hour and a half and then</v>

45
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>it's about the same as what I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>now between the east side of La and the</v>

46
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>west side of la where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where his mother lives.</v>

47
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so actually it's not that much</v>

48
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different commute for me.</v>

49
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traffic versus the flight?</v>

50
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done it yet,</v>

52
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>so we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it'll work out.</v>

53
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What an optimistic fellow you are.</v>

54
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>I Love Oregon though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all so beautiful.</v>

55
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>And they have water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have much water of water and they</v>

56
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>have green plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's green.</v>

57
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

58
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:06.441
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

59
00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting trade off.</v>

60
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like they get a lot of rain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of that,</v>

61
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grass is like this vibrant,</v>

62
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>almost like glowing Greens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the opposite of La.</v>

63
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's alive and lush.</v>

64
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets a little dreary though.</v>

65
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Like when you don't see the son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried about like February,</v>

66
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>March,</v>
<v Speaker 1>April.</v>

67
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:28.320
<v Speaker 1>But I've heard the summers are great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The summers are amazing.</v>

68
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Same as Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was just in Seattle recently and</v>

69
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>it rained three days in a row and by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time the third day rolled around we were</v>

70
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

71
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:36.890
<v Speaker 1>let's get out of here.</v>

72
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fun cause you know,</v>

73
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I was visiting some friends and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my family,</v>

74
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>so [inaudible] took the kids and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just love the fact that it's different,</v>

75
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it never rains out here.</v>

76
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

77
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.240
<v Speaker 1>You get to go play splashing in puddles</v>
<v Speaker 1>and running around.</v>

78
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if that's every day,</v>

79
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.540
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

80
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>the 90th day in a row they've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they had like a flip of rain in</v>

81
00:02:57.541 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>the last month they've had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but last winter they had like an</v>

82
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 1>incredibly dry winter and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

83
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

84
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>but I'm looking forward to it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I love hiking and camping in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains and the ocean and all that</v>

86
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great spot to be grounded by</v>

87
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.990
<v Speaker 1>And you say it's Willamette?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Willamette?</v>

89
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>We'll laminate and Sam Salem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just south of Portland.</v>

90
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

91
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

92
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>That's great country up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.850
<v Speaker 1>So a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would that,</v>

94
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>was that part of the incentive to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to go there?</v>

95
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deal is my,</v>

96
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>my partner or girlfriend got a job as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vice president there.</v>

97
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Partner slash girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>

98
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:31.091
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

99
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no good term for it right now.</v>

100
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.780
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing that your special lady</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends were married?</v>

101
00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I was married,</v>

102
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>I'd call my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my special lady friend.</v>

103
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I call her my lady,</v>

104
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>but I can't do that on the campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

105
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Like you can get in trouble for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get totally in trouble.</v>

106
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How hilarious is that?</v>

107
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since you've been here,</v>

108
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.560
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warrior,</v>

109
00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crusade has ramped up considerably.</v>

110
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including what happened in Yale,</v>

111
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the woman who she,</v>

112
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I guess she sent out a letter saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should allow people a certain</v>

113
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 1>amount of leeway to be offensive.</v>

114
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Like you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't restrict what kind of</v>

115
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 1>costumes kids can wear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including if they want to wear things</v>

116
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that appropriate other cultures and</v>

117
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you should give people the</v>

118
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to be offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is what she said.</v>

119
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:21.094
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

120
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess opening up the door for free</v>

121
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:25.450
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that you're supposed to be</v>

122
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 1>learning in these schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to be exploring</v>

123
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 1>different ways of thinking and whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not something is of,</v>

124
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 1>is this a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this humorous?</v>

125
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Is is valid in our culture or is it not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should you be offended?</v>

126
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Is it pointless to be offended?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it silly?</v>

127
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Does it offend everyone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it doesn't offend people who it's</v>

128
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be culturally appropriating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what's,</v>

129
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>what's it on you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was this opening up this can of</v>

130
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 1>worms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

131
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

132
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a can of worms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very complex issue.</v>

133
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a lot to unpack here.</v>

134
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know,</v>

135
00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>she quit for good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

136
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:00.760
<v Speaker 1>That professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe her husband did as well,</v>

137
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dean,</v>

138
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.450
<v Speaker 1>the Dean of Silliman College.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think so.</v>

139
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be wrong.</v>

140
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

141
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:11.740
<v Speaker 1>it's been all over the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been very intense at Occidental,</v>

142
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:12.574
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

143
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>And I've been in meetings and I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it there.</v>

144
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I've been sort of in the middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

145
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a complete cluster fuck.</v>

146
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

147
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:22.510
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my scholarly opinion.</v>

148
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 1>It is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

149
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 1>it's gone to the level of being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>caricature of political correctness,</v>

150
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Pcu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie you've ever seen,</v>

151
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>that it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really often looks like that.</v>

152
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a south park episode,</v>

153
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:35.960
<v Speaker 1>almost a South Park episode.</v>

154
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 1>It really is to the level of caricature</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

155
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

156
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously a lot of what the student</v>

157
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>protesters are saying is hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they talk as if they're in</v>

158
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Alabama in 1960 when they're actually at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yale or Occidental college and they are</v>

159
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>among the most privileged people on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

160
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just by being there.</v>

161
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

162
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 1>many of their demands are essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian,</v>

163
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding diversity training,</v>

164
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>mandatory diversity training for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>faculty and staff,</v>

165
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming would be teaching me how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about race and gender and</v>

167
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 1>sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

168
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Telling me what I should should say in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my classrooms and not say in my</v>

169
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 1>classrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

170
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 1>that Occidental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the faculty themselves,</v>

171
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>some of the faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually took it upon themselves to</v>

172
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:27.300
<v Speaker 1>propose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

173
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.530
<v Speaker 1>a mechanism in which students can report</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro aggressions committed against them</v>

174
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 1>by five faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The faculty,</v>

175
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>the students didn't even demand this.</v>

176
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 1>How is this happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say,</v>

177
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 1>I will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to be clear here,</v>

178
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.970
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't been voted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The faculty hasn't voted for that yet,</v>

179
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 1>but it was a significant minority of</v>
<v Speaker 1>faculty propose that significant like</v>

180
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:54.310
<v Speaker 1>30% probably around there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

181
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I'd say about a third to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mechanism to report microaggressions.</v>

182
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Microaggressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning like,</v>

183
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 shirt.</v>

184
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could look at you and go,</v>

185
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.710
<v Speaker 1>nice shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can be specific because they've</v>

186
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:10.610
<v Speaker 1>actually listed micro aggressions in</v>
<v Speaker 1>many places and one of them is asking</v>

187
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:12.320
<v Speaker 1>the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you from?</v>

188
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

189
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:17.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a microaggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you from?</v>

190
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Is One way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you from?</v>

191
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another one is what are you all right,</v>

192
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 1>what are you</v>
<v Speaker 1>following up with?</v>

193
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:30.260
<v Speaker 1>What are you really well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you seems like a good question</v>

194
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:33.110
<v Speaker 1>today because you have to be really</v>
<v Speaker 1>careful with gender pronouns.</v>

195
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why can't you just say,</v>

196
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 1>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doesn't seem offensive at</v>

197
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:39.940
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be you could be a g j uh,</v>

198
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.020
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uhZ,</v>

199
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.150
<v Speaker 1>,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even sure how it's pronounced,</v>

200
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when someone says,</v>

201
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>what are you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's gender neutral.</v>

202
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.870
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually should be politically</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

203
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not race neutral.</v>

204
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

205
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's a question about race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

206
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 1>But why is it a question about race?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like a Mulatto Looking,</v>

207
00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:02.690
<v Speaker 1>oh mama say Mulatto and don't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have a similar story from 1971</v>

208
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.450
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

209
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.910
<v Speaker 1>but I don't even believe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be mixed race because</v>

210
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a human,</v>

211
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all one race that's been proven</v>

212
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:15.850
<v Speaker 1>scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could.</v>

213
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:20.300
<v Speaker 1>The question is what race are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is sort of a silly question and a</v>

214
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:21.330
<v Speaker 1>little bit terrible question.</v>

215
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Slightly rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

216
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.770
<v Speaker 1>But it's also like scientifically</v>
<v Speaker 1>invalid.</v>

217
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's only one race.</v>

218
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.440
<v Speaker 1>It might be different ethnicities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different parts of the world where your</v>

219
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 1>ancestors and different cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's the only one race.</v>

220
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Like this idea of what's your race?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking stupid.</v>

221
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

222
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.710
<v Speaker 1>But so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's considered to be that kind of</v>

223
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:43.310
<v Speaker 1>ignorance is considered to be violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that violence,</v>

224
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.500
<v Speaker 1>hostile racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the refresh,</v>

225
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.680
<v Speaker 1>the refrain is we are unsafe on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>

226
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the word that's used.</v>

227
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.830
<v Speaker 1>If someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

228
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 1>You become unsafe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

229
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.950
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not an exaggeration.</v>

230
00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it said guys with</v>

231
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:01.350
<v Speaker 1>hoods and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

232
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so coaches,</v>

233
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 1>there's this incredible conflation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes on,</v>

234
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:10.071
<v Speaker 1>which drives me insane because certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is some racism on campuses.</v>

235
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is some racial insensitivity,</v>

236
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 1>no doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they conflate that stuff that goes</v>

237
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:21.291
<v Speaker 1>on at Yale with Ferguson and Baltimore</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Birmingham,</v>

238
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Alabama in 1956 and South Africa under</v>
<v Speaker 1>apartheid,</v>

239
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

240
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 1>It all becomes the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

241
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:31.560
<v Speaker 1>It all becomes white supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all racism.</v>

242
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:34.290
<v Speaker 1>It's all structural racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all systemic racism.</v>

243
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we need to start sort of</v>

244
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.530
<v Speaker 1>differentiating here cause there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly some differences among those.</v>

245
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.520
<v Speaker 1>So what are you as one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you really is the followup,</v>

246
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:47.310
<v Speaker 1>which is like the death where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubled down on your racism.</v>

247
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are some other ones?</v>

248
00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:51.390
<v Speaker 1>So it would make me feel like a double</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro aggression,</v>

249
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's the mother one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

250
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:57.263
<v Speaker 1>where are you from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are,</v>

251
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.620
<v Speaker 1>what are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

252
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.150
<v Speaker 1>well then there's things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

253
00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:04.680
<v Speaker 1>that there's things that clearly are</v>
<v Speaker 1>rude,</v>

254
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 1>possibly racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're really smart or you're</v>

255
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:12.450
<v Speaker 1>really articulate to a black person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute,</v>

256
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.730
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

257
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:14.550
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

258
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if he's really articulate?</v>

259
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.260
<v Speaker 1>What if he talking to a woman and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>black and she's super articulate and you</v>

260
00:10:20.261 --> 00:10:20.791
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

261
00:10:20.791 --> 00:10:21.810
<v Speaker 1>you're really articulate.</v>

262
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Or whether you're talking to a white man</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's really articulate and go,</v>

263
00:10:25.861 --> 00:10:27.300
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really articulate.</v>

264
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.860
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be racist,</v>

265
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.900
<v Speaker 1>but it might just be a compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

266
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:32.580
<v Speaker 1>it's just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's often been said.</v>

267
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand.</v>

268
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.530
<v Speaker 1>I do often been said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

269
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.980
<v Speaker 1>remember what Joe Biden said about Obama</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the election,</v>

270
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:38.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he's very,</v>

271
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.740
<v Speaker 1>the people like him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he's so articulate and well</v>

272
00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:41.391
<v Speaker 1>spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

273
00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what's classically been said,</v>

274
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.110
<v Speaker 1>but why is that racist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just show model black people.</v>

275
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Why is that racist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're comparing him to the</v>

276
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 1>former president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George W.</v>

277
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Bush was totally the opposite of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not right.</v>

278
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.180
<v Speaker 1>He was terrible at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you get a guy like Obama,</v>

279
00:10:54.181 --> 00:10:56.130
<v Speaker 1>he's clearly articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

280
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that racist at all?</v>

281
00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.471
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

282
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:01.170
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's been said about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>model black person.</v>

283
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

284
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 1>but unless you use it in that context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you say as a black guy,</v>

285
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.290
<v Speaker 1>he's very articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

286
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Which has been said to you on campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

287
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.960
<v Speaker 1>and often they'll say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a black guy in particular,</v>

288
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must be an athlete.</v>

289
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.590
<v Speaker 1>You must be on a sports team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

290
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.290
<v Speaker 1>what if they're yoked yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

291
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:22.130
<v Speaker 1>with their black higher and the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

292
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could just like Lebron James,</v>

293
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Physics major lifts a lot of weights</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

294
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay could be,</v>

295
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.430
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that a bad thing to say you,</v>

296
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.090
<v Speaker 1>you must be really good moving your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

297
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.890
<v Speaker 1>It's footing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Annoy you.</v>

298
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:35.431
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

299
00:11:35.431 --> 00:11:36.120
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

300
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.420
<v Speaker 1>What if somebody asks you if you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>black and someone said that to you,</v>

301
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.610
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're here because you must be on the</v>

302
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:42.480
<v Speaker 1>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

303
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Well if it was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was like the insinuation that the</v>

304
00:11:45.151 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 1>only reason why you got into the college</v>
<v Speaker 1>was because of your athletic prowess,</v>

305
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.710
<v Speaker 1>not your intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>

306
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

307
00:11:50.371 --> 00:11:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That these things are not completely</v>

308
00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:52.740
<v Speaker 1>groundless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

309
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 1>it's mostly</v>

310
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.390
<v Speaker 2>hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

311
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 2>There is a lot that's legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>

312
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:00.190
<v Speaker 2>That I understand that I have compassion</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

313
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.770
<v Speaker 2>I've never been a black person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been a black college student,</v>

314
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 2>but I've always been sure that it must</v>
<v Speaker 2>be at least uncomfortable for black</v>

315
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 2>people on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on these campuses that are mostly white.</v>

316
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some circumstances for sure.</v>

317
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Well that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it seems like socially that</v>

318
00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:17.020
<v Speaker 2>stuff all weeds itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people realize who the decks are</v>

319
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.400
<v Speaker 2>and you avoid those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said we were talking about like the</v>

320
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:26.401
<v Speaker 2>word microaggression is suitable for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and that is a micro aggression.</v>

321
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:28.120
<v Speaker 2>It's so micro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all like,</v>

322
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.360
<v Speaker 2>it's this kind of slightly dicky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

323
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 2>And so the question is do you have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>macro response to a micro grid in its</v>

324
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.830
<v Speaker 2>form of policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which limits freedom of speech?</v>

325
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Which limits academic freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you rex the surveillance system.</v>

326
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially,</v>

327
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.720
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially what they're asking</v>
<v Speaker 2>for with microaggressions.</v>

328
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>limits,</v>

329
00:12:47.771 --> 00:12:50.370
<v Speaker 2>humor to it certainly limits humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It eliminates,</v>

330
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:51.190
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

331
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:52.930
<v Speaker 2>college campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

332
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.540
<v Speaker 2>there's no fun being had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no end though.</v>

333
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Funniness right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

334
00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.140
<v Speaker 2>it's in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just talking about this with</v>

335
00:12:59.141 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 2>someone the other night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

336
00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:02.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are crack a lot of jokes.</v>

337
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:02.630
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

338
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.463
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no,</v>

339
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 2>there no jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to be like animal house.</v>

340
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:08.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I do,</v>

341
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I do joke in my classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sort of the space outside of the</v>

342
00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 2>classroom on campus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of in public arenas on campus.</v>

343
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:20.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've gotta be really dour and earnest</v>

344
00:13:20.171 --> 00:13:21.730
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

345
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:23.950
<v Speaker 2>It's so tiresome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It certainly is,</v>

346
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.170
<v Speaker 2>but that's not life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

347
00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:27.440
<v Speaker 2>What are they preparing people for?</v>

348
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.510
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

349
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

350
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:31.420
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you're going to,</v>

351
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:37.600
<v Speaker 2>John mcwhorter is this brilliant black</v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbia linguistics professor.</v>

352
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.920
<v Speaker 2>Micro microaggression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

353
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

354
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.180
<v Speaker 2>I say black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

355
00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

356
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.750
<v Speaker 2>to him and everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has said that when he was in college</v>

357
00:13:46.751 --> 00:13:50.950
<v Speaker 2>in the 1980s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he heard a few times statements that</v>

358
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:54.170
<v Speaker 2>were clearly racist that we're even sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of hostile and racist eating.</v>

359
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Speaker 2>They're not no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

360
00:13:55.271 --> 00:14:00.271
<v Speaker 2>but he said it never occurred to me that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be damaged by that.</v>

361
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.490
<v Speaker 2>That it might hurt me to hear these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

362
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.520
<v Speaker 2>I just assumed that these people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>worthless when they said it.</v>

363
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 2>That they're like gum on my shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

364
00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:13.780
<v Speaker 2>exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's happening now is kids on</v>

365
00:14:13.781 --> 00:14:18.781
<v Speaker 2>campuses either have been trained or</v>
<v Speaker 2>have trained themselves to feel damaged.</v>

366
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.400
<v Speaker 2>Devastated is the word actually that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>often used by things like micro</v>

367
00:14:25.401 --> 00:14:26.890
<v Speaker 2>aggressions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

368
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that what you're doing is you are</v>

369
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:34.590
<v Speaker 2>stating and claiming status as a weak</v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

370
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who can be damaged by the</v>

371
00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:38.620
<v Speaker 2>slightest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slight.</v>

372
00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:40.900
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then what happens when you're in the</v>

373
00:14:40.901 --> 00:14:43.090
<v Speaker 2>real world where there really are</v>
<v Speaker 2>racists,</v>

374
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.700
<v Speaker 2>where there really are people who will</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull you over for being black,</v>

375
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.490
<v Speaker 2>who will throw him in prison for being</v>
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>

376
00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 2>who will shoot you for being black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who will not give you a job for black,</v>

377
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real racism,</v>

378
00:14:53.391 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 1>real structural racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do then?</v>

379
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea is that they're going</v>

380
00:14:58.041 --> 00:15:03.041
<v Speaker 1>to eliminate that by raising people</v>
<v Speaker 1>through their system that never have</v>

381
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:04.550
<v Speaker 1>these thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

382
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.230
<v Speaker 1>so we're gonna clean up the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that were a plan,</v>

383
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.260
<v Speaker 1>at least it would be a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that as the plan though.</v>

384
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the professional victim status,</v>

385
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:19.280
<v Speaker 1>that that's a real issue because people</v>
<v Speaker 1>claiming to be victims when there is no</v>

386
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 1>real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looking for victims.</v>

387
00:15:23.151 --> 00:15:24.560
<v Speaker 1>They're looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>

388
00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:27.590
<v Speaker 1>we're looking for things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>targeting them.</v>

389
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.190
<v Speaker 1>And I always assumed that the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do that is because there's not</v>

390
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:35.030
<v Speaker 1>enough real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problems have become so minute.</v>

391
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Like this is the safest time to live</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

392
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.140
<v Speaker 1>And on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

393
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 1>outside of the normal things that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to deal with when you have a bunch</v>

394
00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:46.850
<v Speaker 1>of young people together and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

395
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 1>social interactions and alcohol and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other crap that happens between</v>

396
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:52.730
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get them together in a young,</v>

397
00:15:52.731 --> 00:15:55.460
<v Speaker 1>and they don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when they're older,</v>

398
00:15:55.461 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a group of people together,</v>

399
00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.360
<v Speaker 1>you're likely to have some disputes.</v>

400
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.880
<v Speaker 1>But outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the fucking worst thing that's</v>

401
00:16:01.881 --> 00:16:04.100
<v Speaker 1>happening in these kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I actually looked up the</v>

402
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:05.360
<v Speaker 1>statistics because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

403
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:07.880
<v Speaker 1>people during,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Missouri thing was happening at</v>

404
00:16:07.881 --> 00:16:08.960
<v Speaker 1>the University of Missouri,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

405
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Claims about,</v>

406
00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:12.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nigger being said and you know,</v>

407
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.380
<v Speaker 1>racist violence in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

408
00:16:15.381 --> 00:16:16.400
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that possible?</v>

409
00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:17.091
<v Speaker 1>So I looked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

410
00:16:17.091 --> 00:16:18.890
<v Speaker 1>there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has not been a,</v>

411
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:23.630
<v Speaker 1>a racist hate crime on a college campus</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States in 30 years.</v>

412
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

413
00:16:25.281 --> 00:16:26.540
<v Speaker 1>in that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was in the early,</v>

414
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:30.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years ago was a guy who wasn't a</v>

415
00:16:30.921 --> 00:16:32.480
<v Speaker 1>student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't affiliated with the campus at</v>

416
00:16:32.481 --> 00:16:35.480
<v Speaker 1>all with the college at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who bombed some dormitory that had black</v>

417
00:16:35.481 --> 00:16:37.610
<v Speaker 1>people in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically it's,</v>

418
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:39.530
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it is an extremely safe place</v>

419
00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:40.364
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

420
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.940
<v Speaker 1>And everyone don't you think that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>those extremely safe environments,</v>

421
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.780
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people just go around looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>for problems that don't exist?</v>

422
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:48.291
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

423
00:16:48.291 --> 00:16:52.970
<v Speaker 1>this has been the case at an American</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleges for decades.</v>

424
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in college in the 1980s,</v>

425
00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:55.580
<v Speaker 1>that's all we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

426
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.030
<v Speaker 1>we needed to fight the devil we needed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

427
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.170
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you had to find the devil.</v>

428
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:01.810
<v Speaker 1>And the problem was he wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

429
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.920
<v Speaker 1>The Ku Klux Klan wasn't actually on</v>
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>

430
00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The police weren't even really on</v>

431
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:07.250
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

432
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:11.300
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have these terrible sexist</v>
<v Speaker 1>and racist on campus,</v>

433
00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:14.120
<v Speaker 1>so you had to invent them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you did was you invented them</v>

434
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:16.520
<v Speaker 1>in the form of the president of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>college often.</v>

435
00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He became the villain that you had to</v>

436
00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:19.191
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

437
00:17:19.191 --> 00:17:21.200
<v Speaker 1>And I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

438
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.460
<v Speaker 1>and that's what's going on now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

439
00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:25.820
<v Speaker 1>one of the main demands of students at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occidental was the resignation of the</v>

440
00:17:25.821 --> 00:17:26.570
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

441
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he do wrong?</v>

442
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a great question and I haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually gotten a specific answer to</v>

443
00:17:32.841 --> 00:17:35.600
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no answer cause he a white guy.</v>

444
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well fuck him.</v>

445
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Well he embodies privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course he does.</v>

446
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone at Occidental and buddy's</v>

447
00:17:41.761 --> 00:17:43.200
<v Speaker 1>privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone does.</v>

448
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone at Yale and bodies privilege.</v>

449
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

450
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Will students as faculty of luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asca,</v>

451
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Filipino peasant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what they think of student</v>

452
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:53.370
<v Speaker 1>yells at students at Yale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're privileged or not,</v>

453
00:17:53.371 --> 00:17:54.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

454
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so does it have specific trees?</v>

455
00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.680
<v Speaker 1>A tremendous lack of specificity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also drives me crazy.</v>

456
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often say,</v>

457
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what they're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

458
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.380
<v Speaker 1>I be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what's happened to</v>

459
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:09.180
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has he actually done?</v>

460
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.150
<v Speaker 1>So there's been a demand for a black</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies program at Occidental for</v>

461
00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:13.530
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the 60s.</v>

462
00:18:13.531 --> 00:18:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that hasn't been instituted.</v>

463
00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:17.310
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's only the most recent president who</v>

464
00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Speaker 1>hasn't done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

465
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:21.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a faculty decision anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether I have a black studies program.</v>

466
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even tell you.</v>

467
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I really couldn't tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so racial charge kind of.</v>

468
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.840
<v Speaker 1>It's also about the sexual assault</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

469
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:36.410
<v Speaker 1>But the sexual assault stuff was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre and also lacking in specificity</v>

470
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:40.980
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're being sued by the young man who</v>

471
00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:44.670
<v Speaker 1>was accused of sexual assault while the</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman that he had sex with was not.</v>

472
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why he was accused of</v>

473
00:18:46.471 --> 00:18:48.290
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being the assaulter,</v>

474
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.620
<v Speaker 1>it's cause he's a male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

475
00:18:49.621 --> 00:18:51.300
<v Speaker 1>they were both drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the only,</v>

476
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.340
<v Speaker 1>that's the only conclusion you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw for.</v>

477
00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:55.350
<v Speaker 1>People don't know the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can google the story.</v>

478
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.450
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we talked about it the last time we</v>

479
00:18:57.451 --> 00:18:58.740
<v Speaker 1>were here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

480
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.300
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

481
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.210
<v Speaker 1>a man and a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're both over 18,</v>

482
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.250
<v Speaker 1>they were going to college there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

483
00:19:05.251 --> 00:19:07.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got liquored up and decided to hook up</v>

484
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:09.840
<v Speaker 1>and they exchanged some text messages</v>
<v Speaker 1>where she said,</v>

485
00:19:09.841 --> 00:19:10.650
<v Speaker 1>do you have condoms?</v>

486
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Come on over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she told her friend,</v>

487
00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lol,</v>

488
00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:15.900
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

489
00:19:15.901 --> 00:19:19.410
<v Speaker 1>after they had sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone either convinced her or she</v>

490
00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:24.030
<v Speaker 1>convinced herself that it was rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when two people are drinking,</v>

491
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.050
<v Speaker 1>the woman cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consent was the only time in the world</v>

492
00:19:28.051 --> 00:19:31.170
<v Speaker 1>where you're not responsible for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions because you've been drinking.</v>

493
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.790
<v Speaker 1>If you get in a car and you drank and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you drive drunk and plow into people,</v>

494
00:19:35.791 --> 00:19:38.780
<v Speaker 1>you can never say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not responsible because I was drunk</v>

495
00:19:38.781 --> 00:19:41.190
<v Speaker 1>and he can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for whatever reason,</v>

496
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:45.810
<v Speaker 1>these social justice warriors have taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon themselves to,</v>

497
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.680
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in part victim status only on women that</v>

498
00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:52.620
<v Speaker 1>are in these scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that the man is always the ugly</v>

499
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:55.170
<v Speaker 1>oppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ugly pursuer,</v>

500
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.500
<v Speaker 1>the penetrator of the vagina is evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

501
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.440
<v Speaker 1>And so this kid got kicked out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>college for having sex while drunk.</v>

502
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.420
<v Speaker 1>That's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most outrageous thing was at the</v>

503
00:20:03.421 --> 00:20:07.770
<v Speaker 1>college itself actually officially</v>
<v Speaker 1>determined that the sex was consensual.</v>

504
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he got expelled.</v>

505
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's suing now.</v>

506
00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:14.260
<v Speaker 1>He should fucking close that place down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

507
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 1>And then light it on fire and turn it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disneyland too.</v>

508
00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:19.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

509
00:20:19.741 --> 00:20:23.370
<v Speaker 1>I think a revolution is coming or it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe already begun in higher education,</v>

510
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.420
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

511
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're doing right now,</v>

512
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 1>I think what you've been doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think stuff like this,</v>

513
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:29.430
<v Speaker 1>I think podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

514
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it started with blogs 20 years ago now.</v>

515
00:20:32.761 --> 00:20:37.761
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of online courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a tremendous demand for</v>

516
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.800
<v Speaker 1>learning and I think there are a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>curious people out there who can't</v>

517
00:20:40.801 --> 00:20:44.130
<v Speaker 1>afford to go to college or don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to these nut houses that are</v>

518
00:20:44.131 --> 00:20:46.950
<v Speaker 1>colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what is it that's causing these not</v>

519
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 1>houses to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to</v>

520
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.360
<v Speaker 3>flourish this way where it's so common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an oddity.</v>

521
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.440
<v Speaker 3>It's not just dartmouth where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>stormed into the library or the,</v>

522
00:20:56.441 --> 00:20:57.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the study hall and started screaming</v>

523
00:20:57.971 --> 00:21:02.800
<v Speaker 3>black lives matter while fucking white</v>
<v Speaker 3>and black people were going over their</v>

524
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:04.720
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sitting there trying to do their</v>

525
00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:08.650
<v Speaker 3>homework and all these fucking white</v>
<v Speaker 3>dorks are running through the hallway</v>

526
00:21:08.651 --> 00:21:10.060
<v Speaker 3>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black lives matter,</v>

527
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:12.160
<v Speaker 3>black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm watching that.</v>

528
00:21:12.161 --> 00:21:15.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is this like these people aren't</v>

529
00:21:15.161 --> 00:21:16.180
<v Speaker 3>oppressors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

530
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.130
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their students or fellow students,</v>

531
00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:20.620
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're being shamed if you don't</v>

532
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:23.620
<v Speaker 3>join in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're being shamed if you don't stop</v>

533
00:21:23.621 --> 00:21:26.230
<v Speaker 3>whatever you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

534
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.310
<v Speaker 3>How is this happening?</v>

535
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.790
<v Speaker 2>It's so difficult to unpack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

536
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:34.540
<v Speaker 2>so here's it actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually stems from a sort of</v>

537
00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:39.541
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated social theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that discourse can be violence.</v>

538
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 2>That discourse is power and discourse</v>
<v Speaker 2>can therefore be violence.</v>

539
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Just stay with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

540
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:51.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if discourse is violence than any</v>

541
00:21:51.941 --> 00:21:55.420
<v Speaker 2>means are necessary to defend oneself</v>
<v Speaker 2>from discursive violence.</v>

542
00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

543
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.140
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I agree with this part,</v>

544
00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean silence can be discourse to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

545
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:02.830
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sure.</v>

546
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Silence in the case of these kids in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dartmouth Library,</v>

547
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:06.430
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was violence.</v>

548
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.390
<v Speaker 2>If you carry that argument to its</v>
<v Speaker 2>logical extreme,</v>

549
00:22:10.391 --> 00:22:12.250
<v Speaker 2>which is what obviously is happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

550
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:14.890
<v Speaker 2>it's a perversion of French</v>
<v Speaker 2>poststructuralism,</v>

551
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.760
<v Speaker 2>which made this intervention about 40</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago about discourse being power</v>

552
00:22:18.761 --> 00:22:20.410
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also being violence.</v>

553
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.780
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of running with the idea.</v>

554
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.650
<v Speaker 2>And if you run with it all the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes totalitarian.</v>

555
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're back in like Maoist</v>

556
00:22:28.441 --> 00:22:29.730
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

557
00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:34.690
<v Speaker 2>because everyone who says the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing or doesn't say the right thing is</v>

558
00:22:34.691 --> 00:22:38.920
<v Speaker 2>a criminal is an enemy and must be dealt</v>
<v Speaker 2>with by any means necessary.</v>

559
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

560
00:22:42.701 --> 00:22:43.534
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bad.</v>

561
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:44.411
<v Speaker 2>It's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

562
00:22:44.411 --> 00:22:49.411
<v Speaker 2>the good news is that right now these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't have much power.</v>

563
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They aren't right now these kids aren't</v>

564
00:22:52.541 --> 00:22:56.890
<v Speaker 2>running congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bad news is that they will be</v>

565
00:22:56.891 --> 00:23:00.460
<v Speaker 2>running America pretty soon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't the good news is that with</v>

566
00:23:00.461 --> 00:23:04.000
<v Speaker 2>time and maturity and life experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll become like you.</v>

567
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.160
<v Speaker 2>One would hope we're like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

568
00:23:06.161 --> 00:23:07.660
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One would hope,</v>

569
00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:09.730
<v Speaker 2>and that's it's probably true to some</v>
<v Speaker 2>extent.</v>

570
00:23:09.731 --> 00:23:11.290
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know about this,</v>

571
00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:16.291
<v Speaker 2>but there's been some recent polling</v>
<v Speaker 2>done of millennials by the Pew Research</v>

572
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Organization and they found that</v>
<v Speaker 2>millennials are much more hostile to the</v>

573
00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:23.620
<v Speaker 2>principle of free speech than previous</v>
<v Speaker 2>generations.</v>

574
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that the students in Yale,</v>

575
00:23:26.411 --> 00:23:29.740
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a significant majority voted</v>

576
00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:32.660
<v Speaker 2>to resend the first amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

577
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:34.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

578
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.490
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>

579
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:36.491
<v Speaker 2>What is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jay?</v>

580
00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:38.200
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know what that one is that that</v>

581
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.103
<v Speaker 2>that study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

582
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.440
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like 39% or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>

583
00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:42.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saying amounts about,</v>

584
00:23:42.701 --> 00:23:43.301
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

585
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they state</v>

586
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.880
<v Speaker 1>regulation of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so crazy.</v>

587
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Not a majority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

588
00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 1>but a hefty minority of millennials do</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a larger,</v>

589
00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.860
<v Speaker 1>a larger portion of them than any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>

590
00:23:57.861 --> 00:23:59.660
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>40% of millennials.</v>

591
00:23:59.661 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With limiting speech defenses to mind</v>

592
00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.010
<v Speaker 1>there in minorities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hefty minority.</v>

593
00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:07.160
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do they understand like what,</v>

594
00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.620
<v Speaker 1>what the state is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's really depressing.</v>

595
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.960
<v Speaker 1>That's something to be afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

596
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.940
<v Speaker 1>because these are the people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

597
00:24:13.941 --> 00:24:15.740
<v Speaker 1>they have no institutional power now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they will.</v>

598
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.630
<v Speaker 1>They will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

599
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.580
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are kids in elite colleges who</v>

600
00:24:19.581 --> 00:24:20.414
<v Speaker 1>believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

601
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:21.130
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

602
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.370
<v Speaker 1>what do you think those elite colleges</v>
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>

603
00:24:22.371 --> 00:24:25.820
<v Speaker 1>They train people to take power people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

604
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you asked anyone,</v>

605
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:31.040
<v Speaker 1>no one thinks that you should say rude</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to minorities.</v>

606
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.040
<v Speaker 1>No one thinks you should say offensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to anybody.</v>

607
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:39.020
<v Speaker 1>No one thinks that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you decide what is offensive</v>

608
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.700
<v Speaker 1>and what you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't say,</v>

609
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.610
<v Speaker 1>you limit discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

610
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.221
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

611
00:24:43.221 --> 00:24:47.710
<v Speaker 1>you have power over other people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to express themselves and you,</v>

612
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.340
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you create these splinter</v>

613
00:24:49.341 --> 00:24:51.950
<v Speaker 1>groups where people get off together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fucking,</v>

614
00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:53.370
<v Speaker 1>they closed the blinds and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

615
00:24:53.371 --> 00:24:55.420
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's time to talk about Mexico.</v>

616
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they get together and they say</v>

617
00:24:56.901 --> 00:24:59.210
<v Speaker 1>racist shit and the Fintech groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

618
00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:02.870
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see it like in comments sections</v>

619
00:25:02.871 --> 00:25:03.561
<v Speaker 1>on the web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

620
00:25:03.561 --> 00:25:05.750
<v Speaker 1>You can see it and read it and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it anywhere.</v>

621
00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a novice users on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet,</v>

622
00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what repression does.</v>

623
00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:12.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like clearly hardcore racism and</v>

624
00:25:12.321 --> 00:25:15.590
<v Speaker 1>sexism and misogyny and rape culture in</v>
<v Speaker 1>those corners.</v>

625
00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all anonymous.</v>

626
00:25:17.211 --> 00:25:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are,</v>

627
00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.330
<v Speaker 1>these are the repressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the repressed talking.</v>

628
00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>

629
00:25:21.561 --> 00:25:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

630
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.600
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>

631
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it's even worse than this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

632
00:25:26.871 --> 00:25:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Because as I said the last time I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

633
00:25:29.001 --> 00:25:29.834
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

634
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.020
<v Speaker 1>it is inherently conservative what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're calling for,</v>

635
00:25:33.021 --> 00:25:34.640
<v Speaker 1>even though it's a sort of a left wing</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

636
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.290
<v Speaker 1>They're asking for big brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either the college president or the</v>

637
00:25:39.291 --> 00:25:44.291
<v Speaker 1>United States government to protect us</v>
<v Speaker 1>from ideas and speech and words.</v>

638
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then what are we interested in?</v>

639
00:25:49.071 --> 00:25:51.310
<v Speaker 1>We're interested in those people having</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power,</v>

640
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.980
<v Speaker 1>having more power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't sound very left wing or</v>

641
00:25:54.981 --> 00:25:57.420
<v Speaker 1>liberatory to know or radical at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

642
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.480
<v Speaker 1>And even these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

643
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.910
<v Speaker 1>to stray slightly from this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

644
00:26:01.911 --> 00:26:06.350
<v Speaker 1>when people are talking about socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas about taxing the rich moore.</v>

645
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck do you think that money's</v>

646
00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:08.860
<v Speaker 1>going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

647
00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Can I go to the government going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders?</v>

648
00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

649
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.370
<v Speaker 1>when Bernie Sanders says that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

650
00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

651
00:26:14.681 --> 00:26:15.800
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

652
00:26:15.801 --> 00:26:18.830
<v Speaker 1>you're a senator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You understand where this money goes to</v>

653
00:26:18.831 --> 00:26:19.441
<v Speaker 1>him as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

654
00:26:19.441 --> 00:26:20.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes to him to control.</v>

655
00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the idea behind you take more money</v>

656
00:26:23.661 --> 00:26:27.410
<v Speaker 1>from people and give to the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make things even that is fucking</v>

657
00:26:27.411 --> 00:26:29.630
<v Speaker 1>crazy talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it works.</v>

658
00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:34.160
<v Speaker 1>If you want to encourage charitable</v>
<v Speaker 1>donations on a wide scale and encourage</v>

659
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.800
<v Speaker 1>some sort of like broad range</v>
<v Speaker 1>philanthropists from uh,</v>

660
00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:42.260
<v Speaker 1>amongst people and figure out some way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to institute that voluntarily,</v>

661
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.500
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

662
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.330
<v Speaker 1>but Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know that when you give the</v>

663
00:26:45.331 --> 00:26:47.640
<v Speaker 1>government lots of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it uses it wisely.</v>

664
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

665
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't ever use the money to</v>

666
00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:51.190
<v Speaker 1>hurt anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

667
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:52.950
<v Speaker 1>never know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they never wasted.</v>

668
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.060
<v Speaker 1>You're being silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

669
00:26:54.061 --> 00:26:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that actually is sort of this,</v>

670
00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:56.863
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

671
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:58.170
<v Speaker 1>it is that absurd.</v>

672
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the assumption underneath this is</v>

673
00:26:59.791 --> 00:27:02.550
<v Speaker 1>that if we give them more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to do nice things with it.</v>

674
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.490
<v Speaker 1>They're going to feed orphans with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend.</v>

675
00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually they're going to drop bombs on</v>

676
00:27:07.051 --> 00:27:08.990
<v Speaker 1>orphans 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

677
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.440
<v Speaker 1>you can look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either you don't get a,</v>

678
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

679
00:27:12.301 --> 00:27:17.160
<v Speaker 1>an itemized sheet of where your money</v>
<v Speaker 1>when like phone bombs,</v>

680
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Itemized taxes.</v>

681
00:27:19.561 --> 00:27:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be amazing.</v>

682
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Would it be amazing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can link it up online where</v>

683
00:27:23.551 --> 00:27:25.710
<v Speaker 1>everybody could take your itemized tax</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheets and say,</v>

684
00:27:25.711 --> 00:27:27.960
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just make sure that they used all</v>

685
00:27:27.961 --> 00:27:30.780
<v Speaker 1>of our money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody submit your itemized tax</v>

686
00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:34.200
<v Speaker 1>sheets so we can show we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're missing $1 billion.</v>

687
00:27:34.201 --> 00:27:35.820
<v Speaker 1>How weird where?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How Fun would that be?</v>

688
00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Be like Afghanistan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

689
00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we don't even have any idea where</v>

690
00:27:39.451 --> 00:27:40.080
<v Speaker 1>our money goes.</v>

691
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.070
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the weirdest things cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give a significant percentage if you</v>

692
00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:45.120
<v Speaker 1>make more than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

693
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:49.920
<v Speaker 1>$250,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pay 40% plus in taxes.</v>

694
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how a lot of money and you don't,</v>

695
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you don't even get a receipt less than</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Scandinavia.</v>

696
00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.970
<v Speaker 1>The taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much they give them for the wealthy.</v>

697
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.670
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it bumps up against 90 in</v>

698
00:28:02.671 --> 00:28:04.290
<v Speaker 1>some countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 I think so.</v>

699
00:28:04.291 --> 00:28:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>90% tax.</v>

700
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.293
<v Speaker 1>It's around there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

701
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what Bernie wants to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a Scandinavian social democrat.</v>

702
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's all that money going?</v>

703
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.670
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like even if you do that,</v>

704
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.300
<v Speaker 1>like his ideas as they've been explained</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me by people who understand the</v>

705
00:28:18.301 --> 00:28:22.050
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you'd have to charge $18 trillion</v>

706
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:22.920
<v Speaker 1>as the number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

707
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.920
<v Speaker 1>You would have to tax everyone in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country 100% of everything they make and</v>

708
00:28:28.171 --> 00:28:29.190
<v Speaker 1>you still wouldn't have enough money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

709
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

710
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.130
<v Speaker 1>if you liquidated all the assets of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wealthy,</v>

711
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll all the wind percent even I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 2% you couldn't pay for his stuff.</v>

712
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.270
<v Speaker 1>They've done the math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not even controversial.</v>

713
00:28:39.271 --> 00:28:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Like he's even admitted this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's admitted this.</v>

714
00:28:40.921 --> 00:28:42.720
<v Speaker 1>So what does he say he did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did on Bill Maher.</v>

715
00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Actually just a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a couple months ago,</v>

716
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:45.571
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

717
00:28:45.571 --> 00:28:48.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe I guess we'd have to tax the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle class a bit to something.</v>

718
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Of course you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

719
00:28:50.641 --> 00:28:53.490
<v Speaker 1>$18 trillion what he's calling for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

720
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would make this society a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better society.</v>

721
00:28:56.341 --> 00:28:59.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean I liked the idea of free</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare and maybe free education,</v>

722
00:28:59.551 --> 00:29:02.760
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're talking about in that case is</v>

723
00:29:02.761 --> 00:29:07.470
<v Speaker 1>public education for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Public education is run by whom?</v>

724
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:09.800
<v Speaker 1>It's run by the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

725
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Do you want people need to think more</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly about this.</v>

726
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Like isn't there a way to do free</v>
<v Speaker 1>education online with ads the way,</v>

727
00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:20.280
<v Speaker 1>the way you have youtube ads?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

728
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean as long as the ads aren't</v>

729
00:29:23.071 --> 00:29:24.990
<v Speaker 1>offensive and well as long as the ads</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't,</v>

730
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ridiculous property.</v>

731
00:29:26.941 --> 00:29:29.700
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the question that should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be raised with Bernie Sanders and his</v>

732
00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:30.540
<v Speaker 1>supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

733
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we need a government run</v>

734
00:29:33.421 --> 00:29:34.590
<v Speaker 1>education system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you,</v>

735
00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:37.230
<v Speaker 1>what are different way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want that?</v>

736
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Because I think there's something else</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on here with them.</v>

737
00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:42.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's just they want free</v>
<v Speaker 1>education for everyone.</v>

738
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I do think they're interested in social</v>
<v Speaker 1>control and that's a great way to</v>

739
00:29:46.691 --> 00:29:50.110
<v Speaker 1>control the populace is to control their</v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

740
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the government to control their</v>

741
00:29:51.461 --> 00:29:52.750
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you say there,</v>

742
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:56.710
<v Speaker 1>they are interested in social control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to what extent you'd have to ask</v>

743
00:29:56.711 --> 00:29:57.130
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

744
00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

745
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Why hasn't this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because every socialist has</v>

746
00:30:01.361 --> 00:30:02.530
<v Speaker 1>been interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

747
00:30:02.531 --> 00:30:03.910
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be a socialist.</v>

748
00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I hung out with socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents were revolutionary</v>

749
00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:07.810
<v Speaker 1>socialists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've studied them.</v>

750
00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.270
<v Speaker 1>How many bills did you have to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you stopped being a socialist one</v>

751
00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:14.830
<v Speaker 1>witness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I know is when I looked at my</v>

752
00:30:14.831 --> 00:30:19.680
<v Speaker 1>parents' tax returns and saw that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>made $11,000 a year in the 1970s is it?</v>

753
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

754
00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.090
<v Speaker 1>seems like not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not much fun to me.</v>

755
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

756
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:25.990
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

757
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:26.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

758
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.130
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

759
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a longstanding tradition of a</v>

760
00:30:29.471 --> 00:30:32.010
<v Speaker 1>desire for social control on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing about that.</v>

761
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the progressive's 120 years ago,</v>

762
00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:36.970
<v Speaker 1>and then the hardcore socialists and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>contract deal,</v>

763
00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.970
<v Speaker 1>the right used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would leave you alone.</v>

764
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.900
<v Speaker 1>That was the idea of conservatives was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would leave you alone,</v>

765
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:44.080
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

766
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:44.810
<v Speaker 1>That you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

767
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.430
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want big government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want the government</v>

768
00:30:48.431 --> 00:30:53.431
<v Speaker 1>interfering with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then it sort of got confused and</v>

769
00:30:53.771 --> 00:30:56.590
<v Speaker 1>then it became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became a lot of religious issues</v>

770
00:30:56.591 --> 00:31:00.940
<v Speaker 1>involved in the Reagan administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once they started incorporating,</v>

771
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the religious right into their,</v>

772
00:31:03.611 --> 00:31:04.750
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their plans,</v>

773
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.690
<v Speaker 1>like when they started using the</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious right in order to get into</v>

774
00:31:07.691 --> 00:31:10.660
<v Speaker 1>power and to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the things started getting really</v>

775
00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:15.010
<v Speaker 1>weird because then conservativism wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily leave people on.</v>

776
00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Then it became about gay rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became about gay marriage and all</v>

777
00:31:19.091 --> 00:31:21.850
<v Speaker 1>those other weird stuff started getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>

778
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:23.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

779
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the right that you're talking about,</v>

780
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:26.890
<v Speaker 1>we now call the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

781
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.820
<v Speaker 1>because it no longer exists pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a little tiny magazine called</v>

782
00:31:30.821 --> 00:31:34.000
<v Speaker 1>the American conservative where you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>find the old right and call themselves</v>

783
00:31:34.001 --> 00:31:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Paleo conservatives now.</v>

784
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Paleoconservative that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

785
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.340
<v Speaker 1>that's a tiny little faction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're interesting and,</v>

786
00:31:41.341 --> 00:31:44.350
<v Speaker 1>and I sorta liked them at least because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're truly conservatives,</v>

787
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.390
<v Speaker 1>but it used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to be about fiscal</v>

788
00:31:46.391 --> 00:31:48.180
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still see it.</v>

789
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

790
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.910
<v Speaker 1>But also leaving people alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

791
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.520
<v Speaker 1>And then what we got was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the neoconservatives,</v>

792
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.301
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

793
00:31:55.301 --> 00:31:55.991
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two things.</v>

794
00:31:55.991 --> 00:31:57.520
<v Speaker 1>There's two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wing you're talking about is the</v>

795
00:31:57.521 --> 00:32:00.430
<v Speaker 1>religious right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We came along and you've summarized that</v>

796
00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:02.380
<v Speaker 1>really well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then also the neoconservatives came</v>

797
00:32:02.381 --> 00:32:05.410
<v Speaker 1>along who really were progressive's to</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>

798
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the people who have run the</v>

799
00:32:08.471 --> 00:32:11.560
<v Speaker 1>United States into Iraq and Afghanistan</v>
<v Speaker 1>and around the world,</v>

800
00:32:11.561 --> 00:32:12.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

801
00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.750
<v Speaker 1>sort of right wing intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of around the Bush administration</v>

802
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:21.751
<v Speaker 1>in particular who are very aligned with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel and want it to protect Israel,</v>

803
00:32:21.791 --> 00:32:26.791
<v Speaker 1>but also most importantly wanted to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world in America's image very much</v>

804
00:32:26.831 --> 00:32:28.360
<v Speaker 1>committed to that vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

805
00:32:28.361 --> 00:32:31.090
<v Speaker 1>And they started off as actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive's or even socialists.</v>

806
00:32:31.091 --> 00:32:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about it,</v>

807
00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.640
<v Speaker 1>progressivism and socialism is</v>
<v Speaker 1>homogenizing ideology.</v>

808
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.310
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're interested in making everyone</v>

809
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:40.243
<v Speaker 1>same</v>

810
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.120
<v Speaker 2>equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

811
00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you have cultural sameness,</v>

812
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.600
<v Speaker 2>you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will reach,</v>

813
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic sameness as well.</v>

814
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Speaker 2>So that's where they come from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's who took over the Bush</v>

815
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:54.110
<v Speaker 2>administration to make the world in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>image of the United States.</v>

816
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:58.040
<v Speaker 2>You got to invade places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to send the army in to take over</v>

817
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.220
<v Speaker 2>and teach them how to live properly to</v>
<v Speaker 2>live like Americans.</v>

818
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:02.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what Iraq was all</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

819
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.520
<v Speaker 2>The Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what Afghanistan,</v>

820
00:33:05.521 --> 00:33:09.650
<v Speaker 2>the Afghanistan occupation is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The textbooks being taught to Afghany</v>

821
00:33:09.651 --> 00:33:13.280
<v Speaker 2>children right now were written by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States army.</v>

822
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

823
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:17.900
<v Speaker 2>It's in the New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they publish this,</v>

824
00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:21.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the United States Army wrote</v>
<v Speaker 2>the history textbooks that are being</v>

825
00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:25.970
<v Speaker 2>used in Afghany schools right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have historians at work for the</v>

826
00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:29.810
<v Speaker 2>army for probably they hired somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was willing to write the proper</v>

827
00:33:29.811 --> 00:33:30.740
<v Speaker 2>history for them.</v>

828
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then they vet it,</v>

829
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.180
<v Speaker 2>make sure that it fits their standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

830
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:36.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

831
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to the times,</v>

832
00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:43.280
<v Speaker 2>there is no mention of the Afghanistan</v>
<v Speaker 2>war in those textbooks.</v>

833
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:44.330
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

834
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Well cause you don't want to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the naughtiness,</v>

835
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.110
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bad stuff.</v>

836
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean that's,</v>

837
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.060
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty naked imperialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

838
00:33:53.061 --> 00:33:56.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what really clearly</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempting to remake the world in your</v>

839
00:33:56.241 --> 00:33:58.790
<v Speaker 2>own end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also super dangerous to deny</v>

840
00:33:58.791 --> 00:33:59.624
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

841
00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.190
<v Speaker 2>It's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because then people find out the truth</v>

842
00:34:01.191 --> 00:34:04.210
<v Speaker 2>and then they resent you and then become</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset and then you never trusted the</v>

843
00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.300
<v Speaker 2>Taliban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

844
00:34:05.301 --> 00:34:06.470
<v Speaker 2>exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

845
00:34:06.471 --> 00:34:07.281
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right.</v>

846
00:34:07.281 --> 00:34:09.550
<v Speaker 2>It's also self defeating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

847
00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.130
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for a long time they'll have some</v>

848
00:34:13.131 --> 00:34:15.590
<v Speaker 2>control and they'll kill a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the process.</v>

849
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.800
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we started this whole rant out trying to</v>

850
00:34:21.801 --> 00:34:24.890
<v Speaker 3>figure out where this all started from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it,</v>

851
00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:27.590
<v Speaker 3>where this social justice movement on</v>
<v Speaker 3>campus,</v>

852
00:34:27.591 --> 00:34:32.210
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous exaggeration of</v>
<v Speaker 3>microaggressions and things along those</v>

853
00:34:32.211 --> 00:34:34.580
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much of it has to do with social</v>

854
00:34:34.581 --> 00:34:36.800
<v Speaker 3>media though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it seems like social media,</v>

855
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:40.430
<v Speaker 3>if they support each other and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>find like minded groups,</v>

856
00:34:40.431 --> 00:34:43.670
<v Speaker 3>they get confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all join together and these little</v>

857
00:34:43.671 --> 00:34:45.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>message boards and what have you and</v>

858
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:49.730
<v Speaker 3>little twitter hashtag groups and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they feed off of each other and then</v>

859
00:34:49.731 --> 00:34:51.950
<v Speaker 3>explain to each other various things.</v>

860
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that just makes it louder,</v>

861
00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's always been around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the stuff I'm seeing on campus</v>

862
00:34:56.701 --> 00:34:58.830
<v Speaker 2>now is what I saw in the 1980s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

863
00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.900
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that in the 1980s it could,</v>

864
00:35:00.901 --> 00:35:02.670
<v Speaker 2>it didn't get off campus because there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was no twitter.</v>

865
00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:03.481
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

866
00:35:03.481 --> 00:35:07.770
<v Speaker 2>So like this youtube video of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>students in Yale screaming at the dean,</v>

867
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:12.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>students at my college,</v>

868
00:35:12.511 --> 00:35:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Antioch College in Ohio took a shit on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the desk of the president.</v>

869
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:23.280
<v Speaker 2>They broke into his office at night and</v>
<v Speaker 2>do wrong and we call them all kinds of</v>

870
00:35:23.281 --> 00:35:23.881
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

871
00:35:23.881 --> 00:35:26.760
<v Speaker 2>we thought he was the great oppressor</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause there was no oppressor around.</v>

872
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:29.190
<v Speaker 2>So we had to create one and he was at</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor guy.</v>

873
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:33.240
<v Speaker 2>So this Occidental God that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to kick out the,</v>

874
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.530
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dean,</v>

875
00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:35.663
<v Speaker 2>the president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

876
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:36.580
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they,</v>

877
00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 3>what they want to replace him with</v>

878
00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.330
<v Speaker 1>a trans black woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great question.</v>

879
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Gender Queer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that has been raised a few times.</v>

880
00:35:44.731 --> 00:35:46.680
<v Speaker 1>So who do you think you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to replace him?</v>

881
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Like who is there out there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who will be better for you?</v>

882
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

883
00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.460
<v Speaker 1>they have at least a list of offenses</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's committed.</v>

884
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Other than not having a black studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>class or program,</v>

885
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a list of demands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go online and see them.</v>

886
00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Those are demands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not necessarily grievances.</v>

887
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.270
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unclear what the specific</v>

888
00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:10.380
<v Speaker 1>grievances are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

889
00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:12.400
<v Speaker 1>and who gets to vote on these demands</v>
<v Speaker 1>too?</v>

890
00:36:12.401 --> 00:36:14.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a small tiny shell group?</v>

891
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the faculty has power over curricular</v>

892
00:36:18.361 --> 00:36:22.950
<v Speaker 1>issues and then administrative issues or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president in his office as basically</v>

893
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.630
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

894
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:29.490
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of embarrassing to talk about</v>

895
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:32.100
<v Speaker 1>this stuff because it's so ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I am a part of it,</v>

896
00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel embarrassed to be associated with</v>

897
00:36:34.021 --> 00:36:35.010
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

898
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that moment when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

899
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.840
<v Speaker 1>there was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pepper spray incident on,</v>

900
00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.591
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

901
00:36:40.591 --> 00:36:42.480
<v Speaker 1>I forget what campus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uc Davis.</v>

902
00:36:42.481 --> 00:36:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

903
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:46.740
<v Speaker 1>they pepper sprayed those kids that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there peacefully on their knees</v>

904
00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:50.550
<v Speaker 1>and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were protesting the raising of</v>

905
00:36:50.551 --> 00:36:53.550
<v Speaker 1>tuition and they wouldn't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these cops,</v>

906
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.950
<v Speaker 1>this cop pepper sprays him in the face</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

907
00:36:55.951 --> 00:36:57.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after all the commotion settled,</v>

908
00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.510
<v Speaker 1>was it the dean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is that what it was the woman who</v>

909
00:37:00.511 --> 00:37:03.930
<v Speaker 1>left and no one said a word as she</v>
<v Speaker 1>walked by.</v>

910
00:37:03.931 --> 00:37:08.931
<v Speaker 1>It was totally eerily silent and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a powerful statement,</v>

911
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:14.280
<v Speaker 1>a real powerful statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of screaming at her instead of</v>

912
00:37:14.281 --> 00:37:15.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you called the police on this,</v>

913
00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:16.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what's happened.</v>

914
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:20.310
<v Speaker 1>The pepper spray kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one said a word and this woman walked</v>

915
00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:24.300
<v Speaker 1>and she was being escorted to our car</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just dead silence.</v>

916
00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:27.270
<v Speaker 1>So how do you interpret that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just insanely powerful.</v>

917
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.470
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a real,</v>

918
00:37:28.471 --> 00:37:30.240
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was palpable.</v>

919
00:37:30.241 --> 00:37:32.460
<v Speaker 1>You could see like first of all it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>shame.</v>

920
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:36.450
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was like shameful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what that cop did was shameful.</v>

921
00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:40.080
<v Speaker 1>What the kids were doing was pro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a legit protest.</v>

922
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Like you're charging too much for</v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

923
00:37:41.701 --> 00:37:43.620
<v Speaker 1>you raising the rate that's a legit</v>
<v Speaker 1>protest.</v>

924
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:48.180
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that they were pepper</v>
<v Speaker 1>sprayed for doing that and by some</v>

925
00:37:48.181 --> 00:37:53.181
<v Speaker 1>fucking asshole cop spraying chemicals</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the face of these kids and then this</v>

926
00:37:54.931 --> 00:37:59.931
<v Speaker 1>woman leaving in total silence debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was a response to a real</v>

927
00:38:01.201 --> 00:38:02.670
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some,</v>

928
00:38:02.671 --> 00:38:05.240
<v Speaker 1>something real happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something real went down.</v>

929
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:08.070
<v Speaker 1>It was really like a cultural tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

930
00:38:08.071 --> 00:38:09.390
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>microaggressions are real.</v>

931
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

932
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I've seen these huge websites that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of document specific microaggressions</v>

933
00:38:14.521 --> 00:38:17.370
<v Speaker 1>that have happened in all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>campuses and I all sounds believable to</v>

934
00:38:17.371 --> 00:38:17.580
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

935
00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's all happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

936
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.000
<v Speaker 1>where are you from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you,</v>

937
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.430
<v Speaker 1>what are you really that was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>dicky people?</v>

938
00:38:23.431 --> 00:38:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Are you an athlete?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's all true.</v>

939
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is how do you,</v>

940
00:38:27.511 --> 00:38:29.840
<v Speaker 1>how should you feel about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

941
00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:30.810
<v Speaker 1>And my war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John mcwhorter,</v>

942
00:38:30.811 --> 00:38:35.811
<v Speaker 1>his argument is by you have a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has that you have a choice,</v>

943
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

944
00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:40.120
<v Speaker 1>you can choose to be damaged by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think these kids really do feel</v>

945
00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:45.121
<v Speaker 1>damaged by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can think this is a parochial</v>

946
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:48.190
<v Speaker 1>knucklehead who said this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should I care?</v>

947
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does idiot thanks.</v>

948
00:38:49.571 --> 00:38:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is a quarters attitude,</v>

949
00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:53.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was at rutgers or whatever it</v>

950
00:38:53.171 --> 00:38:53.891
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just like,</v>

951
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:54.611
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he found,</v>

952
00:38:54.611 --> 00:38:58.960
<v Speaker 1>he came across some actual racists who</v>
<v Speaker 1>said things to him and he thought they</v>

953
00:38:58.961 --> 00:38:59.794
<v Speaker 1>were inferior.</v>

954
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.810
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why the what they should be</v>

955
00:39:01.811 --> 00:39:03.790
<v Speaker 1>thinking now about people who say these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

956
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.230
<v Speaker 1>you're an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

957
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

958
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:11.110
<v Speaker 1>they're making themselves damaged and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

959
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.870
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't rise to the level of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>tuition.</v>

960
00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your scholarship being cut,</v>

961
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:17.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your financial aid being taken away.</v>

962
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:21.880
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't rise to the level of a cop</v>
<v Speaker 1>spraying you in the face with pepper</v>

963
00:39:21.881 --> 00:39:23.140
<v Speaker 1>spray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

964
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Those things are real grievances that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be dealt with.</v>

965
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I think an extreme ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting that that was the response.</v>

966
00:39:31.871 --> 00:39:36.871
<v Speaker 1>Like in a real situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody just just stayed quiet.</v>

967
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.360
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this eerie silence as this woman left,</v>

968
00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a real protest like that that</v>

969
00:39:42.971 --> 00:39:46.000
<v Speaker 1>like rang out like you've watched that</v>
<v Speaker 1>video to this day and it's fucking</v>

970
00:39:46.001 --> 00:39:47.140
<v Speaker 1>creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen it?</v>

971
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't recall the woman walking way.</v>

972
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:51.590
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the video of the video pepper</v>
<v Speaker 1>spray.</v>

973
00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pepper spray videos.</v>

974
00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is really kind of powerful when</v>

975
00:39:56.021 --> 00:39:59.620
<v Speaker 1>the woman's leaving and she's being</v>
<v Speaker 1>escorted out.</v>

976
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:01.330
<v Speaker 1>No one says a fucking word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

977
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:05.020
<v Speaker 1>there's a thousand people out there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one says a word that can be</v>

978
00:40:05.021 --> 00:40:05.854
<v Speaker 1>effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

979
00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that process was effective.</v>

980
00:40:07.871 --> 00:40:10.600
<v Speaker 1>It was because there was a video that</v>
<v Speaker 1>went out on social media and everyone</v>

981
00:40:10.601 --> 00:40:11.434
<v Speaker 1>saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

982
00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:13.090
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the moment,</v>

983
00:40:13.091 --> 00:40:14.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it was effective for everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was there.</v>

984
00:40:14.891 --> 00:40:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And I think leaving her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

985
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.480
<v Speaker 1>I think fucking shit up as effective to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

986
00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:20.261
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at you.</v>

987
00:40:20.261 --> 00:40:21.190
<v Speaker 1>You anarchist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

988
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.430
<v Speaker 1>There's no question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you like to fuck things up?</v>

989
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you look at the history of</v>

990
00:40:26.201 --> 00:40:29.620
<v Speaker 1>riots in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see tremendous social progress</v>

991
00:40:29.621 --> 00:40:31.950
<v Speaker 1>immediately following them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're pro riot.</v>

992
00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.180
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uc Davis.</v>

993
00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not pro riot.</v>

994
00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

995
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.170
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

996
00:40:41.171 --> 00:40:42.430
<v Speaker 1>maybe I got to get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

997
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:43.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm already in trouble.</v>

998
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm already in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell No.</v>

999
00:40:47.171 --> 00:40:48.670
<v Speaker 1>It's true though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at sort of police</v>

1000
00:40:48.671 --> 00:40:49.504
<v Speaker 1>brutality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1001
00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Most riots in this country have been in</v>
<v Speaker 1>response to police brutality.</v>

1002
00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:55.420
<v Speaker 1>And you look at the cities in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights have happened since the 1930s you</v>

1003
00:40:55.421 --> 00:40:57.580
<v Speaker 1>will see a decline in police brutality</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those cities,</v>

1004
00:40:57.581 --> 00:40:59.410
<v Speaker 1>almost across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost in every case,</v>

1005
00:40:59.411 --> 00:41:00.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just in Baltimore.</v>

1006
00:41:00.551 --> 00:41:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right after those riots,</v>

1007
00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:05.050
<v Speaker 1>those cops were indicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they may get off,</v>

1008
00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.610
<v Speaker 1>but they were indicted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a rare thing for call.</v>

1009
00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's put the headphones on so you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear this</v>

1010
00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:16.530
<v Speaker 1>cause it's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's leaving and there's fucking</v>

1011
00:41:22.721 --> 00:41:25.270
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people there and no one's</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying a word or,</v>

1012
00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.310
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do remember this.</v>

1013
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 1>So creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just dead quiet.</v>

1014
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.440
<v Speaker 1>No one's talked to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're protesting her.</v>

1015
00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1016
00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well she was the one that called the</v>

1017
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:39.194
<v Speaker 1>cops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1018
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.810
<v Speaker 1>On these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these students and had them pepper</v>

1019
00:41:41.811 --> 00:41:45.500
<v Speaker 1>sprayed in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she has this long walk of shame</v>

1020
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:52.460
<v Speaker 1>and people are taking photographs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one's saying a word and it's</v>

1021
00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:56.410
<v Speaker 1>really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you know the story behind us,</v>

1022
00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.410
<v Speaker 1>even more intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1023
00:41:57.411 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 1>this sauce for quite a while and no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>says anything and did,</v>

1024
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:03.680
<v Speaker 1>did she resign or was she fired?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

1025
00:42:03.681 --> 00:42:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be,</v>

1026
00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.010
<v Speaker 1>that's the question to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to answer,</v>

1027
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:07.701
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1028
00:42:07.701 --> 00:42:08.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1029
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this video got out and I'm sure this</v>

1030
00:42:12.501 --> 00:42:16.610
<v Speaker 1>whole scenario was brutally stressful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it had a cost,</v>

1031
00:42:16.611 --> 00:42:19.700
<v Speaker 1>some form of change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1032
00:42:19.701 --> 00:42:20.780
<v Speaker 1>it definitely did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1033
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:23.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she suffered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1034
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:27.350
<v Speaker 1>but I know that Uc Davis Institute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the cop was fired.</v>

1035
00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1036
00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.600
<v Speaker 1>was threatened in that guy's life was</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely right.</v>

1037
00:42:31.601 --> 00:42:35.510
<v Speaker 1>And you can be sure that it's less</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely for a protester at that campus to</v>

1038
00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:38.890
<v Speaker 1>get pepper sprayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>source it for just sitting there.</v>

1039
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's disgusting.</v>

1040
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:44.240
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to do stuff like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people are dangerous and violent</v>

1041
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:47.300
<v Speaker 1>and that's supposed to do stuff that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids are just sitting down.</v>

1042
00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:51.380
<v Speaker 1>But in Los Angeles it is much safer even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though it's not safe,</v>

1043
00:42:51.381 --> 00:42:53.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's much safer for black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1044
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:58.580
<v Speaker 1>in dealing with the cops now than it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 1980s because of the 1992 riot.</v>

1045
00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.400
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the cops,</v>

1046
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:04.700
<v Speaker 1>the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lapd instituted wide ranging reforms and</v>

1047
00:43:04.701 --> 00:43:08.660
<v Speaker 1>you can ask anyone who's lived in la in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 80s and lives here now.</v>

1048
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge difference in the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cops deal with black people in this,</v>

1049
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.423
<v Speaker 1>in this city now.</v>

1050
00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:17.480
<v Speaker 1>And that was from one video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rodney king video and then the trial</v>

1051
00:43:17.481 --> 00:43:20.000
<v Speaker 1>in the subsequent acquittal of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>officers.</v>

1052
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:24.590
<v Speaker 1>And then from then what we're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with is the new wave of these videos</v>

1053
00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.140
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these videos,</v>

1054
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:31.070
<v Speaker 1>evidence of police brutality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's probably having an effect on</v>

1055
00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:33.620
<v Speaker 1>it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are much more aware of what they</v>

1056
00:43:33.621 --> 00:43:36.800
<v Speaker 1>do and what they don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There've been more indictments of cops</v>

1057
00:43:36.801 --> 00:43:41.801
<v Speaker 1>this year or this last year then I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever because of black lives matter and</v>

1058
00:43:41.961 --> 00:43:43.220
<v Speaker 1>social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt about it.</v>

1059
00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very effective.</v>

1060
00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:48.890
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have Bernie Sanders and Hillary</v>

1061
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Clinton and Martin and molly talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about police brutality constantly now.</v>

1062
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:55.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's clearly only because of black</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives matter.</v>

1063
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders didn't want to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1064
00:43:56.591 --> 00:43:59.840
<v Speaker 1>and until those kids got on the stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him in Seattle and shamed him and</v>

1065
00:43:59.841 --> 00:44:00.730
<v Speaker 1>yelled at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1066
00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.230
<v Speaker 1>And they were mocked for that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they were very effective in doing</v>

1067
00:44:03.231 --> 00:44:04.130
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1068
00:44:04.131 --> 00:44:06.710
<v Speaker 1>so the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders starts talking about</v>

1069
00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:09.980
<v Speaker 1>police brutality and the criminal</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice system and Hillary Clinton,</v>

1070
00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:11.810
<v Speaker 1>like a week or two later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts doing it too.</v>

1071
00:44:11.811 --> 00:44:13.730
<v Speaker 1>And ever since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't shut up about it.</v>

1072
00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a very effective,</v>

1073
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.980
<v Speaker 1>disruptive protest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They recognize that it's just up to a,</v>

1074
00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:21.680
<v Speaker 1>a powerful talking point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1075
00:44:21.681 --> 00:44:24.560
<v Speaker 1>they're forced to talk about it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've had these disruptive protests.</v>

1076
00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:25.683
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1077
00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.160
<v Speaker 1>so in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in favor of those kinds of</v>

1078
00:44:28.161 --> 00:44:32.730
<v Speaker 1>protests when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm in solidarity with the cause.</v>

1079
00:44:32.731 --> 00:44:33.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1080
00:44:33.391 --> 00:44:34.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a question of tactics.</v>

1081
00:44:34.711 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Like what does an effective tactic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1082
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:41.220
<v Speaker 1>And there's just no doubt that</v>
<v Speaker 1>disruptive protests and in many cases,</v>

1083
00:44:41.221 --> 00:44:43.950
<v Speaker 1>violent protests in the form of riots</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been very effective.</v>

1084
00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the future involves</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of institutions?</v>

1085
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:54.750
<v Speaker 1>He's longstanding institutions like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanford and Harvard and Yale?</v>

1086
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Or do you think that the future is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be something where people get their</v>

1087
00:44:59.101 --> 00:45:02.490
<v Speaker 1>education online more likely than not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1088
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I think the future is the university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start next year.</v>

1089
00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Alam it only part time,</v>

1090
00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:12.900
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm really doing this coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>year as launching a,</v>

1091
00:45:12.901 --> 00:45:16.830
<v Speaker 1>what I'm calling a renegade university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will be an online education set,</v>

1092
00:45:16.831 --> 00:45:19.110
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his lectures and interactive seminars.</v>

1093
00:45:19.111 --> 00:45:22.620
<v Speaker 1>For anyone who's interested in learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>about history and political philosophy,</v>

1094
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:25.350
<v Speaker 1>current events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at things through in a new way</v>

1095
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.090
<v Speaker 1>and you offer degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1096
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.520
<v Speaker 1>not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most people wouldn't be</v>

1097
00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:31.170
<v Speaker 1>interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is just for people who are</v>

1098
00:45:31.171 --> 00:45:32.880
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are just curious about the world,</v>

1099
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge demand for this in the</v>

1100
00:45:36.181 --> 00:45:39.750
<v Speaker 1>world and it's so expensive to colleges</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1101
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unaffordable for most people now or</v>

1102
00:45:41.851 --> 00:45:44.010
<v Speaker 1>many people now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1103
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:47.100
<v Speaker 1>and also you have to sort of enter this</v>
<v Speaker 1>loony bin as we know,</v>

1104
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.360
<v Speaker 1>to learn these things now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1105
00:45:48.361 --> 00:45:50.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are kind of bypassing</v>

1106
00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:53.820
<v Speaker 1>colleges and universities more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>through online education,</v>

1107
00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:56.940
<v Speaker 1>through podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through all these other media forms.</v>

1108
00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:01.350
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to offer sort of what I've</v>

1109
00:46:01.351 --> 00:46:06.351
<v Speaker 1>been teaching in my classes in colleges</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 20 years to anyone online for a tiny</v>

1110
00:46:07.141 --> 00:46:08.190
<v Speaker 1>fraction of the cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1111
00:46:08.191 --> 00:46:08.971
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1112
00:46:08.971 --> 00:46:13.971
<v Speaker 1>it's much cheaper to do this then for</v>
<v Speaker 1>them then to pay tuition at a Yale or</v>

1113
00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Occidental College.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1114
00:46:15.871 --> 00:46:18.120
<v Speaker 1>that sounds excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we're,</v>

1115
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:21.600
<v Speaker 1>we're in a unique time now where</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that is very appealing to</v>

1116
00:46:21.601 --> 00:46:24.150
<v Speaker 1>people because a lot of people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>

1117
00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

1118
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:27.360
<v Speaker 1>education is information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1119
00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.141
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1120
00:46:28.141 --> 00:46:29.400
<v Speaker 1>you're learning things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1121
00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:32.370
<v Speaker 1>you're taking in things and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>educating ourselves constantly.</v>

1122
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.880
<v Speaker 1>You're constantly educating yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>with articles and books and things,</v>

1123
00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:37.470
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentaries that you watch.</v>

1124
00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:39.450
<v Speaker 1>There's always information that's coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

1125
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:44.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just the idea is that to get an</v>
<v Speaker 1>education in air quotes,</v>

1126
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:48.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to go to a place and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to follow their rules and you have to</v>

1127
00:46:48.031 --> 00:46:50.610
<v Speaker 1>sit in the class with all these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are trying to do the same</v>

1128
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:52.740
<v Speaker 1>and you have to somehow or another do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1129
00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why that doesn't make sense to me</v>

1130
00:46:55.261 --> 00:46:56.730
<v Speaker 1>because you don't live your life like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1131
00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:57.361
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1132
00:46:57.361 --> 00:46:59.340
<v Speaker 1>your life is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't involve like,</v>

1133
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:03.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't go to a place and learn about</v>

1134
00:47:03.871 --> 00:47:06.570
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You live and you learn about people.</v>

1135
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:07.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1136
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of confining and archaic to</v>

1137
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.740
<v Speaker 1>have these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these institutions where you have to go</v>

1138
00:47:16.741 --> 00:47:21.741
<v Speaker 1>there and then the whole tenure process</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the politics of the staff and the</v>

1139
00:47:23.791 --> 00:47:27.900
<v Speaker 1>teaching and what can and can't be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the curriculum and who it does and</v>

1140
00:47:27.901 --> 00:47:29.070
<v Speaker 1>doesn't offend or appeal.</v>

1141
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's archaic.</v>

1142
00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:32.890
<v Speaker 1>It's actually medieval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1143
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:36.700
<v Speaker 1>the modern university is based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleges and universities in the mid,</v>

1144
00:47:36.701 --> 00:47:38.110
<v Speaker 1>in the Middle Ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools in the Middle Ages.</v>

1145
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.370
<v Speaker 1>What's the oldest running university</v>
<v Speaker 1>today in the United States?</v>

1146
00:47:42.371 --> 00:47:43.570
<v Speaker 1>It's Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1147
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.030
<v Speaker 1>when was that established?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1148
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:50.710
<v Speaker 1>s 17th century I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1149
00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1150
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbia,</v>

1151
00:47:54.191 --> 00:47:55.330
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1152
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1153
00:47:56.501 --> 00:47:57.790
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was it here?</v>

1154
00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:00.580
<v Speaker 1>1636,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1155
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Sane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is insane.</v>

1156
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1157
00:48:07.981 --> 00:48:11.480
<v Speaker 1>It's based on schools in middle ages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1158
00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's truly archaic.</v>

1159
00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a bizarre place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The modern college.</v>

1160
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bizarre,</v>

1161
00:48:17.201 --> 00:48:18.910
<v Speaker 1>bizarre place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other place like it.</v>

1162
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Some of that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1163
00:48:20.861 --> 00:48:22.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to have this space where you</v>

1164
00:48:22.931 --> 00:48:25.660
<v Speaker 1>can talk about ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that's happening less and</v>

1165
00:48:25.661 --> 00:48:28.240
<v Speaker 1>less in colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it good though for a lot of people</v>

1166
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:31.960
<v Speaker 1>to get away from their parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go someplace to be around other young</v>

1167
00:48:31.961 --> 00:48:34.510
<v Speaker 1>kids that are experiencing this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>new freedom for themselves.</v>

1168
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:39.750
<v Speaker 1>And then to be thrust into this is this</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of pressure cooker of ideas.</v>

1169
00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you have to go to college to get</v>

1170
00:48:42.251 --> 00:48:42.971
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1171
00:48:42.971 --> 00:48:45.370
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you're stuck with your parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what are you gonna do?</v>

1172
00:48:45.371 --> 00:48:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to get a job to pay your</v>
<v Speaker 1>rent this way?</v>

1173
00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:49.360
<v Speaker 1>You're in a dorm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1174
00:48:49.361 --> 00:48:49.871
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1175
00:48:49.871 --> 00:48:50.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you show up,</v>

1176
00:48:50.831 --> 00:48:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Brian Bell rings go to class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1177
00:48:53.231 --> 00:48:55.480
<v Speaker 1>like in the 1960s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just went to San Francisco</v>

1178
00:48:55.481 --> 00:48:56.111
<v Speaker 1>instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1179
00:48:56.111 --> 00:48:57.070
<v Speaker 1>And they just hung out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1180
00:48:57.071 --> 00:48:58.120
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1181
00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.340
<v Speaker 1>So good to San Francisco folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denver's the New San Francisco.</v>

1182
00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:02.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

1183
00:49:02.921 --> 00:49:03.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

1184
00:49:03.971 --> 00:49:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not San Francisco now,</v>

1185
00:49:05.051 --> 00:49:07.630
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but someplace San Francisco now you'll</v>

1186
00:49:07.631 --> 00:49:10.780
<v Speaker 1>be homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make more than less than $200,000</v>

1187
00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:11.770
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be homeless.</v>

1188
00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:14.490
<v Speaker 1>That's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joke either.</v>

1189
00:49:14.491 --> 00:49:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Now I know that place is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents just moved out of there.</v>

1190
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1191
00:49:19.811 --> 00:49:23.260
<v Speaker 1>so I mean it's making less and less</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to people.</v>

1192
00:49:23.261 --> 00:49:28.030
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at just economically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the price of a degree has</v>

1193
00:49:28.031 --> 00:49:33.031
<v Speaker 1>gone up and up and up and the value of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree has gone down and down and down</v>

1194
00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:34.720
<v Speaker 1>because everyone's got a college degree</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1195
00:49:34.721 --> 00:49:36.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like the new high school diploma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1196
00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:40.140
<v Speaker 1>As far as you returned to immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to get a job and doesn't.</v>

1197
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.601
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1198
00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:44.410
<v Speaker 1>so employers are looking at degrees as</v>
<v Speaker 1>being less and less valuable.</v>

1199
00:49:44.411 --> 00:49:47.020
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a clear bubble happening.</v>

1200
00:49:47.021 --> 00:49:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a real problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>economically.</v>

1201
00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe more importantly,</v>

1202
00:49:52.181 --> 00:49:54.550
<v Speaker 1>there's all these other ways to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff now,</v>

1203
00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly online,</v>

1204
00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:58.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cheap or free,</v>

1205
00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:03.310
<v Speaker 1>either formal online courses or just</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to podcasts or reading blogs</v>

1206
00:50:03.311 --> 00:50:04.810
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going on twitter.</v>

1207
00:50:04.811 --> 00:50:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I've said there's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really mean this,</v>

1208
00:50:07.781 --> 00:50:12.010
<v Speaker 1>there is more intellectual debate in one</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour of twitter.</v>

1209
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Then there was a four years of college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's far more conflict of</v>

1210
00:50:17.351 --> 00:50:22.000
<v Speaker 1>ideas on social media now than there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a college classroom because college</v>

1211
00:50:22.001 --> 00:50:26.260
<v Speaker 1>classrooms are dominated and have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>for decades by left liberals.</v>

1212
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>That's discourse that goes on</v>

1213
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.930
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear conservative ideas,</v>

1214
00:50:29.931 --> 00:50:33.860
<v Speaker 2>you don't hear libertarian ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even hear some radical left</v>

1215
00:50:33.861 --> 00:50:38.861
<v Speaker 2>wing ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this very narrow discourse that is</v>

1216
00:50:38.871 --> 00:50:41.210
<v Speaker 2>pretty much only allowed in the college</v>
<v Speaker 2>classroom.</v>

1217
00:50:41.211 --> 00:50:46.211
<v Speaker 2>And that's to me the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest problem with the modern</v>

1218
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:49.130
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no diversity of ideas.</v>

1219
00:50:49.131 --> 00:50:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's obsessed with diversity of</v>
<v Speaker 2>color,</v>

1220
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:54.580
<v Speaker 2>skin color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no one cares about a diversity,</v>

1221
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:59.800
<v Speaker 2>diversity of ideas about real debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want in my university to have a real</v>

1222
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:06.620
<v Speaker 2>debate about big ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want the best minds from conservatism</v>

1223
00:51:06.621 --> 00:51:11.330
<v Speaker 2>and liberalism and socialism and</v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism to have it out too.</v>

1224
00:51:11.331 --> 00:51:16.331
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about the big ideas and let's</v>
<v Speaker 2>go for it and have the best people argue</v>

1225
00:51:16.491 --> 00:51:18.530
<v Speaker 2>the points on their merits against each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

1226
00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:24.300
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that there's such a narrow</v>
<v Speaker 3>path of ideas that exists right now in</v>

1227
00:51:27.011 --> 00:51:29.310
<v Speaker 3>college?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's why is it just as tenured tenure?</v>

1228
00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:30.200
<v Speaker 3>Tenure?</v>

1229
00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1230
00:51:31.071 --> 00:51:35.900
<v Speaker 2>so what happened was conservatives</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically dominated colleges until the</v>

1231
00:51:35.901 --> 00:51:40.901
<v Speaker 2>1960s and then the 1960s generation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>radicals had nowhere to go when they</v>

1232
00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:46.790
<v Speaker 2>went into their twenties and thirties so</v>
<v Speaker 2>they decided to move into the academy.</v>

1233
00:51:46.791 --> 00:51:50.300
<v Speaker 2>So they all got phds and they became</v>
<v Speaker 2>professors and they've dominated ever</v>

1234
00:51:50.301 --> 00:51:54.050
<v Speaker 2>since.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also this system of tenure and</v>

1235
00:51:54.051 --> 00:51:56.180
<v Speaker 2>universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is supposed to protect academic</v>

1236
00:51:56.181 --> 00:51:59.000
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what it actually does is it enforces</v>

1237
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:01.100
<v Speaker 2>intellectual conformity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1238
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Because you have a lifetime appointment</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you die and you control hiring,</v>

1239
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:07.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The faculty controls hiring.</v>

1240
00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are you going to hire?</v>

1241
00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:10.640
<v Speaker 2>You're going to hire somebody who agrees</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you,</v>

1242
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:13.360
<v Speaker 2>who says what you think should be said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1243
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:16.370
<v Speaker 2>so that's the problem with tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1244
00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:21.050
<v Speaker 2>It sort of protects academic freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mostly it enforces intellectual</v>

1245
00:52:21.051 --> 00:52:24.520
<v Speaker 2>conformity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's disturbing.</v>

1246
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.760
<v Speaker 2>It's disturbing because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a priesthood.</v>

1247
00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a way,</v>

1248
00:52:28.811 --> 00:52:29.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1249
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1250
00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:32.980
<v Speaker 2>you're a priest for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And who are you going to recruit into</v>

1251
00:52:32.981 --> 00:52:35.200
<v Speaker 2>the priesthood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A true believer.</v>

1252
00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:36.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1253
00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:39.320
<v Speaker 3>That's what goes on in universities with</v>
<v Speaker 3>faculty hiring.</v>

1254
00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.320
<v Speaker 3>So if you have 10 year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's essentially no way you can get</v>

1255
00:52:42.321 --> 00:52:45.440
<v Speaker 3>fired on this radical crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to rape a student or you have</v>

1256
00:52:45.441 --> 00:52:47.600
<v Speaker 3>to be schizophrenia or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1257
00:52:47.601 --> 00:52:50.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems kind of ridiculous as well</v>

1258
00:52:50.361 --> 00:52:53.360
<v Speaker 3>because like what if someone starts</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting out poor work?</v>

1259
00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.400
<v Speaker 3>Like A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's perfect example.</v>

1260
00:52:55.401 --> 00:52:58.040
<v Speaker 3>A guy who has tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is at the University of California</v>

1261
00:52:58.041 --> 00:53:00.020
<v Speaker 3>Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm that guy,</v>

1262
00:53:00.021 --> 00:53:00.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

1263
00:53:00.921 --> 00:53:03.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believes that a Duesberg Peter Duesberg,</v>

1264
00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:05.630
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had him on the podcast before and</v>

1265
00:53:05.631 --> 00:53:08.360
<v Speaker 3>it was probably the most hate I ever got</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

1266
00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:11.720
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got this radical idea that aids is</v>

1267
00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:13.030
<v Speaker 3>not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1268
00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:17.090
<v Speaker 3>it's not a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's caused by HIV and that HIV is a</v>

1269
00:53:17.091 --> 00:53:19.400
<v Speaker 3>weak virus and HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1270
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:21.980
<v Speaker 3>exist in these people because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>already have a compromised immune</v>

1271
00:53:21.981 --> 00:53:24.980
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that what's really going on is they</v>

1272
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.950
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1273
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.050
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're taking recreational drugs and</v>

1274
00:53:28.051 --> 00:53:31.740
<v Speaker 3>partying and depleting their immune</v>
<v Speaker 3>system to the point where HIV can</v>

1275
00:53:31.741 --> 00:53:34.440
<v Speaker 3>actually show up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that HIV is not the cause of aids,</v>

1276
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:38.190
<v Speaker 3>but it's just the symptom of a depleted</v>
<v Speaker 3>immune system.</v>

1277
00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:42.000
<v Speaker 3>But he's a fucking professor of biology</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the University of California,</v>

1278
00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:45.600
<v Speaker 3>Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's widely hated by AIDS</v>

1279
00:53:45.601 --> 00:53:48.960
<v Speaker 3>researchers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people who understand HIV at a</v>

1280
00:53:48.961 --> 00:53:52.260
<v Speaker 3>deeper level and they think he's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking moron and what he's doing is</v>

1281
00:53:52.261 --> 00:53:53.580
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile,</v>

1282
00:53:53.581 --> 00:53:54.414
<v Speaker 3>he has tenure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1283
00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:56.290
<v Speaker 2>So let them have it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1284
00:53:56.291 --> 00:53:58.390
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's reviled by the profession.</v>

1285
00:53:58.391 --> 00:53:59.800
<v Speaker 2>So what's the problem here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1286
00:53:59.801 --> 00:54:03.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let him have it out with his opponents.</v>

1287
00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:04.800
<v Speaker 2>Let them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them argue this.</v>

1288
00:54:04.801 --> 00:54:06.070
<v Speaker 2>And they won't even argue with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1289
00:54:06.071 --> 00:54:08.110
<v Speaker 2>because it's like arguing with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holocaust denier.</v>

1290
00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:12.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get on a day with a Holocaust</v>

1291
00:54:12.041 --> 00:54:14.320
<v Speaker 2>denier and you start debating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1292
00:54:14.321 --> 00:54:17.230
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're giving him merit by just being</v>

1293
00:54:17.231 --> 00:54:19.420
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the market should decide.</v>

1294
00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:20.710
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1295
00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Meaning the students should decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1296
00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the students,</v>

1297
00:54:24.181 --> 00:54:26.800
<v Speaker 2>let's do the broad student body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who might go to college,</v>

1298
00:54:26.801 --> 00:54:28.570
<v Speaker 2>who might take his class should decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1299
00:54:28.571 --> 00:54:30.520
<v Speaker 2>They don't get to decide though because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has tenure.</v>

1300
00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:33.670
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He removes it from market forces.</v>

1301
00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:34.601
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1302
00:54:34.601 --> 00:54:36.040
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if the students decided,</v>

1303
00:54:36.041 --> 00:54:37.420
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1304
00:54:37.421 --> 00:54:41.620
<v Speaker 2>the students are trying to get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president of Occidental for no</v>

1305
00:54:41.621 --> 00:54:42.730
<v Speaker 2>fucking reason at all.</v>

1306
00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.800
<v Speaker 2>The market often does things we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1307
00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:48.070
<v Speaker 2>but the market should be able to do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

1308
00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1309
00:54:49.871 --> 00:54:51.880
<v Speaker 2>So they'll be able to kick out of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the market is.</v>

1310
00:54:51.881 --> 00:54:53.080
<v Speaker 2>The market learns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1311
00:54:53.081 --> 00:54:54.730
<v Speaker 2>So at Occidental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would kick out,</v>

1312
00:54:54.731 --> 00:54:57.010
<v Speaker 2>if they were had their way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would kick out the president and he</v>

1313
00:54:57.011 --> 00:55:01.390
<v Speaker 2>would be replaced by someone who is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>as bad or some or worse,</v>

1314
00:55:01.391 --> 00:55:05.020
<v Speaker 2>someone like them or slightly better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if someone that maybe they would look</v>

1315
00:55:05.021 --> 00:55:06.430
<v Speaker 2>out and they would find someone just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like them.</v>

1316
00:55:06.431 --> 00:55:10.180
<v Speaker 2>But that seems impossible because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president of a college has to keep the</v>

1317
00:55:10.181 --> 00:55:12.590
<v Speaker 2>place afloat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1318
00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:14.410
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1319
00:55:14.411 --> 00:55:17.680
<v Speaker 2>So they have fiscal responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have taken in consideration fiscal</v>

1320
00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:18.940
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1321
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.920
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why was 10 you're created in the first</v>

1322
00:55:20.921 --> 00:55:21.754
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the idea?</v>

1323
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Protect academic freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1324
00:55:23.651 --> 00:55:26.170
<v Speaker 2>To allow us to say what we want in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>classroom.</v>

1325
00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Free from fear of being fired by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>

1326
00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.420
<v Speaker 2>And when was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when was it an institute?</v>

1327
00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:32.770
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1328
00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.230
<v Speaker 2>it's ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's system,</v>

1329
00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:40.000
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't really fucked until the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties that's when,</v>

1330
00:55:40.001 --> 00:55:40.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always been fucked.</v>

1331
00:55:40.901 --> 00:55:41.460
<v Speaker 2>It's always been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1332
00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:42.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

1333
00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:47.640
<v Speaker 2>in the 1920s and thirties and forties</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 50s the schools were dominated by,</v>

1334
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:49.650
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1335
00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:52.150
<v Speaker 2>straight white male elites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1336
00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Wealthy people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1337
00:55:53.381 --> 00:55:55.120
<v Speaker 2>And they had a very narrow discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two,</v>

1338
00:55:55.121 --> 00:55:57.010
<v Speaker 2>it was just a very different one than</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're taught now.</v>

1339
00:55:57.070 --> 00:55:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they were protected from market</v>

1340
00:55:59.171 --> 00:56:00.550
<v Speaker 2>forces as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1341
00:56:00.551 --> 00:56:02.980
<v Speaker 2>And there was no intellectual diversity</v>
<v Speaker 2>there either.</v>

1342
00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just as bad.</v>

1343
00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:06.580
<v Speaker 2>It's just a different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a different discourse.</v>

1344
00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:09.900
<v Speaker 2>So the problem is tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1345
00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:11.260
<v Speaker 2>the heart of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1346
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also,</v>

1347
00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:17.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just this huge generation,</v>

1348
00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:21.640
<v Speaker 2>which I belong to have scholars with</v>
<v Speaker 2>phds who are very good teachers and very</v>

1349
00:56:21.641 --> 00:56:24.250
<v Speaker 2>good scholars who can't get jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this tremendous</v>

1350
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:26.620
<v Speaker 1>overproduction of phds in the last 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1351
00:56:26.621 --> 00:56:27.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Enough.</v>

1352
00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.330
<v Speaker 1>And not a lot of jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to have more churn.</v>

1353
00:56:31.331 --> 00:56:33.430
<v Speaker 1>We have to have more turnover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to have people.</v>

1354
00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:36.490
<v Speaker 1>There's all these people who are much</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than tenured professors out there</v>

1355
00:56:36.491 --> 00:56:40.300
<v Speaker 1>who can't teach and can't have solid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secure jobs.</v>

1356
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:44.170
<v Speaker 1>We have to eliminate tenure to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>these places better.</v>

1357
00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:49.180
<v Speaker 1>So because of 10 year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting people that establish</v>

1358
00:56:49.181 --> 00:56:51.190
<v Speaker 1>that position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then like here's a perfect example.</v>

1359
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:53.680
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the people that was talking about</v>

1360
00:56:53.681 --> 00:56:56.290
<v Speaker 1>the woman in Missouri that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1361
00:56:56.291 --> 00:56:59.530
<v Speaker 1>was calling for muscle and Melissa</v>
<v Speaker 1>Click,</v>

1362
00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:00.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is their name.</v>

1363
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:05.200
<v Speaker 1>W W it was this insane video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's telling some young man he couldn't</v>

1364
00:57:05.201 --> 00:57:07.460
<v Speaker 1>be there in a public place taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs.</v>

1365
00:57:07.461 --> 00:57:08.650
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually I can,</v>

1366
00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:12.100
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she calls for muscle to get this guy</v>

1367
00:57:12.101 --> 00:57:12.850
<v Speaker 1>kicked out of there.</v>

1368
00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:15.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just like insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1369
00:57:15.191 --> 00:57:18.410
<v Speaker 1>one of the criticisms was by this guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a,</v>

1370
00:57:18.411 --> 00:57:21.520
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a professor and he said that her mistake</v>

1371
00:57:21.521 --> 00:57:23.560
<v Speaker 1>was that she did this before she got</v>
<v Speaker 1>tenure.</v>

1372
00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:26.170
<v Speaker 1>We wait until you get tenure and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shake things up.</v>

1373
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:27.004
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1374
00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:27.941
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1375
00:57:27.941 --> 00:57:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Her mistake was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I get some muscle to take us to not</v>

1376
00:57:32.471 --> 00:57:33.670
<v Speaker 1>only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman,</v>

1377
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:34.680
<v Speaker 1>same woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1378
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:38.290
<v Speaker 1>just a day before was calling for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>media to cover this event.</v>

1379
00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.570
<v Speaker 1>And she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's a professor of communications.</v>

1380
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is the whole thing is the whole</v>

1381
00:57:43.151 --> 00:57:44.460
<v Speaker 1>thing is just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1382
00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:48.850
<v Speaker 1>But it's this detachment from objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasoning,</v>

1383
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:53.880
<v Speaker 1>this complete detachment and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this insistence on staying within this,</v>

1384
00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:59.940
<v Speaker 1>this idea that they're enforcing of safe</v>
<v Speaker 1>spaces have a intolerance to anyone with</v>

1385
00:58:01.661 --> 00:58:02.494
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1386
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:05.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions other than what they're trying</v>

1387
00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:09.040
<v Speaker 1>to conform and what they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enforce on these kids.</v>

1388
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that Melissa Click</v>

1389
00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:16.620
<v Speaker 1>believed that those students protesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the tents on that quad were being</v>

1390
00:58:17.471 --> 00:58:20.110
<v Speaker 1>harmed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been harmed and were being harmed,</v>

1391
00:58:20.111 --> 00:58:25.111
<v Speaker 1>were actively being oprah test by racism</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that campus and they needed to be</v>

1392
00:58:25.121 --> 00:58:27.460
<v Speaker 1>protected from that harm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1393
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.070
<v Speaker 1>what actually happened on the University</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Missouri campus,</v>

1394
00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:34.000
<v Speaker 1>allegedly two people use the word nigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a six month period.</v>

1395
00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.060
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not,</v>

1396
00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:38.620
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't even been proven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

1397
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Are these two people that did it well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who no one knows.</v>

1398
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like it's in the air to two</v>

1399
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:49.150
<v Speaker 1>students claimed to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two students claimed that they were</v>

1400
00:58:49.151 --> 00:58:50.440
<v Speaker 1>called nigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

1401
00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:51.670
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1402
00:58:51.671 --> 00:58:55.150
<v Speaker 1>With no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no descriptions of,</v>

1403
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:57.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this could have happened,</v>

1404
00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.130
<v Speaker 1>it should have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one else could have happened.</v>

1405
00:59:00.131 --> 00:59:01.270
<v Speaker 1>This is a part of the problem.</v>

1406
00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Kids make shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always have,</v>

1407
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:06.850
<v Speaker 1>especially to enforce that victim</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality.</v>

1408
00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we reward victims.</v>

1409
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the cultural problem.</v>

1410
00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:17.560
<v Speaker 1>There's a recreational victim mentality</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going on where people are looking</v>

1411
00:59:17.561 --> 00:59:20.980
<v Speaker 1>for reasons why they were victims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1412
00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.340
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that situation,</v>

1413
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:27.260
<v Speaker 1>you've got a hunger strike or two people</v>
<v Speaker 1>using that word over six months.</v>

1414
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a hunger strike.</v>

1415
00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a demand to be treated like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

1416
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a demand for more paternalism.</v>

1417
00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protect me.</v>

1418
00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm a victim or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleanse this area of all it's impure</v>

1419
00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:44.060
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1420
00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.460
<v Speaker 1>And make it into like a playpen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1421
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:48.380
<v Speaker 1>making it into a safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1422
00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Well I play then they play pens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They Brown.</v>

1423
00:59:51.071 --> 00:59:52.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a bouncy house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1424
00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:54.710
<v Speaker 1>We'll at Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know about the safe spaces of Brown,</v>

1425
00:59:54.711 --> 00:59:55.580
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>University.</v>

1426
00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:56.870
<v Speaker 1>What have they done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1427
00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christina Hoff summers talked about it</v>

1428
00:59:59.361 --> 00:59:59.890
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1429
00:59:59.890 --> 01:00:00.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1430
01:00:00.441 --> 01:00:01.580
<v Speaker 1>for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

1431
01:00:01.581 --> 01:00:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They created a safe space that had like</v>

1432
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:07.130
<v Speaker 1>coloring books for students to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of video.</v>

1433
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:09.920
<v Speaker 1>If the idea is they heard were too</v>
<v Speaker 1>troubling for them.</v>

1434
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Videos of puppies and videos of puppies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1435
01:00:12.051 --> 01:00:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she said these are allegations,</v>

1436
01:00:14.061 --> 01:00:14.810
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1437
01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:16.760
<v Speaker 1>I believe it to some extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1438
01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:21.200
<v Speaker 1>And that was because of a woman who's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist coming on to talk about the</v>

1439
01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:26.201
<v Speaker 1>problems with using incorrect data and</v>
<v Speaker 1>biased studies to reinforce ideas that</v>

1440
01:00:28.131 --> 01:00:30.530
<v Speaker 1>may or may not be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which she believes damage actual</v>

1441
01:00:30.531 --> 01:00:31.520
<v Speaker 1>feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1442
01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.390
<v Speaker 1>so before we continue to trash the</v>
<v Speaker 1>students too much,</v>

1443
01:00:35.391 --> 01:00:38.690
<v Speaker 1>I have to say this all this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything we've said is completely true</v>

1444
01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>and I agree with you on all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1445
01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>I've been teaching for 20 years for</v>
<v Speaker 1>different colleges,</v>

1446
01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:47.030
<v Speaker 1>elite schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both coasts.</v>

1447
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:50.930
<v Speaker 1>This is a minority of college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Students were talking about,</v>

1448
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.660
<v Speaker 1>this is not most of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a vocal minors is not most of them.</v>

1449
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.630
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fairly small minority.</v>

1450
01:00:56.770 --> 01:00:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of my students,</v>

1451
01:00:58.101 --> 01:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have not been like this at all.</v>

1452
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.450
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them are pretty disdainful of</v>

1453
01:01:02.451 --> 01:01:04.790
<v Speaker 1>this kind of stuff and just want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>

1454
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of kids today also because</v>

1455
01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:10.280
<v Speaker 1>of social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they get to watch videos of all</v>

1456
01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:13.880
<v Speaker 1>this nonsense going on at Yale and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this craziness going on in Missouri,</v>

1457
01:01:13.881 --> 01:01:16.850
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get to read blogs about it and they</v>

1458
01:01:16.851 --> 01:01:21.170
<v Speaker 1>get to participate in conversations on</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media.</v>

1459
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:24.140
<v Speaker 1>They're understanding how stupid at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there understanding that you're</v>

1460
01:01:24.141 --> 01:01:28.340
<v Speaker 1>dealing with a bunch of fucking babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's probably some pushback in</v>

1461
01:01:28.341 --> 01:01:30.230
<v Speaker 1>that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's been,</v>

1462
01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.870
<v Speaker 1>I keep saying the most troubling thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

1463
01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:38.240
<v Speaker 1>one of the most troubling things to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the faculty have been mostly</v>

1464
01:01:38.241 --> 01:01:39.440
<v Speaker 1>silent about this.</v>

1465
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:42.350
<v Speaker 1>And it seems worse than that if the</v>
<v Speaker 1>faculty's trying to,</v>

1466
01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some or some sort of mechanism summer,</v>

1467
01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:48.650
<v Speaker 1>some of them are egging them on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most I would say,</v>

1468
01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>just aren't saying anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm talking about tenured senior</v>

1469
01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:55.370
<v Speaker 1>faculty with lifetime job security or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not saying anything.</v>

1470
01:01:55.371 --> 01:01:58.790
<v Speaker 1>And I know many of them have</v>
<v Speaker 1>reservations about what's going on,</v>

1471
01:01:58.791 --> 01:02:01.610
<v Speaker 1>but they won't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really infuriating.</v>

1472
01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't quite explain it except that</v>

1473
01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:08.930
<v Speaker 1>they're just cowards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a terrible thing,</v>

1474
01:02:08.931 --> 01:02:09.261
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1475
01:02:09.261 --> 01:02:12.470
<v Speaker 1>because the idea is these kids are</v>
<v Speaker 1>espousing,</v>

1476
01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.360
<v Speaker 1>they've gotten from the classrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1477
01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:16.640
<v Speaker 1>They've gotten from these faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1478
01:02:16.641 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>don't you want to take back your ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>or try to teach these kids?</v>

1479
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that what we're here for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1480
01:02:22.590 --> 01:02:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1481
01:02:23.791 --> 01:02:26.880
<v Speaker 2>Discourse can be violent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean we should</v>

1482
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.670
<v Speaker 2>eliminate free speech because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1483
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that intervention is not being made by</v>

1484
01:02:31.861 --> 01:02:34.140
<v Speaker 2>faculty though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hearing that being said,</v>

1485
01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:35.850
<v Speaker 2>not publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not on campuses,</v>

1486
01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.750
<v Speaker 2>but that's where it gets confusing</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if the faculty does have tenure,</v>

1487
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.700
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't they want to express</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves?</v>

1488
01:02:41.701 --> 01:02:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't have to worry about</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting fired.</v>

1489
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Like don't you see the problems with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of thinking in this kind of</v>

1490
01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:51.830
<v Speaker 2>enforcing this very rigid idea of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can and can't say or who you are and</v>

1491
01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:56.070
<v Speaker 2>how you behave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the worst thing that can happen to a</v>

1492
01:02:56.071 --> 01:02:59.400
<v Speaker 2>white liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know this is to be called a</v>

1493
01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:02.070
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst thing that can happen</v>

1494
01:03:02.071 --> 01:03:03.410
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1495
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Maybe worse than losing your job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1496
01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:06.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1497
01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Being called a racist and having people</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it.</v>

1498
01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:13.020
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a terrifying prospect for a white</v>

1499
01:03:13.021 --> 01:03:15.090
<v Speaker 2>liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrifying.</v>

1500
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:20.480
<v Speaker 2>So they'll do anything to avoid that</v>
<v Speaker 2>being called a sexist wouldn't be so hot</v>

1501
01:03:21.211 --> 01:03:22.790
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But being called a racist is,</v>

1502
01:03:22.791 --> 01:03:25.280
<v Speaker 2>it's worse than being a sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so wow.</v>

1503
01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's like trends phobic fall on that</v>

1504
01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:29.820
<v Speaker 2>list that's catching up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1505
01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:34.860
<v Speaker 2>That's moving up the list pretty fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It transphobic was weird because there's</v>

1506
01:03:34.861 --> 01:03:37.030
<v Speaker 2>so few transgender people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1507
01:03:37.031 --> 01:03:39.150
<v Speaker 2>the percentage of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender.</v>

1508
01:03:39.151 --> 01:03:43.140
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that that has caught so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much steam publicly because it's not</v>

1509
01:03:43.141 --> 01:03:47.580
<v Speaker 2>like you're responding to like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real issue that's happening.</v>

1510
01:03:47.581 --> 01:03:49.140
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1511
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:50.000
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1512
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:52.440
<v Speaker 2>a pet thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1513
01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.250
<v Speaker 2>to reinforce the Trans Movement is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is interesting.</v>

1514
01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:57.120
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1515
01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:02.010
<v Speaker 2>the Trans Movement started basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>after stonewall 1969,</v>

1516
01:04:02.011 --> 01:04:04.200
<v Speaker 2>1970s as part of the Gay Liberation</v>
<v Speaker 2>Movement.</v>

1517
01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:10.310
<v Speaker 2>And the thrust of that was leave us</v>
<v Speaker 2>alone and we don't care what you think</v>

1518
01:04:10.801 --> 01:04:11.634
<v Speaker 2>about us.</v>

1519
01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:13.740
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do whatever we want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1520
01:04:13.741 --> 01:04:15.390
<v Speaker 2>We're going to dress as women are</v>
<v Speaker 2>dressed as men.</v>

1521
01:04:15.391 --> 01:04:16.590
<v Speaker 2>We're going to behave it however we</v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

1522
01:04:16.591 --> 01:04:18.360
<v Speaker 2>We don't care what you think about us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1523
01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:21.540
<v Speaker 2>That's a very liberatory movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

1524
01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:23.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1525
01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.900
<v Speaker 2>They're my heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That generation,</v>

1526
01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:27.390
<v Speaker 2>and by the way route Paul is kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>descendant of them.</v>

1527
01:04:27.391 --> 01:04:28.860
<v Speaker 2>This is what he keeps saying over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>over again.</v>

1528
01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:30.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you call me a she or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>

1529
01:04:30.631 --> 01:04:31.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1530
01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do whatever I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you allowed to say he or is it she</v>

1531
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:36.870
<v Speaker 2>ru Paul says he doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says he,</v>

1532
01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.850
<v Speaker 2>he says he doesn't hit her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1533
01:04:38.851 --> 01:04:40.260
<v Speaker 2>you can call me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either he or she.</v>

1534
01:04:40.261 --> 01:04:41.670
<v Speaker 2>So you can't miss gender him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

1535
01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's free her.</v>

1536
01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.590
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.G ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>G.</v>

1537
01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:48.423
<v Speaker 2>G.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zay.</v>

1538
01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.480
<v Speaker 2>So now what you see a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not entirely,</v>

1539
01:04:51.481 --> 01:04:54.120
<v Speaker 2>but a lot among trans people is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1540
01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:57.840
<v Speaker 2>they're really concerned about what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think about them.</v>

1541
01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:02.100
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their primary concern is what we think</v>

1542
01:05:02.101 --> 01:05:03.090
<v Speaker 2>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1543
01:05:03.091 --> 01:05:05.550
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's asking for more</v>
<v Speaker 2>paternalism.</v>

1544
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.280
<v Speaker 2>It's giving us more power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1545
01:05:08.281 --> 01:05:13.281
<v Speaker 2>asking people too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you meet someone immediately ask,</v>

1546
01:05:13.831 --> 01:05:18.280
<v Speaker 2>what are your preferred gender pronouns?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen Steven crowder</v>

1547
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.170
<v Speaker 3>did a video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We applied that in real life.</v>

1548
01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.030
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking hilarious.</v>

1549
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.700
<v Speaker 3>He went out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys,</v>

1550
01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:29.260
<v Speaker 3>he something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went out all over the place and uh,</v>

1551
01:05:29.261 --> 01:05:32.680
<v Speaker 3>was asking people what their preferred</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender Pronoun would be.</v>

1552
01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.770
<v Speaker 3>The look that people gave him like in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real world,</v>

1553
01:05:35.771 --> 01:05:37.120
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

1554
01:05:37.121 --> 01:05:40.000
<v Speaker 3>Like over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's asking these people what their</v>

1555
01:05:40.001 --> 01:05:43.200
<v Speaker 3>preferred gender Pronoun would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How should I refer it to you?</v>

1556
01:05:43.850 --> 01:05:44.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

1557
01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.300
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it be better if we just didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>care?</v>

1558
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:49.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't,</v>

1559
01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:54.360
<v Speaker 3>I think this idea that a man has a woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside of them and he really is a man or</v>

1560
01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:00.190
<v Speaker 3>a woman trapped in a man's body or a man</v>
<v Speaker 3>trapped in a woman's body and you would</v>

1561
01:06:00.191 --> 01:06:02.800
<v Speaker 3>like to transfer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know like this idea that now it's a</v>

1562
01:06:02.801 --> 01:06:03.880
<v Speaker 3>she or now it's a he.</v>

1563
01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:08.170
<v Speaker 3>I really think that you should be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do whatever you want to do and I</v>

1564
01:06:08.171 --> 01:06:11.110
<v Speaker 3>think that even if you're not a woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>trapped in a man's body,</v>

1565
01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:14.800
<v Speaker 3>but if you wake up one day and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be cool to just get an</v>

1566
01:06:14.801 --> 01:06:18.400
<v Speaker 3>operation and become a woman and started</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking female hormones and see if I like</v>

1567
01:06:18.401 --> 01:06:19.960
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should totally be able to do that.</v>

1568
01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:25.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm 100% for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real problem becomes when you make</v>

1569
01:06:26.021 --> 01:06:30.040
<v Speaker 3>whatever choices your doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make it a big deal to everyone else</v>

1570
01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:34.470
<v Speaker 3>and you start making it so that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>have like very specific ways you're</v>

1571
01:06:34.471 --> 01:06:37.960
<v Speaker 3>supposed to address you and talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You change your name to Caitlyn.</v>

1572
01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:41.440
<v Speaker 3>Now you're kate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were bruce for 60 fucking years.</v>

1573
01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:43.690
<v Speaker 3>But now I have to make a new noise with</v>
<v Speaker 3>my face.</v>

1574
01:06:43.691 --> 01:06:46.210
<v Speaker 3>That means you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if I don't make that new noise in my</v>

1575
01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:49.090
<v Speaker 3>face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an asshole and I'm mis-gendering and</v>

1576
01:06:49.091 --> 01:06:50.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm insensitive and rude.</v>

1577
01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a slight possibility you might</v>

1578
01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:54.940
<v Speaker 3>be fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1579
01:06:54.941 --> 01:06:58.450
<v Speaker 3>if you decide that you're a Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do I call you a Fox skin?</v>

1580
01:06:58.480 --> 01:06:59.830
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do I do now?</v>

1581
01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:00.990
<v Speaker 3>What if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if you do?</v>

1582
01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:03.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't like those comparisons.</v>

1583
01:07:03.551 --> 01:07:05.410
<v Speaker 3>They don't like to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those are valid.</v>

1584
01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:06.251
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1585
01:07:06.251 --> 01:07:10.960
<v Speaker 3>you're doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're having surgery and hormones to</v>

1586
01:07:10.961 --> 01:07:14.650
<v Speaker 3>become normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That alone should make you go,</v>

1587
01:07:14.651 --> 01:07:16.300
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we dealing with here?</v>

1588
01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:18.280
<v Speaker 3>What exactly are we allowed to discuss</v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

1589
01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:20.290
<v Speaker 3>We are not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where things get tricky.</v>

1590
01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:25.240
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to discuss this and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to stay within a very rigid set</v>

1591
01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.640
<v Speaker 3>of rules and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1592
01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.150
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what behaviors,</v>

1593
01:07:28.151 --> 01:07:29.710
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to call them crazy though</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>

1594
01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you know that?</v>

1595
01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:34.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some people are crazy.</v>

1596
01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.540
<v Speaker 3>I would assume that there's a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of people in this world,</v>

1597
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:41.380
<v Speaker 3>whether it is 1% or one 10th of 1% that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are crazy.</v>

1598
01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:46.360
<v Speaker 3>Now a certain amount of men who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>cisgendered heterosexual men are fucking</v>

1599
01:07:46.361 --> 01:07:49.090
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A certain amount of CIS gendered</v>

1600
01:07:49.091 --> 01:07:52.480
<v Speaker 3>heterosexual women are fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to define crazy,</v>

1601
01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:55.120
<v Speaker 3>insane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous,</v>

1602
01:07:55.121 --> 01:07:58.120
<v Speaker 3>preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's been said about people who get</v>

1603
01:07:58.121 --> 01:07:59.470
<v Speaker 3>punched in the face for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1604
01:07:59.471 --> 01:08:01.480
<v Speaker 3>A lot of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true though,</v>

1605
01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.200
<v Speaker 3>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my point being like when you decide</v>

1606
01:08:05.201 --> 01:08:06.670
<v Speaker 3>what's normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's not normal,</v>

1607
01:08:06.671 --> 01:08:09.400
<v Speaker 3>what we have to accept and not accept</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what we're allowed to comment on.</v>

1608
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.500
<v Speaker 3>That's when things get weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're,</v>

1609
01:08:11.501 --> 01:08:14.500
<v Speaker 3>when you're not allowed to comment on</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things because you become</v>

1610
01:08:14.501 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 3>insensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're putting</v>

1611
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.790
<v Speaker 1>out this thing in the public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making it this big social issue.</v>

1612
01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you only have one way.</v>

1613
01:08:22.071 --> 01:08:23.840
<v Speaker 1>You're allowed to communicate and look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

1614
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:24.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1615
01:08:24.411 --> 01:08:26.020
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really dislike is the,</v>

1616
01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:28.470
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the concern for what I think about it.</v>

1617
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather than you should,</v>

1618
01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.650
<v Speaker 1>you should really be free of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be free of me.</v>

1619
01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that seemed to be con entirely</v>

1620
01:08:36.261 --> 01:08:38.270
<v Speaker 1>concerned with what I think and what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

1621
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1622
01:08:39.831 --> 01:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>this is a repudiation of the 1960s and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventies Gay Liberation Movement and</v>

1623
01:08:43.941 --> 01:08:45.680
<v Speaker 1>the Trans Liberation Movement of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1624
01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:47.990
<v Speaker 1>that the whole point of that movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1625
01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:51.800
<v Speaker 1>we don't care what you think about us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to fucking the streets.</v>

1626
01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:53.840
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be naked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to dress however we want.</v>

1627
01:08:53.841 --> 01:08:57.140
<v Speaker 1>We're going to act however we want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't care.</v>

1628
01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:58.970
<v Speaker 1>That was true freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's,</v>

1629
01:08:59.030 --> 01:09:03.620
<v Speaker 1>it's about wanting to be treated</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly by parents,</v>

1630
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:05.780
<v Speaker 1>by making us into their parents.</v>

1631
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also sort of reinforcing this new</v>

1632
01:09:08.481 --> 01:09:13.481
<v Speaker 1>society standards of acceptance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm 100% in favor of the idea</v>

1633
01:09:13.641 --> 01:09:14.600
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1634
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:19.270
<v Speaker 1>it is okay if your dad just decided to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a woman at 60 years old and</v>

1635
01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.350
<v Speaker 1>starts wearing dresses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it makes him feel better,</v>

1636
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.010
<v Speaker 1>which I'm 100% for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1637
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:25.160
<v Speaker 1>But why shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

1638
01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:29.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer in choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer what's all being</v>

1639
01:09:29.901 --> 01:09:32.420
<v Speaker 1>different and I wouldn't be in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business of calling people crazy.</v>

1640
01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Well that's because you're a professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a comedian.</v>

1641
01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:37.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the business of calling people</v>

1642
01:09:37.791 --> 01:09:38.990
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they're crazy.</v>

1643
01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't mean a lot crazy.</v>

1644
01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't my world because it's so</v>

1645
01:09:44.541 --> 01:09:45.351
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1646
01:09:45.351 --> 01:09:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been applied to certainly everyone.</v>

1647
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:49.160
<v Speaker 1>I certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've been called crazy.</v>

1648
01:09:49.161 --> 01:09:50.060
<v Speaker 1>I've been called crazy.</v>

1649
01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's been crazily crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1650
01:09:51.930 --> 01:09:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Well it depends on your standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1651
01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.530
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so you really want to allow people</v>

1652
01:09:57.531 --> 01:10:00.380
<v Speaker 1>to do whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly then don't call them crazy.</v>

1653
01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:04.520
<v Speaker 1>Why does that have any effect on whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not they do whatever I want?</v>

1654
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Not saying it's stopping some of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite people doing whatever they want</v>

1655
01:10:07.731 --> 01:10:10.070
<v Speaker 1>or fucking public that you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage people to do whatever they</v>

1656
01:10:10.071 --> 01:10:11.690
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1657
01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.900
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that calling someone</v>

1658
01:10:14.901 --> 01:10:18.050
<v Speaker 1>crazy for crazy behavior stops that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it does,</v>

1659
01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:22.260
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you're not free enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1660
01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:22.821
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1661
01:10:22.821 --> 01:10:24.320
<v Speaker 1>they should not care too much about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1662
01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:29.860
<v Speaker 1>that's my main point here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're really in favor of making</v>

1663
01:10:30.501 --> 01:10:33.110
<v Speaker 1>people feel free to make whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices they want,</v>

1664
01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.770
<v Speaker 1>then using terms like insane and crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not helpful.</v>

1665
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see that point,</v>

1666
01:10:38.451 --> 01:10:42.140
<v Speaker 1>but also there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very real possibility that</v>

1667
01:10:42.141 --> 01:10:44.450
<v Speaker 1>people with all sorts of dysmorphia</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

1668
01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:48.260
<v Speaker 1>whether it is a Anorexia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's bodybuilder dysmorphia,</v>

1669
01:10:48.261 --> 01:10:51.680
<v Speaker 1>where they never can be big enough that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these are,</v>

1670
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:55.370
<v Speaker 1>these are conditions that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological,</v>

1671
01:10:55.371 --> 01:10:58.250
<v Speaker 1>mental conditions that you could say</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person's crazy.</v>

1672
01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Like when you see a bodybuilder and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't stop getting bigger because</v>

1673
01:11:01.911 --> 01:11:03.620
<v Speaker 1>they're out of their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look at themselves in the mirror</v>

1674
01:11:03.621 --> 01:11:06.980
<v Speaker 1>and they think they're tiny and so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are 350 fucking pounds and they're</v>

1675
01:11:06.981 --> 01:11:09.680
<v Speaker 1>doing steroids and lifting weights 24</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a day.</v>

1676
01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:11.750
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's crazy,</v>

1677
01:11:11.751 --> 01:11:12.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1678
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.033
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

1679
01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:15.253
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1680
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:19.800
<v Speaker 3>you're in this weird pc area now that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have kind of accepted because you go</v>

1681
01:11:19.801 --> 01:11:23.190
<v Speaker 3>to school and you teach and you're a</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of it now,</v>

1682
01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:27.990
<v Speaker 3>but that's a crazy person we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about a man who's a</v>

1683
01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:31.590
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilder who lifts so much weight so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that his body is like virtually</v>

1684
01:11:31.591 --> 01:11:35.400
<v Speaker 3>exploding and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a dysmorphia where they cover</v>

1685
01:11:35.401 --> 01:11:36.960
<v Speaker 3>themselves up because they always look</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny.</v>

1686
01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.360
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological condition there?</v>

1687
01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.970
<v Speaker 3>There's a psychological condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't that make you crazy?</v>

1688
01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:44.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1689
01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:45.620
<v Speaker 3>what does crazy mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1690
01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1691
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:47.450
<v Speaker 3>we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1692
01:11:47.451 --> 01:11:50.160
<v Speaker 3>Mantis here doing Jujitsu is called</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

1693
01:11:50.161 --> 01:11:52.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's being a professor has been</v>

1694
01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:53.790
<v Speaker 3>called crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1695
01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.770
<v Speaker 3>So why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do you have issue with the word</v>

1696
01:11:55.771 --> 01:11:59.730
<v Speaker 3>crazy then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you're pathologizing people's</v>

1697
01:11:59.731 --> 01:12:02.370
<v Speaker 3>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying I'm pathologizing people's</v>

1698
01:12:02.371 --> 01:12:02.730
<v Speaker 3>choices.</v>

1699
01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:04.950
<v Speaker 3>If they lift weights until their body</v>
<v Speaker 3>explodes.</v>

1700
01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:06.600
<v Speaker 3>I knew a dude who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1701
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:07.940
<v Speaker 3>who literally did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1702
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:12.510
<v Speaker 3>he was a bodybuilder and he died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was like 31 or 32.</v>

1703
01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:17.660
<v Speaker 3>We used to call them garden hoses cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>his arms had veins that were like garden</v>

1704
01:12:18.061 --> 01:12:19.470
<v Speaker 3>hoses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were these giant,</v>

1705
01:12:19.530 --> 01:12:20.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was insane.</v>

1706
01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:23.010
<v Speaker 3>You looked at them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd never seen a human being like him.</v>

1707
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:24.720
<v Speaker 3>He would lift weights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a white guy.</v>

1708
01:12:24.721 --> 01:12:27.000
<v Speaker 3>Like is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did you he would turn fucking</v>

1709
01:12:27.001 --> 01:12:28.530
<v Speaker 3>purple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean purple.</v>

1710
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.620
<v Speaker 3>He was just 80% steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His body was just overrun.</v>

1711
01:12:32.650 --> 01:12:35.220
<v Speaker 3>He was out of his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was definitely crazy.</v>

1712
01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Would you call that guy crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1713
01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:40.980
<v Speaker 3>He lifted weights until he died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that's crazy.</v>

1714
01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:43.110
<v Speaker 3>What about martial artists do not use</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy at all?</v>

1715
01:12:43.111 --> 01:12:44.240
<v Speaker 3>Is that what's going on on a martial</v>
<v Speaker 3>artist?</v>

1716
01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.320
<v Speaker 3>He was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you use the term crazy?</v>

1717
01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.240
<v Speaker 3>I try not to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a school shooter?</v>

1718
01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Is that a crazy person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's someone I want to avoid.</v>

1719
01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:52.320
<v Speaker 3>Not Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1720
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.560
<v Speaker 3>Do you limit speech and your own mind?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you limiting your own speech?</v>

1721
01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.830
<v Speaker 3>Censoring myself all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit with what?</v>

1722
01:12:58.831 --> 01:13:00.810
<v Speaker 3>The word crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a problem with the word crazy.</v>

1723
01:13:00.811 --> 01:13:02.690
<v Speaker 3>Do why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do I?</v>

1724
01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:05.220
<v Speaker 3>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it pathologizes people's</v>

1725
01:13:05.221 --> 01:13:08.670
<v Speaker 3>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it contributes to a limitation</v>

1726
01:13:08.671 --> 01:13:11.940
<v Speaker 3>of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy contributes a limitation for you</v>

1727
01:13:11.941 --> 01:13:16.200
<v Speaker 3>and it's been used against all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>behaviors that you would absolutely</v>

1728
01:13:16.201 --> 01:13:18.540
<v Speaker 3>consider to be normal now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1729
01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:20.310
<v Speaker 3>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't affect me.</v>

1730
01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:23.170
<v Speaker 3>Not only that you consider normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that you considered to be a</v>

1731
01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:25.260
<v Speaker 3>preferable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what behaviors?</v>

1732
01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:29.460
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like martial arts or driving a fast</v>

1733
01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:30.420
<v Speaker 3>sports car.</v>

1734
01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't affect me in a negative</v>

1735
01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:34.590
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you say that I'm crazy because I</v>

1736
01:13:34.591 --> 01:13:37.100
<v Speaker 3>like to do stand up when I'm high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's,</v>

1737
01:13:37.101 --> 01:13:38.490
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not gonna affect me.</v>

1738
01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

1739
01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:46.470
<v Speaker 3>well it's in a way your infant towel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your infant [inaudible] that's on the</v>

1740
01:13:46.471 --> 01:13:49.350
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Infantilizing infantilizing um,</v>

1741
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:53.670
<v Speaker 3>people that you would use that moniker</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1742
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you gain from calling someone</v>

1743
01:13:55.381 --> 01:13:56.214
<v Speaker 3>crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>

1744
01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:56.701
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1745
01:13:56.701 --> 01:13:58.130
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like calling.</v>

1746
01:13:59.450 --> 01:14:01.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you gain by any adjective?</v>

1747
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:04.560
<v Speaker 3>The question is what you wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you want to accomplish.</v>

1748
01:14:04.561 --> 01:14:07.170
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not moralizing against you using</v>
<v Speaker 3>that term.</v>

1749
01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:09.900
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're interested in human</v>

1750
01:14:09.901 --> 01:14:11.200
<v Speaker 3>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1751
01:14:11.201 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 3>And encouraging him</v>

1752
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:16.000
<v Speaker 1>and freedom than I would discourage</v>
<v Speaker 1>using the term crazy to describe</v>

1753
01:14:16.001 --> 01:14:17.530
<v Speaker 1>people's choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1754
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:18.100
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1755
01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:22.900
<v Speaker 1>but I use it all the time and I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 1>favor of people's freedom and I think</v>

1756
01:14:22.901 --> 01:14:24.790
<v Speaker 1>he's crazy and he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1757
01:14:24.791 --> 01:14:27.820
<v Speaker 1>is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about being okay or not.</v>

1758
01:14:27.821 --> 01:14:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying again,</v>

1759
01:14:29.021 --> 01:14:31.090
<v Speaker 1>it's about objectives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is your objective?</v>

1760
01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:34.690
<v Speaker 1>If it's maximizing human freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the word that doesn't reach that</v>

1761
01:14:34.691 --> 01:14:35.240
<v Speaker 1>objective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1762
01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.270
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind that would be then</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another,</v>

1763
01:14:37.271 --> 01:14:40.340
<v Speaker 1>the word crazy would have a negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact on the person that you,</v>

1764
01:14:40.341 --> 01:14:42.940
<v Speaker 1>you use it on what you're doing by</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying something as crazy as you're</v>

1765
01:14:42.941 --> 01:14:44.690
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should not do this thing.</v>

1766
01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

1767
01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:47.370
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were.</v>

1768
01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the bustle of the muscle.</v>

1769
01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:52.180
<v Speaker 1>The bodybuilder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck if he lifts himself</v>

1770
01:14:52.181 --> 01:14:53.620
<v Speaker 1>to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was my kid.</v>

1771
01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.080
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably try to get them help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1772
01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's obviously it's used,</v>

1773
01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.620
<v Speaker 1>you admit it's usually it's used in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way though.</v>

1774
01:14:59.621 --> 01:15:01.090
<v Speaker 1>It's used as a negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1775
01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Usually it's you're saying you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>not do that.</v>

1776
01:15:04.331 --> 01:15:07.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should not ride a motorcycle without</v>

1777
01:15:07.841 --> 01:15:09.220
<v Speaker 1>a helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1778
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:12.610
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're going to die anyway,</v>

1779
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.290
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1780
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I then I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I view crazy is there's broad</v>

1781
01:15:18.371 --> 01:15:19.660
<v Speaker 1>ranges of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1782
01:15:19.661 --> 01:15:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Like there's the crazy guy that walks in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the street talking to himself and he's</v>

1783
01:15:22.841 --> 01:15:25.120
<v Speaker 1>not on a Bluetooth headset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

1784
01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:28.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having internal dialogues externally,</v>

1785
01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:29.470
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy person,</v>

1786
01:15:29.471 --> 01:15:30.304
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1787
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:31.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1788
01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:38.740
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very dangerous because people</v>

1789
01:15:38.741 --> 01:15:41.440
<v Speaker 1>have been locked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1790
01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:45.940
<v Speaker 1>For behaviors that were called crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would never consider to be</v>

1791
01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:47.200
<v Speaker 1>crazy now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1792
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Against their will.</v>

1793
01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:53.230
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of behaviors have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>punished harshly,</v>

1794
01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:56.800
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they were deemed to be crazy or</v>

1795
01:15:56.801 --> 01:15:57.940
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1796
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Or pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1797
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:01.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do whatever you want,</v>

1798
01:16:01.721 --> 01:16:04.450
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to be in the business</v>
<v Speaker 1>of labeling things,</v>

1799
01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.650
<v Speaker 1>behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices,</v>

1800
01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.280
<v Speaker 1>other people's choices as those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know where I can lead them,</v>

1801
01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:12.040
<v Speaker 1>they can lead them to lock up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1802
01:16:12.041 --> 01:16:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1803
01:16:13.051 --> 01:16:15.640
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with a broad definition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word crazy.</v>

1804
01:16:15.641 --> 01:16:18.880
<v Speaker 1>And some of them are pejorative and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them that are actually positive.</v>

1805
01:16:18.881 --> 01:16:22.450
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people that I find</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be crazy that I enjoy very much.</v>

1806
01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:24.040
<v Speaker 1>And there was some of my favorite</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1807
01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.750
<v Speaker 1>It's also utterly arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1808
01:16:25.751 --> 01:16:30.190
<v Speaker 1>So it becomes basically meaningless</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't necessarily your crazy is someone</v>

1809
01:16:30.191 --> 01:16:31.870
<v Speaker 1>else's normal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1810
01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:35.440
<v Speaker 1>if you watch a guy and he's walking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tight rope in between two buildings,</v>

1811
01:16:35.441 --> 01:16:37.630
<v Speaker 1>a hundred stories up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's fucking crazy.</v>

1812
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that he should go to jail</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anyone wants to stop his choices,</v>

1813
01:16:42.161 --> 01:16:45.860
<v Speaker 1>but that is a fucking crazy thing to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I don't know.</v>

1814
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:47.710
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

1815
01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:49.840
<v Speaker 1>We're playing games here like what are</v>
<v Speaker 1>we doing here?</v>

1816
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.681
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1817
01:16:50.681 --> 01:16:55.540
<v Speaker 1>you've got on this road because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the possibility that someone</v>

1818
01:16:55.541 --> 01:16:58.210
<v Speaker 1>who is transgender might be crazy like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1819
01:16:58.211 --> 01:17:02.080
<v Speaker 1>This should be taken into consideration</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the possibility that someone who gets</v>

1820
01:17:02.081 --> 01:17:06.100
<v Speaker 1>their face tattoo definition</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologizing something by calling it</v>

1821
01:17:06.101 --> 01:17:08.760
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that it's not normal it</v>

1822
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:12.530
<v Speaker 1>and basically you're suggesting at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting or just straight out saying</v>

1823
01:17:12.531 --> 01:17:15.330
<v Speaker 1>that it should not be done on a tight</v>
<v Speaker 1>rope.</v>

1824
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:17.540
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't dress on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She shouldn't dress as a woman.</v>

1825
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:18.830
<v Speaker 1>You should do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1826
01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:20.390
<v Speaker 1>I a hundred percent think that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should.</v>

1827
01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.190
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to lift yourself to</v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

1828
01:17:22.191 --> 01:17:24.410
<v Speaker 1>you should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to walk on a tie rope</v>

1829
01:17:24.411 --> 01:17:26.150
<v Speaker 1>across two buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do it.</v>

1830
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:27.730
<v Speaker 1>What is not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1831
01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:30.140
<v Speaker 1>how does one live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there someone who's lived in the</v>

1832
01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:32.600
<v Speaker 1>world without being crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

1833
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:37.670
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a very boring place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there is like a very non Joe</v>

1834
01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Rogan kind of place to live in and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>non crazy place.</v>

1835
01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think maybe like a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>works at a deli?</v>

1836
01:17:41.670 --> 01:17:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or just make sandwiches all,</v>

1837
01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:47.240
<v Speaker 1>we should all make sandwiches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the sandwiches are fucking crazy.</v>

1838
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:49.670
<v Speaker 1>The term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

1839
01:17:49.671 --> 01:17:52.880
<v Speaker 1>But what if he's a trans sandwich maker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1840
01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:56.600
<v Speaker 1>well maybe he's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just crazy.</v>

1841
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's crazy and a normal sandwich</v>

1842
01:17:59.421 --> 01:18:01.730
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's a CIS gendered White Crazy</v>

1843
01:18:01.731 --> 01:18:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Sandwich Guy who hears words in his head</v>
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't respond to them.</v>

1844
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:11.210
<v Speaker 1>You just don't like to work crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1845
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:12.081
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good word.</v>

1846
01:18:12.081 --> 01:18:13.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a bad word.</v>

1847
01:18:13.581 --> 01:18:14.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1848
01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give you get like a little fucking</v>

1849
01:18:16.770 --> 01:18:17.930
<v Speaker 1>rollercoaster ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Go.</v>

1850
01:18:17.931 --> 01:18:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>

1851
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use it all the time.</v>

1852
01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I just judge myself harshly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have shame session,</v>

1853
01:18:29.811 --> 01:18:30.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by myself.</v>

1854
01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:34.580
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying is you don't want to</v>

1855
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:40.220
<v Speaker 1>shame people or in any way affect our</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices and um,</v>

1856
01:18:40.221 --> 01:18:43.350
<v Speaker 1>you want to give them the freedom to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they want and by saying someone</v>

1857
01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.280
<v Speaker 1>might be crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're possibly limiting that.</v>

1858
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a shaming.</v>

1859
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:49.370
<v Speaker 1>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be,</v>

1860
01:18:49.371 --> 01:18:51.820
<v Speaker 1>not always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will also are people with like</v>

1861
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:56.950
<v Speaker 1>legitimate pathologies that get involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all sorts of body modification things</v>

1862
01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:58.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1863
01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.070
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy who got his nose cut off</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1864
01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:04.060
<v Speaker 1>he literally turned himself into the red</v>
<v Speaker 1>skull.</v>

1865
01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:04.791
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Guy,</v>

1866
01:19:04.791 --> 01:19:06.920
<v Speaker 1>the captain America guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking terrifying.</v>

1867
01:19:06.921 --> 01:19:10.640
<v Speaker 1>He was a handsome guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had his nose cut off like the tip</v>

1868
01:19:10.641 --> 01:19:13.790
<v Speaker 1>of his nose cut off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had all these bolts put in his head.</v>

1869
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:15.690
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1870
01:19:15.710 --> 01:19:17.360
<v Speaker 1>it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks awesome.</v>

1871
01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:20.120
<v Speaker 1>What is wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that guy crazy areas.</v>

1872
01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Look at that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1873
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1874
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seems like a normal guy to me.</v>

1875
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:27.643
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't.</v>

1876
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Is that guy came home with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter,</v>

1877
01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:31.100
<v Speaker 1>would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1878
01:19:31.101 --> 01:19:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call him crazy because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>scared of him.</v>

1879
01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are scared of Oh yeah.</v>

1880
01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's obviously willing to do</v>

1881
01:19:38.001 --> 01:19:39.800
<v Speaker 1>this to his body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would he do to you?</v>

1882
01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:42.770
<v Speaker 1>He had his eyeballs turned black with</v>
<v Speaker 1>tattoo ink.</v>

1883
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:47.210
<v Speaker 1>I would certainly say it's unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he is definitely unusual.</v>

1884
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:49.490
<v Speaker 1>It's possibly unique.</v>

1885
01:19:49.730 --> 01:19:51.560
<v Speaker 1>It's really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's really crazy?</v>

1886
01:19:51.561 --> 01:19:53.270
<v Speaker 1>If you see what he looked like</v>
<v Speaker 1>beforehand and go,</v>

1887
01:19:53.271 --> 01:19:55.190
<v Speaker 1>who was a pretty pretty good looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

1888
01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:57.680
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1889
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's him beforehand,</v>

1890
01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is crazy.</v>

1891
01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:01.910
<v Speaker 1>And thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1892
01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you,</v>

1893
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:04.040
<v Speaker 1>where do we draw the line?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you one.</v>

1894
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:05.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's crazy.</v>

1895
01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think it's crazy?</v>

1896
01:20:06.411 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be called crazy.</v>

1897
01:20:08.191 --> 01:20:11.850
<v Speaker 1>It's arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's meeting those cutoffs face dyed red</v>

1898
01:20:11.851 --> 01:20:13.590
<v Speaker 1>and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyeballs tattooed.</v>

1899
01:20:13.591 --> 01:20:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Meaningless term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaningless.</v>

1900
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:19.290
<v Speaker 1>It has a good meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you know,</v>

1901
01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:22.620
<v Speaker 1>if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it helps sort of direct you in your</v>

1902
01:20:22.621 --> 01:20:23.700
<v Speaker 1>choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1903
01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:26.060
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if it helps describe like a,</v>

1904
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:31.070
<v Speaker 1>if that's your son and he does that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone says he sees that as his boy</v>

1905
01:20:31.441 --> 01:20:35.640
<v Speaker 1>went fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying my son did that to his</v>

1906
01:20:35.641 --> 01:20:36.740
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1907
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:39.090
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't call it crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you call it?</v>

1908
01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Awesomely unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Call it.</v>

1909
01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:48.360
<v Speaker 1>I would call it unfortunate for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at him.</v>

1910
01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1911
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.630
<v Speaker 1>because that's what he wants to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1912
01:20:51.690 --> 01:20:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Does he though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's just crazy</v>

1913
01:20:57.810 --> 01:21:01.950
<v Speaker 1>people fucking stock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just to stop shaking.</v>

1914
01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:06.380
<v Speaker 1>This'll never 30 minutes on the subject</v>
<v Speaker 1>of crazy.</v>

1915
01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying though.</v>

1916
01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:10.980
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

1917
01:21:11.010 --> 01:21:11.843
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

1918
01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:14.670
<v Speaker 1>martial arts come on like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>

1919
01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to call it 100% people,</v>

1920
01:21:16.601 --> 01:21:21.180
<v Speaker 1>like people call that crazy all the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's why it's illegal in some</v>

1921
01:21:21.181 --> 01:21:22.170
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1922
01:21:22.171 --> 01:21:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a reason.</v>

1923
01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:24.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

1924
01:21:24.930 --> 01:21:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the restaurant workers,</v>

1925
01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:29.850
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like martial arts aren't illegal in New</v>

1926
01:21:29.850 --> 01:21:32.310
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You granted it's considered crazy by</v>

1927
01:21:32.311 --> 01:21:35.010
<v Speaker 1>much of the population and if it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it were not,</v>

1928
01:21:35.011 --> 01:21:36.960
<v Speaker 1>it probably would be legal everywhere.</v>

1929
01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:38.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

1930
01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:42.690
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why it's illegal in New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York state is because of corruption.</v>

1931
01:21:42.691 --> 01:21:43.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the only reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1932
01:21:43.911 --> 01:21:46.200
<v Speaker 1>because boxing is not illegal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing,</v>

1933
01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:47.910
<v Speaker 1>it's not illegal and neither one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are illegal.</v>

1934
01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Those things are brutal and violent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are combat sports,</v>

1935
01:21:51.391 --> 01:21:53.430
<v Speaker 1>so it's not the combat sports are</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

1936
01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:56.790
<v Speaker 1>It is that mixed martial arts is illegal</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the culinary union and their</v>

1937
01:21:56.791 --> 01:21:59.190
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly on one politician who is</v>

1938
01:21:59.191 --> 01:22:03.000
<v Speaker 1>now going to jail most likely for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of his life because of corruption</v>

1939
01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:06.960
<v Speaker 1>and we're hoping to be getting into</v>
<v Speaker 1>Madison Square Garden in April.</v>

1940
01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:07.853
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1941
01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:08.820
<v Speaker 1>I know all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

1942
01:22:08.821 --> 01:22:09.930
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all,</v>

1943
01:22:09.931 --> 01:22:12.990
<v Speaker 1>if the entire New York state population</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that mixed martial arts was</v>

1944
01:22:12.991 --> 01:22:15.120
<v Speaker 1>totally normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be legal.</v>

1945
01:22:15.150 --> 01:22:16.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true because culinary again</v>

1946
01:22:16.991 --> 01:22:18.630
<v Speaker 1>would not have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the power that it does,</v>

1947
01:22:18.631 --> 01:22:21.750
<v Speaker 1>but they do because a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population thinks that it's barbaric.</v>

1948
01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:22.561
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that.</v>

1949
01:22:22.561 --> 01:22:25.470
<v Speaker 1>They didn't vote on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The population has never voted or they</v>

1950
01:22:25.471 --> 01:22:26.900
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the much of the popular,</v>

1951
01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:29.980
<v Speaker 1>they haven't voted on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The population hasn't voted no,</v>

1952
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.640
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do grant that much of the population</v>

1953
01:22:32.641 --> 01:22:35.190
<v Speaker 1>thinks it's sparked Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a large percentage of people</v>

1954
01:22:35.191 --> 01:22:36.810
<v Speaker 1>that don't like any violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports,</v>

1955
01:22:36.811 --> 01:22:38.630
<v Speaker 1>whether it's football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's boxing,</v>

1956
01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:41.860
<v Speaker 1>whether it's mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's animalistic barbaric.</v>

1957
01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:43.390
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of wind cock fighting.</v>

1958
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are pussies though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't listen to this.</v>

1959
01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:48.900
<v Speaker 1>What I hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you allowed to use the word pussy?</v>

1960
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's Craig.</v>

1961
01:22:49.971 --> 01:22:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are pussies within.</v>

1962
01:22:51.161 --> 01:22:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Not Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1963
01:22:52.290 --> 01:22:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even imagine what would happen</v>

1964
01:22:54.781 --> 01:22:57.390
<v Speaker 1>to me if I use that on a campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1965
01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Calling some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting because pussy can be</v>

1966
01:23:00.631 --> 01:23:03.000
<v Speaker 1>a pejorative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like Dick can be a pejorative,</v>

1967
01:23:03.450 --> 01:23:05.820
<v Speaker 1>but a very different kind of pejorative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick is a,</v>

1968
01:23:05.821 --> 01:23:06.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1969
01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:08.350
<v Speaker 2>a forceful Pajaro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a Dick.</v>

1970
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:10.990
<v Speaker 2>I could sell a mean person pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's weakness.</v>

1971
01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:11.843
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1972
01:23:11.890 --> 01:23:13.480
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or it can be awesome.</v>

1973
01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1974
01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:18.220
<v Speaker 2>I've noticed that people are starting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>call women Dick's now.</v>

1975
01:23:18.430 --> 01:23:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Really haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1976
01:23:20.290 --> 01:23:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And assholes.</v>

1977
01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:24.670
<v Speaker 2>Assholes used to be only men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's now often women are called</v>

1978
01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:26.670
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think women have always been called</v>

1979
01:23:26.671 --> 01:23:28.720
<v Speaker 2>that assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>

1980
01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:32.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man gendered a lot of men are called</v>

1981
01:23:32.051 --> 01:23:33.770
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1982
01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:35.040
<v Speaker 2>That's one of your favorites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

1983
01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.033
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good one.</v>

1984
01:23:36.490 --> 01:23:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean actually,</v>

1985
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I first heard people using cunt.</v>

1986
01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1987
01:23:42.281 --> 01:23:44.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminists actually in college really</v>

1988
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:46.300
<v Speaker 2>used that for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1989
01:23:46.301 --> 01:23:49.210
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for other women in a negative way.</v>

1990
01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Sort of how black people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1991
01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:56.050
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like the Nigga of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminists of the 1980 [inaudible] he was</v>

1992
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:57.183
<v Speaker 2>really was.</v>

1993
01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:02.520
<v Speaker 2>That's my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my country cut.</v>

1994
01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:05.620
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

1995
01:24:05.621 --> 01:24:06.730
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of true actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1996
01:24:06.731 --> 01:24:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's done anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I remember in the 80s and at least</v>

1997
01:24:09.251 --> 01:24:12.550
<v Speaker 2>in my circles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was definitely one of my favorite</v>

1998
01:24:12.551 --> 01:24:15.940
<v Speaker 2>things about going to the UK is how</v>
<v Speaker 2>freely they throw that around.</v>

1999
01:24:15.941 --> 01:24:17.620
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a good way,</v>

2000
01:24:17.890 --> 01:24:18.340
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2001
01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:19.430
<v Speaker 2>he's a good con.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2002
01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:23.080
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking con.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>

2003
01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:28.240
<v Speaker 2>They throw it around like a beach ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 30 or 40 years behind the U S in</v>

2004
01:24:29.141 --> 01:24:31.510
<v Speaker 2>gender politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which may be good or bad,</v>

2005
01:24:31.511 --> 01:24:31.961
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2006
01:24:31.961 --> 01:24:33.670
<v Speaker 2>they haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're always behind a bit.</v>

2007
01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I still call women girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2008
01:24:36.221 --> 01:24:38.050
<v Speaker 2>that's common there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you,</v>

2009
01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever say you girlfriend where</v>

2010
01:24:39.761 --> 01:24:41.410
<v Speaker 2>that's not correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The United States.</v>

2011
01:24:41.411 --> 01:24:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Do you get corrected when you say my</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend?</v>

2012
01:24:45.690 --> 01:24:47.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2013
01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard coming out of my mouth</v>

2014
01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:54.240
<v Speaker 2>considering our age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kinda like it and I wish I could say</v>

2015
01:24:54.431 --> 01:24:55.530
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

2016
01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:56.860
<v Speaker 2>you can do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2017
01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:58.091
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2018
01:24:58.091 --> 01:25:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to be on it.</v>

2019
01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get out.</v>

2020
01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:05.440
<v Speaker 2>You're my avenue out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I helping you?</v>

2021
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These kind of conversations.</v>

2022
01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

2023
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:10.150
<v Speaker 2>None of getting in trouble is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2024
01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:11.990
<v Speaker 2>Because that forces you out of places</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be in,</v>

2025
01:25:11.991 --> 01:25:13.780
<v Speaker 2>in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2026
01:25:13.781 --> 01:25:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly think that the boxy confines</v>

2027
01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:22.030
<v Speaker 2>of ideas that you seem to be forced into</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're a professor at a college,</v>

2028
01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:26.620
<v Speaker 2>it definitely reinforces this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>self censorship.</v>

2029
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2030
01:25:28.211 --> 01:25:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to watch yourself all the time.</v>

2031
01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:32.680
<v Speaker 2>That seems so exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2032
01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:36.760
<v Speaker 2>I have like a standup comedian spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I'm as funny,</v>

2033
01:25:36.761 --> 01:25:39.790
<v Speaker 2>but like the spirit of a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a professor's body.</v>

2034
01:25:40.210 --> 01:25:41.440
<v Speaker 2>So do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2035
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:45.820
<v Speaker 2>like a range,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain bits of humor in your,</v>

2036
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:48.970
<v Speaker 2>in your curriculum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your courses that you teach?</v>

2037
01:25:48.971 --> 01:25:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Do you have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2038
01:25:49.961 --> 01:25:51.010
<v Speaker 2>in my teaching?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2039
01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>

2040
01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:53.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm funny sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2041
01:25:53.651 --> 01:25:57.850
<v Speaker 2>And I'm much freer in the classroom</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause the other professors aren't there.</v>

2042
01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you have to be careful of</v>

2043
01:26:00.341 --> 01:26:02.400
<v Speaker 2>children because it's not videotaped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2044
01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2045
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:03.471
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2046
01:26:03.471 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 2>So it won't get</v>

2047
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:04.401
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2048
01:26:04.401 --> 01:26:06.260
<v Speaker 1>it could though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could get out.</v>

2049
01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:07.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only by word of mouth.</v>

2050
01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna be on Youtube.</v>

2051
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:15.260
<v Speaker 1>That's such a drag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real drag.</v>

2052
01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to reinvent it though.</v>

2053
01:26:18.530 --> 01:26:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Renegade University.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's coming.</v>

2054
01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Do you worry about that word being kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Douchey?</v>

2055
01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Renegade.</v>

2056
01:26:24.810 --> 01:26:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it Douchey?</v>

2057

<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

<v Speaker 1>my brand.</v>

2060
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:37.190
<v Speaker 1>But the word renegade and like you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna got a bunch of dudes are</v>

2061
01:26:37.191 --> 01:26:39.350
<v Speaker 1>sons of anarchy fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so shitty tee shirts.</v>

2062
01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:40.970
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2063
01:26:40.971 --> 01:26:45.680
<v Speaker 1>There's been some renegades bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have noticed the Douche tinge renegade</v>

2064
01:26:45.681 --> 01:26:47.820
<v Speaker 1>might be careful with that word</v>
<v Speaker 1>renegades.</v>

2065
01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.600
<v Speaker 1>A tricky word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2066
01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:51.800
<v Speaker 1>it works for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a book of renegade history of the</v>

2067
01:26:51.801 --> 01:26:52.634
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

2068
01:26:52.670 --> 01:26:56.600
<v Speaker 1>But as far as for a whole university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll see.</v>

2069
01:26:56.690 --> 01:26:58.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe just call it crazy.</v>

2070
01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.550
<v Speaker 1>You've raised you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well a friend of mine suggested it</v>

2071
01:27:01.551 --> 01:27:04.640
<v Speaker 1>should be called fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I like that friends.</v>

2072
01:27:04.641 --> 01:27:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Probably crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2073
01:27:09.730 --> 01:27:12.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you look at it like it's your brand,</v>

2074
01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:14.570
<v Speaker 1>like the word renegade is because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

2075
01:27:14.610 --> 01:27:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea is I'm going to be</v>

2076
01:27:17.241 --> 01:27:19.550
<v Speaker 1>teaching in the university will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced,</v>

2077
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:22.160
<v Speaker 1>come out of the boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like though that it's</v>

2078
01:27:22.161 --> 01:27:25.790
<v Speaker 1>possible to like limit the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are willing to enroll at renegade</v>

2079
01:27:25.791 --> 01:27:28.070
<v Speaker 1>university?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it just the name,</v>

2080
01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:29.210
<v Speaker 1>the moniker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2081
01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:34.400
<v Speaker 1>perhaps that'll turn off some customers</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps that are looking for,</v>

2082
01:27:34.410 --> 01:27:35.670
<v Speaker 1>they don't like this name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2083
01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't hold me back,</v>

2084
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:40.490
<v Speaker 1>but I just see there could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be limiting.</v>

2085
01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2086
01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:43.250
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

2087
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe those are the people I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

2088
01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:46.670
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2089
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you mean though.</v>

2090
01:27:48.801 --> 01:27:52.790
<v Speaker 1>It can't has like a sons of anarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of got vibe a little bit.</v>

2091
01:27:52.791 --> 01:27:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2092
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Somebody might be riding a harley trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to escape from nothing.</v>

2093
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2094
01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:02.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm a renegade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

2095
01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:05.180
<v Speaker 1>I gotta fuck a jolly Roger Tattooed on</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ass.</v>

2096
01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just people are strange that's</v>

2097
01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:10.430
<v Speaker 1>trained with words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not crazy.</v>

2098
01:28:10.930 --> 01:28:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're formulating this university,</v>

2099
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:15.950
<v Speaker 1>do you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2100
01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:20.180
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a plan for launching it and for like,</v>

2101
01:28:20.181 --> 01:28:23.030
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to roll out courses</v>
<v Speaker 1>and are you going to,</v>

2102
01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:25.210
<v Speaker 1>you got to create all the courses?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2103
01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:26.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's going to start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2104
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:29.840
<v Speaker 1>with sort of standalone lectures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can download and listen to like</v>

2105
01:28:29.841 --> 01:28:31.880
<v Speaker 1>podcasts or you can watch the videos of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2106
01:28:32.730 --> 01:28:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if there's sufficient interest,</v>

2107
01:28:35.991 --> 01:28:38.720
<v Speaker 1>I'll have interactive seminars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of great platforms for</v>

2108
01:28:38.721 --> 01:28:40.450
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2109
01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:41.120
<v Speaker 1>where you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2110
01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:45.580
<v Speaker 1>talk to me and we can have an exchange</v>
<v Speaker 1>online and you do a chat or email with</v>

2111
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:48.290
<v Speaker 1>other students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The exact format we haven't worked out</v>

2112
01:28:48.291 --> 01:28:49.910
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or are you going to have the time to do</v>

2113
01:28:49.911 --> 01:28:51.320
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2114
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:54.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna stop teaching and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleges the idea,</v>

2115
01:28:54.810 --> 01:28:58.250
<v Speaker 1>so the idea is to completely dedicate</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your time to this ultimate,</v>

2116
01:28:58.251 --> 01:28:59.690
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2117
01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:00.553
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2118
01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:02.730
<v Speaker 1>And will you stay in Oregon if you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that or were you,</v>

2119
01:29:02.731 --> 01:29:03.960

2120
01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:06.690

2121
01:29:06.691 --> 01:29:09.600
<v Speaker 1>and in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both go back and forth.</v>

2122
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you have like a,</v>

2123
01:29:12.661 --> 01:29:14.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like a five year plan or a 10 year</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan?</v>

2124
01:29:14.761 --> 01:29:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Like how are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2125
01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:16.650
<v Speaker 1>how you kind of rolled this out?</v>

2126
01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to roll out next year.</v>

2127
01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:21.180
<v Speaker 1>If it's successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be for the rest of my life.</v>

2128
01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like it to be.</v>

2129
01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:23.880
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2130

2136
01:29:36.931 --> 01:29:38.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might actually use an old school</v>

2137
01:29:39.210 --> 01:29:43.080
<v Speaker 1>whiteboard in the background depending</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what I'm presenting or videos and</v>

2138
01:29:43.081 --> 01:29:43.860
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2139
01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:44.693
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2140
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:46.170
<v Speaker 1>be multimedia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2141
01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long have you been thinking about</v>

2142
01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:49.620
<v Speaker 1>those years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2143
01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2144
01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:54.450
<v Speaker 1>I started becoming disaffected with</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleges and universities probably 10</v>

2145
01:29:54.451 --> 01:29:55.950
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2146
01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:59.160
<v Speaker 1>after getting fired from Barnard College</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Columbia.</v>

2147
01:29:59.190 --> 01:30:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I get fired for,</v>

2148
01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.990
<v Speaker 1>did you talk about in the last podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>he being a white man?</v>

2149
01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:04.381
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2150
01:30:04.381 --> 01:30:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Why'd you leave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of my ideas.</v>

2151
01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:07.820
<v Speaker 1>What ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2152
01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:10.320
<v Speaker 1>about is really both those reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2153
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:11.183
<v Speaker 1>People just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2154
01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say things you're not supposed to</v>

2155
01:30:12.871 --> 01:30:13.950
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And My,</v>

2156
01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:15.700
<v Speaker 1>the renegade history stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

2157
01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:20.400
<v Speaker 1>didn't go over well with a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>professoriate and they wanted to,</v>

2158
01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:22.590
<v Speaker 1>they wanted a black woman also for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

2159
01:30:22.591 --> 01:30:24.330
<v Speaker 1>And then it's happened to me again at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occidental.</v>

2160
01:30:24.331 --> 01:30:27.720
<v Speaker 1>I was disqualified from a tenure track</v>
<v Speaker 1>job about two years ago because of my</v>

2161
01:30:27.721 --> 01:30:31.290
<v Speaker 1>race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of your race specifically?</v>

2162
01:30:31.291 --> 01:30:34.470
<v Speaker 1>That's what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was told behind the scenes.</v>

2163
01:30:34.471 --> 01:30:35.304
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2164
01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:38.880
<v Speaker 1>How'd they say it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We weren't going to hire a white guy.</v>

2165
01:30:39.330 --> 01:30:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

2166
01:30:42.271 --> 01:30:43.710
<v Speaker 1>it's happened twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2167
01:30:43.711 --> 01:30:45.390
<v Speaker 1>It's very depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So depressing.</v>

2168
01:30:45.450 --> 01:30:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just,</v>

2169
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:49.800
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's equally depressing</v>

2170
01:30:49.801 --> 01:30:51.810
<v Speaker 1>that they wouldn't hire a black woman.</v>

2171
01:30:52.650 --> 01:30:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably more depressing.</v>

2172
01:30:54.541 --> 01:30:56.490
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't hire a black woman for</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>

2173
01:30:56.491 --> 01:30:58.740
<v Speaker 1>cause there's so many more white men</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing your job,</v>

2174
01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:00.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2175
01:31:00.241 --> 01:31:02.910
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not much less depressing.</v>

2176
01:31:03.210 --> 01:31:04.860
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's racist.</v>

2177
01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:06.750
<v Speaker 1>It's ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also illegal.</v>

2178
01:31:07.230 --> 01:31:07.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2179
01:31:07.771 --> 01:31:11.580
<v Speaker 1>you can't do it according to the civil</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights act of 1964 they do it all the</v>

2180
01:31:11.581 --> 01:31:13.020
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just do it without,</v>

2181
01:31:13.850 --> 01:31:15.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without making it public.</v>

2182
01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:20.160
<v Speaker 1>What is this recent trend amongst kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're saying that white people</v>

2183
01:31:20.161 --> 01:31:22.590
<v Speaker 1>can't be racist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absurd.</v>

2184
01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black people can't be racist.</v>

2185
01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Black people can't be racist towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>white people because they don't have any</v>

2186
01:31:28.651 --> 01:31:32.880
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that racism is imposing your own</v>

2187
01:31:32.881 --> 01:31:35.310
<v Speaker 1>prejudices on other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is like,</v>

2188
01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:37.110
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to redefine it.</v>

2189
01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:40.410
<v Speaker 1>And people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check the wikipedia for the definition</v>

2190
01:31:40.411 --> 01:31:41.670
<v Speaker 1>of racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

2191
01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so racism in its classical sense is the</v>

2192
01:31:46.411 --> 01:31:51.411
<v Speaker 1>belief that there are distinct and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical biological races of human</v>

2193
01:31:51.571 --> 01:31:52.530
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2194
01:31:52.531 --> 01:31:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2195
01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.140
<v Speaker 1>That's racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2196
01:31:55.141 --> 01:31:56.370
<v Speaker 1>It's classical sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2197
01:31:56.371 --> 01:31:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Then there's like prejudice and cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>dislike and you know,</v>

2198
01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:03.280
<v Speaker 1>but that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyone can be racist against anyone</v>

2199
01:32:03.281 --> 01:32:04.030
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2200
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a point to be made there that</v>

2201
01:32:06.881 --> 01:32:11.881
<v Speaker 1>some groups have power and some don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some who are racist can do things</v>

2202
01:32:12.551 --> 01:32:13.860
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2203
01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:16.210
<v Speaker 1>And some can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>

2204
01:32:16.211 --> 01:32:19.960
<v Speaker 1>black people can be racist if they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are biologically distinct and</v>

2205
01:32:19.961 --> 01:32:22.780
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical races of human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which some do.</v>

2206
01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:26.380
<v Speaker 1>I watched some white rapper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just can't put anybody in prison</v>

2207
01:32:26.381 --> 01:32:27.820
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people were,</v>

2208
01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:30.100
<v Speaker 1>this was so frustrating as young kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying,</v>

2209
01:32:30.101 --> 01:32:32.710
<v Speaker 1>he's woke as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's woke,</v>

2210
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:34.360
<v Speaker 1>he woke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's awake,</v>

2211
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:36.580
<v Speaker 1>he's woke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he woke as fuck.</v>

2212
01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.920
<v Speaker 1>And then people were like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2213
01:32:38.921 --> 01:32:41.440
<v Speaker 1>you're ignorant to two people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreed.</v>

2214
01:32:41.490 --> 01:32:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Y'all need to check wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

2215
01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Check wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing.</v>

2216
01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Like they've redefined the term racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying white people can only,</v>

2217
01:32:51.670 --> 01:32:54.250
<v Speaker 1>or black people can only be prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't be racist.</v>

2218
01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Black people can be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just can't do much about it.</v>

2219
01:32:58.510 --> 01:32:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can against,</v>

2220
01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they are an employer and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to hire a Chinese,</v>

2221
01:33:02.051 --> 01:33:04.870
<v Speaker 1>some blacks can veer a black guy and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a business.</v>

2222
01:33:04.871 --> 01:33:06.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to hire Chinese people</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't like Chinese.</v>

2223
01:33:07.130 --> 01:33:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Just as a group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't do much unless they're in</v>

2224
01:33:09.791 --> 01:33:12.730
<v Speaker 1>South Africa where they control the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

2225
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 black people can not only be racist,</v>

2226
01:33:15.731 --> 01:33:18.520
<v Speaker 1>but they can put you in jail if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong race.</v>

2227
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:20.230
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm struggling for the time to be able</v>

2228
01:33:20.231 --> 01:33:21.100
<v Speaker 1>to use that term.</v>

2229
01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:24.210
<v Speaker 1>He's woke as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The day is coming,</v>

2230
01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:28.210
<v Speaker 1>woke the term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woke</v>

2231
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:34.690
<v Speaker 1>all these wacky kids today telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2232
01:33:34.691 --> 01:33:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit.</v>

2233
01:33:37.331 --> 01:33:40.660
<v Speaker 1>And redefining the words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course people can be,</v>

2234
01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:44.350
<v Speaker 1>they can do wrong things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're based on racial</v>

2235
01:33:44.351 --> 01:33:49.120
<v Speaker 1>prejudices or sociological prejudices or</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic or class,</v>

2236
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:52.210
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This of course there's prejudices.</v>

2237
01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:53.111
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

2238
01:33:53.111 --> 01:33:55.930
<v Speaker 1>why redefine them like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why even waste any time.</v>

2239
01:33:55.931 --> 01:33:58.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like there's all this frivolous</v>

2240
01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:03.220
<v Speaker 1>bantering of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what should and shouldn't be used as</v>

2241
01:34:03.221 --> 01:34:08.221
<v Speaker 1>far as like language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism and sexism and homophobia are</v>

2242
01:34:08.561 --> 01:34:11.200
<v Speaker 1>almost meaningless now because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>applied to almost everything.</v>

2243
01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:12.191
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2244
01:34:12.191 --> 01:34:13.930
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like Chinese food has been</v>

2245
01:34:13.931 --> 01:34:15.670
<v Speaker 1>called racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2246
01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:19.210
<v Speaker 1>you can even say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like Chinese people and not</v>

2247
01:34:19.211 --> 01:34:20.620
<v Speaker 1>necessarily be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2248
01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:22.060
<v Speaker 1>That's just a cultural preference.</v>

2249
01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2250
01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:27.670
<v Speaker 1>if you say Chinese people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>biologically,</v>

2251
01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:30.610
<v Speaker 1>naturally better at math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is racist.</v>

2252
01:34:30.611 --> 01:34:31.421
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you say,</v>

2253
01:34:31.421 --> 01:34:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't like Chinese people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's racist.</v>

2254
01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Not in a general the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily you,</v>

2255
01:34:36.850 --> 01:34:40.090
<v Speaker 1>but you're generalizing about a billion</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus people.</v>

2256
01:34:40.091 --> 01:34:40.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2257
01:34:40.511 --> 01:34:41.620
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>

2258
01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:43.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ignorance and it's a gross</v>

2259
01:34:43.841 --> 01:34:46.480
<v Speaker 1>generalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not necessarily a belief that</v>

2260
01:34:46.481 --> 01:34:49.720
<v Speaker 1>they are biologically distinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be a preference.</v>

2261
01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:52.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't like the way they look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feed,</v>

2262
01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:55.770
<v Speaker 1>you don't wear the clothes they wear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2263
01:34:55.810 --> 01:34:56.531
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

2264
01:34:56.531 --> 01:34:58.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in the jasmine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2265
01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:01.880
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like using fois silk,</v>

2266
01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:05.330
<v Speaker 1>all these silk paddler's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I even saying?</v>

2267
01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2268
01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:08.170
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2269
01:35:08.690 --> 01:35:12.680
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 1>another get over this as a race.</v>

2270
01:35:12.681 --> 01:35:15.370
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to get over</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous vice president.</v>

2271
01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a race.</v>

2272
01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as a human race.</v>

2273
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:23.950
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to get over that</v>
<v Speaker 1>origins or your ancestors and languages</v>

2274
01:35:24.531 --> 01:35:27.380
<v Speaker 1>that you speak and just be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate each other for what the fuck</v>

2275
01:35:27.381 --> 01:35:30.770
<v Speaker 1>we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how's that going to happen?</v>

2276
01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:31.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>

2277
01:35:31.791 --> 01:35:33.650
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to get rid of cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>

2278
01:35:33.651 --> 01:35:34.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2279
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:35.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what I'm saying.</v>

2280
01:35:35.131 --> 01:35:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying appreciate each other for</v>

2281
01:35:37.011 --> 01:35:42.011
<v Speaker 1>what we are and just this idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can generalize or be racist and</v>

2282
01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:45.920
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be a counterproductive</v>

2283
01:35:45.921 --> 01:35:47.840
<v Speaker 1>idea that I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2284
01:35:47.841 --> 01:35:48.674
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2285
01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:53.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a kin to tribalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of dissipating and</v>

2286
01:35:53.211 --> 01:35:56.120
<v Speaker 1>nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was also sort of dissipating over</v>

2287
01:35:56.121 --> 01:35:59.630
<v Speaker 1>time as we integrate with all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>other cultures all throughout the world.</v>

2288
01:35:59.631 --> 01:36:03.080
<v Speaker 1>And you have google translate and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can understand what people were saying</v>

2289
01:36:03.081 --> 01:36:07.010
<v Speaker 1>and other places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because of the separations of</v>

2290
01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.920
<v Speaker 1>languages and cultures and things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2291
01:36:09.921 --> 01:36:13.250
<v Speaker 1>you're always going to have people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are wary of people that they don't know</v>

2292
01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:14.113
<v Speaker 1>or understand.</v>

2293
01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:16.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classical racism has declined</v>

2294
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:18.560
<v Speaker 1>dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2295
01:36:18.561 --> 01:36:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last hundred years.</v>

2296
01:36:19.581 --> 01:36:20.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until World War II,</v>

2297
01:36:20.901 --> 01:36:22.640
<v Speaker 1>it was dominant and respectable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2298
01:36:22.641 --> 01:36:25.280
<v Speaker 1>it was taught and at Harvard and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivy League schools,</v>

2299
01:36:25.281 --> 01:36:26.570
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone talked about,</v>

2300
01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:27.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about braces?</v>

2301
01:36:27.731 --> 01:36:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Interracial couples like black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2302
01:36:30.090 --> 01:36:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Connie was illegal rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal for them to get married and so</v>

2303
01:36:32.301 --> 01:36:33.380
<v Speaker 1>many teen sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2304
01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:36.590
<v Speaker 1>And so that was all replaced after World</v>
<v Speaker 1>War II,</v>

2305
01:36:36.591 --> 01:36:37.250
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2306
01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:40.160
<v Speaker 1>in respectable discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that racists went away,</v>

2307
01:36:40.161 --> 01:36:42.860
<v Speaker 1>but in respectable discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't use the n word anymore.</v>

2308
01:36:42.861 --> 01:36:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2309
01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:45.340
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2310
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:48.440
<v Speaker 1>what road was replaced by is what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>call racial liberalism,</v>

2311
01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:51.080
<v Speaker 1>which is this paternalist stuff we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been talking about that goes on in</v>

2312
01:36:51.081 --> 01:36:54.260
<v Speaker 1>campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was assimilationist as well.</v>

2313
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:58.010
<v Speaker 1>The idea was we need to get these black</v>
<v Speaker 1>people into our institutions to train</v>

2314
01:36:58.011 --> 01:36:59.200
<v Speaker 1>them to become like us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2315
01:36:59.201 --> 01:37:01.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a Brown v Board of education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1954,</v>

2316
01:37:01.311 --> 01:37:03.380
<v Speaker 1>the integration supreme court decision.</v>

2317
01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:07.130
<v Speaker 1>That was what was said in that decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to get black people into our</v>

2318
01:37:07.131 --> 01:37:10.250
<v Speaker 1>schools so that we can make them into</v>
<v Speaker 1>good citizens,</v>

2319
01:37:10.251 --> 01:37:12.020
<v Speaker 1>good soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and good workers.</v>

2320
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what these black kids in</v>

2321
01:37:15.201 --> 01:37:16.730
<v Speaker 1>colleges are dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2322
01:37:16.731 --> 01:37:19.670
<v Speaker 1>So they're not completely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have real legitimate grievances.</v>

2323
01:37:19.671 --> 01:37:22.640
<v Speaker 1>They are there for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

2324
01:37:22.641 --> 01:37:25.610
<v Speaker 1>to assimilate into the dominant culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2325
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:28.310
<v Speaker 1>To shed their own culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so cool.</v>

2326
01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:30.020
<v Speaker 1>And to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this has been said,</v>

2327
01:37:30.021 --> 01:37:34.400
<v Speaker 1>it's very explicit to enrich the</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences of the white students in</v>

2328
01:37:34.401 --> 01:37:35.870
<v Speaker 1>colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

2329
01:37:35.871 --> 01:37:38.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a diversity has been stated as</v>
<v Speaker 1>its purpose.</v>

2330
01:37:38.451 --> 01:37:42.920
<v Speaker 1>So bringing in African students will</v>
<v Speaker 1>enrich the American students from</v>

2331
01:37:42.921 --> 01:37:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Nebraska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the argument that has been made</v>

2332
01:37:45.381 --> 01:37:49.760
<v Speaker 1>explicitly for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White kids benefit from being around</v>

2333
01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:52.070
<v Speaker 1>other cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people's,</v>

2334
01:37:52.071 --> 01:37:53.930
<v Speaker 1>other races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How bizarre.</v>

2335
01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:54.891
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2336
01:37:54.891 --> 01:37:59.891
<v Speaker 1>but imagine being the one black kid in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the class of 20 people or 30 people.</v>

2337
01:38:01.230 --> 01:38:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And knowing that you're there for that</v>

2338
01:38:03.391 --> 01:38:05.730
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would make me crazy.</v>

2339
01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:07.650
<v Speaker 1>It'd be pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would make you pissed off.</v>

2340
01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2341
01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's actually the source of a</v>

2342
01:38:10.021 --> 01:38:13.350
<v Speaker 1>lot of the rage that's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets expressed in all kinds of funky</v>

2343
01:38:13.351 --> 01:38:16.410
<v Speaker 1>ways that I'm not a fan of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do think that's at the heart of a</v>

2344
01:38:16.411 --> 01:38:19.220
<v Speaker 1>lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2345
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:22.050
<v Speaker 1>That has to be acknowledged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the students do say this.</v>

2346
01:38:22.051 --> 01:38:22.591
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>

2347
01:38:22.591 --> 01:38:23.940
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them I think are,</v>

2348
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:27.150
<v Speaker 1>are aware of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This tokenism that goes on and</v>

2349
01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:30.090
<v Speaker 1>assimilation ism and they know they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that class for that reason.</v>

2350
01:38:30.330 --> 01:38:31.800
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of disgusting.</v>

2351
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:33.750
<v Speaker 1>What are your feelings on Trans Racial</v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

2352
01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Rachel Dolezal and the the guy who</v>

2353
01:38:37.021 --> 01:38:40.320
<v Speaker 1>was until recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in the black lives matter and</v>

2354
01:38:40.321 --> 01:38:41.154
<v Speaker 1>they found that shocking.</v>

2355
01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2356
01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.910
<v Speaker 1>I believe what I believe that his father</v>
<v Speaker 1>was black,</v>

2357
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:47.580
<v Speaker 1>but his mom and his dad are both white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2358
01:38:47.581 --> 01:38:50.100
<v Speaker 1>the story is that his mom had an affair</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a black man.</v>

2359
01:38:50.101 --> 01:38:53.490
<v Speaker 1>It's only his story and unsubstantiated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2360
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:55.590
<v Speaker 1>He was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He refuses to take DNA tests.</v>

2361
01:38:55.650 --> 01:38:58.140
<v Speaker 1>But you agreed that racism is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2362
01:38:58.141 --> 01:39:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have many times I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even these,</v>

2363
01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:06.220
<v Speaker 1>he's got the little pencil thin mustache</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to try to accentuate the,</v>

2364
01:39:06.221 --> 01:39:07.920
<v Speaker 1>but you said there's only an American</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks.</v>

2365
01:39:08.050 --> 01:39:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you said there's only one human race</v>

2366
01:39:12.490 --> 01:39:14.460
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all a con studies.</v>

2367
01:39:14.670 --> 01:39:17.100
<v Speaker 1>He's appropriating African American</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

2368
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think.</v>

2369
01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:19.800
<v Speaker 1>That's okay too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2370
01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's been stories written</v>

2371
01:39:21.961 --> 01:39:24.750
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where they've gone pretty deep into</v>

2372
01:39:24.751 --> 01:39:29.190
<v Speaker 1>this guy's passed and no one agrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that he wrote on when he was a</v>

2373
01:39:29.191 --> 01:39:32.340
<v Speaker 1>victim of a hate crime back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote his race as white.</v>

2374
01:39:33.150 --> 01:39:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he wrote on the police</v>

2375
01:39:34.261 --> 01:39:36.600
<v Speaker 1>report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're talking about a guy like</v>

2376
01:39:36.601 --> 01:39:37.530
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2377
01:39:37.930 --> 01:39:38.601
<v Speaker 1>just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2378
01:39:38.601 --> 01:39:41.310
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't know and he looks white to me,</v>

2379
01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:43.610
<v Speaker 1>but let's say he is a Rachel Dolezal</v>
<v Speaker 1>type.</v>

2380
01:39:43.611 --> 01:39:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2381
01:39:44.410 --> 01:39:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if race is a social construct than</v>

2382
01:39:47.371 --> 01:39:49.620
<v Speaker 1>their whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will be all Africans.</v>

2383
01:39:49.621 --> 01:39:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Even you take a pasty fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2384
01:39:51.450 --> 01:39:55.110
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all Irish.</v>

2385
01:39:55.170 --> 01:39:56.003
<v Speaker 1>Pink Self.</v>

2386
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:59.820
<v Speaker 1>A little Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian,</v>

2387
01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2388
01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Sean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're African,</v>

2389
01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:03.093
<v Speaker 1>totally African.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2390
01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Well everybody is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's where the cradle of civilization.</v>

2391
01:40:05.970 --> 01:40:07.440
<v Speaker 1>So Shaun King could be whatever he wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

2392
01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:10.080
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what my argument was for Rachel</v>

2393
01:40:10.081 --> 01:40:15.081
<v Speaker 1>dolls me to spray Tan herself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly do herself up in a fro.</v>

2394
01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't it amazing how you had social</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice warriors saying that she</v>

2395
01:40:20.251 --> 01:40:22.740
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Caitlin Jenner,</v>

2396
01:40:22.770 --> 01:40:24.180
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be celebrated.</v>

2397
01:40:24.210 --> 01:40:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my point.</v>

2398
01:40:25.291 --> 01:40:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my point.</v>

2399
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was an amazing moment.</v>

2400
01:40:28.471 --> 01:40:29.790
<v Speaker 1>It's adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That contradiction.</v>

2401
01:40:29.791 --> 01:40:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you decide that you are more</v>

2402
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:37.020
<v Speaker 1>properly identify with people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>African Americans,</v>

2403
01:40:37.170 --> 01:40:41.340
<v Speaker 1>but do you think people would get pissed</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you appropriated the Polish culture?</v>

2404
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Those people wouldn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2405
01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:48.020
<v Speaker 1>My book is full of examples going back</v>
<v Speaker 1>250 years of whites appropriating in a</v>

2406
01:40:48.601 --> 01:40:50.370
<v Speaker 1>celebratory way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black culture,</v>

2407
01:40:50.371 --> 01:40:52.530
<v Speaker 1>loving it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to be black,</v>

2408
01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:54.400
<v Speaker 1>as many of them have claimed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>

2409
01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:59.400
<v Speaker 1>There was a jazz musician named Mez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mez Rao in the 20th century who he said,</v>

2410
01:40:59.710 --> 01:41:01.420
<v Speaker 1>he never said he was actually black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he said,</v>

2411
01:41:01.421 --> 01:41:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm renouncing my whiteness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be with black people.</v>

2412
01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:06.820
<v Speaker 1>He married a black woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang out with black people all the time,</v>

2413
01:41:06.821 --> 01:41:08.200
<v Speaker 1>ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he,</v>

2414
01:41:08.201 --> 01:41:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to be wide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He only wanted to be black.</v>

2415
01:41:10.090 --> 01:41:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mine.</v>

2416
01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Why not raise a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2417
01:41:12.641 --> 01:41:13.750
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More fun.</v>

2418
01:41:13.930 --> 01:41:18.100
<v Speaker 1>I just think that when you make stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>up about your past,</v>

2419
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.890
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we find out that's not true.</v>

2420
01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've created some sort of a fantasy</v>

2421
01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:25.660
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2422
01:41:25.661 --> 01:41:28.720
<v Speaker 1>That's not what Mez and Ezra was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was always up front about everything.</v>

2423
01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:30.130
<v Speaker 1>And he was like a Jewish guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2424
01:41:30.131 --> 01:41:30.701
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2425
01:41:30.701 --> 01:41:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not gonna be Jewish anymore.</v>

2426
01:41:32.650 --> 01:41:33.870
<v Speaker 1>I was Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not anymore.</v>

2427
01:41:34.050 --> 01:41:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2428
01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Jewish is not really,</v>

2429
01:41:37.290 --> 01:41:39.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2430
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.550
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish is a weird one though.</v>

2431
01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:42.281
<v Speaker 1>You're asking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2432
01:41:42.281 --> 01:41:43.810
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it's been defined in many</v>

2433
01:41:43.811 --> 01:41:46.210
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a race and a religion and a</v>

2434
01:41:46.211 --> 01:41:46.831
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2435
01:41:46.831 --> 01:41:48.790
<v Speaker 1>I think we talked about this last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Jews,</v>

2436
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:51.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until World War Two were considered to</v>

2437
01:41:51.911 --> 01:41:53.410
<v Speaker 1>be a separate race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much so.</v>

2438
01:41:53.411 --> 01:41:55.600
<v Speaker 1>And there was a debate about whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were black.</v>

2439
01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many scholars thought they were black.</v>

2440
01:41:57.881 --> 01:42:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or whether they were sort of an ape sort</v>

2441
01:42:00.281 --> 01:42:02.260
<v Speaker 1>of missing link,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the missing link,</v>

2442
01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:04.390
<v Speaker 1>or they were just something else</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely.</v>

2443
01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:08.050
<v Speaker 1>But they were definitely not white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's amazing about Jewish people is</v>

2444
01:42:08.051 --> 01:42:11.590
<v Speaker 1>how many European Jews have won Nobel</v>
<v Speaker 1>prizes.</v>

2445
01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:16.150
<v Speaker 1>How many European Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant scientists and mathematicians.</v>

2446
01:42:16.151 --> 01:42:17.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a what?</v>

2447
01:42:17.741 --> 01:42:19.840
<v Speaker 1>A what an amazing gene pool.</v>

2448
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the European Jews.</v>

2449
01:42:21.410 --> 01:42:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always been an intellectual</v>

2450
01:42:22.541 --> 01:42:23.480
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2451
01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:27.220
<v Speaker 1>the rabbis and studying the texts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the town would,</v>

2452
01:42:27.221 --> 01:42:29.320
<v Speaker 1>and you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been a heady intellectual</v>

2453
01:42:29.321 --> 01:42:31.030
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where it comes from.</v>

2454
01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:32.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2455
01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

2456
01:42:33.250 --> 01:42:36.370
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why they're also</v>
<v Speaker 1>overrepresented in politics in</v>

2457
01:42:36.371 --> 01:42:38.490
<v Speaker 1>particular radical politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2458
01:42:39.190 --> 01:42:41.950
<v Speaker 1>if you look at socialism and communism</v>
<v Speaker 1>and anarchism,</v>

2459
01:42:41.951 --> 01:42:42.551
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2460
01:42:42.551 --> 01:42:46.210
<v Speaker 1>huge percentages of Jews participating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's because they're</v>

2461
01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:48.460
<v Speaker 1>essentially intellectual movements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2462
01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

2463
01:42:50.471 --> 01:42:50.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2464
01:42:50.890 --> 01:42:54.280
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

2465
01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge representation in standup comedy.</v>

2466
01:42:56.851 --> 01:42:59.170
<v Speaker 1>It's right from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2467
01:42:59.250 --> 01:43:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't Lenny Bruce Jewish?</v>

2468
01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

2469
01:43:02.071 --> 01:43:03.490
<v Speaker 1>the greatest of the greats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2470
01:43:03.491 --> 01:43:04.420
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without him,</v>

2471
01:43:04.421 --> 01:43:07.480
<v Speaker 1>there would be no modern standup comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I would've taken a lot longer to</v>

2472
01:43:07.481 --> 01:43:07.900
<v Speaker 1>develop.</v>

2473
01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:09.440
<v Speaker 1>It's all blacks and Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2474
01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not comedy.</v>

2475
01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woody Allen,</v>

2476
01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:13.653
<v Speaker 1>mort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saul.</v>

2477
01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes on and on,</v>

2478
01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:19.660
<v Speaker 1>especially that early golden era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that that generation was,</v>

2479
01:43:20.190 --> 01:43:22.690
<v Speaker 1>they would choose dominated for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2480
01:43:22.691 --> 01:43:26.590
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting how many of them were</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in nightclub performing right</v>

2481
01:43:26.591 --> 01:43:30.550
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it amazing that standup comedy is</v>

2482
01:43:30.551 --> 01:43:33.400
<v Speaker 1>nowhere else really in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is now.</v>

2483
01:43:33.401 --> 01:43:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but us just dominates.</v>

2484
01:43:35.501 --> 01:43:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most standup comedy right,</v>

2485
01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:40.060
<v Speaker 1>is in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I wouldn't say that anymore.</v>

2486
01:43:40.090 --> 01:43:42.630
<v Speaker 1>They're a vibrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very vibrant elsewhere.</v>

2487
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Melbourne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

2488
01:43:43.691 --> 01:43:45.110
<v Speaker 1>And they had a vibrant culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2489
01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2490
01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:47.741
<v Speaker 1>Well he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2491
01:43:47.741 --> 01:43:48.574
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's uh,</v>

2492
01:43:48.590 --> 01:43:50.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it was from Sydney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2493
01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:51.920
<v Speaker 1>he might prefer from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2494
01:43:51.921 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 1>where's</v>

2495
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.200
<v Speaker 3>your outside of Sydney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But outside of English speaking</v>

2496
01:43:54.201 --> 01:43:57.740
<v Speaker 3>countries there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just not as big.</v>

2497
01:43:57.770 --> 01:43:59.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well America is where it started.</v>

2498
01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:01.040
<v Speaker 3>That's hard to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2499
01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause we got the fuck away from</v>

2500
01:44:03.231 --> 01:44:05.480
<v Speaker 3>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once we got the fuck away from</v>

2501
01:44:05.481 --> 01:44:08.210
<v Speaker 3>everybody else who started talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So once we started talking shit,</v>

2502
01:44:08.211 --> 01:44:10.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they believe that the first modern</v>

2503
01:44:10.041 --> 01:44:12.410
<v Speaker 3>standup comedian was actually Mark</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twain.</v>

2504
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Mark Twain used to give these readings</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in these readings they would be very</v>

2505
01:44:17.571 --> 01:44:21.470
<v Speaker 3>humorous and he would essentially be</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing a monologue and it was like a</v>

2506
01:44:21.471 --> 01:44:25.880
<v Speaker 3>standup monologue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Mark Twain has some still brilliant,</v>

2507
01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:30.320
<v Speaker 3>insightful and resonating quotes that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote hundreds of years ago.</v>

2508
01:44:30.321 --> 01:44:31.154
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was this?</v>

2509
01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.590
<v Speaker 3>What year was Dwayne?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Late 19th century.</v>

2510
01:44:33.610 --> 01:44:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or a hundred,</v>

2511
01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:35.870
<v Speaker 3>I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More.</v>

2512
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:36.950
<v Speaker 3>A little more than a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2513
01:44:37.190 --> 01:44:38.840
<v Speaker 3>a hundred plus years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2514
01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:42.470
<v Speaker 3>but brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant stuff that he created back</v>

2515
01:44:42.471 --> 01:44:42.680
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

2516
01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:46.220
<v Speaker 3>And he would go on stage in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people and read these things and</v>

2517
01:44:46.221 --> 01:44:49.220
<v Speaker 3>they would laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he became like a humorous</v>

2518
01:44:49.221 --> 01:44:52.640
<v Speaker 3>lecturer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was sort of the beginning of</v>

2519
01:44:52.641 --> 01:44:55.790
<v Speaker 3>standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not Jewish Mark Twain?</v>

2520
01:44:55.850 --> 01:44:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2521
01:44:57.100 --> 01:44:58.120
<v Speaker 3>And not black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

2522
01:44:58.190 --> 01:45:00.680
<v Speaker 3>Although he was certainly influenced by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2523
01:45:00.710 --> 01:45:02.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some other people have said that</v>

2524
01:45:02.271 --> 01:45:04.880
<v Speaker 3>the first standups were ex slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2525
01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:07.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2526
01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:11.230
<v Speaker 3>and Vaudeville it's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vaudeville is happening when Mark</v>

2527
01:45:11.230 --> 01:45:13.850
<v Speaker 3>Twain's going on and there's lots of</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy going on in Vaudeville and that</v>

2528
01:45:13.851 --> 01:45:17.270
<v Speaker 3>was Jewish and black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what kind of speeches they</v>

2529
01:45:17.271 --> 01:45:19.400
<v Speaker 3>would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of jokes they would tell if</v>

2530
01:45:19.401 --> 01:45:20.270
<v Speaker 3>they would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2531
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:21.850
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2532
01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:24.440
<v Speaker 3>the MCS,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's one of the things that Lenny</v>

2533
01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:25.700
<v Speaker 3>Bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's do early in the day.</v>

2534
01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:30.830
<v Speaker 3>He was sort of an MC for other acts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you would tell a few jokes and then</v>

2535
01:45:30.831 --> 01:45:34.010
<v Speaker 3>bring up a band and then tell a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes and bring up a dancer.</v>

2536
01:45:34.190 --> 01:45:38.330
<v Speaker 3>They had these variety shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>variety shows were big deal back then.</v>

2537
01:45:38.690 --> 01:45:41.690
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the MC would often be a standup comedian</v>

2538
01:45:41.691 --> 01:45:45.590
<v Speaker 3>and you'd be armed with jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like the catskills era.</v>

2539
01:45:45.810 --> 01:45:50.330
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the weird things is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had sort of street jokes and like</v>

2540
01:45:50.331 --> 01:45:52.160
<v Speaker 3>you would have jokes and I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2541
01:45:52.161 --> 01:45:53.810
<v Speaker 3>use kind of the same jokes at you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2542
01:45:53.811 --> 01:45:56.840
<v Speaker 3>So you would be in one place and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be in another place and we might</v>

2543
01:45:56.841 --> 01:45:58.640
<v Speaker 3>be doing the same jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2544
01:45:58.641 --> 01:46:03.080
<v Speaker 3>And then Lenny Bruce was like the guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>that started talking about life.</v>

2545
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Whereas instead of having these jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was trying to explain why some of the</v>

2546
01:46:09.741 --> 01:46:11.420
<v Speaker 3>parts of our culture didn't make any</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

2547
01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Why some of the things that we do are</v>
<v Speaker 3>preposterous.</v>

2548
01:46:13.761 --> 01:46:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Why there's these hypocritical aspects</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our society that should be addressed</v>

2549
01:46:17.901 --> 01:46:22.280
<v Speaker 3>and maybe we could live in a better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more happy world if we kind of looked at</v>

2550
01:46:22.281 --> 01:46:26.000
<v Speaker 3>these more more clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was at first to do that.</v>

2551
01:46:26.001 --> 01:46:30.230
<v Speaker 3>So what we think of a standup comedy is</v>
<v Speaker 3>so broad because there's like Steven</v>

2552
01:46:30.230 --> 01:46:32.090
<v Speaker 3>Wright standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like joke,</v>

2553
01:46:32.091 --> 01:46:32.924
<v Speaker 3>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joke,</v>

2554
01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:35.660
<v Speaker 3>you know a non sequiturs not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not connected.</v>

2555
01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:38.420
<v Speaker 3>And then there's George Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>

2556
01:46:38.421 --> 01:46:43.220
<v Speaker 3>he would create sort of a new monologue</v>
<v Speaker 3>every year and then he would do that new</v>

2557
01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:45.950
<v Speaker 3>hour on hbo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw it away and start all over again</v>

2558
01:46:45.951 --> 01:46:48.950
<v Speaker 3>the next year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Observational humor is what you're</v>

2559
01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:49.770
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2560
01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:53.400
<v Speaker 3>With some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like Jerry Seinfeld's observational,</v>

2561
01:46:53.401 --> 01:46:57.120
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't have any like deep</v>
<v Speaker 3>political insight or social inside or</v>

2562
01:46:57.121 --> 01:46:59.670
<v Speaker 3>sexual insight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Lenny Bruce would,</v>

2563
01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:00.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2564
01:47:00.110 --> 01:47:02.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's more restricted in his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sir,</v>

2565
01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:05.850
<v Speaker 3>did you ever known us a deal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He put a sock in the dryer where that's</v>

2566
01:47:05.851 --> 01:47:07.170
<v Speaker 3>all gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>

2567
01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Like that kind of shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's observational.</v>

2568
01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:14.610
<v Speaker 3>There were lenny bruce wasn't the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>political observational comedian though.</v>

2569
01:47:14.611 --> 01:47:16.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>woody Allen was doing that stuff in the</v>

2570
01:47:16.111 --> 01:47:18.810
<v Speaker 3>fifties he wasn't radical like Lenny</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bruce,</v>

2571
01:47:18.811 --> 01:47:23.080
<v Speaker 3>lenny bruce was the first radical</v>
<v Speaker 3>popular observational humorist.</v>

2572
01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:23.791
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2573
01:47:23.791 --> 01:47:25.920
<v Speaker 3>the halls credit him as being the</v>
<v Speaker 3>originator.</v>

2574
01:47:26.130 --> 01:47:29.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if woody Allen was before</v>
<v Speaker 3>woody allen definitely talking about</v>

2575
01:47:29.611 --> 01:47:32.210
<v Speaker 3>politics in the fifties I would like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

2576
01:47:32.250 --> 01:47:34.020
<v Speaker 3>but he was talking about like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>presidential races.</v>

2577
01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:37.350
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't talking about daily life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't talking about race and the way</v>

2578
01:47:37.351 --> 01:47:41.550
<v Speaker 3>that Lenny Bruce did doing some stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some stuff that wasn't even funny.</v>

2579
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:43.590
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the things that he did was</v>

2580
01:47:43.591 --> 01:47:46.530
<v Speaker 3>he was talking about how they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2581
01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:51.560
<v Speaker 3>they lied when Jackie Onassis was</v>
<v Speaker 3>jumping out of the limousine after JFK</v>

2582
01:47:52.231 --> 01:47:54.830
<v Speaker 3>got shot or Jackie Kennedy when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were,</v>

2583
01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:58.770
<v Speaker 3>they were saying that she was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>help him and that she was trying to go</v>

2584
01:47:58.771 --> 01:47:59.250
<v Speaker 3>for help.</v>

2585
01:47:59.250 --> 01:48:00.720
<v Speaker 3>Like she was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he name was like,</v>

2586
01:48:00.721 --> 01:48:04.080
<v Speaker 3>she was saving her ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was trying to get out of that</v>

2587
01:48:04.081 --> 01:48:06.480
<v Speaker 3>fucking limousine because they shot the</v>
<v Speaker 3>president in the head.</v>

2588
01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:09.150
<v Speaker 3>His head exploded and she jumped out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Limo.</v>

2589
01:48:09.450 --> 01:48:11.520
<v Speaker 3>And you're lying to people if you say</v>
<v Speaker 3>any differently.</v>

2590
01:48:11.521 --> 01:48:14.180
<v Speaker 3>And it just like this weird moment when</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was onstage.</v>

2591
01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:17.640
<v Speaker 3>I've heard the recordings where he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>explaining this like he's,</v>

2592
01:48:17.641 --> 01:48:21.900
<v Speaker 3>he's explaining like you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>sell a false narrative about an</v>

2593
01:48:21.901 --> 01:48:24.750
<v Speaker 3>important historical event and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to fuck with people's heads.</v>

2594
01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:27.690
<v Speaker 3>Like of course she's tried to get away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was trying to get away because they</v>

2595
01:48:27.691 --> 01:48:29.900
<v Speaker 3>just shot and killed her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2596
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:32.490
<v Speaker 3>But that wasn't funny at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's like some stuff that he was</v>

2597
01:48:32.491 --> 01:48:33.390
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like,</v>

2598
01:48:33.391 --> 01:48:37.080
<v Speaker 3>he just sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had like crossed this boundary,</v>

2599
01:48:37.081 --> 01:48:40.320
<v Speaker 3>this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange divide into commentary that</v>

2600
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:42.060
<v Speaker 3>mustn't even necessarily funny.</v>

2601
01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:44.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's flipping the script though.</v>

2602
01:48:44.521 --> 01:48:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's turning things upside down even</v>

2603
01:48:46.531 --> 01:48:49.140
<v Speaker 3>when he's not being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily towards the end.</v>

2604
01:48:49.141 --> 01:48:51.120
<v Speaker 3>All he was doing was like reporting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2605
01:48:51.121 --> 01:48:54.060
<v Speaker 3>towards the end when he was going crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would just go on stage with his court</v>

2606
01:48:54.061 --> 01:48:57.090
<v Speaker 3>transcripts and just read from his court</v>
<v Speaker 3>transcripts.</v>

2607
01:48:57.091 --> 01:48:58.830
<v Speaker 3>And people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this?</v>

2608
01:48:58.831 --> 01:49:01.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like you watch videos of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched them.</v>

2609
01:49:01.210 --> 01:49:06.210
<v Speaker 3>There is so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going over finite or find details</v>

2610
01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:12.080
<v Speaker 3>of his court case wasn't neither last</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian to be prosecuted for obscenity.</v>

2611
01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:15.400
<v Speaker 3>I think Karlyn was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Carl Carlos to prosecute him.</v>

2612
01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:16.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2613
01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:18.720
<v Speaker 3>Carla went to jail for obscenity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2614
01:49:18.721 --> 01:49:20.110
<v Speaker 3>he was arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2615
01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll know.</v>

2616
01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:25.170
<v Speaker 3>I'll know how much he went through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>court system in regards to it,</v>

2617
01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:27.180
<v Speaker 3>but I know for sure he was arrested for</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2618
01:49:27.570 --> 01:49:31.110
<v Speaker 3>Murders for our freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

2619
01:49:31.111 --> 01:49:32.580
<v Speaker 3>Great Heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2620
01:49:32.610 --> 01:49:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Well if it wasn't for those guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>exposing how ridiculous and I mean our</v>

2621
01:49:37.141 --> 01:49:40.410
<v Speaker 3>culture went through this radical shift</v>
<v Speaker 3>right from the fifties,</v>

2622
01:49:40.411 --> 01:49:43.200
<v Speaker 3>the 60s,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties to seventies and they tried to</v>

2623
01:49:43.201 --> 01:49:47.770
<v Speaker 3>put a cork on it in the 70s and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sweeping psychedelic legislation</v>

2624
01:49:47.771 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 3>that was</v>

2625
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:49.180
<v Speaker 1>passed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2626
01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:52.690
<v Speaker 1>in the 1970 where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fucking made everything's scheduled</v>

2627
01:49:52.691 --> 01:49:55.230
<v Speaker 1>one and they started locking down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2628
01:49:55.720 --> 01:50:00.310
<v Speaker 1>what you can and can't do that there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>some big giant shifts.</v>

2629
01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:04.720
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the shift in our culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>between 1950 and in 1980,</v>

2630
01:50:04.930 --> 01:50:07.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a crazy fucking 30 years.</v>

2631
01:50:07.870 --> 01:50:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Whereas opposed to you look at like 1980</v>
<v Speaker 1>to today,</v>

2632
01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:17.400
<v Speaker 1>not nearly as 85 to 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you get is more information.</v>

2633
01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:19.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the clothes don't look as</v>

2634
01:50:19.841 --> 01:50:21.490
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2635
01:50:21.491 --> 01:50:24.580
<v Speaker 1>no one's wearing z cavariccis and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know about that.</v>

2636
01:50:24.581 --> 01:50:27.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think there's been many</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutions and you know,</v>

2637
01:50:27.670 --> 01:50:30.070
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of freedom of speech,</v>

2638
01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:32.350
<v Speaker 1>I think we were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're saying things we didn't say five</v>

2639
01:50:32.351 --> 01:50:34.990
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bajan lost 100%.</v>

2640
01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:36.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the big heroes in this,</v>

2641
01:50:36.251 --> 01:50:39.910
<v Speaker 1>he never gets talked about in this way</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Larry Flynt had it.</v>

2642
01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:45.040
<v Speaker 1>He waged many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many successful court cases on obscenity</v>

2643
01:50:45.610 --> 01:50:48.670
<v Speaker 1>issues and he went all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way to the Supreme Court and he</v>

2644
01:50:48.671 --> 01:50:51.730
<v Speaker 1>won many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he really opened up a lot of space</v>

2645
01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:55.030
<v Speaker 1>for speech in the media and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his seventies,</v>

2646
01:50:55.031 --> 01:50:56.860
<v Speaker 1>80s and 90s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting point.</v>

2647
01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:57.850
<v Speaker 1>There's no one would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2648
01:50:57.910 --> 01:51:02.830
<v Speaker 1>even if they did believe that was true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would leave that out because he's a</v>

2649
01:51:02.831 --> 01:51:03.571
<v Speaker 1>pornographer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2650
01:51:03.571 --> 01:51:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2651
01:51:04.530 --> 01:51:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Not Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2652
01:51:05.770 --> 01:51:08.140
<v Speaker 1>He wanted me to write the foreword to</v>
<v Speaker 1>his book.</v>

2653
01:51:08.230 --> 01:51:09.063
<v Speaker 1>Did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2654
01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:13.720
<v Speaker 1>I did not because of who he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because the book was not a good book</v>

2655
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:16.720
<v Speaker 1>and I did my name associated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't not have well done book.</v>

2656
01:51:16.721 --> 01:51:18.640
<v Speaker 1>But what was the book about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had lunch with them.</v>

2657
01:51:19.210 --> 01:51:21.280
<v Speaker 1>It was a fascinating experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2658
01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:25.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a book about the sex scandals of</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents.</v>

2659
01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:27.190
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not interesting.</v>

2660
01:51:27.250 --> 01:51:29.440
<v Speaker 1>It's stuff that's just not very</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

2661
01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Sex scandals of presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sexual secrets of the presidents.</v>

2662
01:51:34.030 --> 01:51:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't Nixon supposed to be gay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were all supposed to be gay.</v>

2663
01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them.</v>

2664
01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:40.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lots and had like a little dog</v>

2665
01:51:40.270 --> 01:51:42.250
<v Speaker 1>and a boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They traveled everywhere.</v>

2666
01:51:42.270 --> 01:51:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Never heard of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nixon being gay.</v>

2667
01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never heard that.</v>

2668
01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody wrote a book about it recently.</v>

2669
01:51:46.421 --> 01:51:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Nixon was definitely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was locked.</v>

2670
01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:50.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2671
01:51:50.830 --> 01:51:52.840
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was an unusual man,</v>

2672
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:56.130
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was definitely unusual fastener into</v>

2673
01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:59.440
<v Speaker 1>strange castering bizarre man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever,</v>

2674
01:51:59.441 --> 01:52:02.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see hunter s Thompson's interview where</v>

2675
01:52:02.431 --> 01:52:06.190
<v Speaker 1>you talked about sharing a limousine</v>
<v Speaker 1>ride with Nixon because Nixon want to</v>

2676
01:52:06.191 --> 01:52:09.610
<v Speaker 1>talk to them about football because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew that a hunter was a football</v>

2677
01:52:09.611 --> 01:52:10.960
<v Speaker 1>fanatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>

2678
01:52:10.961 --> 01:52:11.800
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2679
01:52:11.801 --> 01:52:13.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about politics at all deal.</v>

2680
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.591
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2681
01:52:14.591 --> 01:52:17.440
<v Speaker 1>And they got it and they just talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about football and Nixon apparently knew</v>

2682
01:52:17.441 --> 01:52:20.200
<v Speaker 1>about first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second round draft picks and guys from</v>

2683
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:24.310
<v Speaker 1>obscure colleges and Nixon was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>football fanatic and hunter and Nixon</v>

2684
01:52:24.311 --> 01:52:28.990
<v Speaker 1>just shared this limousine ride to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>airport and just talk nothing about</v>

2685
01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:31.900
<v Speaker 1>about nothing but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but football then he definitely wasn't</v>

2686
01:52:31.901 --> 01:52:33.340
<v Speaker 1>gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2687
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:36.220
<v Speaker 1>This is when it was just a lot of gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that like football.</v>

2688
01:52:36.450 --> 01:52:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this was when hunter was doing fear</v>

2689
01:52:38.831 --> 01:52:40.990
<v Speaker 1>and loathing on the campaign trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2690
01:52:40.991 --> 01:52:44.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they understood quite the</v>

2691
01:52:44.111 --> 01:52:46.240
<v Speaker 1>extent of how deranged</v>

2692
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:50.420
<v Speaker 3>honner was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took a chance with him in the</v>

2693
01:52:50.421 --> 01:52:52.040
<v Speaker 3>fucking limousine with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2694
01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:55.070
<v Speaker 3>with the president only in the 70s.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2695
01:52:55.071 --> 01:52:58.220
<v Speaker 3>Would that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a total 70 story.</v>

2696
01:52:58.250 --> 01:52:58.821
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2697
01:52:58.821 --> 01:53:02.120
<v Speaker 3>especially a president like Nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

2698
01:53:02.590 --> 01:53:04.880
<v Speaker 3>he was one of the oddest presidents</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

2699
01:53:05.450 --> 01:53:06.140
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2700
01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:08.980
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to think of another man even</v>
<v Speaker 3>remotely like him.</v>

2701
01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:10.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just thinking about like sort of</v>

2702
01:53:10.911 --> 01:53:13.760
<v Speaker 3>establishment figures mixing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>countercultural people.</v>

2703
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:15.790
<v Speaker 3>You would never see that now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2704
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:19.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they kind of knew totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>how counterculture a hunter was.</v>

2705
01:53:19.311 --> 01:53:22.620
<v Speaker 3>Like he would show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the things in the Gonzo fear</v>

2706
01:53:22.621 --> 01:53:23.660
<v Speaker 3>and loathing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2707
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:24.331
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2708
01:53:24.331 --> 01:53:24.771
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2709
01:53:24.771 --> 01:53:27.200
<v Speaker 3>the life and times of hunter s Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2710
01:53:27.201 --> 01:53:29.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the documentary sort of talked about how</v>

2711
01:53:29.181 --> 01:53:33.110
<v Speaker 3>when he decided to write that book and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went to,</v>

2712
01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:34.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2713
01:53:34.121 --> 01:53:36.920
<v Speaker 3>the campaign trail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was on it for a year and nobody knew</v>

2714
01:53:36.921 --> 01:53:40.400
<v Speaker 3>who he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's like all the politicians,</v>

2715
01:53:40.401 --> 01:53:42.680
<v Speaker 3>they all knew the other writers from all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these other places.</v>

2716
01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:46.580
<v Speaker 3>And Hunter would show up and all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people wanted to take photos with them.</v>

2717
01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:47.660
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is this guy's,</v>

2718
01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:48.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the astronaut or something like,</v>

2719
01:53:48.951 --> 01:53:50.240
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody knew who the fuck he was.</v>

2720
01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:52.640
<v Speaker 3>And then some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause he'd already written fear and</v>

2721
01:53:52.641 --> 01:53:56.390
<v Speaker 3>loathing in Las Vegas and hell's angels</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hugely popular books.</v>

2722
01:53:56.391 --> 01:54:00.350
<v Speaker 3>But these people had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just were so outside of that</v>

2723
01:54:00.351 --> 01:54:03.290
<v Speaker 3>cultural loop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of let this guy in and didn't</v>

2724
01:54:03.291 --> 01:54:05.390
<v Speaker 3>know who he was until it was almost too</v>
<v Speaker 3>late.</v>

2725
01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:06.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But can you imagine the Obama</v>

2726
01:54:06.791 --> 01:54:09.410
<v Speaker 2>administration not vetting the shit out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of someone like that?</v>

2727
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:10.540
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2728
01:54:10.630 --> 01:54:11.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine.</v>

2729
01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2730
01:54:14.290 --> 01:54:14.920
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2731
01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:17.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what he did was he found Mark Marin.</v>

2732
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:20.590
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And went on that podcast and I,</v>

2733
01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:25.570
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted at mark and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what George Carlin say about a standup</v>

2734
01:54:25.571 --> 01:54:30.571
<v Speaker 2>comedian giving a platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an uncritical platform to a politician</v>

2735
01:54:31.150 --> 01:54:33.520
<v Speaker 2>or a head of state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he blocked me.</v>

2736
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:36.190
<v Speaker 2>He blocked too because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a pussy.</v>

2737
01:54:36.250 --> 01:54:39.190
<v Speaker 2>But I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he blocked you for that question.</v>

2738
01:54:39.191 --> 01:54:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2739
01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:42.220
<v Speaker 2>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

2740
01:54:42.221 --> 01:54:42.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2741
01:54:42.650 --> 01:54:45.430
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like for him to answer the</v>

2742
01:54:45.431 --> 01:54:48.430
<v Speaker 2>question because it really bothered me</v>
<v Speaker 2>what bothered you.</v>

2743
01:54:48.431 --> 01:54:50.020
<v Speaker 2>But he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he gave this platform.</v>

2744
01:54:50.230 --> 01:54:51.730
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he had brought him on and asked him</v>

2745
01:54:51.731 --> 01:54:52.810
<v Speaker 2>hard questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

2746
01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't,</v>

2747
01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:55.660
<v Speaker 2>it was clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2748
01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:57.900
<v Speaker 2>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Obama administration found mirror</v>

2749
01:54:57.901 --> 01:54:59.980
<v Speaker 2>and knew that it would be safe and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were right.</v>

2750
01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Marin delivered for them.</v>

2751
01:55:03.161 --> 01:55:06.490
<v Speaker 2>He just gave him softball questions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't challenge him one bit.</v>

2752
01:55:06.491 --> 01:55:08.050
<v Speaker 2>And basically Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you listen to it,</v>

2753
01:55:08.051 --> 01:55:10.270
<v Speaker 2>but just basically given like an hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>long speech,</v>

2754
01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:13.540
<v Speaker 2>that's all it was in Marin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of celebrated him and cheer them</v>

2755
01:55:13.541 --> 01:55:16.060
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought this is,</v>

2756
01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:19.270
<v Speaker 2>this is a countercultural and quotes</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian,</v>

2757
01:55:19.630 --> 01:55:20.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doing this.</v>

2758
01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:23.200
<v Speaker 2>That's what countercultural comedians</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2759
01:55:23.230 --> 01:55:26.170
<v Speaker 2>I thought that they challenged power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They asked questions of power.</v>

2760
01:55:26.171 --> 01:55:28.480
<v Speaker 2>They made power absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Lenny Bruce did.</v>

2761
01:55:28.481 --> 01:55:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Like George Carlin did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like the opposite to me of what</v>

2762
01:55:31.181 --> 01:55:34.020
<v Speaker 2>standup comedians should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily think I would</v>

2763
01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:36.520
<v Speaker 2>categorize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mark has countercultural.</v>

2764
01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:36.981
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2765
01:55:36.981 --> 01:55:38.200
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's thought of that way.</v>

2766
01:55:38.830 --> 01:55:41.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he is at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's absolutely establishment</v>

2767
01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:42.910
<v Speaker 2>and conservative in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

2768
01:55:42.911 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's considered to</v>

2769
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:47.940
<v Speaker 3>be by many to be sorta countercultural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always thought of him as like a guy</v>

2770
01:55:47.941 --> 01:55:52.230
<v Speaker 3>who like looks at himself and kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>mocks himself and mocks but not like,</v>

2771
01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:55.320
<v Speaker 3>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know like Doug Stan hope will be</v>

2772
01:55:55.321 --> 01:56:00.120
<v Speaker 3>much more counter culture but also</v>
<v Speaker 3>degenerate drunk.</v>

2773
01:56:00.121 --> 01:56:03.180
<v Speaker 3>And the last person that Obama would sit</v>
<v Speaker 3>down with,</v>

2774
01:56:03.181 --> 01:56:07.200
<v Speaker 3>and if I had them on I would have to ask</v>
<v Speaker 3>him questions about drones.</v>

2775
01:56:07.201 --> 01:56:12.201
<v Speaker 3>I'd ask him what does it feel like to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>too to be a part of a program that has</v>

2776
01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:18.090
<v Speaker 3>80 plus percent depending on who you ask</v>
<v Speaker 3>innocent casualty rates.</v>

2777
01:56:18.450 --> 01:56:21.380
<v Speaker 3>Like what is it like to make these</v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions knowing that people are going</v>

2778
01:56:21.381 --> 01:56:23.820
<v Speaker 3>to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it like when you,</v>

2779
01:56:23.821 --> 01:56:28.821
<v Speaker 3>when you see someone like Edward Snowden</v>
<v Speaker 3>come out against the NSA's spying</v>

2780
01:56:29.791 --> 01:56:34.710
<v Speaker 3>platform and then you realize that on</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own campaign when the hope and</v>

2781
01:56:34.711 --> 01:56:38.250
<v Speaker 3>change website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had all these provisions in there to</v>

2782
01:56:38.251 --> 01:56:43.251
<v Speaker 3>protect and and help whistleblowers</v>
<v Speaker 3>whistleblowers who were exposing actual</v>

2783
01:56:43.441 --> 01:56:44.670
<v Speaker 3>laws that are being broken.</v>

2784
01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:47.490
<v Speaker 3>Like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did you make this change?</v>

2785
01:56:47.491 --> 01:56:49.320
<v Speaker 3>Like what is your thought process behind</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

2786
01:56:49.321 --> 01:56:50.700
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about a guy like</v>

2787
01:56:50.701 --> 01:56:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Julian assange?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about someone like</v>

2788
01:56:52.441 --> 01:56:54.720
<v Speaker 3>Chelsea Manning?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about someone who</v>

2789
01:56:54.721 --> 01:56:59.640
<v Speaker 3>delivers information to a new source and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that new source exposes things that are</v>

2790
01:56:59.641 --> 01:57:03.240
<v Speaker 3>absolutely crimes that the United States</v>
<v Speaker 3>public hates,</v>

2791
01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:05.760
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people don't ever want to think of</v>

2792
01:57:05.761 --> 01:57:09.660
<v Speaker 3>when they think of the American people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they think of this good just um,</v>

2793
01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:13.590
<v Speaker 3>leader of democracy in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He don't want to think about those</v>

2794
01:57:13.591 --> 01:57:16.350
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is why Obama will never be in</v>

2795
01:57:16.351 --> 01:57:17.670
<v Speaker 3>this chair that I'm sitting in right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2796
01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:19.350
<v Speaker 3>He might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might take a chance.</v>

2797
01:57:19.470 --> 01:57:21.240
<v Speaker 3>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just disqualified yourself.</v>

2798
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:23.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that because I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are questions that he probably has</v>

2799
01:57:23.881 --> 01:57:26.070
<v Speaker 3>answers to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that he doesn't have</v>

2800
01:57:26.071 --> 01:57:27.000
<v Speaker 3>answers to those questions.</v>

2801
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.130
<v Speaker 3>I think those are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very complicated subject.</v>

2802
01:57:29.131 --> 01:57:33.240
<v Speaker 3>Do you not want him being challenged in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a freewheeling way for three hours?</v>

2803
01:57:33.330 --> 01:57:34.770
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they chose Marin.</v>

2804
01:57:35.010 --> 01:57:37.680
<v Speaker 3>We'll also Marin's not live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not live,</v>

2805
01:57:37.681 --> 01:57:40.410
<v Speaker 3>but he also worked for Air America and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>knew what his politics were.</v>

2806
01:57:40.770 --> 01:57:43.440
<v Speaker 3>They knew he wasn't going to challenge a</v>
<v Speaker 3>super liberal the way that you would.</v>

2807
01:57:43.441 --> 01:57:45.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he sort of party line liberal,</v>

2808
01:57:45.210 --> 01:57:46.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2809
01:57:46.741 --> 01:57:47.700
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2810
01:57:47.701 --> 01:57:48.870
<v Speaker 3>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2811
01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:52.200
<v Speaker 3>standup comedians should never be giving</v>
<v Speaker 3>a platform to a politician.</v>

2812
01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to talk to Bernie Sanders.</v>

2813
01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:57.840
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy Kimmel did that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had had obama basically made them just</v>

2814
01:57:57.841 --> 01:58:01.500
<v Speaker 3>look cool and hip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just really pisses me off.</v>

2815
01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:04.020
<v Speaker 3>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that this you Ui more or less than</v>

2816
01:58:04.021 --> 01:58:06.600
<v Speaker 3>when Jimmy cried for the lion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2817
01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know he cried for Cecil the</v>

2818
01:58:08.701 --> 01:58:09.000
<v Speaker 3>lion.</v>

2819
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.190
<v Speaker 3>We did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was very upset that the dentist who</v>

2820
01:58:11.191 --> 01:58:14.310
<v Speaker 3>he named on his television show who</v>
<v Speaker 3>legally killed that line,</v>

2821
01:58:14.430 --> 01:58:15.710
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just made lions.</v>

2822
01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:16.573
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2823
01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:19.410
<v Speaker 3>they put them under some endangered</v>
<v Speaker 3>species protection.</v>

2824
01:58:19.590 --> 01:58:21.180
<v Speaker 3>So now nobody has to worry about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2825
01:58:21.181 --> 01:58:23.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you're allowed to be an</v>
<v Speaker 3>American.</v>

2826
01:58:23.490 --> 01:58:26.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you're allowed to go over</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Africa and kill lions anymore.</v>

2827
01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:29.730
<v Speaker 3>As far as I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the recent provision.</v>

2828
01:58:29.731 --> 01:58:32.970
<v Speaker 3>Americans aren't allowed to kill lions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that's what they've,</v>

2829
01:58:32.971 --> 01:58:35.060
<v Speaker 3>just because there's an ancient scan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2830
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:36.650
<v Speaker 3>you certainly can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2831
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:38.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And well not just Africans,</v>

2832
01:58:38.521 --> 01:58:40.140
<v Speaker 3>but people from other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

2833
01:58:40.141 --> 01:58:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how the law works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a,</v>

2834
01:58:41.861 --> 01:58:42.694
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2835
01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:45.670
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

2836
01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:49.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

2837
01:58:51.250 --> 01:58:56.250
<v Speaker 3>I think certainly that there are animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this world that are beautiful and</v>

2838
01:58:56.861 --> 01:58:59.890
<v Speaker 3>she'd be protected and I don't think you</v>
<v Speaker 3>should really kill things that you're</v>

2839
01:58:59.891 --> 01:59:00.724
<v Speaker 3>not going to eat.</v>

2840
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:04.930
<v Speaker 3>And I don't necessarily understand why</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody would want to go to a place like</v>

2841
01:59:04.931 --> 01:59:09.640
<v Speaker 3>Africa and kill a lion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's incredibly complicated when you</v>

2842
01:59:09.641 --> 01:59:14.641
<v Speaker 3>look at the reality of what these</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting camps are in Africa because they</v>

2843
01:59:14.891 --> 01:59:18.070
<v Speaker 3>have taken these animals that were on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brink of extinction and they've made</v>

2844
01:59:18.071 --> 01:59:20.560
<v Speaker 3>them plentiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way they've done that is by</v>

2845
01:59:20.561 --> 01:59:22.450
<v Speaker 3>fencing in these enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2846
01:59:22.451 --> 01:59:25.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100,000,</v>

2847
01:59:25.301 --> 01:59:29.380
<v Speaker 3>200,000 Acre areas and turn them into</v>
<v Speaker 3>these hunting preserves and they bred</v>

2848
01:59:29.381 --> 01:59:31.150
<v Speaker 3>these animals in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of fucked up.</v>

2849
01:59:31.151 --> 01:59:36.151
<v Speaker 3>It's canned hunting and they have areas</v>
<v Speaker 3>where these lions are free roaming like</v>

2850
01:59:36.791 --> 01:59:41.410
<v Speaker 3>in Zimbabwe where I'm this cecil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lion was killed where there's areas</v>

2851
01:59:41.411 --> 01:59:44.410
<v Speaker 3>where they're preserved or they're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to hunt and then areas where</v>

2852
01:59:44.411 --> 01:59:49.240
<v Speaker 3>they are allowed to hunt and that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>money that goes to these hunts is what</v>

2853
01:59:49.241 --> 01:59:50.550
<v Speaker 3>pays for conservation.</v>

2854
01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:53.200
<v Speaker 3>It's super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's super conflicted.</v>

2855
01:59:53.201 --> 01:59:55.210
<v Speaker 3>What do hunters need?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need animals.</v>

2856
01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:58.510
<v Speaker 3>They need to conserve animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are naturally necessarily</v>

2857
01:59:58.511 --> 02:00:00.880
<v Speaker 3>conservationists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean in that sense,</v>

2858
02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:02.920
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sierra club and hundreds organizations</v>

2859
02:00:02.921 --> 02:00:05.020
<v Speaker 3>have worked together on many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many things for this reason,</v>

2860
02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:08.620
<v Speaker 3>but it just seems counter intuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>productive.</v>

2861
02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:13.540
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me shooting something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never planned on eating unless it's</v>

2862
02:00:13.541 --> 02:00:15.640
<v Speaker 3>a danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's one thing they have to do,</v>

2863
02:00:15.641 --> 02:00:17.590
<v Speaker 3>like they have to shoot certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of coyotes.</v>

2864
02:00:17.591 --> 02:00:20.470
<v Speaker 3>If they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm the cattle ranchers have calves,</v>

2865
02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:24.670
<v Speaker 3>they have to be very careful because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes will literally pull the calves</v>

2866
02:00:24.671 --> 02:00:27.940
<v Speaker 3>out of the females as they're giving</v>
<v Speaker 3>birth and kill the calves.</v>

2867
02:00:27.941 --> 02:00:28.750
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2868
02:00:28.750 --> 02:00:32.980
<v Speaker 3>they have to keep them away if they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep a healthy population of cows and</v>

2869
02:00:32.981 --> 02:00:35.740
<v Speaker 3>sheep and a lot of other animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense to me.</v>

2870
02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:39.040
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to manage Predator populations,</v>

2871
02:00:39.490 --> 02:00:43.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's not what you're doing when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>fly to Africa to go shoot a lion,</v>

2872
02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:45.130
<v Speaker 3>you're just want to put a head on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>wall.</v>

2873
02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:46.900
<v Speaker 3>It's something kind of creepy about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2874
02:00:46.901 --> 02:00:49.000
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's why people responded</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they did.</v>

2875
02:00:49.870 --> 02:00:51.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've never had a desire to hunt,</v>

2876
02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:54.910
<v Speaker 3>but I can understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose why someone would want to do</v>

2877
02:00:54.911 --> 02:00:55.661
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2878
02:00:55.661 --> 02:00:57.670
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a spectacular thing to see at a</v>

2879
02:00:57.671 --> 02:00:59.230
<v Speaker 3>lion's head on your wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2880
02:00:59.231 --> 02:01:00.640
<v Speaker 3>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite a trophy.</v>

2881
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2882
02:01:01.751 --> 02:01:03.430
<v Speaker 3>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

2883
02:01:03.490 --> 02:01:04.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess so.</v>

2884
02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:05.860
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2885
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:10.780
<v Speaker 3>I could see that someone would want that</v>
<v Speaker 3>or why someone would want that.</v>

2886
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:12.130
<v Speaker 3>I just don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2887
02:01:12.131 --> 02:01:14.440
<v Speaker 3>I know you're into eating what you kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2888
02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:16.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you do understand why,</v>

2889
02:01:16.481 --> 02:01:19.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you understand why people get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>charge out of,</v>

2890
02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:19.540
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>

2891
02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:22.760
<v Speaker 3>Shooting a giant deer or large game</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal or,</v>

2892
02:01:22.990 --> 02:01:24.940
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you definitely get a charge out of</v>

2893
02:01:24.941 --> 02:01:27.160
<v Speaker 3>it as well as get the food from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

2894
02:01:27.161 --> 02:01:31.330
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this gigantic experience.</v>

2895
02:01:31.331 --> 02:01:34.840
<v Speaker 3>It's attached to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but unless you wanted to eat a lion,</v>

2896
02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:38.080
<v Speaker 3>apparently people eat mountain lion and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it tastes good.</v>

2897
02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2898
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Mount Line is supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a guy and he hunts mountain lions</v>

2899
02:01:42.771 --> 02:01:45.890
<v Speaker 3>all winter long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in Colorado they do it all legally.</v>

2900
02:01:45.891 --> 02:01:48.380
<v Speaker 3>He's a guide and they love mountain</v>
<v Speaker 3>lion.</v>

2901
02:01:48.381 --> 02:01:51.110
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be really muscular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are not so good.</v>

2902
02:01:51.230 --> 02:01:54.060
<v Speaker 3>But so as a pig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pigs are really muscular too,</v>

2903
02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:55.071
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2904
02:01:55.071 --> 02:01:55.970
<v Speaker 3>so as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2905
02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.520
<v Speaker 3>like elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elk are extremely muscular.</v>

2906
02:01:58.910 --> 02:02:01.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a deer are very muscular as well,</v>

2907
02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:03.140
<v Speaker 3>but it's one of the reasons why they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>so lean,</v>

2908
02:02:03.650 --> 02:02:04.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2909
02:02:04.461 --> 02:02:05.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of,</v>

2910
02:02:06.650 --> 02:02:08.720
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of what they call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2911
02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:14.900
<v Speaker 3>there are certain animals that people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just decide that you're not</v>

2912
02:02:14.961 --> 02:02:16.670
<v Speaker 3>supposed to hunt or eat them.</v>

2913
02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:17.930
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2914
02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:21.650
<v Speaker 3>charismatic megafauna is how my friend</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve Rinella describes some as like</v>

2915
02:02:21.651 --> 02:02:24.560
<v Speaker 3>bears or one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but bears had been eaten by people</v>

2916
02:02:24.561 --> 02:02:27.320
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a black bear.</v>

2917
02:02:27.321 --> 02:02:29.930
<v Speaker 3>Especially they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very delicious and they're,</v>

2918
02:02:29.931 --> 02:02:32.270
<v Speaker 3>they're thought of as game animals for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

2919
02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just thinking about the selective</v>

2920
02:02:34.371 --> 02:02:35.680
<v Speaker 3>outrage about Cecil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2921
02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:40.370
<v Speaker 3>These lions get poached,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed all the time in Africa,</v>

2922
02:02:40.371 --> 02:02:42.470
<v Speaker 3>don't they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean by Africans and others.</v>

2923
02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when some privileged white dentist</v>

2924
02:02:45.081 --> 02:02:48.560
<v Speaker 3>from Minnesota does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's this international outrage.</v>

2925
02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:50.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also because the line was named,</v>

2926
02:02:50.091 --> 02:02:52.880
<v Speaker 3>which was one of the more hilarious</v>
<v Speaker 3>aspects in the door and turned out he</v>

2927
02:02:52.881 --> 02:02:53.990
<v Speaker 3>wasn't cecil though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2928
02:02:53.991 --> 02:02:56.060
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he sold his brother Jericho.</v>

2929
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:58.960
<v Speaker 3>They were worried was killed too because</v>
<v Speaker 3>people had create this narrative that</v>

2930
02:02:58.961 --> 02:03:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Jericho's not going to take care of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cecil's babies forum,</v>

2931
02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:02.960
<v Speaker 3>which is so fucking hilarious.</v>

2932
02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:05.600
<v Speaker 3>Cause first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know anything about lions</v>

2933
02:03:05.601 --> 02:03:08.270
<v Speaker 3>and how they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how a male becomes the head of a pride,</v>

2934
02:03:08.450 --> 02:03:10.640
<v Speaker 3>they murder all the cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2935
02:03:10.641 --> 02:03:13.430
<v Speaker 3>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if there are females and they're,</v>

2936
02:03:13.431 --> 02:03:15.470
<v Speaker 3>they're giving birth to another male's</v>
<v Speaker 3>babies,</v>

2937
02:03:15.590 --> 02:03:18.050
<v Speaker 3>that line will come in and murder all</v>
<v Speaker 3>those babies.</v>

2938
02:03:18.170 --> 02:03:22.970
<v Speaker 3>So Cecil was a baby murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100% all of the heads of prides,</v>

2939
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:25.790
<v Speaker 3>those are all baby murders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So of Jericho came along.</v>

2940
02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:28.130
<v Speaker 3>Not only would he not protect Cecil's</v>
<v Speaker 3>babies,</v>

2941
02:03:28.131 --> 02:03:29.810
<v Speaker 3>he would fucking killed him with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

2942
02:03:30.170 --> 02:03:32.840
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were worried that Jericho had</v>

2943
02:03:32.841 --> 02:03:35.090
<v Speaker 3>been killed too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was a story saying that they</v>

2944
02:03:35.091 --> 02:03:39.140
<v Speaker 3>believe Jericho had been poached and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they said there was a relief</v>

2945
02:03:39.290 --> 02:03:42.770
<v Speaker 3>because it turned out that the line that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was killed was not Jericho,</v>

2946
02:03:42.890 --> 02:03:46.910
<v Speaker 3>but with some other no name bitch ass</v>
<v Speaker 3>line that nobody cared about because</v>

2947
02:03:46.911 --> 02:03:50.740
<v Speaker 3>nobody had made a noise that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>associate with this fucking lying lying</v>

2948
02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:51.620
<v Speaker 3>to be a bitch ass.</v>

2949
02:03:51.650 --> 02:03:52.483
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2950
02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:56.180
<v Speaker 3>100% if he doesn't have a name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>

2951
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:58.240
<v Speaker 3>Why aren't you Jericho?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even have an aim.</v>

2952
02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:02.210
<v Speaker 3>Jericho has got a name bitch ass lion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2953
02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:04.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know how we got started on</v>

2954
02:04:04.521 --> 02:04:05.420
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

2955
02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:07.820
<v Speaker 3>the idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2956
02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:10.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting these things.</v>

2957
02:04:10.871 --> 02:04:14.190
<v Speaker 3>So it was Jimmy Kimmel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was crying about it.</v>

2958
02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:16.820
<v Speaker 3>It's just irritating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not outraged.</v>

2959
02:04:16.821 --> 02:04:21.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm outraged by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by standup comedians who have some sort</v>

2960
02:04:21.261 --> 02:04:25.000
<v Speaker 3>of veneer of countercultural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>

2961
02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:26.990
<v Speaker 3>rebel to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is really,</v>

2962
02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:29.060
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get some platform to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>politician is just,</v>

2963
02:04:29.061 --> 02:04:32.440
<v Speaker 3>I didn't listen to the Obama interview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't listen to boring.</v>

2964
02:04:32.450 --> 02:04:32.811
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2965
02:04:32.811 --> 02:04:35.390
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like a press conference or at</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse,</v>

2966
02:04:35.391 --> 02:04:38.190
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like a speech because there</v>
<v Speaker 3>are no questions that are any,</v>

2967
02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:40.860
<v Speaker 2>that are difficult for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm most offended that Mark Marin</v>

2968
02:04:40.861 --> 02:04:42.720
<v Speaker 2>blocked you for asking a question like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2969
02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty weak.</v>

2970
02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:47.220
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not even insulting.</v>

2971
02:04:47.250 --> 02:04:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Plus he's my neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is He really?</v>

2972
02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in the same neighborhood and</v>

2973
02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:51.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

2974
02:04:51.431 --> 02:04:53.520
<v Speaker 2>see I'm a trader Joe's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

2975
02:04:53.550 --> 02:04:54.660
<v Speaker 2>does he next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2976
02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

2977
02:04:55.510 --> 02:04:59.160
<v Speaker 2>It does now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He better guarantee you he's going to be</v>

2978
02:04:59.790 --> 02:05:01.020
<v Speaker 2>getting here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This will be upset.</v>

2979
02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2980
02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:05.970
<v Speaker 2>I think for a guy like him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an opportunity to just sit down</v>

2981
02:05:05.971 --> 02:05:09.810
<v Speaker 2>with someone who he thinks you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you follow his politics.</v>

2982
02:05:09.811 --> 02:05:12.960
<v Speaker 2>He's very left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He probably thinks is a great president.</v>

2983
02:05:12.990 --> 02:05:16.080
<v Speaker 2>If you look at what Obama has done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the numbers,</v>

2984
02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:19.560
<v Speaker 2>what he's done economically as far as</v>
<v Speaker 2>like job creation,</v>

2985
02:05:19.561 --> 02:05:23.730
<v Speaker 2>as far as the rebound of the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand all that stuff,</v>

2986
02:05:23.731 --> 02:05:25.710
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all looks fairly positive.</v>

2987
02:05:25.710 --> 02:05:27.870
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the raw numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the raw data,</v>

2988
02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:32.250
<v Speaker 2>but he had very little to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With unemployment going down to 5% I</v>

2989
02:05:32.251 --> 02:05:36.660
<v Speaker 2>mean his policies or the Congress has</v>
<v Speaker 2>policies had very little effect on that.</v>

2990
02:05:37.170 --> 02:05:40.110
<v Speaker 2>What do you think that that was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>economy churning itself?</v>

2991
02:05:40.410 --> 02:05:42.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the economy rebounding,</v>

2992
02:05:42.271 --> 02:05:44.970
<v Speaker 2>like do you mean the most economist I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think would agree with that,</v>

2993
02:05:45.010 --> 02:05:49.170
<v Speaker 2>that the fiscal policies by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government had negligible effect on</v>

2994
02:05:49.171 --> 02:05:51.970
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most comms believe that exam.</v>

2995
02:05:52.150 --> 02:05:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would say they are.</v>

2996
02:05:54.030 --> 02:05:58.260
<v Speaker 2>I think very few would give much of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their credit to po to government</v>

2997
02:05:58.410 --> 02:06:00.450
<v Speaker 2>government policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the bail out?</v>

2998
02:06:00.490 --> 02:06:03.000
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't that have some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>significant impact?</v>

2999
02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a catastrophe.</v>

3000
02:06:05.340 --> 02:06:06.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3001
02:06:06.210 --> 02:06:10.500
<v Speaker 2>trillions to Wall Street and GM and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>did we get for it?</v>

3002
02:06:10.501 --> 02:06:13.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the recovery didn't happen then it took</v>

3003
02:06:13.141 --> 02:06:14.220
<v Speaker 2>many years after that.</v>

3004
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:17.880
<v Speaker 2>It was not the plan all along was that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was going to be a sort of a trickle</v>

3005
02:06:17.881 --> 02:06:19.410
<v Speaker 2>down from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3006
02:06:19.411 --> 02:06:20.970
<v Speaker 2>the recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3007
02:06:20.971 --> 02:06:23.840
<v Speaker 2>But would we have been better off if</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd let them fail many of those things.</v>

3008
02:06:23.841 --> 02:06:26.220
<v Speaker 2>So I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Delay,</v>

3009
02:06:26.450 --> 02:06:28.050
<v Speaker 2>delay the recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3010
02:06:28.051 --> 02:06:29.700
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've bail out these failing</v>

3011
02:06:29.701 --> 02:06:32.080
<v Speaker 2>institutions that clearly are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>working well.</v>

3012
02:06:32.081 --> 02:06:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Would you have asked what are you going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get?</v>

3013
02:06:33.571 --> 02:06:35.610
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get more failing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3014
02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:37.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>procedures.</v>

3015
02:06:37.130 --> 02:06:39.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once something becomes too big to fail,</v>

3016
02:06:39.061 --> 02:06:40.080
<v Speaker 2>that is a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3017
02:06:40.081 --> 02:06:41.290
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird state matter.</v>

3018
02:06:41.410 --> 02:06:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Like what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I let them fail.</v>

3019
02:06:44.190 --> 02:06:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Let the market work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3020
02:06:46.090 --> 02:06:49.010
<v Speaker 2>They're worried about all these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>losing all their money had in the banks.</v>

3021
02:06:49.011 --> 02:06:50.240
<v Speaker 2>Just like the say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened anyway.</v>

3022
02:06:50.241 --> 02:06:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Isis and the 80s but that's what I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

3023
02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people certainly did.</v>

3024
02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3025
02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:56.910
<v Speaker 2>What would you have asked the president</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was there with you?</v>

3026
02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all the things you asked him.</v>

3027
02:06:58.890 --> 02:07:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Those are great questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

3028
02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:02.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't expect,</v>

3029
02:07:02.101 --> 02:07:05.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark Marin to be a policy wonk in a</v>

3030
02:07:05.401 --> 02:07:07.860
<v Speaker 2>situation like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like you could ask him things like,</v>

3031
02:07:08.700 --> 02:07:10.050
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3032
02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:12.060
<v Speaker 2>When you pull the trigger in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3033
02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:15.270
<v Speaker 2>drone in Yemen that ends up killing a 16</v>
<v Speaker 2>year old.</v>

3034
02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that feel?</v>

3035
02:07:16.381 --> 02:07:20.550
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you reconcile your past</v>

3036
02:07:20.551 --> 02:07:23.400
<v Speaker 2>experience as a student activist at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Occidental College?</v>

3037
02:07:23.401 --> 02:07:27.510
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with now being the head of the</v>

3038
02:07:27.511 --> 02:07:29.610
<v Speaker 2>biggest killing machine in world</v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

3039
02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:30.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

3040
02:07:30.930 --> 02:07:35.560
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you reconcile your feelings as</v>

3041
02:07:35.561 --> 02:07:40.561
<v Speaker 2>Barry Obama who was protesting against</v>
<v Speaker 2>apartheid in South Africa with being the</v>

3042
02:07:41.111 --> 02:07:44.470
<v Speaker 2>president who murders Brown people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>

3043
02:07:45.490 --> 02:07:45.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3044
02:07:45.850 --> 02:07:46.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he's doing.</v>

3045
02:07:46.810 --> 02:07:51.810
<v Speaker 2>So I want to know sort of personally</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in Africa and what are you</v>

3046
02:07:52.061 --> 02:07:52.894
<v Speaker 2>referring to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>

3047
02:07:52.930 --> 02:07:55.720
<v Speaker 2>there are troops on the ground in Africa</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

3048
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:58.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>murdering people and there's drones in</v>

3049
02:07:58.301 --> 02:08:02.610
<v Speaker 2>North Africa murdering people and in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Middle East and,</v>

3050
02:08:02.620 --> 02:08:03.850
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what he's doing.</v>

3051
02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:05.980
<v Speaker 2>And these are all brown people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's killing.</v>

3052
02:08:06.190 --> 02:08:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3053
02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:09.730
<v Speaker 2>how did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about that or off?</v>

3054
02:08:09.790 --> 02:08:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you want to know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

3055
02:08:12.010 --> 02:08:15.220
<v Speaker 2>I would want to know like what is it</v>
<v Speaker 2>like inside,</v>

3056
02:08:15.250 --> 02:08:17.650
<v Speaker 2>like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the mechanism?</v>

3057
02:08:17.651 --> 02:08:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Like what's it like once you get into</v>
<v Speaker 2>office?</v>

3058
02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how different is it than what you</v>

3059
02:08:22.721 --> 02:08:24.820
<v Speaker 2>thought it was when you were running?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of them,</v>

3060
02:08:24.821 --> 02:08:26.170
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to get into that.</v>

3061
02:08:26.171 --> 02:08:28.840
<v Speaker 2>And one of the main claims it's made</v>
<v Speaker 2>about him is that he's actually a</v>

3062
02:08:28.841 --> 02:08:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Peacenik who's forced to do these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the military industrial</v>

3063
02:08:31.931 --> 02:08:32.530
<v Speaker 2>establishment.</v>

3064
02:08:32.530 --> 02:08:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3065
02:08:34.030 --> 02:08:35.290
<v Speaker 2>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would ask him,</v>

3066
02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:39.700
<v Speaker 2>do you have any agency as president or</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you forced to make these decisions</v>

3067
02:08:39.701 --> 02:08:40.640
<v Speaker 2>by other people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3068
02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:42.850
<v Speaker 2>How do the decisions get made when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3069
02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:46.930
<v Speaker 2>when a drone strike is made?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it really you and your advisors</v>

3070
02:08:46.931 --> 02:08:49.840
<v Speaker 2>making that decision or are you forced</v>
<v Speaker 2>to buy this thing called the military</v>

3071
02:08:49.841 --> 02:08:51.280
<v Speaker 2>industrial complex?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>

3072
02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Is this true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we've been told that the president</v>

3073
02:08:54.011 --> 02:08:56.320
<v Speaker 2>actually has no power over foreign</v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

3074
02:08:56.321 --> 02:08:57.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's true,</v>

3075
02:08:57.521 --> 02:08:59.200
<v Speaker 2>but I'd like to hear him say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3076
02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:03.280
<v Speaker 2>And if it is true that he has no power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what's the point of having a</v>

3077
02:09:03.281 --> 02:09:06.010
<v Speaker 2>president of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of getting excited about the first black</v>

3078
02:09:06.011 --> 02:09:08.230
<v Speaker 2>president about getting excited about</v>
<v Speaker 2>any precedent.</v>

3079
02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:12.430
<v Speaker 2>If Bernie Sanders gets into office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will he be doing the same thing then</v>

3080
02:09:12.431 --> 02:09:13.630
<v Speaker 2>that would be hilarious.</v>

3081
02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't it be amazing if Bernie Sanders</v>
<v Speaker 2>got an office and just start fucking</v>

3082
02:09:17.110 --> 02:09:21.070
<v Speaker 2>full-scale drone attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting down a whistle blowers and</v>

3083
02:09:21.370 --> 02:09:25.160
<v Speaker 2>ramped up the NSA spying program?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He probably would because he did it.</v>

3084
02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:27.070
<v Speaker 2>What did Obama run on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3085
02:09:27.071 --> 02:09:29.950
<v Speaker 2>He ran on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to end the war in Iraq.</v>

3086
02:09:30.580 --> 02:09:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to,</v>

3087
02:09:32.170 --> 02:09:36.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be good for civil liberties and right,</v>

3088
02:09:36.371 --> 02:09:39.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to roll back all the policies</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Bush administration was down</v>

3089
02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:41.200
<v Speaker 2>Guantanamo Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close down Guantanamo.</v>

3090
02:09:41.201 --> 02:09:42.940
<v Speaker 2>And what did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually ramped up all those</v>

3091
02:09:42.941 --> 02:09:45.460
<v Speaker 2>policies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extended Bush's policies.</v>

3092
02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Now when you talk to someone like Sam</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harris,</v>

3093
02:09:48.430 --> 02:09:52.720
<v Speaker 2>what he believes is that Obama gets into</v>
<v Speaker 2>office ans then presented with the</v>

3094
02:09:52.721 --> 02:09:57.220
<v Speaker 2>reality of the ongoing situation in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Middle East with Islamic terrorism,</v>

3095
02:09:57.221 --> 02:10:00.940
<v Speaker 2>with radical fundamentalists and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the grow the globe.</v>

3096
02:10:00.941 --> 02:10:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Does it mean to do America harm that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's presented with this overwhelming</v>

3097
02:10:04.361 --> 02:10:07.720
<v Speaker 2>evidence that the world is way more</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked than we're being led to believe?</v>

3098
02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's them Harris's take.</v>

3099
02:10:09.611 --> 02:10:11.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris thinks the world is far more</v>

3100
02:10:11.381 --> 02:10:12.640
<v Speaker 2>dangerous than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3101
02:10:12.641 --> 02:10:15.070
<v Speaker 2>he thinks that Islam is inherently</v>
<v Speaker 2>violent,</v>

3102
02:10:15.850 --> 02:10:19.810
<v Speaker 2>is the jihad is a necessary outgrowth of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam.</v>

3103
02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:23.350
<v Speaker 2>That if we don't take action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lethal action against them,</v>

3104
02:10:23.351 --> 02:10:26.710
<v Speaker 2>that they will come and kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't buy that.</v>

3105
02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I know that that's his analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He necessarily thinks you have to take</v>

3106
02:10:30.431 --> 02:10:32.500
<v Speaker 2>legal action against him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think lethal lethal,</v>

3107
02:10:32.501 --> 02:10:33.600
<v Speaker 2>lethal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>legal aside,</v>

3108
02:10:33.610 --> 02:10:35.150
<v Speaker 2>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lethal action against him,</v>

3109
02:10:35.151 --> 02:10:39.860
<v Speaker 2>I think he believes that there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fundamental flaw in the ideology that</v>

3110
02:10:39.861 --> 02:10:42.740
<v Speaker 2>wants all people who leave the religion</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed.</v>

3111
02:10:43.100 --> 02:10:44.450
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3112
02:10:44.730 --> 02:10:47.870
<v Speaker 2>that a religion that believes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3113
02:10:47.871 --> 02:10:52.070
<v Speaker 2>a religion was founded by a warlord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different style of religion than</v>

3114
02:10:52.071 --> 02:10:55.610
<v Speaker 2>say like Jesus who was a Peacenik.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3115
02:10:55.611 --> 02:10:59.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he necessarily thinks that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to take lethal action against</v>

3116
02:10:59.271 --> 02:10:59.480
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3117
02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:04.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that he is more concerned about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they are capable of doing than the</v>

3118
02:11:05.541 --> 02:11:08.000
<v Speaker 2>average person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no doubt that there are</v>

3119
02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:10.370
<v Speaker 2>Muslims who do you believe that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3120
02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:15.860
<v Speaker 2>The question is why are they targeting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the French and the United States</v>

3121
02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:17.120
<v Speaker 2>specifically?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3122
02:11:17.121 --> 02:11:21.620
<v Speaker 2>And I think that is because not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because of their religion entirely.</v>

3123
02:11:21.621 --> 02:11:26.621
<v Speaker 2>I think it's largely because France and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States has intervened in the</v>

3124
02:11:27.050 --> 02:11:31.580
<v Speaker 2>Middle East against Arabs and in France</v>
<v Speaker 2>against their own Arab and Muslim people</v>

3125
02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:34.670
<v Speaker 2>in discriminatory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lethal,</v>

3126
02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:39.440
<v Speaker 2>murderous ways for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is blow back.</v>

3127
02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:42.230
<v Speaker 2>I think that explains why they attacked</v>
<v Speaker 2>us specifically.</v>

3128
02:11:42.231 --> 02:11:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Now it doesn't explain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously everything those Muslims do in</v>

3129
02:11:46.611 --> 02:11:48.860
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't explain why they insist on</v>

3130
02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:53.870
<v Speaker 2>women wearing burka is it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain why they shoot gay people.</v>

3131
02:11:53.871 --> 02:11:56.210
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't explain why they attack other</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims.</v>

3132
02:11:56.211 --> 02:11:59.660
<v Speaker 2>But I think it does explain blow back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think does explain why they're</v>

3133
02:11:59.690 --> 02:12:02.870
<v Speaker 2>interested in attacking us and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it needs to be addressed in my</v>

3134
02:12:02.871 --> 02:12:03.704
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>

3135
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop giving them a reason to hate us.</v>

3136
02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take that away.</v>

3137
02:12:08.001 --> 02:12:12.470
<v Speaker 2>If they continue to fly planes into our</v>
<v Speaker 2>buildings after we've withdrawn from the</v>

3138
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we can talk about the religion and</v>

3139
02:12:14.391 --> 02:12:16.370
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about them as criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychopaths,</v>

3140
02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:18.500
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the case yet.</v>

3141
02:12:18.590 --> 02:12:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Let's remove that reason from there for</v>
<v Speaker 2>them attacking us,</v>

3142
02:12:22.070 --> 02:12:24.050
<v Speaker 2>then we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we can see what happens.</v>

3143
02:12:24.890 --> 02:12:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Removing troops from the Middle East is</v>

3144
02:12:27.111 --> 02:12:32.111
<v Speaker 2>a real hot subject and I would love to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hear what the president would say about</v>

3145
02:12:32.991 --> 02:12:36.660
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The vacuum created and like what,</v>

3146
02:12:36.661 --> 02:12:39.230
<v Speaker 2>what's going on right now with Isis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3147
02:12:39.590 --> 02:12:43.370
<v Speaker 2>this vacuum that has been created is now</v>
<v Speaker 2>filled up with the most dangerous</v>

3148
02:12:43.371 --> 02:12:45.740
<v Speaker 2>radical fundamentalist group in recent</v>
<v Speaker 2>memory.</v>

3149
02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean clearly,</v>

3150
02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean the big heavy weaponry that isis</v>
<v Speaker 2>is using is all American made.</v>

3151
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:54.320
<v Speaker 2>It's weapons that were left by the u s</v>
<v Speaker 2>military in that region.</v>

3152
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fucked is up.</v>

3153
02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you were saying,</v>

3154
02:12:57.231 --> 02:13:00.230
<v Speaker 2>like they created this vacuum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this power vacuum in that area.</v>

3155
02:13:00.231 --> 02:13:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which these nut bags just easily and</v>

3156
02:13:03.471 --> 02:13:04.700
<v Speaker 2>quickly filled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3157
02:13:04.701 --> 02:13:07.220
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing that in Libya as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing that everywhere you get rid</v>

3158
02:13:07.221 --> 02:13:08.180
<v Speaker 2>of a dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3159
02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:12.440
<v Speaker 2>You get rid of the dictator and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>people line up to see who becomes the</v>

3160
02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:13.340
<v Speaker 2>next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just getting rid of the</v>

3161
02:13:13.341 --> 02:13:15.170
<v Speaker 2>dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's getting rid of the government,</v>

3162
02:13:15.171 --> 02:13:16.250
<v Speaker 2>the structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3163
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

3164
02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:20.090
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing to oppose them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't think,</v>

3165
02:13:20.091 --> 02:13:22.550
<v Speaker 2>I think isis is going to fall on its own</v>
<v Speaker 2>accord.</v>

3166
02:13:22.551 --> 02:13:24.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think these guys can manage a</v>

3167
02:13:24.311 --> 02:13:27.560
<v Speaker 2>society you've already seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing evidence of people sort of</v>

3168
02:13:27.561 --> 02:13:30.320
<v Speaker 2>fleeing and leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because they don't like the</v>

3169
02:13:30.321 --> 02:13:31.154
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just don't,</v>

3170
02:13:31.170 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 2>all these rules</v>

3171
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:35.970
<v Speaker 1>that Isis is imposing its sharia law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3172
02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine they could sustain a</v>
<v Speaker 1>society for very long.</v>

3173
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should also be pointed out that I</v>

3174
02:13:41.311 --> 02:13:44.820
<v Speaker 1>think something around the neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 80 plus percent of the people that</v>

3175
02:13:44.821 --> 02:13:47.820
<v Speaker 1>are fighting against Isis are Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

3176
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3177
02:13:48.690 --> 02:13:50.670
<v Speaker 1>and almost all of their victims are</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim.</v>

3178
02:13:50.730 --> 02:13:51.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3179
02:13:51.900 --> 02:13:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let them,</v>

3180
02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:56.850
<v Speaker 1>let them hang themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is My,</v>

3181
02:13:56.970 --> 02:14:01.890
<v Speaker 1>my position pull out entirely?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The U s resident Thaddeus Russell has</v>

3182
02:14:01.891 --> 02:14:02.940
<v Speaker 1>spoken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

3183
02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Are you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ready to run?</v>

3184
02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:05.221
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3185
02:14:05.221 --> 02:14:07.470
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a couple years after you get the</v>

3186
02:14:07.471 --> 02:14:08.520
<v Speaker 1>renegade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universities,</v>

3187
02:14:08.521 --> 02:14:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I've been writing city up and running</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be the renegade president except</v>

3188
02:14:11.341 --> 02:14:13.560
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of douchey yet here renegade</v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

3189
02:14:13.590 --> 02:14:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any aspirations politically?</v>

3190
02:14:15.570 --> 02:14:15.991
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3191
02:14:15.991 --> 02:14:17.580
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you think so much about it.</v>

3192
02:14:18.630 --> 02:14:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I first of all,</v>

3193
02:14:20.101 --> 02:14:23.370
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think anyone is far more effective</v>

3194
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:25.410
<v Speaker 1>outside the establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3195
02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can actually get more done and</v>

3196
02:14:27.541 --> 02:14:31.440
<v Speaker 1>change minds and change the culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ultimately influencing policies</v>

3197
02:14:31.470 --> 02:14:32.880
<v Speaker 1>simply by talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by doing this.</v>

3198
02:14:32.881 --> 02:14:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we all do that.</v>

3199
02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I think we are much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have far more power than a</v>

3200
02:14:36.451 --> 02:14:38.290
<v Speaker 1>congress man does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3201
02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:40.110
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How scary.</v>

3202
02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean honestly,</v>

3203
02:14:43.171 --> 02:14:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think that take legalization of</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>

3204
02:14:47.310 --> 02:14:49.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How fast that's happening now.</v>

3205
02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:51.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to give you all the credit</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>

3206
02:14:51.601 --> 02:14:53.190
<v Speaker 1>but clearly you had something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3207
02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cha,</v>

3208
02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you participated in this massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural shift,</v>

3209
02:14:56.611 --> 02:14:58.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were many people doing it,</v>

3210
02:14:58.531 --> 02:15:00.410
<v Speaker 1>but I would say that your voice was one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the loudest and I'd,</v>

3211
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:04.940
<v Speaker 1>I'd give you quite a bit of credit for</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving it as fast as it has moved is</v>

3212
02:15:04.990 --> 02:15:05.820
<v Speaker 1>that it's ridiculous.</v>

3213
02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:08.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I dunno what,</v>

3214
02:15:08.250 --> 02:15:09.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I represented very weird.</v>

3215
02:15:09.870 --> 02:15:14.870
<v Speaker 1>I represent the jockish guy who also is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a psychedelic drugs.</v>

3216
02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm the bridge between the meat heads in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potheads that's in that,</v>

3217
02:15:19.891 --> 02:15:23.400
<v Speaker 1>in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's got a lot more people that go,</v>

3218
02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:25.680
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think about it that way when</v>

3219
02:15:25.681 --> 02:15:29.460
<v Speaker 1>they sort of people that wanted those</v>
<v Speaker 1>two groups to be much more clearly</v>

3220
02:15:29.461 --> 02:15:32.130
<v Speaker 1>defined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm letting them know when it's not.</v>

3221
02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:35.790
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like especially like martial arts.</v>

3222
02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Like one thing that I definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably done is turned a lot of people</v>

3223
02:15:39.601 --> 02:15:42.840
<v Speaker 1>that it would never been involved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts onto martial arts.</v>

3224
02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:47.250
<v Speaker 1>And just just by</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the benefits of it,</v>

3225
02:15:47.370 --> 02:15:50.220
<v Speaker 1>like praising the benefits of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have seen,</v>

3226
02:15:50.330 --> 02:15:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm not here to kiss your ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have seen evidence of your</v>

3227
02:15:55.021 --> 02:15:57.240
<v Speaker 1>influence in the drug policy debate.</v>

3228
02:15:57.480 --> 02:16:00.660
<v Speaker 1>I've seen many people reference it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen you mentioned,</v>

3229
02:16:00.661 --> 02:16:05.460
<v Speaker 1>I've seen you're a prominent figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in favor of legalization.</v>

3230
02:16:05.461 --> 02:16:08.310
<v Speaker 1>That alone changes people's minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3231
02:16:08.311 --> 02:16:09.031
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he,</v>

3232
02:16:09.031 --> 02:16:12.000
<v Speaker 1>if he's for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's not such a crazy idea.</v>

3233
02:16:12.210 --> 02:16:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

3234
02:16:13.621 --> 02:16:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're not the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I think other celebrities have</v>

3235
02:16:16.351 --> 02:16:18.220
<v Speaker 1>come out to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like being,</v>

3236
02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:21.360
<v Speaker 1>but you've been very consistent about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really pushed it and I think you've</v>

3237
02:16:21.361 --> 02:16:26.361
<v Speaker 1>also activated your base guys who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>just into martial arts or into smoking</v>

3238
02:16:26.371 --> 02:16:30.160
<v Speaker 1>pot became political about this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

3239
02:16:30.550 --> 02:16:34.480
<v Speaker 2>in part because of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think my point is that you get a</v>

3240
02:16:34.481 --> 02:16:37.240
<v Speaker 2>lot more done actually by changing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and the only way to change the</v>

3241
02:16:37.241 --> 02:16:40.360
<v Speaker 2>culture as being outside of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment,</v>

3242
02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:43.600
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congressman can't lead cultural shifts.</v>

3243
02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:44.951
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3244
02:16:44.951 --> 02:16:47.680
<v Speaker 2>And presidents certainly can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to sort of follow what the</v>

3245
02:16:47.681 --> 02:16:49.840
<v Speaker 2>culture dictates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

3246
02:16:49.841 --> 02:16:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We changed the culture.</v>

3247
02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Those guys have to do our bidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3248
02:16:53.861 --> 02:16:57.100
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that concerns</v>
<v Speaker 2>me the most about the trends that are</v>

3249
02:16:57.101 --> 02:17:00.430
<v Speaker 2>going on in schools today because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that if you really do want to</v>

3250
02:17:00.431 --> 02:17:02.830
<v Speaker 2>change the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you have to change his young</v>

3251
02:17:02.831 --> 02:17:05.260
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to open the eyes and the minds</v>

3252
02:17:05.261 --> 02:17:09.430
<v Speaker 2>of young people and to all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities and to the fact that what</v>

3253
02:17:09.431 --> 02:17:13.420
<v Speaker 2>our culture really is is just this</v>
<v Speaker 2>established pattern that we're all</v>

3254
02:17:13.421 --> 02:17:14.254
<v Speaker 2>following.</v>

3255
02:17:14.350 --> 02:17:18.400
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't necessarily suit you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>help you or even make sense,</v>

3256
02:17:18.610 --> 02:17:20.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got momentum behind it and it's a</v>

3257
02:17:20.981 --> 02:17:23.560
<v Speaker 2>habit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The schools are a dead end.</v>

3258
02:17:23.561 --> 02:17:28.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>people need to run really like deal with</v>

3259
02:17:28.421 --> 02:17:33.280
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This fact most American children are</v>

3260
02:17:33.281 --> 02:17:36.610
<v Speaker 2>trained in schools run by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

3261
02:17:36.910 --> 02:17:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the government going to train</v>

3262
02:17:39.581 --> 02:17:43.660
<v Speaker 2>those kids to be trained them to be good</v>
<v Speaker 2>American citizens?</v>

3263
02:17:43.930 --> 02:17:46.480
<v Speaker 2>What are they not going to introduce in</v>
<v Speaker 2>those schools as ideas?</v>

3264
02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:48.220
<v Speaker 2>Anything that challenges the</v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment?</v>

3265
02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Anything that challenges the status quo</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any significant way,</v>

3266
02:17:51.370 --> 02:17:55.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are sort of the cognitive</v>

3267
02:17:55.571 --> 02:17:58.120
<v Speaker 2>dissonance and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't ever sort of address that</v>

3268
02:17:58.121 --> 02:18:00.100
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just there,</v>

3269
02:18:00.130 --> 02:18:01.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are government schools.</v>

3270
02:18:01.511 --> 02:18:03.760
<v Speaker 2>What is the government going to do in</v>
<v Speaker 2>schools?</v>

3271
02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:07.450
<v Speaker 2>What are they going to train those kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do and be and how to think.</v>

3272
02:18:07.510 --> 02:18:08.760
<v Speaker 2>But when you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who?</v>

3273
02:18:08.761 --> 02:18:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Who's responsible for the curriculum?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Sacramento in California,</v>

3274
02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:15.310
<v Speaker 2>State Capitol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>legislators,</v>

3275
02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:18.580
<v Speaker 2>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats and Republicans,</v>

3276
02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:20.290
<v Speaker 2>but and communicators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3277
02:18:20.470 --> 02:18:21.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

3278
02:18:21.370 --> 02:18:23.050
<v Speaker 2>when you get a job as a public school</v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher,</v>

3279
02:18:23.051 --> 02:18:26.080
<v Speaker 2>the curriculum is set for you and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the common core,</v>

3280
02:18:26.170 --> 02:18:27.700
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's set nationally.</v>

3281
02:18:27.730 --> 02:18:30.490
<v Speaker 2>It's a national curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3282
02:18:30.491 --> 02:18:33.240
<v Speaker 2>you don't get a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they sneak in there.</v>

3283
02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Certainly their ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have friends who were public high</v>

3284
02:18:35.411 --> 02:18:37.630
<v Speaker 2>school teachers and they sneak in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas of course,</v>

3285
02:18:38.050 --> 02:18:40.960
<v Speaker 2>but they're not supposed to and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>curriculum is handed to them.</v>

3286
02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:44.020
<v Speaker 2>You're given a textbook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what you're going to teach these</v>

3287
02:18:44.021 --> 02:18:46.300
<v Speaker 2>your lesson plans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the topics,</v>

3288
02:18:46.750 --> 02:18:48.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be able to talk</v>

3289
02:18:48.491 --> 02:18:51.070
<v Speaker 2>about Lenny Bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you should.</v>

3290
02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't have like a creative</v>

3291
02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:56.710
<v Speaker 2>assignment for a class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't like come in and and and say,</v>

3292
02:18:56.711 --> 02:18:59.980
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my job is to teach history but I want to</v>

3293
02:18:59.981 --> 02:19:03.340
<v Speaker 2>give these people a real perspective</v>
<v Speaker 2>only so much that you can do it on the</v>

3294
02:19:03.341 --> 02:19:04.174
<v Speaker 2>down low.</v>

3295
02:19:04.210 --> 02:19:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Teachers Cheat of course,</v>

3296
02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:11.640
<v Speaker 2>but they're not supposed to and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get fired for it from I think Lenny</v>

3297
02:19:12.010 --> 02:19:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Bruce and the history of standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be a central part of any</v>

3298
02:19:16.181 --> 02:19:18.460
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that is one of the most</v>

3299
02:19:18.461 --> 02:19:23.461
<v Speaker 2>important things in modern US history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No doubt about that is it mentioned</v>

3300
02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:24.880
<v Speaker 2>haver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

3301
02:19:25.220 --> 02:19:26.890
<v Speaker 2>Certainly not in the official</v>
<v Speaker 2>curriculum.</v>

3302
02:19:27.530 --> 02:19:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Cause those guys said bad words and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>said naughty things.</v>

3303
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:33.680
<v Speaker 2>So the official curriculum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the goal behind it to do,</v>

3304
02:19:33.681 --> 02:19:35.780
<v Speaker 2>to be the most efficient at educating</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids?</v>

3305
02:19:35.781 --> 02:19:37.880
<v Speaker 2>Or will you try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think they're trying to programs.</v>

3306
02:19:37.881 --> 02:19:41.960
<v Speaker 2>So the margin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the American public school system was</v>

3307
02:19:41.961 --> 02:19:46.310
<v Speaker 2>modeled after the Prussian system of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>19th century and early American</v>

3308
02:19:46.311 --> 02:19:49.100
<v Speaker 2>educators who founded this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>public schools,</v>

3309
02:19:49.101 --> 02:19:54.101
<v Speaker 2>Horace Mann and others said explicitly</v>
<v Speaker 2>this should be a means to train children</v>

3310
02:19:55.311 --> 02:19:56.510
<v Speaker 2>to be workers.</v>

3311
02:19:58.670 --> 02:20:01.220
<v Speaker 2>This was explicit at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was explicit.</v>

3312
02:20:01.330 --> 02:20:03.140
<v Speaker 2>That's disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually,</v>

3313
02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:06.620
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the way schools are</v>
<v Speaker 2>operated and the format of them,</v>

3314
02:20:06.621 --> 02:20:08.030
<v Speaker 2>it's like a factory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3315
02:20:08.031 --> 02:20:10.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like an assembly line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go from this class to that class,</v>

3316
02:20:10.911 --> 02:20:14.060
<v Speaker 2>to that class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get trained in this and this and this.</v>

3317
02:20:14.650 --> 02:20:17.630
<v Speaker 2>And then they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they leave the doors and they go</v>

3318
02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:22.660
<v Speaker 2>work in a corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's explicitly designed for</v>

3319
02:20:22.820 --> 02:20:27.820
<v Speaker 2>based on the PRUSSIAN system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean that's not explicit anymore</v>

3320
02:20:27.891 --> 02:20:30.320
<v Speaker 2>cause I would turn off a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what's being done.</v>

3321
02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:33.980
<v Speaker 2>They're not training them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would the government trained them to</v>

3322
02:20:33.981 --> 02:20:38.420
<v Speaker 2>be critical intellectuals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would the government train them to</v>

3323
02:20:38.421 --> 02:20:41.060
<v Speaker 2>think critically about everything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3324
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:44.000
<v Speaker 2>they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government can't.</v>

3325
02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:49.030
<v Speaker 2>The government has to have citizens who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are law abiding and who don't question</v>

3326
02:20:49.791 --> 02:20:51.710
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fundamentals of the society.</v>

3327
02:20:52.730 --> 02:20:57.730
<v Speaker 2>So do you specifically believe that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>set the students up and they set the</v>

3328
02:20:58.041 --> 02:21:01.550
<v Speaker 2>classes up in that manner?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or do you think they do it because they</v>

3329
02:21:01.551 --> 02:21:05.330
<v Speaker 2>feel like that's the most efficient way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to produce the goals that they want to</v>

3330
02:21:05.331 --> 02:21:07.850
<v Speaker 2>achieve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is higher GPA,</v>

3331
02:21:07.851 --> 02:21:08.481
<v Speaker 2>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3332
02:21:08.481 --> 02:21:11.390
<v Speaker 2>higher sat scores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to compete with China and India.</v>

3333
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's all internalized.</v>

3334
02:21:13.371 --> 02:21:16.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody in the schools is</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking what I just say,</v>

3335
02:21:16.460 --> 02:21:19.580
<v Speaker 2>you're not thinking [inaudible] well of</v>
<v Speaker 2>course you've got,</v>

3336
02:21:19.581 --> 02:21:21.930
<v Speaker 2>they've got to be good in math and</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering cause we've got to come,</v>

3337
02:21:22.010 --> 02:21:23.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you get a good job and that's</v>

3338
02:21:23.511 --> 02:21:24.590
<v Speaker 2>how you're a good American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3339
02:21:24.591 --> 02:21:29.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can talk about Rosa parks now</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she's now safe because we now</v>

3340
02:21:30.561 --> 02:21:32.690
<v Speaker 2>live in an integrated society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3341
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:34.820
<v Speaker 2>But 60 years ago you didn't talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

3342
02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:35.870
<v Speaker 2>She was dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3343
02:21:35.871 --> 02:21:38.110
<v Speaker 2>That had to be sort of inserted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3344
02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:41.540
<v Speaker 2>but now it doesn't challenge the status</v>
<v Speaker 2>quo.</v>

3345
02:21:41.690 --> 02:21:44.810
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't challenge sort of fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas of the society.</v>

3346
02:21:45.050 --> 02:21:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they really debate</v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy and public schools?</v>

3347
02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:50.360
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should it be debated?</v>

3348
02:21:50.510 --> 02:21:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3349
02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:52.673
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

3350
02:21:52.850 --> 02:21:56.440
<v Speaker 2>this is a major idea here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the platform to do it in the</v>

3351
02:21:56.441 --> 02:21:57.620
<v Speaker 2>high school?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think,</v>

3352
02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:00.860
<v Speaker 2>why 90 democracy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know lots of lots and lots of high</v>

3353
02:22:00.861 --> 02:22:05.000
<v Speaker 2>school students who would love to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>that debate and are not able to in their</v>

3354
02:22:05.001 --> 02:22:07.250
<v Speaker 2>high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they do is they read books and</v>

3355
02:22:07.251 --> 02:22:11.030
<v Speaker 2>they listen to podcasts instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about the government</v>

3356
02:22:11.031 --> 02:22:14.240
<v Speaker 2>itself isn't the idea of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>representative government kind of an</v>

3357
02:22:14.241 --> 02:22:18.260
<v Speaker 2>archaic thing in terms of it was all</v>
<v Speaker 2>created back when communication was</v>

3358
02:22:18.261 --> 02:22:22.040
<v Speaker 2>incredibly difficult when you wanted a</v>
<v Speaker 2>state representative.</v>

3359
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:24.770
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause like you just,</v>

3360
02:22:24.771 --> 02:22:25.830
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one</v>

3361
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:28.080
<v Speaker 3>could get ahold of everyone in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

3362
02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:31.140
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't all get together and speak</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind about something.</v>

3363
02:22:31.141 --> 02:22:35.610
<v Speaker 3>But now because of social media and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet as we know it now,</v>

3364
02:22:35.611 --> 02:22:38.040
<v Speaker 3>forget about what the Internet is going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be like 10 15 years from now,</v>

3365
02:22:38.041 --> 02:22:41.300
<v Speaker 3>which is going to be even more intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you,</v>

3366
02:22:41.301 --> 02:22:45.510
<v Speaker 3>you could express yourself in a way now</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just wasn't available before.</v>

3367
02:22:45.511 --> 02:22:49.830
<v Speaker 3>You don't necessarily need a</v>
<v Speaker 3>representative government and the reason</v>

3368
02:22:49.831 --> 02:22:52.570
<v Speaker 3>why they have to go to these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>places like Iowa and,</v>

3369
02:22:52.600 --> 02:22:54.330
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and campaign there,</v>

3370
02:22:54.331 --> 02:22:58.080
<v Speaker 3>and it's a big part of the campaign</v>
<v Speaker 3>trail is just because of this weird</v>

3371
02:22:58.081 --> 02:23:00.330
<v Speaker 3>fucking setup that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3372
02:23:00.331 --> 02:23:01.470
<v Speaker 3>We'll the electoral college system,</v>

3373
02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:04.630
<v Speaker 2>it's in the primaries to party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do opoly Oh yeah.</v>

3374
02:23:04.631 --> 02:23:05.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's disgusting.</v>

3375
02:23:05.950 --> 02:23:07.540
<v Speaker 2>It's basically a monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3376
02:23:07.541 --> 02:23:09.950
<v Speaker 2>because the two parties differ only</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly,</v>

3377
02:23:10.030 --> 02:23:13.750
<v Speaker 2>very tiny amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most exciting thing that happened in</v>

3378
02:23:13.751 --> 02:23:15.790
<v Speaker 2>2008 was not Barack Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

3379
02:23:15.791 --> 02:23:20.650
<v Speaker 2>it was a Ron Paul and Ralph Nader joined</v>
<v Speaker 2>forces with some other third party</v>

3380
02:23:20.651 --> 02:23:25.651
<v Speaker 2>candidates to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to break down the rules that bar third</v>

3381
02:23:26.021 --> 02:23:28.810
<v Speaker 2>party candidates make it much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult for third party candidates to</v>

3382
02:23:28.811 --> 02:23:30.800
<v Speaker 2>have a viable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3383
02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:32.890
<v Speaker 2>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3384
02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:34.930
<v Speaker 2>that hasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen that renewed really in</v>

3385
02:23:34.931 --> 02:23:37.520
<v Speaker 2>any serious way since then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what has to happen.</v>

3386
02:23:37.610 --> 02:23:39.700
<v Speaker 2>We don't have real choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have real choice.</v>

3387
02:23:39.701 --> 02:23:40.930
<v Speaker 2>In Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have real choice.</v>

3388
02:23:40.931 --> 02:23:43.420
<v Speaker 2>They have parliamentary democracy where</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many,</v>

3389
02:23:43.421 --> 02:23:46.960
<v Speaker 2>many parties and you have in all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 2>of parties are represented in the</v>

3390
02:23:46.961 --> 02:23:48.220
<v Speaker 2>legislature's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3391
02:23:48.250 --> 02:23:50.830
<v Speaker 2>You don't have that here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's why we have such low</v>

3392
02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:52.540
<v Speaker 2>voter turnout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3393
02:23:52.541 --> 02:23:55.300
<v Speaker 2>If there was actual choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could actually see yourself</v>

3394
02:23:55.301 --> 02:23:57.400
<v Speaker 2>represented among the politicians</v>
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>

3395
02:23:57.700 --> 02:24:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I think many more people would vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3396
02:24:00.491 --> 02:24:02.240
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>utility</v>

3397
02:24:02.850 --> 02:24:06.090
<v Speaker 3>people feel when they look at the two</v>
<v Speaker 3>party system and then they see where a</v>

3398
02:24:06.091 --> 02:24:09.590
<v Speaker 3>guy like Barack Obama arguably at least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3399
02:24:09.620 --> 02:24:14.620
<v Speaker 3>w with po in returns from like military</v>
<v Speaker 3>policy as as conservative as Gw</v>

3400
02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:17.430
<v Speaker 2>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>civil liberties,</v>

3401
02:24:17.730 --> 02:24:18.960
<v Speaker 2>state surveillance,</v>

3402
02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:22.120
<v Speaker 3>whistleblowers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no difference and freedom of</v>

3403
02:24:22.121 --> 02:24:23.350
<v Speaker 3>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of the press,</v>

3404
02:24:23.740 --> 02:24:25.810
<v Speaker 3>the way they've gone after the press</v>

3405
02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:29.060
<v Speaker 2>and then education policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this common core that I was talking</v>

3406
02:24:29.061 --> 02:24:30.650
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this national curriculum that's now</v>

3407
02:24:30.651 --> 02:24:32.210
<v Speaker 2>being imposed on all the schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3408
02:24:32.510 --> 02:24:34.160
<v Speaker 2>Where did that start?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Bush administration,</v>

3409
02:24:34.161 --> 02:24:36.830
<v Speaker 2>it was called no child left behind is</v>
<v Speaker 2>this national curriculum,</v>

3410
02:24:36.831 --> 02:24:40.430
<v Speaker 2>this idea of homogenizing the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the neoconservatives.</v>

3411
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:43.640
<v Speaker 2>They invented that die fucking thing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 1960s.</v>

3412
02:24:43.641 --> 02:24:46.010
<v Speaker 2>It was their idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Irving Kristol came up with this idea.</v>

3413
02:24:46.011 --> 02:24:48.020
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to have a common core to make</v>

3414
02:24:48.021 --> 02:24:53.021
<v Speaker 2>all Americans similar culturally that</v>
<v Speaker 2>became no child left behind in the 19,</v>

3415
02:24:53.571 --> 02:24:54.141
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3416
02:24:54.141 --> 02:24:56.060
<v Speaker 2>under the Bush administration and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>two thousands.</v>

3417
02:24:56.360 --> 02:24:58.400
<v Speaker 2>And then what did Obama do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just ramped it up.</v>

3418
02:24:58.850 --> 02:25:01.760
<v Speaker 2>He calls it race to the top now gave it</v>
<v Speaker 2>more funding,</v>

3419
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:04.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>required schools to follow it,</v>

3420
02:25:04.611 --> 02:25:07.310
<v Speaker 2>more stringently punished schools for</v>
<v Speaker 2>not following it.</v>

3421
02:25:07.311 --> 02:25:10.520
<v Speaker 2>Now the common core is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this national homogenizing curriculum.</v>

3422
02:25:11.090 --> 02:25:13.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3423
02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:18.760
<v Speaker 2>the idea that a kid in key west Florida</v>
<v Speaker 2>should have the same education as my son</v>

3424
02:25:19.550 --> 02:25:23.590
<v Speaker 2>in Los Angeles or a kid in Mississippi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3425
02:25:23.950 --> 02:25:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why shouldn't the parents in those areas</v>

3426
02:25:27.401 --> 02:25:30.280
<v Speaker 2>have some say over how their children</v>
<v Speaker 2>are taught?</v>

3427
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't there be some diversity of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and cultures in the schools?</v>

3428
02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Do we all need to have the same common</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture?</v>

3429
02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:39.753
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

3430
02:25:40.260 --> 02:25:42.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also an issue in a,</v>

3431
02:25:42.051 --> 02:25:46.590
<v Speaker 3>in a huge one in the way that teachers</v>
<v Speaker 3>are financially</v>

3432
02:25:48.450 --> 02:25:50.750
<v Speaker 3>compensated for work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3433
02:25:50.850 --> 02:25:55.620
<v Speaker 3>the amount of money that teachers make</v>
<v Speaker 3>is so small and the,</v>

3434
02:25:55.650 --> 02:25:59.910
<v Speaker 3>the what the like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the way we look at teachers,</v>

3435
02:25:59.911 --> 02:26:04.350
<v Speaker 3>we don't look at teachers like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you thought about someone who is</v>

3436
02:26:04.351 --> 02:26:07.650
<v Speaker 3>educating your child about the ways of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world influencing them.</v>

3437
02:26:07.860 --> 02:26:11.280
<v Speaker 3>And we all have ideas in our head about</v>
<v Speaker 3>really positive and really negative</v>

3438
02:26:11.281 --> 02:26:13.140
<v Speaker 3>teacher experiences that we had as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>child.</v>

3439
02:26:13.500 --> 02:26:15.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a few really positive ones that</v>

3440
02:26:15.451 --> 02:26:20.130
<v Speaker 3>to this day I think back about this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had a science teacher in seventh</v>

3441
02:26:20.131 --> 02:26:25.131
<v Speaker 3>grade that for the first time ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>introduced in my mind the idea of</v>

3442
02:26:25.561 --> 02:26:27.390
<v Speaker 3>infinity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3443
02:26:27.391 --> 02:26:30.030
<v Speaker 3>I'd never considered it before and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a really unique guy.</v>

3444
02:26:30.031 --> 02:26:30.750
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3445
02:26:30.750 --> 02:26:33.120
<v Speaker 3>would grow his own vegetables and bring</v>
<v Speaker 3>them in and,</v>

3446
02:26:33.290 --> 02:26:34.140
<v Speaker 3>and talk.</v>

3447
02:26:35.310 --> 02:26:38.970
<v Speaker 3>And he's really passionate ways about</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it's like to grow the food that you</v>

3448
02:26:38.971 --> 02:26:40.710
<v Speaker 3>actually eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>

3449
02:26:40.890 --> 02:26:42.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

3450
02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:43.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever I was 12 or something,</v>

3451
02:26:43.741 --> 02:26:45.510
<v Speaker 3>what are you and your yeah to seventh</v>
<v Speaker 3>grade.</v>

3452
02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:48.390
<v Speaker 3>I was a little kid and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this guy going on</v>

3453
02:26:48.391 --> 02:26:51.930
<v Speaker 3>about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about what it's like to</v>

3454
02:26:51.931 --> 02:26:55.380
<v Speaker 3>have food that you grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like do to understand the actual process</v>

3455
02:26:55.381 --> 02:27:00.090
<v Speaker 3>of a seed becoming your food and then to</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat it and it bring it into lunch.</v>

3456
02:27:00.091 --> 02:27:02.290
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was talking about these radishes.</v>

3457
02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:04.860
<v Speaker 3>It had grown in his garden that he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating right now.</v>

3458
02:27:05.150 --> 02:27:08.280
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he was trying to explain to us</v>

3459
02:27:08.580 --> 02:27:13.440
<v Speaker 3>that everything in the entire world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including human beings has essentially</v>

3460
02:27:13.441 --> 02:27:17.280
<v Speaker 3>made out of materials that came from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>star that exploded.</v>

3461
02:27:18.270 --> 02:27:19.590
<v Speaker 3>And then we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3462
02:27:19.950 --> 02:27:23.940
<v Speaker 3>And then he was trying to explain that</v>
<v Speaker 3>our star is going to explode.</v>

3463
02:27:24.270 --> 02:27:26.880
<v Speaker 3>That we all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only a certain amount of time in</v>

3464
02:27:26.881 --> 02:27:29.460
<v Speaker 3>every star and the sun that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3465
02:27:29.461 --> 02:27:32.940
<v Speaker 3>our star w who we call our son only has</v>
<v Speaker 3>a certain amount of time.</v>

3466
02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:35.280
<v Speaker 3>And I remember this guy like saying this</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

3467
02:27:35.310 --> 02:27:40.310
<v Speaker 3>and there are an infinite number of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stars in the galaxy as far as we know,</v>

3468
02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:42.420
<v Speaker 3>the Gal or the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the the universe rather,</v>

3469
02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:44.700
<v Speaker 3>as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe has no end.</v>

3470
02:27:44.970 --> 02:27:47.700
<v Speaker 3>It goes on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just stop and think about that.</v>

3471
02:27:47.940 --> 02:27:52.200
<v Speaker 3>How much time it would take light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just light to get to the nearest solar</v>

3472
02:27:52.201 --> 02:27:55.440
<v Speaker 3>system outside of ours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then think about that in terms of</v>

3473
02:27:55.441 --> 02:27:59.520
<v Speaker 3>how big the galaxies with hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>billions of stars,</v>

3474
02:27:59.700 --> 02:28:03.870
<v Speaker 3>each one with their own little planets</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then hundreds of billions of</v>

3475
02:28:03.871 --> 02:28:05.820
<v Speaker 3>galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember leaving that class just</v>

3476
02:28:05.821 --> 02:28:10.260
<v Speaker 3>mind fucked at 12 or 13 years old and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuck.</v>

3477
02:28:10.590 --> 02:28:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Like it's stuck with me like for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for decades.</v>

3478
02:28:13.620 --> 02:28:16.380
<v Speaker 3>That one teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that wasn't,</v>

3479
02:28:16.620 --> 02:28:18.090
<v Speaker 3>that was him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

3480
02:28:18.091 --> 02:28:20.850
<v Speaker 3>his idea is this wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this wasn't a part of some state</v>

3481
02:28:21.290 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 3>curriculum that</v>

3482
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:23.990
<v Speaker 2>he had to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a public school,</v>

3483
02:28:23.991 --> 02:28:24.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3484
02:28:24.470 --> 02:28:25.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3485
02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:26.330
<v Speaker 2>So he's the exception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3486
02:28:26.350 --> 02:28:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3487
02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:29.990
<v Speaker 2>And there's no reason he should exist in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that system.</v>

3488
02:28:30.470 --> 02:28:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The system has no reason to encourage</v>

3489
02:28:34.071 --> 02:28:37.520
<v Speaker 2>creativity to encourage thinking outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>one's world like that,</v>

3490
02:28:37.521 --> 02:28:38.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must,</v>

3491
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:42.350
<v Speaker 2>it must reinforce itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinvigorate itself,</v>

3492
02:28:42.380 --> 02:28:44.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The system must sustain itself.</v>

3493
02:28:44.061 --> 02:28:47.210
<v Speaker 2>And it does that by training new</v>
<v Speaker 2>workers,</v>

3494
02:28:47.211 --> 02:28:48.520
<v Speaker 2>new participants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new citizens,</v>

3495
02:28:48.530 --> 02:28:52.790
<v Speaker 2>we soldiers look at it when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they want to justify the core</v>

3496
02:28:52.791 --> 02:28:54.710
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they,</v>

3497
02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:56.600
<v Speaker 2>how do they promote it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they,</v>

3498
02:28:56.810 --> 02:28:59.000
<v Speaker 2>how do they describe it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3499
02:28:59.030 --> 02:29:04.030
<v Speaker 2>that it will cause the shitty schools in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mississippi to rise to the level of the</v>

3500
02:29:04.881 --> 02:29:07.400
<v Speaker 2>good schools in Santa Monica and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan.</v>

3501
02:29:07.850 --> 02:29:10.040
<v Speaker 2>That it standardizes the curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3502
02:29:10.041 --> 02:29:13.130
<v Speaker 2>So that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument is that kids in poor areas</v>

3503
02:29:13.131 --> 02:29:17.210
<v Speaker 2>get worse education and their schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the curriculum is not as good as in the</v>

3504
02:29:17.390 --> 02:29:18.150
<v Speaker 2>wealthy area.</v>

3505
02:29:18.150 --> 02:29:21.350
<v Speaker 2>So the standardizes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it raises them all to the same level.</v>

3506
02:29:22.450 --> 02:29:25.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also very much the argument was</v>

3507
02:29:25.131 --> 02:29:26.090
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3508
02:29:26.091 --> 02:29:28.490
<v Speaker 2>that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helps us compete with India and</v>

3509
02:29:28.491 --> 02:29:31.970
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So stem is a big part of this,</v>

3510
02:29:32.060 --> 02:29:34.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So training kids to be better in stem,</v>

3511
02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:38.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a huge part of the common core.</v>

3512
02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Explain stem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

3513
02:29:40.131 --> 02:29:41.900
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering and mathematics.</v>

3514
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3515
02:29:42.650 --> 02:29:47.030
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to build shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to make super conductors and</v>

3516
02:29:47.031 --> 02:29:49.580
<v Speaker 2>computers and technology and all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that the Chinese and Indians are</v>

3517
02:29:49.581 --> 02:29:51.890
<v Speaker 2>doing and some people in the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States are doing,</v>

3518
02:29:52.370 --> 02:29:56.630
<v Speaker 2>you have to be good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was the argument made by Arnie</v>

3519
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Duncan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the secretary of education and Obama</v>

3520
02:29:58.730 --> 02:30:02.330
<v Speaker 2>throughout with race to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to standardize the teaching of</v>

3521
02:30:02.331 --> 02:30:07.080
<v Speaker 2>stem so that we compete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can compete with India and China does</v>

3522
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:08.023
<v Speaker 2>working.</v>

3523
02:30:08.420 --> 02:30:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the results?</v>

3524
02:30:10.330 --> 02:30:10.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3525
02:30:10.911 --> 02:30:12.320
<v Speaker 2>it's just started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just been moved out.</v>

3526
02:30:12.321 --> 02:30:13.730
<v Speaker 2>It's been about a year or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3527
02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:17.000
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who's got kids in public</v>
<v Speaker 2>school in Manhattan,</v>

3528
02:30:17.001 --> 02:30:19.630
<v Speaker 2>and he was going crazy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the,</v>

3529
02:30:19.631 --> 02:30:21.680
<v Speaker 2>the changes that it's made to their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3530
02:30:22.180 --> 02:30:23.350
<v Speaker 2>to what they have to study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

3531
02:30:23.351 --> 02:30:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Kay has been railing about it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3532
02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:27.260
<v Speaker 2>The whole twitter rant about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3533
02:30:27.261 --> 02:30:28.890
<v Speaker 2>His kids are in Manhattan schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

3534
02:30:29.340 --> 02:30:30.141
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3535
02:30:30.141 --> 02:30:32.000
<v Speaker 2>My son's in Santa Monica schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>public schools,</v>

3536
02:30:32.001 --> 02:30:33.200
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been dealing with it.</v>

3537
02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:35.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the common core as such is not a</v>

3538
02:30:35.871 --> 02:30:37.760
<v Speaker 2>terrible curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's the worst thing in</v>

3539
02:30:37.761 --> 02:30:39.620
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My argument is that it shouldn't be</v>

3540
02:30:39.621 --> 02:30:40.640
<v Speaker 2>standardized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3541
02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:44.720
<v Speaker 2>I think the parents in localities should</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some decision over what is taught</v>

3542
02:30:44.721 --> 02:30:45.630
<v Speaker 2>to their children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3543
02:30:46.130 --> 02:30:48.710
<v Speaker 2>And I like cultural diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like intellectual diversity,</v>

3544
02:30:48.711 --> 02:30:50.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This destroys that.</v>

3545
02:30:51.290 --> 02:30:53.720
<v Speaker 2>All the kids in the country will think</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same way is the,</v>

3546
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:57.290
<v Speaker 2>is not that they're actually going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what is intended with this</v>

3547
02:30:57.840 --> 02:31:01.010
<v Speaker 2>and it'll certainly push them toward</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking in the same way.</v>

3548
02:31:01.700 --> 02:31:05.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a standardization of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the worst thing we can do.</v>

3549
02:31:05.900 --> 02:31:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Standardization of thinking.</v>

3550
02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Is it the idea of conformity on a mass</v>
<v Speaker 2>scale like that without leaving in any</v>

3551
02:31:13.941 --> 02:31:18.941
<v Speaker 2>room for creativity or any room for</v>
<v Speaker 2>exploring the possibilities of the</v>

3552
02:31:19.471 --> 02:31:20.040
<v Speaker 2>wonders</v>

3553
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:24.210
<v Speaker 3>of the unknown of your future instead of</v>
<v Speaker 3>just trying to create a robot that can</v>

3554
02:31:24.211 --> 02:31:25.500
<v Speaker 3>compete with China?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3555
02:31:25.950 --> 02:31:27.750
<v Speaker 3>that's what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Race to the top.</v>

3556
02:31:27.751 --> 02:31:31.320
<v Speaker 3>It's the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Race to the top of the world.</v>

3557
02:31:32.320 --> 02:31:32.941
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3558
02:31:32.941 --> 02:31:34.830
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the coolest trends in this</v>

3559
02:31:34.831 --> 02:31:39.831
<v Speaker 3>country right now is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not people that are trying to do</v>

3560
02:31:40.111 --> 02:31:41.790
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but rather people that are trying to do</v>

3561
02:31:41.791 --> 02:31:45.060
<v Speaker 3>their own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that what we're getting out of the</v>

3562
02:31:45.061 --> 02:31:49.470
<v Speaker 3>Internet is we're getting a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 3>small independent businesses where</v>

3563
02:31:49.471 --> 02:31:51.750
<v Speaker 3>people leave their job and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3564
02:31:51.751 --> 02:31:54.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sell blank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make my own clock.</v>

3565
02:31:54.321 --> 02:31:55.800
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do that,</v>

3566
02:31:56.070 --> 02:31:57.720
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to find something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm passionate.</v>

3567
02:31:57.721 --> 02:31:58.200
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3568
02:31:58.200 --> 02:32:01.380
<v Speaker 3>and through the Internet there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an avenue where I can pursue this as a</v>

3569
02:32:01.381 --> 02:32:02.980
<v Speaker 3>career where I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3570
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:05.370
<v Speaker 3>dental have to join some gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking corporation.</v>

3571
02:32:05.370 --> 02:32:08.340
<v Speaker 3>It'd be a cog in the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do something that I actually</v>

3572
02:32:08.341 --> 02:32:09.174
<v Speaker 3>enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3573
02:32:09.330 --> 02:32:13.680
<v Speaker 3>And we're seeing this in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this trend in restaurants where</v>

3574
02:32:13.681 --> 02:32:18.681
<v Speaker 3>they want like raw wood tables and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>old style lighting and everything's sort</v>

3575
02:32:18.961 --> 02:32:23.610
<v Speaker 3>of rustic with metal and wood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like this is longing for</v>

3576
02:32:23.611 --> 02:32:27.570
<v Speaker 3>something that's not homogenized and</v>
<v Speaker 3>pasteurized and mass produced.</v>

3577
02:32:27.930 --> 02:32:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Like we have this longing for things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>

3578
02:32:30.121 --> 02:32:32.090
<v Speaker 3>they're crafted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we,</v>

3579
02:32:32.130 --> 02:32:35.100
<v Speaker 3>you keep these seeing these fucking hand</v>
<v Speaker 3>crafted sandwiches.</v>

3580
02:32:35.101 --> 02:32:38.280
<v Speaker 3>What does that even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you got robots making your fucking</v>

3581
02:32:38.281 --> 02:32:40.140
<v Speaker 3>sandwiches in some places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about,</v>

3582
02:32:40.330 --> 02:32:44.100
<v Speaker 3>but that that term handcrafted cocktails</v>
<v Speaker 3>and handcraft unit,</v>

3583
02:32:44.370 --> 02:32:47.100
<v Speaker 3>that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's a common thing that you hear</v>

3584
02:32:47.101 --> 02:32:51.150
<v Speaker 3>over and over again and it kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>represents this desire that people have</v>

3585
02:32:51.330 --> 02:32:54.300
<v Speaker 3>to get away from this gigantic system of</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

3586
02:32:54.460 --> 02:32:55.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>

3587
02:32:55.090 --> 02:32:56.800
<v Speaker 2>that's happening outside of the school</v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

3588
02:32:56.950 --> 02:32:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's happening outside of mainstream</v>

3589
02:32:58.871 --> 02:33:00.070
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3590
02:33:00.071 --> 02:33:04.120
<v Speaker 2>That's happening just in the real world</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's happening among entrepreneurs</v>

3591
02:33:04.121 --> 02:33:06.940
<v Speaker 2>that's happening in commerce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's happening just in the culture</v>

3592
02:33:06.941 --> 02:33:08.890
<v Speaker 2>generally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's happening in technology that's</v>

3593
02:33:08.891 --> 02:33:12.130
<v Speaker 2>happening on social media where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are pursuing happiness,</v>

3594
02:33:12.131 --> 02:33:13.930
<v Speaker 2>spontaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's run.</v>

3595
02:33:13.960 --> 02:33:17.110
<v Speaker 2>It's driven by individuals and</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual desires.</v>

3596
02:33:17.170 --> 02:33:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not by standardization,</v>

3597
02:33:19.541 --> 02:33:23.080
<v Speaker 2>not by had a need to compete as a nation</v>
<v Speaker 2>against another nation.</v>

3598
02:33:23.170 --> 02:33:23.851
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an,</v>

3599
02:33:23.851 --> 02:33:25.930
<v Speaker 2>it's a beautiful thing and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

3600
02:33:25.931 --> 02:33:29.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's much more of that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great time to be an entrepreneur.</v>

3601
02:33:29.021 --> 02:33:33.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a great time to do your own thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make a living as I'm trying to do</v>

3602
02:33:33.581 --> 02:33:34.480
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3603
02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Doing what you're passionate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to bring it back to that.</v>

3604
02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:37.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3605
02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:41.380
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of unique in the sense that,</v>

3606
02:33:41.381 --> 02:33:43.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know a lot of other professors</v>

3607
02:33:43.781 --> 02:33:46.810
<v Speaker 3>that have decided to try to separate</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the system and create their own</v>

3608
02:33:46.811 --> 02:33:48.100
<v Speaker 3>courses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know of any.</v>

3609
02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:50.740
<v Speaker 3>So you're a fucking rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a rebel.</v>

3610
02:33:51.130 --> 02:33:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard of any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>

3611
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:55.840
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we should call it that instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rebel university.</v>

3612
02:33:55.841 --> 02:34:00.841
<v Speaker 2>That might be a picture and dudes with</v>
<v Speaker 2>like American flag Bandana.</v>

3613
02:34:01.130 --> 02:34:03.700
<v Speaker 2>Not Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not the image I want to present.</v>

3614
02:34:04.390 --> 02:34:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3615
02:34:05.441 --> 02:34:06.191
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been surprised.</v>

3616
02:34:06.191 --> 02:34:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I've been researching and I haven't been</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to find anyone who's done it.</v>

3617
02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:09.773
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3618
02:34:11.020 --> 02:34:12.370
<v Speaker 2>so there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is ed ex,</v>

3619
02:34:12.371 --> 02:34:13.640
<v Speaker 2>there's Coursera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's you,</v>

3620
02:34:13.641 --> 02:34:14.680
<v Speaker 2>udacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's these,</v>

3621
02:34:14.681 --> 02:34:17.140
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these big moocs,</v>

3622
02:34:17.170 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 2>massive online</v>

3623
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:20.800
<v Speaker 1>courses that are basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just in partnership with</v>

3624
02:34:20.810 --> 02:34:21.641
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3625
02:34:21.641 --> 02:34:24.820
<v Speaker 1>And so they get professors in as</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities to teach these moocs.</v>

3626
02:34:24.850 --> 02:34:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these people already have jobs.</v>

3627
02:34:27.161 --> 02:34:28.390
<v Speaker 1>They have tenure usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3628
02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:30.910
<v Speaker 1>So they don't need to go independent</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely.</v>

3629
02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen anyone who's gone</v>

3630
02:34:32.831 --> 02:34:34.120
<v Speaker 1>independent entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

3631
02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I am unusual in that I have a phd and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been a professor and I have a book</v>

3632
02:34:41.141 --> 02:34:43.450
<v Speaker 1>that's given me a fairly big public</v>
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>

3633
02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:45.213
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Mit,</v>

3634
02:34:45.220 --> 02:34:46.990
<v Speaker 1>they're an aren't a lot of people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3635
02:34:47.020 --> 02:34:49.840
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of people with phds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of people with big</v>

3636
02:34:49.841 --> 02:34:50.680
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not,</v>

3637
02:34:50.681 --> 02:34:52.420
<v Speaker 1>there's very few people with both those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3638
02:34:52.450 --> 02:34:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say the thing who we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

3639
02:34:53.891 --> 02:34:55.780
<v Speaker 1>adjuncts were not actually tenured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3640
02:34:55.781 --> 02:34:59.260
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sorta unique in that position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say the thing that people</v>

3641
02:34:59.261 --> 02:35:00.580
<v Speaker 1>hate me when I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3642
02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:01.990
<v Speaker 1>why don't you start a podcast?</v>

3643
02:35:02.050 --> 02:35:04.150
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See they go,</v>

3644
02:35:04.151 --> 02:35:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

3645
02:35:06.250 --> 02:35:08.500
<v Speaker 1>I only get so mad at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you telling everybody to give</v>

3646
02:35:08.501 --> 02:35:11.410
<v Speaker 1>him make it her own fucking podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think someone's interesting.</v>

3647
02:35:11.411 --> 02:35:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I think they should do a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

3648

<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

02:35:37.300 --> 02:35:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the freest form of expression</v>

3661
02:35:39.850 --> 02:35:40.870
<v Speaker 1>available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3662
02:35:41.170 --> 02:35:44.770
<v Speaker 1>No one can stop you from just speaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind and making errors and</v>

3663
02:35:44.771 --> 02:35:47.260
<v Speaker 1>corrections and debating things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for instance,</v>

3664
02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:51.160
<v Speaker 1>where in the world other than a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you have a half hour discussion on</v>

3665
02:35:51.161 --> 02:35:51.430
<v Speaker 1>the word?</v>

3666
02:35:51.430 --> 02:35:52.263
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3667
02:35:52.660 --> 02:35:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3668
02:35:53.290 --> 02:35:56.050
<v Speaker 1>and half joking the entire time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3669
02:35:56.110 --> 02:36:01.110
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't exist anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't remember or they don't know</v>

3670
02:36:01.330 --> 02:36:04.780
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Very long ago there were three TV</v>

3671
02:36:04.781 --> 02:36:05.501
<v Speaker 1>networks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3672
02:36:05.501 --> 02:36:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I remember that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A handful of radio stations and about</v>

3673
02:36:08.651 --> 02:36:12.190
<v Speaker 1>three national newspapers and that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3674
02:36:12.220 --> 02:36:14.260
<v Speaker 1>That's how I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they all said the same thing.</v>

3675
02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Fox came around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like,</v>

3676
02:36:16.421 --> 02:36:20.890
<v Speaker 1>what is Rupert Murdoch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is Rupert Murdoch as evil as he may</v>

3677
02:36:20.891 --> 02:36:21.940
<v Speaker 1>be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some ways.</v>

3678
02:36:21.970 --> 02:36:25.600
<v Speaker 1>He is primarily responsible for breaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>that monopoly and allowing all this</v>

3679
02:36:25.601 --> 02:36:26.980
<v Speaker 1>stuff to happen now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3680
02:36:26.981 --> 02:36:28.510
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the one who came in and challenged</v>

3681
02:36:28.511 --> 02:36:33.511
<v Speaker 1>the FCC and got that other band and</v>
<v Speaker 1>established Fox and Fox people forget,</v>

3682
02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:35.920
<v Speaker 1>was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very edgy when it started.</v>

3683
02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:37.330
<v Speaker 1>It's still is in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3684
02:36:37.331 --> 02:36:39.460
<v Speaker 1>If you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at Fox programming,</v>

3685
02:36:39.461 --> 02:36:42.340
<v Speaker 1>it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's far edgier than the other networks.</v>

3686
02:36:42.340 --> 02:36:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he had to do that on Fox was always</v>

3687
02:36:45.641 --> 02:36:47.900
<v Speaker 1>thought of as literally as simpsons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3688
02:36:48.020 --> 02:36:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Married with children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3689
02:36:49.150 --> 02:36:49.811
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3690
02:36:49.811 --> 02:36:52.030
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murdoch gets a lot of credit for that.</v>

3691
02:36:52.060 --> 02:36:53.770
<v Speaker 1>The left will never say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they should.</v>

3692
02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:55.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3693
02:36:55.001 --> 02:36:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone can be evil and still do good.</v>

3694
02:36:57.971 --> 02:36:58.900
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3695
02:36:58.901 --> 02:37:01.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of disagree with many of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his politics of course.</v>

3696
02:37:01.900 --> 02:37:04.330
<v Speaker 1>But my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did a wonderful thing for everyone.</v>

3697
02:37:04.690 --> 02:37:07.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't think any of them thought the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet was going to be what it is now.</v>

3698
02:37:07.841 --> 02:37:09.610
<v Speaker 1>The things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody saw that comment.</v>

3699
02:37:09.611 --> 02:37:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Now I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3700
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to buy anything on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3701
02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm maybe I'll read New York Times on</v>

3702
02:37:15.981 --> 02:37:17.870
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to actually buy</v>

3703
02:37:17.871 --> 02:37:19.040
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I've read?</v>

3704
02:37:19.041 --> 02:37:23.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a staggering statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>39% of everything that's bought online</v>

3705
02:37:23.961 --> 02:37:26.480
<v Speaker 1>is bought through amazon.com yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3706
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:27.770
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

3707
02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Remember when Amazon was a failure for</v>
<v Speaker 1>years to make any,</v>

3708
02:37:31.490 --> 02:37:32.720
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a joke that it should be</v>

3709
02:37:32.721 --> 02:37:35.360
<v Speaker 1>amazon.org because there was no profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3710
02:37:35.390 --> 02:37:35.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3711
02:37:35.871 --> 02:37:38.150
<v Speaker 1>For years be Zos made not a dime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>

3712
02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure for years he made no mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuckers laughing.</v>

3713
02:37:41.211 --> 02:37:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Now when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was only selling books and then</v>

3714
02:37:44.241 --> 02:37:46.730
<v Speaker 1>he started selling whatever toothpaste</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff and still it wasn't making</v>

3715
02:37:46.731 --> 02:37:47.211
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

3716
02:37:47.211 --> 02:37:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archery products by archery releases and</v>

3717
02:37:52.101 --> 02:37:54.520
<v Speaker 1>arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And did you hear what he's brought heads</v>

3718
02:37:54.640 --> 02:37:55.770
<v Speaker 1>rolling out now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3719
02:37:55.790 --> 02:38:00.740
<v Speaker 1>one hour delivery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can order something on Amazon and</v>

3720
02:38:00.741 --> 02:38:03.110
<v Speaker 1>get it delivered in an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that possible?</v>

3721
02:38:03.140 --> 02:38:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to set up these Amazon</v>

3722
02:38:04.940 --> 02:38:05.990
<v Speaker 1>outlet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're doing.</v>

3723
02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Sprinters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got people with wings and their feet</v>

3724
02:38:07.911 --> 02:38:09.350
<v Speaker 1>and then the Amazon buttons.</v>

3725
02:38:09.470 --> 02:38:12.350
<v Speaker 1>You know about the Amazon buttons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have these like stick on buttons you</v>

3726
02:38:12.351 --> 02:38:13.580
<v Speaker 1>can put on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3727
02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:15.010
<v Speaker 1>And if you need a replacement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

3728
02:38:15.080 --> 02:38:17.690
<v Speaker 1>and it just automatically assuming it'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>show up in an hour,</v>

3729
02:38:18.220 --> 02:38:20.690
<v Speaker 1>like laundry detergent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom there in an hour.</v>

3730
02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bizarre.</v>

3731
02:38:22.790 --> 02:38:27.650
<v Speaker 1>But that seems like kind of silly</v>
<v Speaker 1>because unless there's something like</v>

3732
02:38:27.651 --> 02:38:31.580
<v Speaker 1>super critical that you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if this one item only like</v>

3733
02:38:31.581 --> 02:38:34.280
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you're going to need a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of shell get out of a toothpaste button</v>

3734
02:38:34.281 --> 02:38:36.440
<v Speaker 1>and a fucking toilet paper button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3735
02:38:36.540 --> 02:38:38.360
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds,</v>

3736
02:38:38.390 --> 02:38:40.910
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3737
02:38:41.450 --> 02:38:42.530
<v Speaker 1>but good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3738
02:38:42.590 --> 02:38:43.351
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

3739
02:38:43.351 --> 02:38:45.740
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I don't like about Amazon is what I</v>

3740
02:38:45.741 --> 02:38:47.360
<v Speaker 1>hear about the way their employees are</v>
<v Speaker 1>treated.</v>

3741
02:38:47.450 --> 02:38:49.730
<v Speaker 1>What I don't like about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I hear about the pressure that</v>

3742
02:38:49.731 --> 02:38:52.520
<v Speaker 1>they're under and they have to run from</v>
<v Speaker 1>one spot to the other and deliver these</v>

3743
02:38:52.521 --> 02:38:54.800
<v Speaker 1>things and they're yelled at and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3744
02:38:54.860 --> 02:38:57.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big high pressure factory.</v>

3745
02:38:57.080 --> 02:38:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are,</v>

3746
02:38:57.620 --> 02:39:00.320
<v Speaker 1>those are terrible places to work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>always have been.</v>

3747
02:39:00.670 --> 02:39:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But convenience.</v>

3748
02:39:03.021 --> 02:39:06.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming they're better than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternatives for those people.</v>

3749
02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they wouldn't work there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw like sweatshops,</v>

3750
02:39:10.130 --> 02:39:12.110
<v Speaker 1>sweatshops and Vietnam are terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>

3751
02:39:12.111 --> 02:39:14.870
<v Speaker 1>but obviously they're better than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternatives for those people that work</v>

3752
02:39:14.871 --> 02:39:16.100
<v Speaker 1>in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they wouldn't work in them.</v>

3753
02:39:16.101 --> 02:39:17.070
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

3754
02:39:17.090 --> 02:39:20.060
<v Speaker 1>they have a choice between working in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweatshop and being an abject poverty.</v>

3755
02:39:20.810 --> 02:39:22.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's a good thing to work</v>

3756
02:39:22.641 --> 02:39:27.380
<v Speaker 1>in a sweatshop or an Amazon factory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am saying undoubtedly it's better</v>

3757
02:39:27.410 --> 02:39:31.310
<v Speaker 1>than what else there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever happened to that company that</v>

3758
02:39:31.311 --> 02:39:36.140
<v Speaker 1>was making phones that were supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be more ethical.</v>

3759
02:39:36.620 --> 02:39:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the idea behind it?</v>

3760
02:39:38.261 --> 02:39:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Fairphone they call themselves a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairphone but they fucked up and they</v>

3761
02:39:41.481 --> 02:39:43.550
<v Speaker 1>only had like three g and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3762
02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:46.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have no slave labor and everyone</v>

3763
02:39:46.971 --> 02:39:50.060
<v Speaker 1>gets paid a fine wage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you only get three g fuck you.</v>

3764
02:39:50.270 --> 02:39:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I want four g.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can feel really good about yourself</v>

3765
02:39:52.941 --> 02:39:54.260
<v Speaker 1>but you won't be able to make a call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3766
02:39:54.261 --> 02:39:57.530
<v Speaker 1>you won't get any pictures quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they ha there it is.</v>

3767
02:39:57.531 --> 02:39:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Fairphone is it still up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair.</v>

3768
02:39:59.830 --> 02:40:02.390

<v Speaker 1>shipping.</v>

3769
02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:05.600

<v Speaker 1>gets four g lte yet.</v>

3770
02:40:05.810 --> 02:40:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Cause if it doesn't they can fuck off</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was like it was very limited.</v>

3771
02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:16.980
<v Speaker 3>What you're saying is that you preferred</v>
<v Speaker 3>of slaves make your phone.</v>

3772
02:40:17.010 --> 02:40:18.570
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what you just said.</v>

3773
02:40:18.590 --> 02:40:19.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm joking.</v>

3774
02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:23.970
<v Speaker 3>32 gigabytes of internal storage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking clowns.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Gorilla glass.</v>

3778
02:40:31.651 --> 02:40:34.350
<v Speaker 3>I liked that expandable storage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Micro SD slot,</v>

3779
02:40:34.590 --> 02:40:38.460
<v Speaker 3>but 32 gigabyte internal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's making that thing for them too?</v>

3780
02:40:39.510 --> 02:40:43.560
<v Speaker 3>I hope it's only fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Privileged white people who make them</v>

3781
02:40:43.561 --> 02:40:45.630

<v Speaker 3>At fairphone.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like how they got a black guy with a</v>

3783
02:40:48.091 --> 02:40:49.570
<v Speaker 3>brick phone.</v>

3784

<v Speaker 3>What is that point?</v>

3785
02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have that guy with a brick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get the black eye of brick and he's</v>

3786

<v Speaker 3>standing in front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swamped with,</v>

3787
02:40:58.940 --> 02:41:02.400
<v Speaker 3>but why they give me rick from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a fucking rap video in the 80s</v>

<v Speaker 3>bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>phones.</v>

3790
02:41:07.050 --> 02:41:09.810
<v Speaker 3>Do they have good cameras too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was the camera say Jamie?</v>

3791
02:41:11.630 --> 02:41:12.860
<v Speaker 3>The statistics?</v>

3792
02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:18.540
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't say what the cameras out dare</v>

3793
02:41:18.541 --> 02:41:21.000
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I can safely say we're boycotting</v>

3794
02:41:21.001 --> 02:41:21.900
<v Speaker 3>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3795
02:41:21.901 --> 02:41:24.450
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how fair it really is.</v>

3796
02:41:24.451 --> 02:41:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Like where are they getting their</v>
<v Speaker 3>minerals?</v>

3797
02:41:25.980 --> 02:41:30.330
<v Speaker 3>That's what's important because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>minerals fair trade generally is a scam.</v>

3798
02:41:30.450 --> 02:41:31.250
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3799
02:41:31.250 --> 02:41:32.280
<v Speaker 3>it's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3800
02:41:32.281 --> 02:41:34.170
<v Speaker 3>what does it mean look fair?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trade coffee.</v>

3801
02:41:35.270 --> 02:41:36.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

3802
02:41:36.211 --> 02:41:39.210
<v Speaker 3>here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend owns caveman coffee and</v>

3803
02:41:39.211 --> 02:41:40.800
<v Speaker 3>caveman coffee is the coffee that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

3804
02:41:41.090 --> 02:41:43.980
<v Speaker 3>It is owned by a family in Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a single family,</v>

3805
02:41:43.981 --> 02:41:46.620
<v Speaker 3>single origin farm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you buy it from them,</v>

3806
02:41:46.740 --> 02:41:49.020
<v Speaker 3>you are literally buying from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>farmers.</v>

3807
02:41:49.380 --> 02:41:51.480
<v Speaker 3>So like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get it from the farmers,</v>

3808
02:41:51.481 --> 02:41:55.490
<v Speaker 3>they roast it and they sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hire all American labor and they</v>

3809
02:41:55.530 --> 02:41:58.380
<v Speaker 3>sell it in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's like fair trade.</v>

3810
02:41:58.410 --> 02:42:01.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's unfair trade and unfair trade</v>

3811
02:42:01.170 --> 02:42:04.230
<v Speaker 3>is those people that live in those</v>
<v Speaker 3>places where they have the nets,</v>

3812
02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:07.110
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that make iphones and they have to put</v>

3813
02:42:07.111 --> 02:42:09.690
<v Speaker 3>fucking nets around the building to keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>them from jumping off.</v>

3814
02:42:09.691 --> 02:42:13.680
<v Speaker 3>Like that seems unfair that they have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>live in these dormitories and that they,</v>

3815
02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:17.100
<v Speaker 3>they're so concerned with suicides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they put nets all around the like</v>

3816
02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:20.520
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's something that you need to fix.</v>

3817
02:42:20.521 --> 02:42:21.354
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3818
02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:25.230
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what's the alternative?</v>

3819
02:42:25.231 --> 02:42:25.591
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3820
02:42:25.591 --> 02:42:27.510
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like how is that going to happen?</v>

3821
02:42:27.511 --> 02:42:29.550
<v Speaker 3>Should we sort of impose it from</v>
<v Speaker 3>without,</v>

3822
02:42:29.551 --> 02:42:34.260
<v Speaker 3>should you Americans fix those factories</v>
<v Speaker 3>in China and Vietnam for them?</v>

3823
02:42:34.500 --> 02:42:37.560
<v Speaker 3>Or should the Chinese and Vietnamese</v>
<v Speaker 3>workers work that out?</v>

3824
02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:41.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans probably shouldn't get their</v>

3825
02:42:41.071 --> 02:42:45.330
<v Speaker 3>phones made there if the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>making their phones are being paid.</v>

3826
02:42:45.331 --> 02:42:48.480
<v Speaker 3>So then you disempower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People want to lose their question.</v>

3827
02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:51.330
<v Speaker 3>But how'd they get employed in the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>place that American's create this</v>

3828
02:42:51.331 --> 02:42:53.520
<v Speaker 3>problem?</v>
<v Speaker 3>By going over there to the slave labor</v>

3829
02:42:53.521 --> 02:42:56.790
<v Speaker 3>factories and having their phones built</v>
<v Speaker 3>there instead of having a built in Ohio,</v>

3830
02:42:56.820 --> 02:43:00.930
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't work in those factories if</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't better than the alternative.</v>

3831
02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:03.270
<v Speaker 3>They're making more in those factories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>undoubtedly.</v>

3832
02:43:03.420 --> 02:43:05.490
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise they wouldn't be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see that argument.</v>

3833
02:43:05.491 --> 02:43:07.560
<v Speaker 3>They are wood outside those factories.</v>

3834
02:43:07.590 --> 02:43:11.260
<v Speaker 3>But the only reason why they are making</v>
<v Speaker 3>those phones in those factories is</v>

3835
02:43:11.270 --> 02:43:14.350
<v Speaker 3>because they make substantially last</v>
<v Speaker 3>than someone who works in America.</v>

3836
02:43:14.390 --> 02:43:16.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at the conditions that</v>

3837
02:43:16.091 --> 02:43:19.090
<v Speaker 3>they live and work under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their horrific capitalist development</v>

3838
02:43:19.091 --> 02:43:21.440
<v Speaker 3>sucks in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3839
02:43:21.490 --> 02:43:23.920
<v Speaker 3>But it's also necessary to get to</v>
<v Speaker 3>something much better.</v>

3840
02:43:23.950 --> 02:43:26.200
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So our ancestors worked in factories</v>

3841
02:43:26.350 --> 02:43:27.490
<v Speaker 3>worse than those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3842
02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:30.070
<v Speaker 3>But thank God they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because as a society,</v>

3843
02:43:30.071 --> 02:43:33.760
<v Speaker 3>we advanced tremendously because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in quotes,</v>

3844
02:43:33.910 --> 02:43:34.900
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russell says,</v>

3845
02:43:34.901 --> 02:43:37.170
<v Speaker 3>slave labor is awesome for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3846
02:43:38.110 --> 02:43:40.360
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were the one who wanted a</v>
<v Speaker 3>slave made phone.</v>

3847
02:43:40.390 --> 02:43:42.880
<v Speaker 3>Now that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3848
02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:45.160
<v Speaker 3>you want an axiom slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that,</v>

3849
02:43:45.161 --> 02:43:47.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to fairphone sounds like an</v>

3850
02:43:47.321 --> 02:43:49.090
<v Speaker 3>awesome idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does sound like there was another</v>

3851
02:43:49.091 --> 02:43:51.010
<v Speaker 3>company that had an interesting idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

3852
02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:53.410
<v Speaker 3>Then we're going to switch things out</v>
<v Speaker 3>modularly.</v>

3853
02:43:53.620 --> 02:43:56.980
<v Speaker 3>So like your screen could be switched</v>
<v Speaker 3>out when a new,</v>

3854
02:43:56.981 --> 02:43:59.800
<v Speaker 3>more improved screen came along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get switched out.</v>

3855
02:43:59.801 --> 02:44:03.910
<v Speaker 3>Your motherboard switch out on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be like different parts that it</v>

3856
02:44:03.911 --> 02:44:08.200
<v Speaker 3>was like a segmented sort of a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea being that we're doing is</v>

3857
02:44:08.201 --> 02:44:11.830
<v Speaker 3>incredibly wasteful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have this whole unit as a phone and</v>

3858
02:44:11.831 --> 02:44:14.230
<v Speaker 3>then we get a new one every year and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>half,</v>

3859
02:44:14.231 --> 02:44:15.490
<v Speaker 3>two years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

3860
02:44:15.730 --> 02:44:17.650
<v Speaker 3>And he throw the old one out and get the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whom new one.</v>

3861
02:44:17.860 --> 02:44:19.570
<v Speaker 3>What they're saying is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead,</v>

3862
02:44:19.571 --> 02:44:21.910
<v Speaker 3>when they come up with new improvements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a new and improved camera,</v>

3863
02:44:21.911 --> 02:44:25.630
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to put that camera</v>
<v Speaker 3>section and take the old one out.</v>

3864
02:44:25.631 --> 02:44:26.920
<v Speaker 3>Put a new one in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds good.</v>

3865
02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:27.873
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not,</v>

3866
02:44:28.510 --> 02:44:30.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're all made by slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who's making either,</v>

3867
02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:34.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that,</v>

3868
02:44:34.091 --> 02:44:35.650
<v Speaker 3>is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's it called?</v>

3869
02:44:35.650 --> 02:44:37.330
<v Speaker 3>Project Arra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google.</v>

3870
02:44:37.780 --> 02:44:38.613
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3871
02:44:38.830 --> 02:44:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3872
02:44:40.810 --> 02:44:42.550
<v Speaker 3>Ara,</v>
<v Speaker 3>project Ara.</v>

3873
02:44:43.630 --> 02:44:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google is also got a new interesting</v>

3874
02:44:45.401 --> 02:44:49.240
<v Speaker 3>thing they're doing with their phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's their flagship phone called?</v>

3875
02:44:50.130 --> 02:44:52.660
<v Speaker 3>Nexus with the nexus phones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>

3876
02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:56.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not constrained to a carrier.</v>

3877
02:44:57.040 --> 02:45:01.150
<v Speaker 3>So say if you have a nexus foam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll work on sprint,</v>

3878
02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:04.270
<v Speaker 3>t mobile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever's got the signal and then you</v>

3879
02:45:04.271 --> 02:45:06.520
<v Speaker 3>just pay google,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you pay Google,</v>

3880
02:45:06.521 --> 02:45:10.840
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fee is that they charge and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make some sort of deals out with</v>

3881
02:45:10.841 --> 02:45:12.730
<v Speaker 3>all the carriers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that good for us?</v>

3882
02:45:12.910 --> 02:45:14.560
<v Speaker 3>It's good for you if you want good</v>
<v Speaker 3>service.</v>

3883
02:45:14.590 --> 02:45:15.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then that's good.</v>

3884
02:45:15.490 --> 02:45:16.323
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I like it.</v>

3885
02:45:16.570 --> 02:45:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're,</v>

3886
02:45:17.330 --> 02:45:18.760
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a place where t mobile</v>

3887
02:45:18.761 --> 02:45:20.620
<v Speaker 3>doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can get,</v>

3888
02:45:21.070 --> 02:45:23.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at and t or verizon or what have you,</v>

3889
02:45:23.530 --> 02:45:25.180
<v Speaker 3>you have a google phone or to work.</v>

3890
02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:26.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have one of those next nexus</v>

3891
02:45:26.551 --> 02:45:29.080
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any institution or organization changed</v>

3892
02:45:29.170 --> 02:45:32.200
<v Speaker 3>human life more dramatically than</v>
<v Speaker 3>google?</v>

3893
02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:33.280
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

3894
02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:34.870
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're nuts.</v>

3895
02:45:35.220 --> 02:45:38.650
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy company for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

3896
02:45:38.860 --> 02:45:39.371
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

3897
02:45:39.371 --> 02:45:40.410
<v Speaker 3>In a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that ain't good.</v>

3898
02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:41.440
<v Speaker 3>That's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do that,</v>

3899
02:45:41.441 --> 02:45:44.500
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean nothing is ever advanced</v>

3900
02:45:45.250 --> 02:45:47.980
<v Speaker 3>human existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No more,</v>

3901
02:45:48.940 --> 02:45:49.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>broadly,</v>

3902
02:45:49.991 --> 02:45:54.250
<v Speaker 3>dramatically and swiftly than Google and</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost entirely for the good.</v>

3903
02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:55.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost entirely.</v>

3904
02:45:55.930 --> 02:45:58.120
<v Speaker 3>If you lived in the bay area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't know it,</v>

3905
02:45:58.490 --> 02:45:59.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause they're the devil.</v>

3906
02:46:00.220 --> 02:46:03.220
<v Speaker 3>Well they're the devil because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are being forced out can't</v>

3907
02:46:03.221 --> 02:46:04.900
<v Speaker 3>afford the homes anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3908
02:46:04.901 --> 02:46:07.900
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who was an executive at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google for a long time and she just left</v>

3909
02:46:07.901 --> 02:46:09.190
<v Speaker 3>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3910
02:46:09.410 --> 02:46:10.010
<v Speaker 3>for another</v>

3911
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:11.900
<v Speaker 1>evil corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

3912
02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:13.280
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3913
02:46:13.281 --> 02:46:16.340
<v Speaker 1>they would tell me how much the houses</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their neighborhood costs.</v>

3914
02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:18.770
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't make any sense.</v>

3915
02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:20.570
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a house in their neighborhood</v>

3916
02:46:20.571 --> 02:46:23.510
<v Speaker 1>that was $14 million and it was just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking house.</v>

3917
02:46:23.810 --> 02:46:25.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a house.</v>

3918
02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I know is that house is in Nebraska</v>
<v Speaker 1>would cost 200 grand and it didn't make</v>

3919
02:46:29.271 --> 02:46:30.680
<v Speaker 1>any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do about it?</v>

3920
02:46:31.070 --> 02:46:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3921
02:46:32.420 --> 02:46:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what happens is so San</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francisco will no longer be a</v>

3922
02:46:35.901 --> 02:46:39.050
<v Speaker 1>countercultural center at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all for sure,</v>

3923
02:46:39.080 --> 02:46:41.780
<v Speaker 1>nor Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those people will move.</v>

3924
02:46:41.900 --> 02:46:44.630
<v Speaker 1>But go somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then establish a new portland hub,</v>

3925
02:46:44.690 --> 02:46:46.820
<v Speaker 1>your spot Portland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll actually,</v>

3926
02:46:46.850 --> 02:46:49.490
<v Speaker 1>that's super counter called Portland's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to become too expensive.</v>

3927
02:46:49.491 --> 02:46:51.230
<v Speaker 1>And then the moved somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eugene.</v>

3928
02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well where I'm going and Salem,</v>

3929
02:46:54.510 --> 02:46:55.460
<v Speaker 1>which is right down the road.</v>

3930
02:46:55.460 --> 02:46:57.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean it just things move,</v>

3931
02:46:57.321 --> 02:46:58.400
<v Speaker 1>things shift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3932
02:46:58.401 --> 02:47:01.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's with San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always a counter cultural capital.</v>

3933
02:47:01.701 --> 02:47:02.381
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>

3934
02:47:02.381 --> 02:47:06.230
<v Speaker 1>It started in the 1960s right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only for about two decades.</v>

3935
02:47:06.231 --> 02:47:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Was it anything important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those to San Francisco in New York,</v>

3936
02:47:10.311 --> 02:47:13.010
<v Speaker 1>losing those two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had my friend Judas freelander</v>

3937
02:47:13.011 --> 02:47:16.970
<v Speaker 1>who was in here a couple of weeks ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he lives in Manhattan.</v>

3938
02:47:16.971 --> 02:47:18.890
<v Speaker 1>He was talking to me about how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan has changed.</v>

3939
02:47:18.891 --> 02:47:20.240
<v Speaker 1>It's all just bankers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

3940
02:47:20.450 --> 02:47:21.480
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all what?</v>

3941
02:47:22.210 --> 02:47:26.020
<v Speaker 1>So now the cool people are in Brooklyn</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Queens and Jersey City and you know,</v>

3942
02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:28.940
<v Speaker 1>they move around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a bad thing necessarily.</v>

3943
02:47:28.941 --> 02:47:29.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do we,</v>

3944
02:47:29.571 --> 02:47:32.810
<v Speaker 1>why does Manhattan have to be the place</v>
<v Speaker 1>where all the cool shit's happening?</v>

3945
02:47:33.170 --> 02:47:34.730
<v Speaker 1>And it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good way of looking at it,</v>

3946
02:47:34.731 --> 02:47:37.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's always has been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for a lot of people in the Stone Age,</v>

3947
02:47:37.670 --> 02:47:40.730
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only for really just our lifetimes.</v>

3948
02:47:41.150 --> 02:47:42.920
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a blip in history.</v>

3949
02:47:43.010 --> 02:47:44.930
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one way of looking at it,</v>

3950
02:47:44.931 --> 02:47:47.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in a lot of people's eyes,</v>

3951
02:47:47.211 --> 02:47:51.200
<v Speaker 1>especially in Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's being overtaken by the evil side of</v>

3952
02:47:51.201 --> 02:47:54.230
<v Speaker 1>our civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that are making money by just</v>

3953
02:47:54.231 --> 02:47:59.231
<v Speaker 1>moving numbers around and fucking with</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest rates and dividends and yeah.</v>

3954
02:47:59.530 --> 02:48:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Well Wall Street is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3955
02:48:01.761 --> 02:48:04.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but partly partly because,</v>

3956
02:48:04.610 --> 02:48:05.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tech,</v>

3957
02:48:05.601 --> 02:48:06.470
<v Speaker 1>I am a huge fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3958
02:48:06.471 --> 02:48:08.630
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google in San Francisco is an entirely</v>

3959
02:48:08.631 --> 02:48:09.560
<v Speaker 1>different story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3960
02:48:09.590 --> 02:48:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Because pretty much all they're doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>great things.</v>

3961
02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tech is tech is the bright side of</v>

3962
02:48:14.331 --> 02:48:17.240
<v Speaker 1>prosperity and my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in San Francisco,</v>

3963
02:48:17.241 --> 02:48:19.730
<v Speaker 1>although all those people aren't being</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed out of their neighborhood,</v>

3964
02:48:19.731 --> 02:48:22.490
<v Speaker 1>what you're getting is insane</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>

3965
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean unbelievably staggering</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvements to the quality of life for</v>

3966
02:48:26.511 --> 02:48:28.100
<v Speaker 1>people that are in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's missed all the time</v>

3967
02:48:28.101 --> 02:48:30.440
<v Speaker 1>because people talk about inequality all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

3968
02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Economic inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true that there's greater</v>

3969
02:48:32.511 --> 02:48:35.510
<v Speaker 1>inequality now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would no one talks about is that</v>

3970
02:48:35.511 --> 02:48:40.511
<v Speaker 1>the poor live way better than the poor</v>
<v Speaker 1>did 10 2030 50 years ago.</v>

3971
02:48:41.001 --> 02:48:42.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's largely because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

3972
02:48:42.770 --> 02:48:45.620
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is not a person basically in the</v>

3973
02:48:45.621 --> 02:48:47.330
<v Speaker 1>United States who doesn't own a cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

3974
02:48:47.630 --> 02:48:49.370
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more cell phones than there are</v>

3975
02:48:49.371 --> 02:48:50.080
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3976
02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Sub Saharan Africa that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3977
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Sub Saharan Africa there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a majority of people in sub</v>

3978
02:48:54.671 --> 02:48:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Saharan Africa own cell phones now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3979
02:48:56.840 --> 02:48:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3980
02:48:57.860 --> 02:48:59.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that was unimaginable</v>

3981
02:48:59.600 --> 02:49:01.880
<v Speaker 1>just 10 or 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3982
02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:06.050
<v Speaker 1>This incredible magical machine that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>very poor own,</v>

3983
02:49:06.350 --> 02:49:07.380
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3984
02:49:07.381 --> 02:49:08.160
<v Speaker 1>that's an incredible</v>

3985
02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:09.600
<v Speaker 2>advance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way people live,</v>

3986
02:49:10.230 --> 02:49:13.320
<v Speaker 2>huge numbers of poor people live in air</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioned buildings.</v>

3987
02:49:13.350 --> 02:49:16.140
<v Speaker 2>They didn't in the 1960s and seventies</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3988
02:49:16.170 --> 02:49:18.240
<v Speaker 2>They drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they own cars or they have access to</v>

3989
02:49:18.241 --> 02:49:19.500
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most didn't.</v>

3990
02:49:19.501 --> 02:49:22.200
<v Speaker 2>Most poor people didn't until 2030 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

3991
02:49:23.010 --> 02:49:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

3992
02:49:23.690 --> 02:49:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we miss this,</v>

3993
02:49:25.140 --> 02:49:27.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this huge advance for everyone.</v>

3994
02:49:27.511 --> 02:49:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true that the very poor are farther</v>

3995
02:49:29.761 --> 02:49:32.850
<v Speaker 2>from the very rich now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if the very poor are living better</v>

3996
02:49:32.851 --> 02:49:37.851
<v Speaker 2>and also by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have much more access to power through</v>

3997
02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:40.440
<v Speaker 2>social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the Internet,</v>

3998
02:49:40.530 --> 02:49:42.210
<v Speaker 2>through technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3999
02:49:42.420 --> 02:49:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Then ever before you can be poor and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a public voice now.</v>

4000
02:49:46.500 --> 02:49:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can certainly be middle class and</v>

4001
02:49:48.841 --> 02:49:52.140
<v Speaker 2>have a large public voice that wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible before when there was three</v>

4002
02:49:52.141 --> 02:49:52.974
<v Speaker 2>networks</v>

4003
02:49:53.230 --> 02:49:57.700
<v Speaker 3>and this kind of balanced perspective</v>
<v Speaker 3>will be available to you at renegade</v>

4004
02:49:57.701 --> 02:50:02.410
<v Speaker 3>university launching in the spring of</v>
