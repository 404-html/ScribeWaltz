00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Hello freaks,</v>

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.463
<v Speaker 1>we're live.</v>

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.160
<v Speaker 1>It took a while,</v>

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>but we're here.</v>

5
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>This episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by carbonite.</v>

6
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.241
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:13.074
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

8
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.483
<v Speaker 1>I'm consistent.</v>

9
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Carbonite is a way to back up your files online automatically without you even</v>

10
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Speaker 1>have to thinking about half to thinking about having to think about it.</v>

11
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>More people working from laptops today,</v>

12
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:29.340
<v Speaker 1>giving them mobility and flexibility,</v>

13
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:29.791
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>

14
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>60% of workers use laptops as their primary work computer,</v>

15
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>but computer disasters can happen anytime and anywhere affecting not only your</v>

16
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:39.840
<v Speaker 1>business files,</v>

17
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>but possibly even every computer that operates in your business.</v>

18
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need carbonite.</v>

19
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Online backup and laptops can be expecially,</v>

20
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>especially that's what George Bush says.</v>

21
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:56.241
<v Speaker 1>It especially vulnerable because 33% of stolen laptops are taken from the</v>

22
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:57.181
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>

23
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:02.181
<v Speaker 1>28% from cars and about 12,000 laptops are lost every week at US airports.</v>

24
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty ridiculous,</v>

25
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>but if you have carbonite,</v>

26
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>you'll have peace of mind that you're backed up.</v>

27
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Files are always safe.</v>

28
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>No matter what happens to your laptop.</v>

29
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Carbonite backs up your computer files to the cloud automatically and</v>

30
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:19.014
<v Speaker 1>continually.</v>

31
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.740
<v Speaker 1>No matter how many computers your business has or where they're located,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We were not,</v>

34
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>were not very convincing,</v>

35
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.793
<v Speaker 1>but we mean it.</v>

36

132
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

133
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>designed by Steven Shubin Junior,</v>

134
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>who is an artist that on at higher to create these bad ass designs.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

136
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 1>they're all three d balanced as well,</v>

137
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 1>unlike,</v>

138

142
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 1>but they're not balanced.</v>

143
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>One of the more important parts of creating these was that we wanted to make</v>

144
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:32.770
<v Speaker 1>sure that they were functional for actually working out with,</v>

145
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.311
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you've been it hearts in September.</v>

182
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 3>I have been on the road since the second day of September between and between</v>

183
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 3>Dave had maybe like five days at home,</v>

184
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 3>but the rest of the time I've been traveling.</v>

185
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:07.641
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>

186
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:08.121
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>

187
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 3>I've been in Turkey,</v>

188
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 3>I've been all over Turkey,</v>

189
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.451
<v Speaker 3>amazing country.</v>

190
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 3>My first ever visit to Turkey.</v>

191
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 3>Did you got to do go back to,</v>

192
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 3>I went to go back to the Tempe.</v>

193
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Speaker 3>I spent more than a week at Gabelli Tempe.</v>

194
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 3>I met Klaus Schmidt,</v>

195
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 3>who's the actually rather decent German archaeologist who is excavating</v>

196
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 3>correctly.</v>

197
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 3>Tempe.</v>

198
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 3>I very rarely get on with archeologists,</v>

199
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 3>but I got on with Klaus Schmidt.</v>

200
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:29.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he knew who I was but,</v>

201
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 3>but somehow he was charming and he gave us a lot of access to the site.</v>

202
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 3>He led Santa get right in amongst the pillars and then photograph them.</v>

203
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 3>And we had a good time.</v>

204
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 3>So over there and then took the opportunity of being in Turkey to travel over a</v>

205
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:43.340
<v Speaker 3>lot of the rest of the country.</v>

206
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.400
<v Speaker 3>There's some cool stuff that is like what they call underground cities,</v>

207
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 3>which go down eight,</v>

208
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 3>10 stories under the,</v>

209
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.933
<v Speaker 3>under the earth.</v>

210
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 3>The idea was that people build them to hide from their enemies,</v>

211
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 3>but in my opinion,</v>

212
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:58.050
<v Speaker 3>the last thing you'd want to do if you were hiding from your enemies is wall</v>

213
00:06:58.051 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 3>yourself up in some underground place where all they have to do is just put a</v>

214
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:02.990
<v Speaker 3>stone across the door and you're done for,</v>

215
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.210
<v Speaker 3>I think they had some other function than that.</v>

216
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.901
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

217
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:06.890
<v Speaker 3>we drove all over Turkey,</v>

218
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of amazing stuff.</v>

219
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:12.971
<v Speaker 3>Came back to England briefly then went straight to Peru and Bolivia up in the,</v>

220
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 3>up in the high Andes reached a place in a hired car,</v>

221
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.750
<v Speaker 3>15,000 feet above sea level,</v>

222
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 3>just over 15,000 feet.</v>

223
00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 3>That seriously high,</v>

224
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.160
<v Speaker 3>shorter breath up there.</v>

225
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.971
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

226
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:26.091

00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:31.871
<v Speaker 3>that was on the way to a site called shoving one tar where they venerated</v>

230
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics in ancient times.</v>

231
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

232
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.910
<v Speaker 3>also visited te Minako in the Andes where in Bolivia,</v>

233
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 3>where I've been a number of times before.</v>

234

<v Speaker 3>Fantastic place.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

236
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.890
<v Speaker 3>came back from there,</v>

237
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.780

<v Speaker 3>do you follow a healthy diet?</v>

250
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:03.523
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

251
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 3>in a way I don't,</v>

252
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat meat.</v>

253
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat.</v>

254
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.130
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's not healthy.</v>

255
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:07.431
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

256
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:08.181
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat red meat.</v>

257
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:08.931
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat chicken.</v>

258
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 3>I eat,</v>

259
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 3>but I pick on shrimps and scallops and things like that.</v>

260
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise I'm a vegetarian.</v>

261
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 3>So fish and vegetables,</v>

262
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.643
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat fish.</v>

263
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.250
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

264
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.083
<v Speaker 3>it has a backbone.</v>

265
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat things which I don't eat things with backbones.</v>

266
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 3>Only the when,</v>

267
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:21.420
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

268
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.050
<v Speaker 3>what brought this about and I walk a trip.</v>

269
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.710
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

270
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:25.101
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

271
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:28.640
<v Speaker 3>I bought way back in 1986 when I was 36 years old,</v>

272
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.460
<v Speaker 3>I realized that I didn't enjoy meat very much.</v>

273
00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:32.061
<v Speaker 3>So I thought,</v>

274
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:33.470
<v Speaker 3>why did I become a vegetarian?</v>

275
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 3>I became a vegetarian when not for years and years and years.</v>

276
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:37.430
<v Speaker 3>Then I got bored.</v>

277
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I got seriously board with vegetarian diet and I'd always liked shrimps and</v>

278
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:43.790
<v Speaker 3>scallops and shell fish of all kinds,</v>

279
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:44.170
<v Speaker 3>lobster,</v>

280
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:44.960
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

281
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.460
<v Speaker 3>So I went back and started,</v>

282
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 3>I lapsed and I started eating shellfish and that's kind of where I drew the line</v>

283
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:51.740
<v Speaker 3>that I would,</v>

284
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.110
<v Speaker 3>I would eat as far away from myself as possible.</v>

285
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.870
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

286
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 3>but I would definitely have</v>

287
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 4>some flesh.</v>

288
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 4>And so I,</v>

289
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 4>I pick on these,</v>

290
00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Speaker 4>these creatures,</v>

291
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 4>there's not particular moral reason for it.</v>

292
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 4>It's just a,</v>

293
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 4>it's just what I like to do.</v>

294
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 4>It seems a bit more,</v>

295
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:07.770
<v Speaker 4>although if you're trying to eat things that are as far away from the post.</v>

296
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 4>So I suppose so,</v>

297
00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 4>but wouldn't it be ironic if,</v>

298
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 4>if I were to discover when I pass through the veil to the next world that the</v>

299
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:17.430
<v Speaker 4>one thing that you're not allowed to eat ever shrimps.</v>

300
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.613
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that.</v>

301
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 4>I highly doubt there's dietary requirements.</v>

302
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.220
<v Speaker 4>I highly doubt it too.</v>

303
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:23.880
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

304
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 4>everything is temporary.</v>

305
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:26.034
<v Speaker 4>I mean we don't,</v>

306
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:26.611
<v Speaker 4>part of,</v>

307
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 4>I think what's,</v>

308
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 4>what's great about being a vegetarian or being a Vegan is that you don't want to</v>

309
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:32.900
<v Speaker 4>take a life.</v>

310
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

311
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.110
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate that.</v>

312
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:35.700
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of what it comes down to for me.</v>

313
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.260
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate that very much.</v>

314
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.183
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

315
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 4>lives are taking the manner what all the time and you take life when you eat</v>

316
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:43.200
<v Speaker 4>vegetables,</v>

317
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.970
<v Speaker 4>you just take a different type type of life.</v>

318
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 4>Hey Life,</v>

319
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm wearing a leather belt right now.</v>

320
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm wearing leather shoes.</v>

321
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.400
<v Speaker 4>I took life to life,</v>

322
00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 4>eats life and it's not just animal life,</v>

323
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 4>but plant life and fungal life and all these,</v>

324
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean I see the point.</v>

325
00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:59.960
<v Speaker 4>I just think it's a little short sighted and utopian the view.</v>

326
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.640
<v Speaker 4>The view is just a little delusional.</v>

327
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.590
<v Speaker 4>But I appreciate the thought and the sentiment behind me.</v>

328
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.331
<v Speaker 4>If I,</v>

329
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:06.751
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>

330
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 4>if I really enjoyed meat,</v>

331
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.170
<v Speaker 4>even chicken or red meat,</v>

332
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 4>if I really enjoyed it,</v>

333
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:11.521
<v Speaker 4>I would eat it.</v>

334
00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:12.180
<v Speaker 4>But I don't,</v>

335
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 4>I never got,</v>

336
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.920
<v Speaker 4>I never got much out of it.</v>

337
00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:14.191
<v Speaker 4>I never,</v>

338
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 4>I was always a bit squeamish about the blood and I never,</v>

339
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.670
<v Speaker 4>I never really wanted to eat it.</v>

340
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.410
<v Speaker 4>So I kind of felt it's a waste.</v>

341
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:20.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

342
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 4>I get no pleasure from this stuff,</v>

343
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:22.381
<v Speaker 4>so why?</v>

344
00:10:22.381 --> 00:10:23.790
<v Speaker 4>So why should I eat it anyway?</v>

345
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.070
<v Speaker 4>That's why I say it's not entirely a moral thing.</v>

346
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.540
<v Speaker 4>It's partly just a matter of preference as well.</v>

347
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.381
<v Speaker 4>But I agree with you.</v>

348
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:34.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean everything in the web of life on this planet lives off,</v>

349
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 4>lives off everything else.</v>

350
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:36.510
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

351
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:36.960
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

352
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.750
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe in our society,</v>

353
00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 4>in western technological society,</v>

354
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

355
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:45.570
<v Speaker 4>we've got so divorced from the act of actually killing an animal that we forget</v>

356
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 4>what we're doing.</v>

357
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 4>We forget what's involved.</v>

358
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.150
<v Speaker 4>It's all very packaged and sanitized and it's easy.</v>

359
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:52.800
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to forget what's involved in it,</v>

360
00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:53.250
<v Speaker 4>that some,</v>

361
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.083
<v Speaker 4>some creature is,</v>

362
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.110
<v Speaker 4>is dying.</v>

363
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Speaker 4>And in our culture of pretty unpleasant,</v>

364
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:57.870
<v Speaker 4>miserable death.</v>

365
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:58.381
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

366
00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:01.050
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that separation is very immoral.</v>

367
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.080
<v Speaker 4>That separation between us and our food to try to reconcile that.</v>

368
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.650
<v Speaker 4>I've recently taken up hunting,</v>

369
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.190
<v Speaker 4>I went hunting last year for the first time and got a deer and killed it and</v>

370
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.500
<v Speaker 4>gutted it and quartered it and all that jazz and eating it was incredibly</v>

371
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:17.334
<v Speaker 4>satisfying.</v>

372
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 4>And also knowing that where I went,</v>

373
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.580
<v Speaker 4>these animals,</v>

374
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.510
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to make it,</v>

375
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.590
<v Speaker 4>no animal makes it,</v>

376
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.880
<v Speaker 4>but what the idea is,</v>

377
00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:26.100
<v Speaker 4>you just breed as quickly as you can.</v>

378
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.580
<v Speaker 4>Your children live for a couple of years and then they get taken out by mountain</v>

379
00:11:29.581 --> 00:11:31.080
<v Speaker 4>lions or coyotes or the winter,</v>

380
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.240
<v Speaker 4>either freeze to death or what have you.</v>

381
00:11:33.241 --> 00:11:34.920
<v Speaker 4>But it's a constant cycle.</v>

382
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.590
<v Speaker 4>And what I did is just dip into that cycle.</v>

383
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.540
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's,</v>

384
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.340
<v Speaker 4>I have no problem with that.</v>

385
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:41.530
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

386
00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:42.320
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

387
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:42.501
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

388
00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:45.110
<v Speaker 4>it's much better actually go hunt an animal rather than the,</v>

389
00:11:45.111 --> 00:11:49.380
<v Speaker 4>the horrible cold industrial slaughterhouses that we have that we have now.</v>

390
00:11:49.381 --> 00:11:52.200
<v Speaker 4>And the fear and humiliation the animals are put through in that,</v>

391
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.410
<v Speaker 4>in that context,</v>

392
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 4>at least,</v>

393
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.090
<v Speaker 1>at least in hunting,</v>

394
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:55.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

395
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

396
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.230
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of one to one and,</v>

397
00:11:57.231 --> 00:11:57.791
<v Speaker 1>and you are,</v>

398
00:11:57.791 --> 00:11:58.960
<v Speaker 1>you are out there,</v>

399
00:11:59.440 --> 00:11:59.720
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

400
00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 1>you're actually killing what you eat and the animal lives in entirely wild,</v>

401
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:06.610
<v Speaker 1>natural life until the moment you pull that trigger.</v>

402
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

403
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

404
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.320
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

405
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.470
<v Speaker 1>there's no artificial environment that it lives in.</v>

406
00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 1>There's no hormones and are introduced into its body,</v>

407
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 1>no antibiotics.</v>

408
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:17.170
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing unnatural about it at all.</v>

409
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Just the bullet hits it and that's gone and it's over and it's virtually</v>

410
00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:23.770
<v Speaker 1>painless because when a bullet hits an animal like that,</v>

411
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's so fast and so quick,</v>

412
00:12:26.261 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 1>they don't even know what happened.</v>

413
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:28.630
<v Speaker 1>They try to run and then they're done.</v>

414
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:29.111
<v Speaker 1>They're done.</v>

415
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:29.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

416
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.770
<v Speaker 1>and I think I would,</v>

417
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.170
<v Speaker 1>what I'm trying to do,</v>

418
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.520
<v Speaker 1>and I'm trying to do it this year,</v>

419
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:34.301
<v Speaker 1>by the end of this year,</v>

420
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I want to make my diet when I'm home,</v>

421
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:37.564
<v Speaker 1>when I can control it.</v>

422
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Completely wild game.</v>

423
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 1>That's my goal.</v>

424
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:41.111
<v Speaker 1>While game,</v>

425
00:12:41.111 --> 00:12:41.710
<v Speaker 1>which you will hook.</v>

426
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

427
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Which I will hunt and for me and for my whole family and I have this mapped out</v>

428
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.981
<v Speaker 1>this year,</v>

429
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I want to get deer,</v>

430
00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:50.590
<v Speaker 1>I want to get a bison,</v>

431
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I want to get an elk and I would get all these various animals and just do it</v>

432
00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:00.010
<v Speaker 1>entirely to procure meat and to bring it back home and deep freeze it and to</v>

433
00:13:00.011 --> 00:13:01.690
<v Speaker 1>make sure that I always have wild,</v>

434
00:13:01.691 --> 00:13:03.760
<v Speaker 1>natural meat available if I want to eat it.</v>

435
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.121
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

436
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:04.931
<v Speaker 1>Before I went hunting,</v>

437
00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:08.440
<v Speaker 1>I decided that I'm either going to be a vegetarian after this trip.</v>

438
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm neither going to decide that this is like really not me.</v>

439
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like it or I'm going to become a hunter,</v>

440
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.320
<v Speaker 1>so I became a hunter.</v>

441
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

442
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it.</v>

443
00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I've always liked meat,</v>

444
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:21.100
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's also because I participate so much in like really strenuous</v>

445
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:21.934
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>

446
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and martial arts and yeah,</v>

447
00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:25.060
<v Speaker 1>which requires,</v>

448
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.760
<v Speaker 1>requires you to have some protein in your body.</v>

449
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:27.410
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

450
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Makes me crave it.</v>

451
00:13:28.421 --> 00:13:29.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I need it.</v>

452
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I know there's many people that work out very hard that go on a completely plant</v>

453
00:13:33.971 --> 00:13:34.660
<v Speaker 1>based Diet.</v>

454
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.493
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>

455
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

456
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 1>whatever I think I need.</v>

457
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:38.320
<v Speaker 1>It varies from patient to patient.</v>

458
00:13:38.321 --> 00:13:40.690
<v Speaker 1>But the hunting that you do or that you,</v>

459
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.990
<v Speaker 1>that you did to get this animal do,</v>

460
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean are you out there in nature?</v>

461
00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

462
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:45.791
<v Speaker 1>what's the scene?</v>

463
00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:46.390
<v Speaker 1>How does it work?</v>

464
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I went to um,</v>

465
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.360
<v Speaker 1>well going next week actually,</v>

466
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.790
<v Speaker 1>but the first time I went I went to Montana,</v>

467
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.350
<v Speaker 1>the badlands and Montana,</v>

468
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Montana actually where Lewis and Clark went down the Missouri River.</v>

469
00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.340
<v Speaker 1>It was fascinating because it's incredibly wild.</v>

470
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:00.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

471
00:14:00.851 --> 00:14:02.930
<v Speaker 1>we saw we were there as a wild lab.</v>

472
00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:03.850
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of wildlife,</v>

473
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.690
<v Speaker 1>especially with Montana because you can't grow out there.</v>

474
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:12.930
<v Speaker 1>So homesteaders tried to make these homes out there and live and we took these</v>

475
00:14:13.031 --> 00:14:13.570
<v Speaker 1>photos of him.</v>

476
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 1>I should have brought some photos back,</v>

477
00:14:15.191 --> 00:14:20.191
<v Speaker 1>but we took photos of these old homesteads tights from the seven from the 18</v>

478
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:21.850
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and you know,</v>

479
00:14:21.851 --> 00:14:22.740
<v Speaker 1>they're just rotted out.</v>

480
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Nobody could grow anything out of there.</v>

481
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.510
<v Speaker 1>And then the Indians,</v>

482
00:14:25.511 --> 00:14:25.751
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

483
00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:27.460
<v Speaker 1>the natives wind up killing a lot of people.</v>

484
00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of like between the Nez Perce and all these people that lived</v>

485
00:14:30.401 --> 00:14:32.110
<v Speaker 1>there and um,</v>

486
00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:32.861
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

487
00:14:32.861 --> 00:14:33.910
<v Speaker 1>the time we were there,</v>

488
00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:38.620
<v Speaker 1>we were there for about five days and maybe we saw five or six other people the</v>

489
00:14:38.621 --> 00:14:41.980
<v Speaker 1>entire time and they were just people going down the river and canoes doing the</v>

490
00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:42.461
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>

491
00:14:42.461 --> 00:14:43.240
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>

492
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.830
<v Speaker 1>So you're having a wilderness experience,</v>

493
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.690
<v Speaker 1>there's a photo of it up there.</v>

494
00:14:46.691 --> 00:14:46.930
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

495
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:47.711
<v Speaker 1>that's what it looked like.</v>

496
00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:49.600
<v Speaker 1>It was completely wild.</v>

497
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.980
<v Speaker 1>No cell phone service,</v>

498
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.741
<v Speaker 1>no Internet,</v>

499
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:52.380
<v Speaker 1>no nothing.</v>

500
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Sleeping in a tent for five days.</v>

501
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

502
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.720
<v Speaker 1>very intense.</v>

503
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Very refreshing to like,</v>

504
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.640
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the things that I've found fascinating about him going to bed</v>

505
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:02.480
<v Speaker 1>when it got dark.</v>

506
00:15:02.481 --> 00:15:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Getting up in the morning when it got light.</v>

507
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.600
<v Speaker 1>No cell phone service,</v>

508
00:15:05.601 --> 00:15:06.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

509
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.011
<v Speaker 1>no internet,</v>

510
00:15:07.011 --> 00:15:07.311
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

511
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:07.551
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

512
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Dealing with social media,</v>

513
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.810
<v Speaker 1>none of that nonsense that we're constantly inundated with on a daily basis.</v>

514
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

515
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed it very much.</v>

516
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.163
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

517
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.660
<v Speaker 1>but you're not hunting an animal that can hunt you back.</v>

518
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:18.643
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

519
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.660
<v Speaker 1>But the animals that can hunt you back are not really,</v>

520
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:21.620
<v Speaker 1>they're not really edible.</v>

521
00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:26.530
<v Speaker 1>You can eat some of them I guess you can eat grizzly bear like some people in</v>

522
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Montana or in Alaska eat grizzly.</v>

523
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.411
<v Speaker 1>I think they,</v>

524
00:15:30.411 --> 00:15:30.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

525
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.960
<v Speaker 1>make grizzly jerky out of it and some parts you can eat and outline.</v>

526
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Speaker 1>You can eat the loin of a mountain lion,</v>

527
00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:39.290
<v Speaker 1>apparently not really delicious.</v>

528
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:40.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not the best game.</v>

529
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Animals are essentially animals that are all running from predators and you just</v>

530
00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:45.170
<v Speaker 1>take part in that.</v>

531
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.040
<v Speaker 1>You just get,</v>

532
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.510
<v Speaker 1>you just get into the scramble.</v>

533
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

534
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 1>in South Africa,</v>

535
00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:52.160
<v Speaker 1>in the Kalahari desert of Namibia,</v>

536
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.210
<v Speaker 1>the Bushman there,</v>

537
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.410
<v Speaker 1>they would run animal style persistence,</v>

538
00:15:55.411 --> 00:15:56.244
<v Speaker 1>hunting them down,</v>

539
00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.081
<v Speaker 1>run them down.</v>

540
00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 1>They will run for like 12 hours just running,</v>

541
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:00.261
<v Speaker 1>running,</v>

542
00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:02.000
<v Speaker 1>running until finally the animal just says,</v>

543
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

544
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

545
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.310
<v Speaker 1>I've watched that.</v>

546
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I've watched that and videos online.</v>

547
00:16:05.871 --> 00:16:06.561
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>

548
00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

549
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Native Americans used to do that as well.</v>

550
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are a rare animal and that we can't outrun animals.</v>

551
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.410
<v Speaker 1>We can't like out speed them.</v>

552
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:16.640
<v Speaker 1>But we can keep going.</v>

553
00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.400
<v Speaker 1>We can keep going for a long time.</v>

554
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.140
<v Speaker 1>And some animals just overheat.</v>

555
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.550
<v Speaker 1>They can't sweat,</v>

556
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:23.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

557
00:16:23.271 --> 00:16:23.811
<v Speaker 1>and so they're,</v>

558
00:16:23.811 --> 00:16:26.690
<v Speaker 1>they're designed for like these quick sprints to get away from trouble.</v>

559
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.450
<v Speaker 1>But if we're just persistent and we keep after them.</v>

560
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a podcast that I've been listening to those was,</v>

561
00:16:32.751 --> 00:16:36.140
<v Speaker 1>it was recommended by one of the nurses at the Regina King,</v>

562
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Regina King,</v>

563
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:38.570
<v Speaker 1>however you say it,</v>

564
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.350
<v Speaker 1>the laboratory when I'm going to get some blood work done called radio lab and</v>

565
00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:47.351
<v Speaker 1>it dealt with this one particular tribe in Kenya that has so many successful</v>

566
00:16:48.711 --> 00:16:52.580
<v Speaker 1>runners right from this one particular area and they were trying to figure out,</v>

567
00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:56.540
<v Speaker 1>they did all these studies to try to figure out what made them so successful and</v>

568
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:57.650
<v Speaker 1>there was several factors.</v>

569
00:16:57.651 --> 00:16:59.300
<v Speaker 1>One of them was their body shape.</v>

570
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.830
<v Speaker 1>One of them was the fact that they ran to and from school on a regular basis.</v>

571
00:17:03.831 --> 00:17:04.760
<v Speaker 1>They were constantly running.</v>

572
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.720
<v Speaker 1>But the other one was this unbelievably brutal tribal ritual,</v>

573
00:17:08.721 --> 00:17:12.830
<v Speaker 1>this coming of age ritual that the men and the women went through the involve</v>

574
00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:17.150
<v Speaker 1>genital mutilation with the men that and involve the circumcision with a c sharp</v>

575
00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:17.984
<v Speaker 1>stick.</v>

576
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.290
<v Speaker 1>And they would cover their face with mud while they did this.</v>

577
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:23.120
<v Speaker 1>And if they crack the mud,</v>

578
00:17:23.121 --> 00:17:26.300
<v Speaker 1>if they like squinted or Winston pain,</v>

579
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:31.010
<v Speaker 1>then they would be labeled a coward and they would not have access to women.</v>

580
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:31.590
<v Speaker 1>They would like,</v>

581
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.810
<v Speaker 1>they would be cut out of the economic situation in the tribe.</v>

582
00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.290
<v Speaker 1>It's the most recent radio lab folks.</v>

583
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.981
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

584
00:17:39.981 --> 00:17:40.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

585
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I was recommended to me this,</v>

586
00:17:42.051 --> 00:17:46.310
<v Speaker 1>this happens to these as a young man and just entering puberty or who was at 13,</v>

587
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.620
<v Speaker 1>13,</v>

588
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.560
<v Speaker 1>and I think 17.</v>

589
00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:49.380
<v Speaker 1>They said they,</v>

590
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:49.680
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

591
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

592
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.780
<v Speaker 1>they circumcised them with a stick.</v>

593
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:52.831
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

594
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:57.570
<v Speaker 1>they keep this for skin on and they tied in a bow and they push the head of the</v>

595
00:17:57.571 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 1>penis through this bow.</v>

596
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.050
<v Speaker 1>And this whole ritual takes several weeks in which time they're secluded.</v>

597
00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 1>And when they leave the hut,</v>

598
00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:06.570
<v Speaker 1>they're like secluded in this hut.</v>

599
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.100
<v Speaker 1>When they leave the hut to do anything,</v>

600
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.360
<v Speaker 1>they are not allowed to walk.</v>

601
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:11.220
<v Speaker 1>They must run at full pace.</v>

602
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.850
<v Speaker 1>It also involves crawling through stinging nettles naked.</v>

603
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.700
<v Speaker 1>They have to crawl through the stinging nettle bushes.</v>

604
00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:22.701
<v Speaker 1>The idea is just to completely control your ability to withstand pain.</v>

605
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:24.950
<v Speaker 1>I got to be tough bastard.</v>

606
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

607
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's fascinating.</v>

608
00:18:27.391 --> 00:18:29.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like this perfect storm of,</v>

609
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.950
<v Speaker 1>they have a,</v>

610
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:35.130
<v Speaker 1>an innate natural athletic ability based on their frame and then it's also the</v>

611
00:18:35.131 --> 00:18:39.240
<v Speaker 1>running on a regular basis and then also the intense ability to withstand pain.</v>

612
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely fascinating.</v>

613
00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Fast</v>

614
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:41.641
<v Speaker 3>thanks.</v>

615
00:18:41.641 --> 00:18:42.241
<v Speaker 3>Dot well again,</v>

616
00:18:42.241 --> 00:18:45.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is all stuff in a culture that we've kind of completely got away</v>

617
00:18:45.391 --> 00:18:46.620
<v Speaker 3>from set behind us.</v>

618
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:46.981
<v Speaker 3>We don't,</v>

619
00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:50.710
<v Speaker 3>we don't even interrelate with that at all anymore.</v>

620
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:51.100
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

621
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.260
<v Speaker 3>and it makes you wonder,</v>

622
00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:52.441
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

623
00:18:52.441 --> 00:18:54.780
<v Speaker 3>if the shit hits the fan and our culture goes down,</v>

624
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.101
<v Speaker 3>who can survive?</v>

625
00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:56.650
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

626
00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.130
<v Speaker 1>I think we're just going to go back to if the shit does hit the fan.</v>

627
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.590
<v Speaker 1>And I know that's a huge topic of your work.</v>

628
00:19:02.591 --> 00:19:03.041
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

629
00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:05.260
<v Speaker 1>what brought me to you in the first place was uh,</v>

630
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:05.800
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

631
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:10.660
<v Speaker 1>your work on the very clear evidence that at certain points in history this shit</v>

632
00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.630
<v Speaker 1>clearly did hit the fan and people did have to rebuild.</v>

633
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I watch a lot of shows on subsistence living in mostly in Alaska.</v>

634
00:19:19.511 --> 00:19:20.740
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of these shows.</v>

635
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

636
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.220
<v Speaker 1>life below zero is my new favorite one.</v>

637
00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's all based on these people living this.</v>

638
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:31.960
<v Speaker 1>One of them is this man who lives with this woman and they just fish and hunt</v>

639
00:19:31.961 --> 00:19:36.280
<v Speaker 1>and their family lives off of this and it's absolutely fascinating.</v>

640
00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:39.490
<v Speaker 1>The every day is spent acquiring food and they're not,</v>

641
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.240
<v Speaker 1>they're hardly growing anything because it's so cold,</v>

642
00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:42.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

643
00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.560
<v Speaker 1>So everything is just about catching fish,</v>

644
00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:45.730
<v Speaker 1>hunting animals,</v>

645
00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.330
<v Speaker 1>preserving these animals in whatever way would they're drying or you know,</v>

646
00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.493
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

647
00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.750
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazingly brutal life,</v>

648
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.170
<v Speaker 1>but they seem to be very happy.</v>

649
00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:01.200
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the really confusing aspects of this real traditional sort of</v>

650
00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:06.301
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] subsistence living that people seem to feel satisfied by it.</v>

651
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.110
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of something we were meant to do.</v>

652
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.040
<v Speaker 3>Maybe in a way,</v>

653
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:11.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's meant to,</v>

654
00:20:11.301 --> 00:20:13.430
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like we evolve to do it well.</v>

655
00:20:13.431 --> 00:20:14.870
<v Speaker 3>You have to consider that for,</v>

656
00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:15.471
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

657
00:20:15.471 --> 00:20:20.000
<v Speaker 3>anatomically modern humans stars we know have been around for slightly less than</v>

658
00:20:20.001 --> 00:20:23.390
<v Speaker 3>200,000 years and for almost all of that period,</v>

659
00:20:23.391 --> 00:20:24.290
<v Speaker 3>that's what we did.</v>

660
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.540
<v Speaker 3>That's what we did where we're just really,</v>

661
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.411
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

662
00:20:27.411 --> 00:20:30.560
<v Speaker 3>at least if we go with mainstream history and certainly it's true for the</v>

663
00:20:30.561 --> 00:20:31.580
<v Speaker 3>majority of the human race,</v>

664
00:20:31.581 --> 00:20:33.230
<v Speaker 3>whether we go with mainstream history or not,</v>

665
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.460
<v Speaker 3>it's really only in the last 10 12,000 years that we've been,</v>

666
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.610
<v Speaker 3>that we've been doing anything else apart from hunting and gathering.</v>

667
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

668
00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.253
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

669
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.270
<v Speaker 3>it's a long,</v>

670
00:20:43.271 --> 00:20:43.330
<v Speaker 3>long</v>

671
00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 1>time and we've tried to upset that over the last 200 with machines</v>

672
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.410
<v Speaker 4>and electricity and all these different things,</v>

673
00:20:50.411 --> 00:20:55.411
<v Speaker 4>but we long for that created a fundamentally a artificial artificial way of life</v>

674
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 4>and so quickly.</v>

675
00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:56.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

676
00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.680
<v Speaker 4>very rough.</v>

677
00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.630
<v Speaker 4>It seems like our genetics have not been able to catch up with the actual</v>

678
00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:02.464
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>

679
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:03.423
<v Speaker 4>but it was supported.</v>

680
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.780
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

681
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.170
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

682
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.370
<v Speaker 4>the irony of it is that this,</v>

683
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.000
<v Speaker 4>the oldest,</v>

684
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.801
<v Speaker 4>oldest development,</v>

685
00:21:07.801 --> 00:21:09.130
<v Speaker 4>all this amazing technology,</v>

686
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:10.000
<v Speaker 4>all these machines,</v>

687
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:10.691
<v Speaker 4>all this gear,</v>

688
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:11.524
<v Speaker 4>all this equipment,</v>

689
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.500
<v Speaker 4>but somehow the promise was it would,</v>

690
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.570
<v Speaker 4>would make us happier and it didn't,</v>

691
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.170
<v Speaker 4>it didn't make us happier.</v>

692
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:18.490
<v Speaker 4>It made us,</v>

693
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:19.930
<v Speaker 4>it made us much less happy.</v>

694
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.891
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

695
00:21:20.891 --> 00:21:23.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that ever was the promise.</v>

696
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:23.974
<v Speaker 4>What was the problem?</v>

697
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:24.491
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

698
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:24.671
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

699
00:21:24.671 --> 00:21:25.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

700
00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:25.540
<v Speaker 4>I remember,</v>

701
00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.060
<v Speaker 4>I remember with computers back in the back in the 80s before computers really</v>

702
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:32.380
<v Speaker 4>early eighties late seventies the idea was that,</v>

703
00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:33.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

704
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.490
<v Speaker 4>if the computer came in that we would just have all this endless Malaysia,</v>

705
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.550
<v Speaker 4>we would have a life of complete relaxation.</v>

706
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.630
<v Speaker 4>There would be,</v>

707
00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.030
<v Speaker 4>the problem would be actually filling our leisure,</v>

708
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:45.430
<v Speaker 4>but that has not turned out to be the case.</v>

709
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.550
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's lives are taken up with the computer,</v>

710
00:21:48.551 --> 00:21:49.090
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

711
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:49.781
<v Speaker 4>the iPhone,</v>

712
00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:50.290
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

713
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:50.801
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

714
00:21:50.801 --> 00:21:51.100
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

715
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.030
<v Speaker 4>the email,</v>

716
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:52.511
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

717
00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:53.380
<v Speaker 4>all that all the time.</v>

718
00:21:53.381 --> 00:21:54.460
<v Speaker 4>You could never get away from it.</v>

719
00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.650
<v Speaker 4>It's just constantly dividing your time.</v>

720
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.431
<v Speaker 4>Emails,</v>

721
00:21:57.431 --> 00:21:57.851
<v Speaker 4>hundreds,</v>

722
00:21:57.851 --> 00:21:58.181
<v Speaker 4>hundreds,</v>

723
00:21:58.181 --> 00:21:58.481
<v Speaker 4>hundreds,</v>

724
00:21:58.481 --> 00:21:59.410
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of emails a day.</v>

725
00:21:59.411 --> 00:22:00.041
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes.</v>

726
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:00.230
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

727
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.850
<v Speaker 4>I have this huge burden of guilt about emails that I don't answer,</v>

728
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.170
<v Speaker 4>which sit there in my,</v>

729
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:07.000
<v Speaker 4>in my email is I cannot answer them all.</v>

730
00:22:07.001 --> 00:22:07.870
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible.</v>

731
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.240
<v Speaker 4>I gave up a few years ago trying to answer them.</v>

732
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:13.300
<v Speaker 4>I try to respond to a few tweets a day if possible,</v>

733
00:22:13.301 --> 00:22:13.870
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

734
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:14.980
<v Speaker 4>while doing things,</v>

735
00:22:14.981 --> 00:22:19.030
<v Speaker 4>especially providing as much content as I do with podcasts and creating comedy,</v>

736
00:22:19.031 --> 00:22:19.510
<v Speaker 4>all that,</v>

737
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:20.500
<v Speaker 4>there's no time for that.</v>

738
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.150
<v Speaker 4>You can't become a fulltime letter right here.</v>

739
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:22.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

740
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:22.870
<v Speaker 4>it would.</v>

741
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.180
<v Speaker 4>That literally would be what you would do.</v>

742
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:25.980
<v Speaker 4>It would be any,</v>

743
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.320
<v Speaker 4>you would be dusk till dawn doing that and then sleeping.</v>

744
00:22:29.321 --> 00:22:31.390
<v Speaker 4>It's starting all over again and you still would never catch up.</v>

745
00:22:31.391 --> 00:22:31.931
<v Speaker 4>You'd never catch.</v>

746
00:22:31.931 --> 00:22:34.810
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you gave it a real honest reply,</v>

747
00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:37.750
<v Speaker 4>like it was a complex discussion that somebody one and a half with you,</v>

748
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.250
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to get there.</v>

749
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

750
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.770
<v Speaker 4>I faced the same problem probably in a smaller,</v>

751
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:42.820
<v Speaker 4>a smaller level than you,</v>

752
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:44.740
<v Speaker 4>but you know like Facebook and Twitter,</v>

753
00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:45.041
<v Speaker 4>Facebook,</v>

754
00:22:45.041 --> 00:22:46.240
<v Speaker 4>Facebook I find is very,</v>

755
00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:47.230
<v Speaker 4>it's a very useful thing.</v>

756
00:22:47.231 --> 00:22:47.680
<v Speaker 4>It's a very,</v>

757
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.491
<v Speaker 4>very positive thing.</v>

758
00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:50.740
<v Speaker 4>I do like interacting with my Facebook community,</v>

759
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.750
<v Speaker 4>but I can't interact.</v>

760
00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.010
<v Speaker 4>I can't interact that much.</v>

761
00:22:54.011 --> 00:22:54.521
<v Speaker 4>I tried to,</v>

762
00:22:54.521 --> 00:22:55.540
<v Speaker 4>I tried to put up posts,</v>

763
00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:56.860
<v Speaker 4>I tried to put up new material.</v>

764
00:22:56.861 --> 00:22:58.300
<v Speaker 4>People make interesting comments.</v>

765
00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:00.760
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes those comments are really valuable to me.</v>

766
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.220
<v Speaker 4>I get a link to something that I didn't know about and I go,</v>

767
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.113
<v Speaker 4>go look at that.</v>

768
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.820
<v Speaker 4>But to respond to every comment when you have,</v>

769
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:08.200
<v Speaker 4>when you have 300,</v>

770
00:23:08.201 --> 00:23:08.681
<v Speaker 4>500,</v>

771
00:23:08.681 --> 00:23:09.514
<v Speaker 4>a thousand,</v>

772
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.900
<v Speaker 4>1500 comments on a,</v>

773
00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:11.591
<v Speaker 4>on a post,</v>

774
00:23:11.591 --> 00:23:12.341
<v Speaker 4>it's impossible.</v>

775
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:12.701
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

776
00:23:12.701 --> 00:23:14.440
<v Speaker 4>it's just impossible to do that.</v>

777
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 4>That is a weird thing about our time.</v>

778
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.660
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a stage that we're going through.</v>

779
00:23:19.661 --> 00:23:20.494
<v Speaker 4>There'll be,</v>

780
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:25.710
<v Speaker 4>I think whatever comes next will probably be even crazier and even more</v>

781
00:23:25.721 --> 00:23:28.060
<v Speaker 4>impossible to deal with it halfway to telepathy.</v>

782
00:23:28.061 --> 00:23:28.281
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

783
00:23:28.281 --> 00:23:28.440
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

784
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.200
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

785
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.040
<v Speaker 4>that's what I think.</v>

786
00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.021
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

787
00:23:31.021 --> 00:23:31.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

788
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:36.390
<v Speaker 4>there'll be some sort of a technologically created symbiotic relationship that</v>

789
00:23:36.551 --> 00:23:40.530
<v Speaker 4>allows us to communicate some symbiotic thing where I'm thinking,</v>

790
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.020
<v Speaker 4>I think we're already kind of symbiotic with certain aspects of technology,</v>

791
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 4>glasses and even glasses</v>

792
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.150
<v Speaker 1>are essentially a technology that's a part of your life and wearing on your head</v>

793
00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:50.541
<v Speaker 1>all day,</v>

794
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:50.801
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

795
00:23:50.801 --> 00:23:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

796
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

797
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Cell phone might mean it might as well be attached to me because I'm scared.</v>

798
00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:56.420
<v Speaker 1>If I leave it anywhere.</v>

799
00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.040
<v Speaker 1>If I leave it in my car and I go to the mall,</v>

800
00:23:59.041 --> 00:23:59.271
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

801
00:23:59.271 --> 00:23:59.481
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

802
00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:00.380
<v Speaker 1>it's in the car.</v>

803
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.043
<v Speaker 1>I was alone.</v>

804
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

805
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:04.680
<v Speaker 1>We were.</v>

806
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.810
<v Speaker 1>These are weird times,</v>

807
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.870
<v Speaker 1>weird times when it comes to this stage that we're in.</v>

808
00:24:08.871 --> 00:24:13.130
<v Speaker 1>We're obviously progressing towards an even greater connectivity with our</v>

809
00:24:13.131 --> 00:24:13.851
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

810
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

811
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:14.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

812
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:14.721
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

813
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:16.670
<v Speaker 3>Which in some ways is a,</v>

814
00:24:16.671 --> 00:24:18.950
<v Speaker 3>in some ways it is a very good thing I have,</v>

815
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.930
<v Speaker 3>what I find again with,</v>

816
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.220
<v Speaker 3>with Facebook,</v>

817
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:22.641
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

818
00:24:22.641 --> 00:24:25.370
<v Speaker 3>with the Internet is a,</v>

819
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.860
<v Speaker 3>suddenly the whole world is talking.</v>

820
00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:31.280
<v Speaker 3>We're talking to each other and it doesn't actually matter what national</v>

821
00:24:31.281 --> 00:24:32.810
<v Speaker 3>boundaries you have or where you,</v>

822
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:33.850
<v Speaker 3>where you grew up,</v>

823
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.120
<v Speaker 3>what your religion is you're in,</v>

824
00:24:35.121 --> 00:24:37.030
<v Speaker 3>you're in communication with people from,</v>

825
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:41.480
<v Speaker 3>from all over the world and communities of ideas tend to kind of gravitate</v>

826
00:24:41.481 --> 00:24:42.770
<v Speaker 3>together and people share,</v>

827
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.790
<v Speaker 3>share thoughts and ideas.</v>

828
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:47.180
<v Speaker 3>This is far as we know is a new development for the human race to do this on a</v>

829
00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:49.850
<v Speaker 3>global scale and yeah,</v>

830
00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:50.900
<v Speaker 3>some shit comes out of it,</v>

831
00:24:50.901 --> 00:24:53.960
<v Speaker 3>but also also I think a lot of good stuff is coming out of it and it is</v>

832
00:24:53.961 --> 00:24:54.794
<v Speaker 3>challenging.</v>

833
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.170
<v Speaker 3>It is challenging the status quo in the world today.</v>

834
00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:57.980
<v Speaker 3>It is very,</v>

835
00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:01.730
<v Speaker 3>it's very threatening to the powers that be that people can communicate directly</v>

836
00:25:01.731 --> 00:25:02.564
<v Speaker 3>with one another.</v>

837
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:07.580
<v Speaker 3>I remember a time as an author when I depended heavily on the big media to to be</v>

838
00:25:07.581 --> 00:25:08.121
<v Speaker 3>heard about,</v>

839
00:25:08.121 --> 00:25:08.954
<v Speaker 3>to be known at all.</v>

840
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.130
<v Speaker 3>If I'd written a new book,</v>

841
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.280
<v Speaker 3>How could anybody know I'd written it unless one of the big newspapers are a big</v>

842
00:25:13.281 --> 00:25:15.050
<v Speaker 3>TV station or somebody covered it.</v>

843
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a shit about that now.</v>

844
00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:16.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

845
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't need those people anymore.</v>

846
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.831
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

847
00:25:18.831 --> 00:25:18.990
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

848
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:21.670
<v Speaker 3>I can communicate directly with people who are interested in my,</v>

849
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:26.870
<v Speaker 1>and the big media companies or whoever influenced them could remove a book towed</v>

850
00:25:27.591 --> 00:25:29.480
<v Speaker 1>from the market and then that,</v>

851
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.750
<v Speaker 1>that subject is gone.</v>

852
00:25:30.751 --> 00:25:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

853
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:32.670
<v Speaker 1>John Marco Legros book,</v>

854
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.940
<v Speaker 1>perfect examples of sacred mushroom and the cross.</v>

855
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic book.</v>

856
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:36.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

857
00:25:36.931 --> 00:25:38.400
<v Speaker 1>And if you've never read it,</v>

858
00:25:38.401 --> 00:25:43.401
<v Speaker 1>John Marco leg was a biblical scholar and a linguist to also happen to be an</v>

859
00:25:43.621 --> 00:25:44.550
<v Speaker 1>ordained minister.</v>

860
00:25:44.551 --> 00:25:46.080
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the guys who was,</v>

861
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.101
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

862
00:25:47.101 --> 00:25:47.251
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

863
00:25:47.251 --> 00:25:50.400
<v Speaker 1>assigned to decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls,</v>

864
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:53.820
<v Speaker 1>did it for 14 years and wrote this amazing book,</v>

865
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:58.850
<v Speaker 1>which basically said that the entire religion of Christianity originally was</v>

866
00:25:59.881 --> 00:26:03.480
<v Speaker 1>about consuming psychedelic mushrooms and fertility rituals.</v>

867
00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

868
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating stuff.</v>

869
00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

870
00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.470
<v Speaker 1>They removed it.</v>

871
00:26:07.471 --> 00:26:07.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

872
00:26:07.711 --> 00:26:08.640
<v Speaker 1>that book was gone.</v>

873
00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.050
<v Speaker 1>They didn't like the message at all.</v>

874
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

875
00:26:10.321 --> 00:26:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Young urban has,</v>

876
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.840
<v Speaker 1>has worked to republish it and it's,</v>

877
00:26:13.841 --> 00:26:15.540
<v Speaker 1>it's available again now.</v>

878
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.270
<v Speaker 1>But for the longest time that book was gone.</v>

879
00:26:18.271 --> 00:26:18.991
<v Speaker 1>You had to find,</v>

880
00:26:18.991 --> 00:26:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I own two copies of it that I bought used and they were very expensive.</v>

881
00:26:23.911 --> 00:26:25.140
<v Speaker 1>You had to buy them from,</v>

882
00:26:25.141 --> 00:26:25.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

883
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.710
<v Speaker 1>some strange book company that found them.</v>

884
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.000
<v Speaker 1>So this is something in the big,</v>

885
00:26:30.001 --> 00:26:30.511
<v Speaker 1>big media,</v>

886
00:26:30.511 --> 00:26:31.150
<v Speaker 1>can't do anything.</v>

887
00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:31.490
<v Speaker 1>We'll do it.</v>

888
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.730
<v Speaker 1>And the interest they serve,</v>

889
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:33.870
<v Speaker 1>they cannot do it anymore.</v>

890
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.470
<v Speaker 1>You could find something tweeted,</v>

891
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.900
<v Speaker 1>so take a picture of it.</v>

892
00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Say if you were in Turkey and you found something unique,</v>

893
00:26:39.361 --> 00:26:40.560
<v Speaker 1>you can take a picture of that,</v>

894
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.710
<v Speaker 1>tweet it and,</v>

895
00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:41.991
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

896
00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:42.261
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

897
00:26:42.261 --> 00:26:42.531
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

898
00:26:42.531 --> 00:26:44.430
<v Speaker 1>and Lincoln article to your website.</v>

899
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:45.240
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

900
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.220
<v Speaker 4>Put whatever you found on your website.</v>

901
00:26:47.221 --> 00:26:49.110
<v Speaker 4>And then within moments,</v>

902
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:49.320
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

903
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.160
<v Speaker 4>thousands of people would be downloading it and trading it and it would just</v>

904
00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.290
<v Speaker 4>frenzy spread across the world.</v>

905
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:55.891
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing that.</v>

906
00:26:55.891 --> 00:26:57.840
<v Speaker 4>I'd be making a point on my travels of,</v>

907
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:02.580
<v Speaker 4>of putting up a picture and I'm putting up my immediate reaction to something</v>

908
00:27:02.581 --> 00:27:03.031
<v Speaker 4>that I've,</v>

909
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:04.110
<v Speaker 4>something that I've seen.</v>

910
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.960
<v Speaker 4>And it produces a lot of,</v>

911
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:07.920
<v Speaker 4>a lot of reaction.</v>

912
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:08.191
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

913
00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:08.851
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

914
00:27:08.851 --> 00:27:09.684
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

915
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:10.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

916
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:10.471
<v Speaker 4>it goes,</v>

917
00:27:10.471 --> 00:27:12.690
<v Speaker 4>it goes two ways because when people communicate with me,</v>

918
00:27:12.691 --> 00:27:13.530
<v Speaker 4>I learned from them.</v>

919
00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:14.610
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that I'm giving,</v>

920
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:15.481
<v Speaker 4>I'm giving people,</v>

921
00:27:15.481 --> 00:27:18.390
<v Speaker 4>so I'm getting stuff back all the time and I appreciate that my,</v>

922
00:27:18.391 --> 00:27:19.224
<v Speaker 4>I think my,</v>

923
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:22.110
<v Speaker 4>I have these conversations with people that I meet at shows all the time,</v>

924
00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:22.650
<v Speaker 4>will they'll say,</v>

925
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:22.831
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

926

928
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:30.180
<v Speaker 4>It changed my life too and my interaction with these people as changed my life</v>

929
00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:31.710
<v Speaker 4>as much as it's changed their life.</v>

930
00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:32.381
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

931
00:27:32.381 --> 00:27:32.611
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

932
00:27:32.611 --> 00:27:32.821
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

933
00:27:32.821 --> 00:27:37.350
<v Speaker 4>the information that I get on a daily basis from people on Twitter in informs me</v>

934
00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:39.540
<v Speaker 4>in a way that I've never been informed before.</v>

935
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.490
<v Speaker 4>Constant all day long.</v>

936
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean every day I'm getting all these new stories that are tweeted to me and I</v>

937
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.540
<v Speaker 4>retweet the fascinating ones as much as I can,</v>

938
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.280
<v Speaker 4>but it's a never ending stream.</v>

939
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.511
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

940
00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:52.021
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

941
00:27:52.021 --> 00:27:52.854
<v Speaker 4>I'm so,</v>

942
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm so indebted.</v>

943
00:27:54.061 --> 00:27:55.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm so happy.</v>

944
00:27:55.021 --> 00:27:56.220
<v Speaker 4>I feel so obligated.</v>

945
00:27:56.221 --> 00:27:56.581
<v Speaker 4>The whole,</v>

946
00:27:56.581 --> 00:28:00.270
<v Speaker 4>the whole connection is a very rewarding connection for me as well.</v>

947
00:28:00.271 --> 00:28:00.991
<v Speaker 4>As a matter of fact,</v>

948
00:28:00.991 --> 00:28:02.490
<v Speaker 4>you are doing something quite special.</v>

949
00:28:02.491 --> 00:28:02.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

950
00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.070
<v Speaker 4>I've been on the road and,</v>

951
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 4>and it's amazing the people that I meet,</v>

952
00:28:06.241 --> 00:28:07.290
<v Speaker 4>whether it's in South Africa,</v>

953
00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:09.690
<v Speaker 4>whether it's in some Midland city in Britain,</v>

954
00:28:09.691 --> 00:28:11.130
<v Speaker 4>whether it's in upstate New York,</v>

955
00:28:11.131 --> 00:28:11.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

956
00:28:11.401 --> 00:28:12.570
<v Speaker 4>who'd listen to Joe Rogan.</v>

957
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:13.410
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

958
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:14.460
<v Speaker 4>you're reaching a lot of,</v>

959
00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:15.600
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people that way.</v>

960
00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:16.590
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

961
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.930
<v Speaker 4>this is special and it's eyeopening.</v>

962
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:19.681
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

963
00:28:19.681 --> 00:28:21.510
<v Speaker 4>it's an amazing connection that we have.</v>

964
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:21.910
<v Speaker 4>It's in a,</v>

965
00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:25.230
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing to be able to do what we're doing and it's a new thing.</v>

966
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:25.501
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

967
00:28:25.501 --> 00:28:25.671
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

968
00:28:25.671 --> 00:28:26.040
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

969
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.270
<v Speaker 4>it never happened before.</v>

970
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:29.100
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't around this way.</v>

971
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.770
<v Speaker 4>It's possible to change the world.</v>

972
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.970
<v Speaker 4>Everybody says no,</v>

973
00:28:32.971 --> 00:28:34.020
<v Speaker 4>the world is too big.</v>

974
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.000
<v Speaker 4>The power structures to great,</v>

975
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:36.751
<v Speaker 4>nothing can be,</v>

976
00:28:36.751 --> 00:28:37.531
<v Speaker 4>nothing can be changed.</v>

977
00:28:37.531 --> 00:28:37.771
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

978
00:28:37.771 --> 00:28:38.401
<v Speaker 4>But it can be able to,</v>

979
00:28:38.401 --> 00:28:39.121
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think so.</v>

980
00:28:39.121 --> 00:28:40.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm really optimistic,</v>

981
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:40.560
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

982
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.090
<v Speaker 4>I think good things are good.</v>

983
00:28:42.091 --> 00:28:42.781
<v Speaker 4>Things are coming.</v>

984
00:28:42.781 --> 00:28:43.890
<v Speaker 4>There's an awakening going on.</v>

985
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:44.760
<v Speaker 4>I am as well.</v>

986
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm very optimistic just based on the people that I've met that have told me</v>

987
00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:48.360
<v Speaker 4>they've changed their life.</v>

988
00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.193
<v Speaker 4>I have met no,</v>

989
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:50.041
<v Speaker 4>no bullshit.</v>

990
00:28:50.041 --> 00:28:54.180
<v Speaker 4>At least 30 or 40 people that told me they lost a hundred pounds if they</v>

991
00:28:54.181 --> 00:28:55.230
<v Speaker 4>listened to this podcast.</v>

992
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:56.310
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

993
00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.100
<v Speaker 4>Just people that just change their diet,</v>

994
00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.290
<v Speaker 4>started to exercising and started getting their blood pumping and feeling</v>

995
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:01.651
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

996
00:29:01.651 --> 00:29:06.510
<v Speaker 4>It started thinking positively cause surrounding themselves with positive people</v>

997
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:09.810
<v Speaker 4>and that if that could be done on that scale,</v>

998
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:11.580
<v Speaker 4>that can spread virally.</v>

999
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.660
<v Speaker 4>That's totally can.</v>

1000
00:29:12.661 --> 00:29:14.880
<v Speaker 4>And that's a real measurable change in somebody's life.</v>

1001
00:29:14.881 --> 00:29:15.180
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1002
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:19.380
<v Speaker 4>that's setting aside ill health and discomfort and moving onto something better</v>

1003
00:29:19.381 --> 00:29:20.040
<v Speaker 4>and more positive.</v>

1004
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.870
<v Speaker 4>And I've talked to maybe 50 or so people that have started their own podcast</v>

1005
00:29:24.871 --> 00:29:27.120
<v Speaker 4>because of this podcast and I,</v>

1006
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm hugely encouraging of that because I think there's no difference.</v>

1007
00:29:30.781 --> 00:29:31.021
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1008
00:29:31.021 --> 00:29:32.280
<v Speaker 4>if you're a curious person,</v>

1009
00:29:32.281 --> 00:29:35.430
<v Speaker 4>you speak a language that other people understand and you find information</v>

1010
00:29:35.431 --> 00:29:35.730
<v Speaker 4>online,</v>

1011
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:36.563
<v Speaker 4>you want to discuss it,</v>

1012
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.830
<v Speaker 4>start a fucking podcast.</v>

1013
00:29:37.831 --> 00:29:38.664
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>

1014
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:38.881
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1015
00:29:38.881 --> 00:29:38.941
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1016
00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:39.920
<v Speaker 4>if it catches on,</v>

1017
00:29:39.921 --> 00:29:41.560
<v Speaker 4>it catches on and if it doesn't catch on,</v>

1018
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 4>keep</v>

1019
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.420
<v Speaker 3>going until it does catch on.</v>

1020
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:44.290
<v Speaker 3>The way I see it though,</v>

1021
00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:44.711
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

1022
00:29:44.711 --> 00:29:46.060
<v Speaker 3>it's really interesting looking at,</v>

1023
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:47.200
<v Speaker 3>at your story.</v>

1024
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.651
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1025
00:29:47.651 --> 00:29:48.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1026
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.750
<v Speaker 3>so you've got this fight,</v>

1027
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:50.181
<v Speaker 3>this fight,</v>

1028
00:29:50.181 --> 00:29:51.130
<v Speaker 3>her background,</v>

1029
00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.150
<v Speaker 3>MMA,</v>

1030
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know a lot about if it stands for mixed martial arts,</v>

1031
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:58.630
<v Speaker 3>UFC ultimate fighting championship to bit fighting championship.</v>

1032
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:01.840
<v Speaker 3>And that goes back into your youth a long way.</v>

1033
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:02.230
<v Speaker 3>I saw it,</v>

1034
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:05.260
<v Speaker 3>I saw a little clip of you just kicking somebody.</v>

1035
00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 3>I dunno so fast.</v>

1036
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:07.271
<v Speaker 3>You didn't,</v>

1037
00:30:07.271 --> 00:30:07.780
<v Speaker 3>you looked,</v>

1038
00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:08.301
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>

1039
00:30:08.301 --> 00:30:09.670
<v Speaker 3>it was incredible to see that.</v>

1040
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.110
<v Speaker 3>So you've got all of that and,</v>

1041
00:30:11.111 --> 00:30:12.700
<v Speaker 3>and I meet a lot of people who are,</v>

1042
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.870
<v Speaker 3>who are interested in that.</v>

1043
00:30:13.871 --> 00:30:14.471
<v Speaker 3>My son in law,</v>

1044
00:30:14.471 --> 00:30:14.981
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1045
00:30:14.981 --> 00:30:15.191
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>

1046
00:30:15.191 --> 00:30:16.900
<v Speaker 3>is a mixed martial arts fighter and they really,</v>

1047
00:30:16.901 --> 00:30:18.190
<v Speaker 3>hugely important part of his life.</v>

1048
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.280
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time you're combining it with this extraordinary interest in</v>

1049
00:30:21.281 --> 00:30:23.640
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics and social change and,</v>

1050
00:30:23.641 --> 00:30:25.450
<v Speaker 3>and all of these radical ideas.</v>

1051
00:30:25.451 --> 00:30:29.320
<v Speaker 3>And intuitively one would not immediately think that somebody who's into mixed,</v>

1052
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:33.460
<v Speaker 3>mixed martial arts fighting would be also into radical philosophical ideas.</v>

1053
00:30:33.461 --> 00:30:37.220
<v Speaker 3>But it's the precisely the combination of those two things that is a,</v>

1054
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.530
<v Speaker 3>that is really attractive I think.</v>

1055
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:38.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1056
00:30:38.771 --> 00:30:43.660
<v Speaker 1>I think that the intuition or intuitively that it wouldn't be is just because</v>

1057
00:30:43.661 --> 00:30:45.550
<v Speaker 1>people don't understand what martial arts really are.</v>

1058
00:30:45.551 --> 00:30:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1059
00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.950
<v Speaker 1>In martial art with a martial art really is,</v>

1060
00:30:47.951 --> 00:30:49.110
<v Speaker 1>is the,</v>

1061
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:54.140
<v Speaker 1>the the path that you go through in becoming excellent in a martial art,</v>

1062
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:56.290
<v Speaker 1>it's just developing your human potential.</v>

1063
00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.980
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is and and seeking the truth about yourself and your own</v>

1064
00:30:59.981 --> 00:31:00.700
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

1065
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Like as we were talking about those Kenyan men who endure extreme pain and they</v>

1066
00:31:05.021 --> 00:31:07.300
<v Speaker 1>become stronger because of that,</v>

1067
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:09.190
<v Speaker 1>they become something special because of that,</v>

1068
00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:12.600
<v Speaker 1>that seeking truth through martial arts is,</v>

1069
00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.740
<v Speaker 1>it's along the same lines.</v>

1070
00:31:14.741 --> 00:31:19.741
<v Speaker 1>It's doing something incredibly difficult and in doing that you grow as a person</v>

1071
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.200
<v Speaker 1>and then in seeking that truth about your character,</v>

1072
00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:25.180
<v Speaker 1>seeking the truth about your determination,</v>

1073
00:31:25.181 --> 00:31:26.080
<v Speaker 1>your willpower,</v>

1074
00:31:26.081 --> 00:31:26.801
<v Speaker 1>your focus,</v>

1075
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:27.634
<v Speaker 1>your discipline,</v>

1076
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 1>you also start to seek truth in everything else around you and your government</v>

1077
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.470
<v Speaker 1>and your relationships and your all,</v>

1078
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.190
<v Speaker 1>all various aspects of your life,</v>

1079
00:31:36.191 --> 00:31:36.881
<v Speaker 1>your diet.</v>

1080
00:31:36.881 --> 00:31:39.760
<v Speaker 1>You see the relationship between your diet and your health and all these</v>

1081
00:31:39.761 --> 00:31:42.140
<v Speaker 1>different things they do fall into.</v>

1082
00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.800
<v Speaker 3>They do psychedelics,</v>

1083
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:44.351
<v Speaker 3>all of them.</v>

1084
00:31:44.351 --> 00:31:44.881
<v Speaker 3>Psychedelics.</v>

1085
00:31:44.881 --> 00:31:49.050
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely because it because in in many ways there is no more challenging</v>

1086
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.060
<v Speaker 3>adventure or experience that one can have.</v>

1087
00:31:51.061 --> 00:31:51.271
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1088
00:31:51.271 --> 00:31:51.451
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1089
00:31:51.451 --> 00:31:53.310
<v Speaker 3>there's all kinds of wilderness experiences weren't going to have,</v>

1090
00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:57.180
<v Speaker 3>but a deep journey with a powerful psychedelic is going to challenge you in</v>

1091
00:31:57.181 --> 00:32:01.260
<v Speaker 3>every possible level as a human being and it requires incredible will and</v>

1092
00:32:01.261 --> 00:32:02.100
<v Speaker 3>strength to,</v>

1093
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:02.671
<v Speaker 3>to deal with it.</v>

1094
00:32:02.671 --> 00:32:05.610
<v Speaker 3>This is what a lot of people who don't work with psychedelics who had just</v>

1095
00:32:05.611 --> 00:32:08.550
<v Speaker 3>washed brainwashed by the whole war on drugs thing don't understand.</v>

1096
00:32:08.551 --> 00:32:08.971
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

1097
00:32:08.971 --> 00:32:13.440
<v Speaker 3>this is a deep personal journey which requires strength of character to fulfill.</v>

1098
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:14.460
<v Speaker 3>Without a doubt.</v>

1099
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:16.840
<v Speaker 1>I've done some terrifying things in my life,</v>

1100
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.730
<v Speaker 1>but the moment before you,</v>

1101
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:23.740
<v Speaker 1>you light the lighter that fires up the DMT is one of the most terrifying</v>

1102
00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:24.670
<v Speaker 1>moments of all time.</v>

1103
00:32:24.671 --> 00:32:25.510
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree.</v>

1104
00:32:25.511 --> 00:32:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you've been there and you know what's coming and you're like,</v>

1105
00:32:28.091 --> 00:32:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1106
00:32:29.051 --> 00:32:29.980
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

1107
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:34.330
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes in a rocket to the center of the universe,</v>

1108
00:32:34.331 --> 00:32:39.331
<v Speaker 1>exact swarming with colors and geometric patterns and truth and fear</v>

1109
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:40.913
<v Speaker 4>and entities.</v>

1110
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:42.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1111
00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:42.771
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1112
00:32:42.771 --> 00:32:43.210
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1113
00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:44.240
<v Speaker 4>I share that.</v>

1114
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:44.421
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1115
00:32:44.421 --> 00:32:45.141
<v Speaker 4>the last time I,</v>

1116
00:32:45.141 --> 00:32:50.030
<v Speaker 4>the last time I smoked DMT was in up to the beginning of the end of September,</v>

1117
00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:51.500
<v Speaker 4>2011 I haven't smoked since because,</v>

1118
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:52.071
<v Speaker 4>and I will.</v>

1119
00:32:52.071 --> 00:32:52.760
<v Speaker 4>But I had,</v>

1120
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.870
<v Speaker 4>I had such a,</v>

1121
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:55.190
<v Speaker 4>such a,</v>

1122
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:57.020
<v Speaker 4>well at the word terrifying.</v>

1123
00:32:57.021 --> 00:32:58.970
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't do it justice to what happened to me.</v>

1124
00:32:58.971 --> 00:32:59.720
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1125
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.650
<v Speaker 4>it was just the,</v>

1126
00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:04.730
<v Speaker 4>the single hugest ordeal that I have ever confronted in my life.</v>

1127
00:33:04.731 --> 00:33:06.740
<v Speaker 4>And after you've been through an ordeal like that,</v>

1128
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:08.023
<v Speaker 4>you kind of,</v>

1129
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.580
<v Speaker 4>you kind of think twice about just leaping,</v>

1130
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.810
<v Speaker 4>leaping back into it again.</v>

1131
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:13.160
<v Speaker 4>But I learned a lot from it.</v>

1132
00:33:13.161 --> 00:33:13.521
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1133
00:33:13.521 --> 00:33:14.450
<v Speaker 4>it was a hugely,</v>

1134
00:33:14.451 --> 00:33:17.540
<v Speaker 4>hugely beneficial and to survive that and to come back from it,</v>

1135
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1136
00:33:18.351 --> 00:33:18.621
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1137
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:20.780
<v Speaker 4>you gather your strength from experiences like that.</v>

1138
00:33:20.781 --> 00:33:21.381
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I,</v>

1139
00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:26.381
<v Speaker 4>that's why I think our society is foolish to try to just sanitize everything and</v>

1140
00:33:26.661 --> 00:33:27.800
<v Speaker 4>not allow people to,</v>

1141
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:28.280
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1142
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.360
<v Speaker 4>to undergo these,</v>

1143
00:33:29.361 --> 00:33:31.550
<v Speaker 4>these profound and important experiences.</v>

1144
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.910
<v Speaker 4>We'd rather we should be creating structures where it is possible for people to</v>

1145
00:33:34.911 --> 00:33:38.870
<v Speaker 4>have those experiences and where they don't need to feel afraid of the law about</v>

1146
00:33:38.871 --> 00:33:39.704
<v Speaker 4>it and where they,</v>

1147
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:43.370
<v Speaker 4>where they can challenge themselves in that way with good advice and with and</v>

1148
00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:45.920
<v Speaker 4>with wise and loving care surrounding that situation.</v>

1149
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:46.701
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1150
00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:50.360
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's one of the things that's beautiful about today's internet and</v>

1151
00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:54.530
<v Speaker 4>these exchanges like we're having right now is it lets people know what these</v>

1152
00:33:54.531 --> 00:33:57.260
<v Speaker 4>experiences really are about and what,</v>

1153
00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:00.200
<v Speaker 4>what the potential these experiences actually do hold.</v>

1154
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:04.340
<v Speaker 4>Because we're the victim of massive propaganda that has been going on for</v>

1155
00:34:04.341 --> 00:34:07.610
<v Speaker 4>decades and decades and it's thousands of years.</v>

1156
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:08.331
<v Speaker 4>It's confused.</v>

1157
00:34:08.331 --> 00:34:10.010
<v Speaker 4>Some really intelligent people.</v>

1158
00:34:10.011 --> 00:34:13.880
<v Speaker 4>I've had some really disappointing conversations with guys like Michio Kaku,</v>

1159
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1160
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.500
<v Speaker 4>talking about mushrooms,</v>

1161
00:34:15.501 --> 00:34:16.610
<v Speaker 4>giving you brain damage,</v>

1162
00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.153
<v Speaker 4>such shit.</v>

1163
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.940
<v Speaker 4>It's just so silly complete.</v>

1164
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:21.140
<v Speaker 4>It's such a brilliant man.</v>

1165
00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:26.140
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise it's like the brainwashing goes very deep and it's as though it,</v>

1166
00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:31.670
<v Speaker 4>it presses a button in certain certain people that they actually just rational</v>

1167
00:34:31.671 --> 00:34:33.920
<v Speaker 4>faculties shutdown and they cannot,</v>

1168
00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:37.700
<v Speaker 4>they cannot react to the subject in an intelligent way anymore.</v>

1169
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:38.031
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

1170
00:34:38.031 --> 00:34:39.470
<v Speaker 4>I do find this again and again.</v>

1171
00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:40.521
<v Speaker 4>It is a,</v>

1172
00:34:40.521 --> 00:34:41.450
<v Speaker 4>it is a,</v>

1173
00:34:41.451 --> 00:34:42.500
<v Speaker 4>it is a huge problem.</v>

1174
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:46.010
<v Speaker 4>It's a self preservation issue as well for people that are professionals.</v>

1175
00:34:46.011 --> 00:34:48.000
<v Speaker 4>Because if you're a professional in any sort of,</v>

1176
00:34:48.001 --> 00:34:48.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1177
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:52.320
<v Speaker 4>anything where you're being judged or you're being looked at as you know,</v>

1178
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.120
<v Speaker 4>possibly,</v>

1179
00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:53.451
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1180
00:34:53.451 --> 00:34:53.661
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1181
00:34:53.661 --> 00:34:55.340
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at you for possible promotion,</v>

1182
00:34:55.341 --> 00:34:55.970
<v Speaker 4>but we heard your,</v>

1183
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:56.511
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>

1184
00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:57.860
<v Speaker 4>Mushrooms and the desert.</v>

1185
00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.270
<v Speaker 4>What the Fuck Bob,</v>

1186
00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:01.340
<v Speaker 4>you're ruining the whole career pal.</v>

1187
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.760
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1188
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.870
<v Speaker 4>you're on the fast track.</v>

1189
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1190
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:03.771
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1191
00:35:03.771 --> 00:35:04.071
<v Speaker 4>People,</v>

1192
00:35:04.071 --> 00:35:04.630
<v Speaker 4>people are,</v>

1193
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.810
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

1194
00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:07.010
<v Speaker 4>are in danger of destroying their careers if that,</v>

1195
00:35:07.011 --> 00:35:07.760
<v Speaker 4>if that comes out.</v>

1196
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's where I guess you and I have some,</v>

1197
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:11.830
<v Speaker 4>some advantage because we,</v>

1198
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.440
<v Speaker 4>we have careers that cannot get really in doing that can only help.</v>

1199
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:16.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1200
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.160
<v Speaker 4>If I get caught with a bag of mushrooms at the airport,</v>

1201
00:35:19.161 --> 00:35:19.994
<v Speaker 4>I got a bump.</v>

1202
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.040
<v Speaker 4>Everything is great.</v>

1203
00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:22.480
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1204
00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:22.700
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1205
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:23.533
<v Speaker 4>We get excited.</v>

1206
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:24.770
<v Speaker 4>My Twitter explodes.</v>

1207
00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:25.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1208
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1209
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.530
<v Speaker 4>obviously I'm not flying with mushrooms,</v>

1210
00:35:27.531 --> 00:35:28.760
<v Speaker 4>but my point being that,</v>

1211
00:35:28.761 --> 00:35:29.210
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1212
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:30.470
<v Speaker 4>and if you're honest about it,</v>

1213
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.370
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1214
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.550
<v Speaker 4>if you're doing something you shouldn't be doing because it's harming someone</v>

1215
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.560
<v Speaker 4>and people find out about it,</v>

1216
00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 4>the repercussions are real and they should be.</v>

1217
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1218
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:42.510
<v Speaker 4>but if you're doing something like psychedelics that harm no one and they're</v>

1219
00:35:42.511 --> 00:35:43.050
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

1220
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:47.040
<v Speaker 4>and then you can have a rational discussion about the benefits that you've had</v>

1221
00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:48.600
<v Speaker 4>from them that helps people.</v>

1222
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:49.463
<v Speaker 4>It really does.</v>

1223
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:50.390
<v Speaker 4>Totally helps people.</v>

1224
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:50.941
<v Speaker 4>I find this,</v>

1225
00:35:50.941 --> 00:35:53.970
<v Speaker 4>I find this again and again and that's the crucial distinction is,</v>

1226
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.620
<v Speaker 4>is are you doing something which is harmful to others,</v>

1227
00:35:58.621 --> 00:36:00.630
<v Speaker 4>which impinges upon the sovereignty of others,</v>

1228
00:36:00.631 --> 00:36:03.750
<v Speaker 4>which makes the life of another person less rather than more.</v>

1229
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:05.460
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is we'd taking psychedelics.</v>

1230
00:36:05.461 --> 00:36:05.790
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1231
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:06.623
<v Speaker 4>you're not right.</v>

1232
00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:07.261
<v Speaker 4>You're not doing that.</v>

1233
00:36:07.261 --> 00:36:09.240
<v Speaker 4>That's an inner experience that that's your,</v>

1234
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.260
<v Speaker 4>that's your own experience.</v>

1235
00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:11.430
<v Speaker 4>As I've said many times,</v>

1236
00:36:11.431 --> 00:36:11.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean we all,</v>

1237
00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:16.590
<v Speaker 4>we have plenty of laws that deal with doing negative stuff too to other people.</v>

1238
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:19.740
<v Speaker 4>We do not need laws that seek to govern,</v>

1239
00:36:19.741 --> 00:36:20.610
<v Speaker 4>control,</v>

1240
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:21.623
<v Speaker 4>manage,</v>

1241
00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.850
<v Speaker 4>limit our consciousness.</v>

1242
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:24.631
<v Speaker 4>This is the,</v>

1243
00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:28.710
<v Speaker 4>this is the heart of the matter we're starting to see in our lifetime these</v>

1244
00:36:28.711 --> 00:36:30.540
<v Speaker 4>centers in Mexico.</v>

1245
00:36:30.541 --> 00:36:35.100
<v Speaker 4>My friend Ed clay runs one in Mexico and I know there's some in Canada as well,</v>

1246
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:40.080
<v Speaker 4>where they have these Ibogaine centers where people are going and completely</v>

1247
00:36:40.081 --> 00:36:42.390
<v Speaker 4>curing themselves from opiates.</v>

1248
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:47.850
<v Speaker 4>Opiate addictions for folks who don't know are a huge problem in this country.</v>

1249
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.980
<v Speaker 4>I have lost a couple of friendships.</v>

1250
00:36:49.981 --> 00:36:50.431
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

1251
00:36:50.431 --> 00:36:54.810
<v Speaker 4>it went horribly wrong because I know the guy was on a bunch of different pills</v>

1252
00:36:54.811 --> 00:36:57.420
<v Speaker 4>from a bunch of different doctors and I just couldn't deal with them anymore.</v>

1253
00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.990
<v Speaker 4>I had to get up out of my life blaming other people for all of its failures</v>

1254
00:37:00.991 --> 00:37:01.501
<v Speaker 4>constantly.</v>

1255
00:37:01.501 --> 00:37:05.970
<v Speaker 4>Woe is me and just on pills all the time and things have prescribed pills.</v>

1256
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.740
<v Speaker 4>These are illegal pills.</v>

1257
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.640
<v Speaker 4>He had a back injury and he went to one doctor in one state and then moved to</v>

1258
00:37:11.641 --> 00:37:13.440
<v Speaker 4>California and started going to another doctor.</v>

1259
00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:17.430
<v Speaker 4>And then having both guys sending prescriptions and taking both two times the</v>

1260
00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:18.264
<v Speaker 4>amount of pills.</v>

1261
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.260
<v Speaker 4>And if you would take,</v>

1262
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.800
<v Speaker 4>you take a prescribed dose of opiate pills,</v>

1263
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:24.570
<v Speaker 4>you're very likely to get addictive.</v>

1264
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:25.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1265
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.310
<v Speaker 4>Even with the prescribed dosage,</v>

1266
00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.240
<v Speaker 4>she'll really difficult time to get off of them,</v>

1267
00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:30.750
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're facing some significant pain.</v>

1268
00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:31.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1269
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.790
<v Speaker 4>You just had a hip replacement.</v>

1270
00:37:32.791 --> 00:37:34.140
<v Speaker 4>Did they prescribe you any?</v>

1271
00:37:34.141 --> 00:37:34.291
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1272
00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:34.920
<v Speaker 4>they did.</v>

1273
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:35.460
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1274
00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.750
<v Speaker 4>I was given but nothing,</v>

1275
00:37:36.751 --> 00:37:36.991
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1276
00:37:36.991 --> 00:37:38.130
<v Speaker 4>nothing extremely strong,</v>

1277
00:37:38.131 --> 00:37:39.360
<v Speaker 4>but codene you know,</v>

1278
00:37:39.361 --> 00:37:39.691
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1279
00:37:39.691 --> 00:37:40.524
<v Speaker 4>which is an opiate,</v>

1280
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:41.350
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1281
00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.020
<v Speaker 4>well that's what Nyquil used to have it,</v>

1282
00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:43.350
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1283
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:43.651
<v Speaker 4>It does.</v>

1284
00:37:43.651 --> 00:37:43.921
<v Speaker 4>It does.</v>

1285
00:37:43.921 --> 00:37:44.731
<v Speaker 4>It I used to.</v>

1286
00:37:44.731 --> 00:37:45.481
<v Speaker 4>I believe so.</v>

1287
00:37:45.481 --> 00:37:46.770
<v Speaker 4>I believe Nyquil had coding.</v>

1288
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:47.041
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1289
00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:49.200
<v Speaker 4>coding is actually a highly addictive drug.</v>

1290
00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:49.560
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

1291
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.010
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>

1292
00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:51.030
<v Speaker 4>there's no doubt it is,</v>

1293
00:37:51.031 --> 00:37:51.960
<v Speaker 4>it is addictive.</v>

1294
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.531
<v Speaker 4>In Britain.</v>

1295
00:37:52.531 --> 00:37:54.660
<v Speaker 4>David often mix it with paracetamol,</v>

1296
00:37:54.661 --> 00:37:55.170
<v Speaker 4>which is a,</v>

1297
00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:57.120
<v Speaker 4>which is a less strong pain killer.</v>

1298
00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:57.781
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1299
00:37:57.781 --> 00:37:58.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1300
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.860
<v Speaker 4>if you take those,</v>

1301
00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.750
<v Speaker 4>those two pills in combination,</v>

1302
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.990
<v Speaker 4>you could get addicted to it within a week or 10 days.</v>

1303
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:04.620
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1304
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.510
<v Speaker 4>and it's the coding that you're getting addicted to,</v>

1305
00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:11.010
<v Speaker 4>but it's the paracetamol that's really good to totally screw up your liver,</v>

1306
00:38:11.011 --> 00:38:11.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1307
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:12.070
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1308
00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:12.431
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

1309
00:38:12.431 --> 00:38:12.931
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

1310
00:38:12.931 --> 00:38:13.710
<v Speaker 4>in the long run.</v>

1311
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.950
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1312
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:14.500
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

1313
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.010
<v Speaker 4>it's stunning actually that the,</v>

1314
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.020
<v Speaker 4>the big pharmaceutical companies are allowed to do this.</v>

1315
00:38:19.021 --> 00:38:23.880
<v Speaker 4>They're allowed to get to deliberately addict people to Hook people on very</v>

1316
00:38:23.881 --> 00:38:25.980
<v Speaker 4>powerful drugs that I really have very little,</v>

1317
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:27.450
<v Speaker 4>very little benefit.</v>

1318
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:28.201
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1319
00:38:28.201 --> 00:38:29.010
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>

1320
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:29.461
<v Speaker 4>to be honest,</v>

1321
00:38:29.461 --> 00:38:29.791
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>

1322
00:38:29.791 --> 00:38:30.624
<v Speaker 4>if I had some,</v>

1323
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:31.950
<v Speaker 4>some terrible cancer,</v>

1324
00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.000
<v Speaker 4>some terrible pain,</v>

1325
00:38:33.001 --> 00:38:34.530
<v Speaker 4>some terrible suffering,</v>

1326
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:37.720
<v Speaker 4>I would be very interested in exploring opium or,</v>

1327
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:38.860
<v Speaker 4>or even heroin.</v>

1328
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.671
<v Speaker 4>As a matter of fact,</v>

1329
00:38:39.671 --> 00:38:40.510
<v Speaker 4>I think that nature,</v>

1330
00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:42.070
<v Speaker 4>nature has been kind to us.</v>

1331
00:38:42.071 --> 00:38:45.820
<v Speaker 4>It's provided us with certain plants that can help us with pain and,</v>

1332
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.110
<v Speaker 4>and the reaches a stage,</v>

1333
00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:48.540
<v Speaker 4>it may reach a stage in life where,</v>

1334
00:38:48.541 --> 00:38:48.940
<v Speaker 4>where you're,</v>

1335
00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:49.390
<v Speaker 4>where your,</v>

1336
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:50.171
<v Speaker 4>where your terminal,</v>

1337
00:38:50.171 --> 00:38:50.420
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>

1338
00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.400
<v Speaker 4>why suffer that,</v>

1339
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.020
<v Speaker 4>why suffered that terrible agony.</v>

1340
00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:53.860
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1341
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:54.431
<v Speaker 4>it would be,</v>

1342
00:38:54.431 --> 00:38:56.010
<v Speaker 4>it would be interesting perhaps to,</v>

1343
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.610
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1344
00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:58.480
<v Speaker 4>to sort of bliss out a bit on that,</v>

1345
00:38:58.481 --> 00:38:59.740
<v Speaker 4>but to take it regularly,</v>

1346
00:38:59.741 --> 00:39:01.780
<v Speaker 4>daily for Small and minor pain,</v>

1347
00:39:01.781 --> 00:39:02.680
<v Speaker 4>this is a huge mistake.</v>

1348
00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:03.550
<v Speaker 4>It's not what it's for.</v>

1349
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:04.540
<v Speaker 4>There's a new,</v>

1350
00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:09.541
<v Speaker 4>a snail toxin that they've discovered that is a hundred times more effective</v>

1351
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.400
<v Speaker 4>than opiates and his non addictive.</v>

1352
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:13.990
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

1353
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:16.090
<v Speaker 4>And they're trying to figure out a way.</v>

1354
00:39:16.091 --> 00:39:16.924
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

1355
00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:21.980
<v Speaker 4>there's a new drug is from the cone snail venom and it's a hundred times more</v>

1356
00:39:23.351 --> 00:39:27.760
<v Speaker 4>potent than any existing pain medication and completely nonaddictive.</v>

1357
00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.170
<v Speaker 4>And they're,</v>

1358
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:33.580
<v Speaker 4>they're coming up with this nail venom in a pill form that would just completely</v>

1359
00:39:33.581 --> 00:39:34.510
<v Speaker 4>eliminate pain.</v>

1360
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.731
<v Speaker 4>I can see the,</v>

1361
00:39:36.731 --> 00:39:37.180
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1362
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.190
<v Speaker 4>the big drug companies not wanting to do that.</v>

1363
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:42.570
<v Speaker 4>They'll probably run out with a hammer and smash every snail that exists.</v>

1364
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.433
<v Speaker 4>Lash</v>

1365
00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.050
<v Speaker 4>get in cahoots with some,</v>

1366
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.610
<v Speaker 4>some company to spray some shit all over the areas where these nails live and</v>

1367
00:39:51.611 --> 00:39:52.421
<v Speaker 4>just whack them out.</v>

1368
00:39:52.421 --> 00:39:53.980
<v Speaker 4>All they wanted to keep us,</v>

1369
00:39:53.981 --> 00:39:55.180
<v Speaker 4>they want to keep us addicted.</v>

1370
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:55.331
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1371
00:39:55.331 --> 00:39:56.260
<v Speaker 4>the amount of money,</v>

1372
00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:56.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1373
00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:58.420
<v Speaker 4>people would say that that's a ridiculous thing.</v>

1374
00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:58.660
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1375
00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:59.890
<v Speaker 4>that's not what people do.</v>

1376
00:39:59.891 --> 00:40:03.930
<v Speaker 4>But the amount of money you're talking about is absolutely staggering.</v>

1377
00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:07.900
<v Speaker 4>Cost an enormous billions upon billions every month.</v>

1378
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1379
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:09.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1380
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.990
<v Speaker 4>And you were talking about about opiate addictions of which the vast majority</v>

1381
00:40:13.991 --> 00:40:17.000
<v Speaker 4>are addictions to prescribed pills and,</v>

1382
00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:17.690
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1383
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:18.790
<v Speaker 4>but then there's also,</v>

1384
00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:19.630
<v Speaker 4>there's also heroin,</v>

1385
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.650
<v Speaker 4>heroin addiction.</v>

1386
00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.311
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

1387
00:40:21.311 --> 00:40:22.120
<v Speaker 4>if again,</v>

1388
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:22.630
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1389
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:27.630
<v Speaker 4>and in fact Iowasca astonishingly successful in getting people off these off</v>

1390
00:40:28.241 --> 00:40:29.000
<v Speaker 4>these addictions,</v>

1391
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.380
<v Speaker 4>a very weird way,</v>

1392
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:31.150
<v Speaker 4>very weird way.</v>

1393
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:31.470
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1394
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:31.620
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1395
00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:31.931
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1396
00:40:31.931 --> 00:40:34.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure the exact mechanism Ibogaine,</v>

1397
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:34.911
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1398
00:40:34.911 --> 00:40:39.911
<v Speaker 4>the people that have taken it if told me that it's both physically removed,</v>

1399
00:40:41.591 --> 00:40:46.591
<v Speaker 4>the addiction and more importantly psychologically alerts you to all the factors</v>

1400
00:40:47.831 --> 00:40:51.490
<v Speaker 4>that have contributed to your shitty decision making in the first place.</v>

1401
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.000
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1402
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:52.331
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1403
00:40:52.331 --> 00:40:52.660
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1404
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.610
<v Speaker 4>All the Evers in your thinking,</v>

1405
00:40:54.611 --> 00:40:58.180
<v Speaker 4>all the errors in your personality that have led you to this path and you're</v>

1406
00:40:58.181 --> 00:41:01.270
<v Speaker 4>just trying to numb life with these pills.</v>

1407
00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.300
<v Speaker 4>It's like a,</v>

1408
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.010
<v Speaker 4>it's like a teaching that you get and that's the mystery of these plants</v>

1409
00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.110
<v Speaker 4>actually have th th the teacher plants,</v>

1410
00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:12.330
<v Speaker 4>particularly the two plants that go into the Iowasca brew and then they Boca,</v>

1411
00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:13.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1412
00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:16.240
<v Speaker 4>they're probably the most powerful in this,</v>

1413
00:41:16.241 --> 00:41:17.110
<v Speaker 4>in this respect,</v>

1414
00:41:17.111 --> 00:41:21.340
<v Speaker 4>is that there is that there's a sense of an encounter with an intelligence</v>

1415
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:22.240
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

1416
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.710
<v Speaker 4>which communicates with you at which gets right to the root of your personal</v>

1417
00:41:26.711 --> 00:41:27.544
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>

1418
00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.061
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1419
00:41:28.061 --> 00:41:28.351
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1420
00:41:28.351 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 4>and shows it to you and says,</v>

1421
00:41:29.951 --> 00:41:30.610
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1422
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:31.091
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1423
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:33.830
<v Speaker 4>I've had some experience with this myself and shows to you and says,</v>

1424
00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 4>this</v>

1425
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.240
<v Speaker 3>is actually how you are,</v>

1426
00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:35.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1427
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:36.763
<v Speaker 3>and you think,</v>

1428
00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:37.701
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

1429
00:41:37.701 --> 00:41:38.690
<v Speaker 3>I never realized that.</v>

1430
00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:38.991
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1431
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:39.380
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1432
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.690
<v Speaker 3>I hid that from myself for so long.</v>

1433
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.553
<v Speaker 3>The Ego,</v>

1434
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.960
<v Speaker 3>the ego and that revelation is extremely helpful in,</v>

1435
00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:50.970
<v Speaker 3>in handling an addiction and no ones protecting you by making Ibogaine,</v>

1436
00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:51.741
<v Speaker 3>illegal,</v>

1437
00:41:51.741 --> 00:41:55.850
<v Speaker 3>no ones protecting you from anything other than you getting cured from these</v>

1438
00:41:55.851 --> 00:41:56.870
<v Speaker 3>illnesses and,</v>

1439
00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:01.550
<v Speaker 3>and realizing the issues that you have in your life and in your personality.</v>

1440
00:42:01.551 --> 00:42:05.840
<v Speaker 3>And you can see yet another example of the fact that we live in a society that</v>

1441
00:42:05.841 --> 00:42:07.460
<v Speaker 3>is completely insane.</v>

1442
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:10.760
<v Speaker 3>Our society at is actually crazy.</v>

1443
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.841
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1444
00:42:11.841 --> 00:42:16.841
<v Speaker 3>It's run by crazy people in pursuit of crazy motives and it is designed to</v>

1445
00:42:18.291 --> 00:42:19.370
<v Speaker 3>diminish you and potential.</v>

1446
00:42:19.371 --> 00:42:19.881
<v Speaker 3>I can't help,</v>

1447
00:42:19.881 --> 00:42:20.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's accident.</v>

1448
00:42:20.721 --> 00:42:23.960
<v Speaker 3>I think it's actually deliberately designed to minimize you by who?</v>

1449
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:24.771
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1450
00:42:24.771 --> 00:42:27.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is where I have to get into something like Gnosticism,</v>

1451
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.760
<v Speaker 3>which has been a long term,</v>

1452
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:30.320
<v Speaker 3>a long term interest of mine.</v>

1453
00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.030
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that there is a,</v>

1454
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:36.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to use the word divine in terms of God cause I don't go with,</v>

1455
00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:37.040
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1456
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.560
<v Speaker 3>with God particularly I do go with mystery,</v>

1457
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.700
<v Speaker 3>but that there's a divine spark in,</v>

1458
00:42:41.701 --> 00:42:43.400
<v Speaker 3>in human beings and,</v>

1459
00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:48.350
<v Speaker 3>and that there has been a project for thousands of years to deny us the</v>

1460
00:42:48.351 --> 00:42:51.290
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to realize that part of ourselves,</v>

1461
00:42:51.291 --> 00:42:55.610
<v Speaker 3>the spiritual essence of ourselves and to keep us chained in matter and locked</v>

1462
00:42:55.611 --> 00:42:55.850
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1463
00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:57.290
<v Speaker 3>locked in the material realm.</v>

1464
00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:57.990
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1465
00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:02.000
<v Speaker 3>and what we see in modern society is two things going on side by side.</v>

1466
00:43:02.001 --> 00:43:04.700
<v Speaker 3>One is so called the materialist science,</v>

1467
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:09.350
<v Speaker 3>which tells us that there is nothing else to reality except the stuff that you</v>

1468
00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:14.060
<v Speaker 3>can weigh and measure and count and any thought that there might be spirit,</v>

1469
00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:14.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1470
00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.141
<v Speaker 3>that consciousness,</v>

1471
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:15.681
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1472
00:43:15.681 --> 00:43:18.050
<v Speaker 3>might not be a generated by the brain,</v>

1473
00:43:18.051 --> 00:43:19.280
<v Speaker 3>might not be local to the brain.</v>

1474
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.460
<v Speaker 3>Any such thought is supposed to be according to materialist science,</v>

1475
00:43:22.461 --> 00:43:23.240
<v Speaker 3>complete nonsense.</v>

1476
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.210
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the actual materialism which,</v>

1477
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:31.240
<v Speaker 3>which tries to persuade us through all manner of media and the way our society</v>

1478
00:43:31.401 --> 00:43:31.641
<v Speaker 3>is run,</v>

1479
00:43:31.641 --> 00:43:36.320
<v Speaker 3>that our sole purpose as creatures is to produce and consume and that we have no</v>

1480
00:43:36.321 --> 00:43:40.190
<v Speaker 3>other function here on this planet and that we are to define ourselves and</v>

1481
00:43:40.191 --> 00:43:44.030
<v Speaker 3>measure ourselves in terms of our production and consumption.</v>

1482
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:47.570
<v Speaker 3>Is that a really what we're being taught or is that just something that people</v>

1483
00:43:47.571 --> 00:43:48.770
<v Speaker 3>find easy,</v>

1484
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.760
<v Speaker 3>that that producing and consuming is just easy.</v>

1485
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:53.870
<v Speaker 3>It's exciting.</v>

1486
00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:54.771
<v Speaker 3>Get a new car.</v>

1487
00:43:54.771 --> 00:43:55.521
<v Speaker 3>It's exciting.</v>

1488
00:43:55.521 --> 00:43:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Get a new TV that's exciting work and you,</v>

1489
00:43:58.971 --> 00:43:59.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1490
00:43:59.301 --> 00:44:01.190
<v Speaker 3>you can wear clothes that this guy can't wear.</v>

1491
00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:01.431
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

1492
00:44:01.431 --> 00:44:02.264
<v Speaker 3>exciting.</v>

1493
00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:07.300
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something to that that is just a natural aspect of being a human</v>

1494
00:44:07.671 --> 00:44:12.671
<v Speaker 3>being and constantly having this desire for improvement and progress.</v>

1495
00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:16.730
<v Speaker 3>And we measure that improvement and progress erroneously with objects.</v>

1496
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:17.811
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1497
00:44:17.811 --> 00:44:18.291
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

1498
00:44:18.291 --> 00:44:19.480
<v Speaker 3>there was a culture of,</v>

1499
00:44:19.481 --> 00:44:19.651
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1500
00:44:19.651 --> 00:44:20.900
<v Speaker 3>of native American Indians,</v>

1501
00:44:20.901 --> 00:44:21.710
<v Speaker 3>I forget the,</v>

1502
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:25.640
<v Speaker 3>I forget the name of the tribe who had this ceremony called the potlatch where</v>

1503
00:44:25.641 --> 00:44:25.940
<v Speaker 3>the PR,</v>

1504
00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.200
<v Speaker 3>which happened like once a year and their project that what they had to do as</v>

1505
00:44:29.201 --> 00:44:29.400
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1506
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 3>the more things you could burn that</v>

1507
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.670
<v Speaker 1>showed,</v>

1508
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.740
<v Speaker 1>that showed that you were a really big guy.</v>

1509
00:44:34.741 --> 00:44:35.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1510
00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:35.760
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

1511
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.090
<v Speaker 1>just complete the ultimate conspicuous consumption as you take all these</v>

1512
00:44:39.091 --> 00:44:40.530
<v Speaker 1>possessions and burn them.</v>

1513
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Not because you're despising them,</v>

1514
00:44:42.151 --> 00:44:44.310
<v Speaker 1>but because you're rich enough to just barely,</v>

1515
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:45.031
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1516
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:45.841
<v Speaker 1>that's so stupid.</v>

1517
00:44:45.841 --> 00:44:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was to free yourself from this.</v>

1518
00:44:47.701 --> 00:44:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Now unfortunately not,</v>

1519
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:50.430
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately not.</v>

1520
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:51.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1521
00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:51.840
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1522
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.940
<v Speaker 1>the consciousness not being,</v>

1523
00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.793
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1524
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:59.520
<v Speaker 1>projected from the human mind is a very confusing one to me because I see their</v>

1525
00:44:59.521 --> 00:45:01.050
<v Speaker 1>point and I see your point.</v>

1526
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:01.861
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>

1527
00:45:01.861 --> 00:45:02.694
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1528
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:07.740
<v Speaker 1>What I see is I don't think that we know enough about consciousness.</v>

1529
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:11.070
<v Speaker 1>It's excel itself to define what's going on.</v>

1530
00:45:11.071 --> 00:45:11.904
<v Speaker 1>We can't be sure.</v>

1531
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it is possible that the mind could be some form of antenna.</v>

1532
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that,</v>

1533
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:22.170
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty clear that if you injure certain parts of the mind,</v>

1534
00:45:22.171 --> 00:45:25.170
<v Speaker 1>it affects certain aspects of cognitive function.</v>

1535
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I think that's pretty clear.</v>

1536
00:45:26.251 --> 00:45:26.940
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty clear.</v>

1537
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:27.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1538
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:28.411
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

1539
00:45:28.411 --> 00:45:30.480
<v Speaker 1>And an antenna to the damage,</v>

1540
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:31.710
<v Speaker 1>if you damage an antenna,</v>

1541
00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:33.600
<v Speaker 1>the picture on the TV screen is affected.</v>

1542
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1543
00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Fuck up a radio,</v>

1544
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.630
<v Speaker 1>the insides of a radio.</v>

1545
00:45:36.631 --> 00:45:37.321
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that the,</v>

1546
00:45:37.321 --> 00:45:38.850
<v Speaker 1>the signal's not still out there.</v>

1547
00:45:38.851 --> 00:45:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1548
00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just not getting in.</v>

1549
00:45:40.171 --> 00:45:40.441
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1550
00:45:40.441 --> 00:45:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1551
00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1552
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:41.933
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>

1553
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:43.380
<v Speaker 1>And there's also,</v>

1554
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:47.850
<v Speaker 1>there was a fascinating debate recently between a Richard Dawkins and Deepak</v>

1555
00:45:47.851 --> 00:45:48.684
<v Speaker 1>Chopra,</v>

1556
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:49.111
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

1557
00:45:49.111 --> 00:45:49.944
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1558
00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:50.701
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1559
00:45:50.701 --> 00:45:54.600
<v Speaker 1>it was quite hilarious cause Richard Dawkins is a very brilliant guy.</v>

1560
00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:55.170
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1561
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:55.710
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1562
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:57.270
<v Speaker 1>he's also kind of cunty.</v>

1563
00:45:58.590 --> 00:45:59.890
<v Speaker 1>He gets a little conti,</v>

1564
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:01.321
<v Speaker 1>rightly so.</v>

1565
00:46:01.321 --> 00:46:01.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1566
00:46:01.561 --> 00:46:01.760
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1567
00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.890
<v Speaker 1>he's had to deal with so much quackery and fuckery his whole life.</v>

1568
00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:05.401
<v Speaker 1>And he's been,</v>

1569
00:46:05.401 --> 00:46:05.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1570
00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:06.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1571
00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.370
<v Speaker 1>of rabid atheists atheist for the longest.</v>

1572
00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:09.540
<v Speaker 1>He's made a career out of that,</v>

1573
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:11.400
<v Speaker 1>has made a big career out of that.</v>

1574
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:15.170
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that Deepak said that was really fascinating because they</v>

1575
00:46:15.171 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 1>were talking about consciousness and consciousness being an Adams and</v>

1576
00:46:18.301 --> 00:46:19.200
<v Speaker 1>consciousness being in,</v>

1577
00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:24.420
<v Speaker 1>and Dawkins was insisting that these things did not have consciousness,</v>

1578
00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.890
<v Speaker 1>which to me is,</v>

1579
00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:26.701
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1580
00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:27.151
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1581
00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:27.271
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1582
00:46:27.271 --> 00:46:28.530
<v Speaker 1>how can you insist?</v>

1583
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:29.850
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me.</v>

1584
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1585
00:46:30.151 --> 00:46:30.984
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that,</v>

1586
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:33.540
<v Speaker 1>but whether you clearly you're,</v>

1587
00:46:33.541 --> 00:46:37.830
<v Speaker 1>he's a brilliant man with a massive amount of scientific data at his disposal</v>

1588
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:39.720
<v Speaker 1>for things that he can prove for sure.</v>

1589
00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:41.460
<v Speaker 1>But to say that you know,</v>

1590
00:46:41.461 --> 00:46:46.461
<v Speaker 1>that Adam's don't have consciousness is kind of silly because we don't,</v>

1591
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:50.970
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing that Deepak said that I thought was really fascinating was</v>

1592
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:56.150
<v Speaker 1>that he believes that what w what you're seeing in human beings with human</v>

1593
00:46:56.281 --> 00:46:58.650
<v Speaker 1>beings being recycled star dust me,</v>

1594
00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:01.030
<v Speaker 1>we literally are made of star dust.</v>

1595
00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:05.130
<v Speaker 1>A star had to explode to create the very molecules that are inside of our body</v>

1596
00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:09.540
<v Speaker 1>and what you're seeing in the human being is the universe actually becoming</v>

1597
00:47:09.541 --> 00:47:12.180
<v Speaker 1>aware of itself in a way that it can communicate.</v>

1598
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:13.230
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a beautiful idea.</v>

1599
00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:18.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful idea and I think both guys are so rigid on what their side is,</v>

1600
00:47:19.081 --> 00:47:19.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1601
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:20.191
<v Speaker 1>and especially in the,</v>

1602
00:47:20.191 --> 00:47:22.770
<v Speaker 1>in a debate forum and Dawkins absolutely,</v>

1603
00:47:22.771 --> 00:47:23.830
<v Speaker 1>sure he's correct.</v>

1604
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Depok confusing the fuck out of everybody with word salad of quantum and this</v>

1605
00:47:28.681 --> 00:47:29.080
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>

1606
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.670
<v Speaker 1>He just throws quantum out there.</v>

1607
00:47:30.671 --> 00:47:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Like you throw salt on French fries,</v>

1608
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:32.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1609
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if it's the right way to use it,</v>

1610
00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 1>but he just throws it out there and confuses the shit out of you.</v>

1611
00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:42.721
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes like very poor method of communication he incorporates because it's</v>

1612
00:47:45.101 --> 00:47:46.570
<v Speaker 1>not clear what he's saying.</v>

1613
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Even though I know what quantum means.</v>

1614
00:47:49.031 --> 00:47:49.601
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1615
00:47:49.601 --> 00:47:52.450
<v Speaker 1>I know what he's talking about when he's talking about consciousness being</v>

1616
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:53.230
<v Speaker 1>nonlocal.</v>

1617
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I understand all those things,</v>

1618
00:47:54.281 --> 00:47:58.000
<v Speaker 1>but he says it in such a word salad way that it's like,</v>

1619
00:47:58.090 --> 00:47:58.501
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1620
00:47:58.501 --> 00:47:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1621
00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:00.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're getting at.</v>

1622
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Man seems to me like you're trying to confuse the shit out of people with a real</v>

1623
00:48:03.161 --> 00:48:04.330
<v Speaker 1>elaborate sentence.</v>

1624
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:05.743
<v Speaker 1>Could be,</v>

1625
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:08.680
<v Speaker 1>and then when this debate or make it clear,</v>

1626
00:48:08.681 --> 00:48:09.510
<v Speaker 1>make a point.</v>

1627
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:10.780
<v Speaker 1>That's our goal to win</v>

1628
00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:11.211
<v Speaker 3>bait.</v>

1629
00:48:11.211 --> 00:48:12.090
<v Speaker 3>Would Richard Dawkins,</v>

1630
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:14.100
<v Speaker 3>Richard Dawkins is a very clever guy.</v>

1631
00:48:14.101 --> 00:48:14.341
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1632
00:48:14.341 --> 00:48:14.641
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1633
00:48:14.641 --> 00:48:15.930
<v Speaker 3>I've met him and he's um,</v>

1634
00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:17.330
<v Speaker 3>he's a formidable uh,</v>

1635
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.000
<v Speaker 3>arguing.</v>

1636
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1637
00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:19.350
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy.</v>

1638
00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:20.161
<v Speaker 3>Not Easy at all,</v>

1639
00:48:20.161 --> 00:48:23.730
<v Speaker 3>but he is a religious fanatic in his own way.</v>

1640
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.001
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>

1641
00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:24.301
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1642
00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:28.830
<v Speaker 3>his non belief in the meaning or purpose in the universe is a religious idea of</v>

1643
00:48:28.831 --> 00:48:29.580
<v Speaker 3>a kind.</v>

1644
00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:30.660
<v Speaker 3>It's not based on facts.</v>

1645
00:48:30.661 --> 00:48:31.710
<v Speaker 3>It's not based on evidence.</v>

1646
00:48:31.711 --> 00:48:33.660
<v Speaker 3>It's based on his,</v>

1647
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:34.950
<v Speaker 3>his opinion.</v>

1648
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:35.611
<v Speaker 3>As a matter of fact,</v>

1649
00:48:35.611 --> 00:48:36.444
<v Speaker 3>nothing more.</v>

1650
00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:36.671
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1651
00:48:36.671 --> 00:48:38.770
<v Speaker 1>it's also based on a lack of information.</v>

1652
00:48:38.771 --> 00:48:40.510
<v Speaker 1>And when I say that lack of information,</v>

1653
00:48:40.511 --> 00:48:43.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean one thing and one thing only psychedelic experiences.</v>

1654
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:44.800
<v Speaker 1>He has not had them.</v>

1655
00:48:44.801 --> 00:48:46.450
<v Speaker 1>He needs to have them without a doubt.</v>

1656
00:48:46.451 --> 00:48:47.380
<v Speaker 1>You need to have the million.</v>

1657
00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:48.323
<v Speaker 3>I would like to,</v>

1658
00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:51.150
<v Speaker 3>I would like Dawkins to smoke DMT.</v>

1659
00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:51.900
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1660
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:52.770
<v Speaker 3>That's the one.</v>

1661
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.950
<v Speaker 3>That's the one psychedelic with which there is just no negotiation.</v>

1662
00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:57.370
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>

1663
00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:59.620
<v Speaker 3>you just don't get a discussion with DMT.</v>

1664
00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.200
<v Speaker 3>It just does for you.</v>

1665
00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:01.561
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1666
00:49:01.561 --> 00:49:04.200
<v Speaker 3>and the other ones that even the DMT in Iowa,</v>

1667
00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.180
<v Speaker 3>Asca Dawkins could resist that,</v>

1668
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.680
<v Speaker 3>but the smoke DMT,</v>

1669
00:49:07.681 --> 00:49:08.910
<v Speaker 3>once you hit the right dose,</v>

1670
00:49:08.911 --> 00:49:10.320
<v Speaker 3>once you pass that fourth,</v>

1671
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.470
<v Speaker 3>fourth big draw on the pipe there,</v>

1672
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.030
<v Speaker 3>then there is no negotiation.</v>

1673
00:49:15.031 --> 00:49:17.700
<v Speaker 3>It is going to take you there and it's going to deal with you.</v>

1674
00:49:17.701 --> 00:49:17.941
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1675
00:49:17.941 --> 00:49:20.220
<v Speaker 3>and I would like to see Dawkins argue with DMT.</v>

1676
00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.433
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

1677
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1678
00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:26.240
<v Speaker 1>he would probably argue with what the effects are and that it's some sort of a,</v>

1679
00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:26.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1680
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:31.610
<v Speaker 1>an assault on the sort of visual Cortex by various chemicals that distort</v>

1681
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:32.870
<v Speaker 1>perception and reality.</v>

1682
00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:33.681
<v Speaker 1>That's what he'd do.</v>

1683
00:49:33.681 --> 00:49:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1684
00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:34.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1685
00:49:34.191 --> 00:49:34.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1686
00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:37.880
<v Speaker 1>what it is though is data and what it is,</v>

1687
00:49:37.881 --> 00:49:42.590
<v Speaker 1>is an experience and it's both things he's lacking in and he's lacking in that</v>

1688
00:49:42.591 --> 00:49:43.041
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>

1689
00:49:43.041 --> 00:49:43.470
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

1690
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:46.880
<v Speaker 3>that experience data that he needs to have as a scientist is,</v>

1691
00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:47.700
<v Speaker 3>he's one of the,</v>

1692
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.040
<v Speaker 3>one of the people I would really like to see having that,</v>

1693
00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:50.933
<v Speaker 3>having that data.</v>

1694
00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:54.540
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you that he would probably find a way to rationalize it and put it</v>

1695
00:49:54.541 --> 00:49:55.470
<v Speaker 3>and set it aside,</v>

1696
00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:59.640
<v Speaker 3>but still it would be incredibly useful for him to have that experience because</v>

1697
00:49:59.641 --> 00:50:04.641
<v Speaker 3>he's been so influential in persuading so many people that there is nothing</v>

1698
00:50:04.651 --> 00:50:08.850
<v Speaker 3>beyond this material realm and DMT is a place beyond this material realm.</v>

1699
00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.690
<v Speaker 3>I am prepared to admit it could be something that we're projecting out of our</v>

1700
00:50:12.691 --> 00:50:13.201
<v Speaker 3>own minds.</v>

1701
00:50:13.201 --> 00:50:14.330
<v Speaker 3>It may not be any relative to,</v>

1702
00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:15.990
<v Speaker 3>but it feels like a real place.</v>

1703
00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.410
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate you,</v>

1704
00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:17.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1705
00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:18.511
<v Speaker 1>admitting that,</v>

1706
00:50:18.511 --> 00:50:20.610
<v Speaker 1>and I say that often as well.</v>

1707
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I think that it feels like a different dimension that's inhabited with</v>

1708
00:50:24.811 --> 00:50:26.130
<v Speaker 1>intelligent thought,</v>

1709
00:50:26.131 --> 00:50:26.671
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1710
00:50:26.671 --> 00:50:27.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever is intelligent.</v>

1711
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Something I,</v>

1712
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1713
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1714
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:32.480
<v Speaker 1>the way I described as geometric patterns that are made out of love and</v>

1715
00:50:32.481 --> 00:50:35.210
<v Speaker 1>understanding what it feels like to me,</v>

1716
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I have never had a bad DMT trip in a sense where it turned evil,</v>

1717
00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:46.180
<v Speaker 1>but I've heard people discuss like really horrific evil entities if they've run</v>

1718
00:50:46.881 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

1719
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:50.120
<v Speaker 1>and I often wonder by virtue of that,</v>

1720
00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:54.050
<v Speaker 1>whether or not what they're talking about is something that's in their psyche.</v>

1721
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Something that's in their subconscious,</v>

1722
00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.970
<v Speaker 3>something that I bring it to the party.</v>

1723
00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.113
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1724
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.540
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1725
00:50:58.540 --> 00:50:59.850
<v Speaker 3>my last DMT trip,</v>

1726
00:50:59.851 --> 00:51:00.990
<v Speaker 3>which I mentioned a little while ago,</v>

1727
00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:01.411
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>

1728
00:51:01.411 --> 00:51:04.590
<v Speaker 3>which was extremely powerful and scary.</v>

1729
00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1730
00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:06.870
<v Speaker 3>this was the time,</v>

1731
00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:07.211
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1732
00:51:07.211 --> 00:51:12.211
<v Speaker 3>this happened just a into two weeks before I gave up my 24 year kind of what's</v>

1733
00:51:13.421 --> 00:51:14.254
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

1734
00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:14.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1735
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:18.720
<v Speaker 3>and I think I had some shit to go through and I think the DMT was partner.</v>

1736
00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:20.790
<v Speaker 3>I then followed that with five I wasco sessions.</v>

1737
00:51:20.791 --> 00:51:22.710
<v Speaker 3>But I think the DMT was really helpful.</v>

1738
00:51:22.711 --> 00:51:24.570
<v Speaker 3>And I may have mentioned this to you the last time we talked,</v>

1739
00:51:24.571 --> 00:51:25.320
<v Speaker 3>but what,</v>

1740
00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.580
<v Speaker 3>but what happened as I,</v>

1741
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.391
<v Speaker 3>as I went under,</v>

1742
00:51:27.391 --> 00:51:31.220
<v Speaker 3>I had that fourth deep inhalation of the pipe lay,</v>

1743
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:32.590
<v Speaker 3>lay back and,</v>

1744
00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:35.370
<v Speaker 3>and I don't normally hear voices and Dmt,</v>

1745
00:51:35.371 --> 00:51:38.070
<v Speaker 3>but a voice spoke to me and the voice said to me,</v>

1746
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.170
<v Speaker 3>your hours now,</v>

1747
00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:41.700
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1748
00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.110
<v Speaker 3>your hours now.</v>

1749
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:45.480
<v Speaker 3>And my last conscious thought was,</v>

1750
00:51:45.481 --> 00:51:45.991
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

1751
00:51:45.991 --> 00:51:46.320
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1752
00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.540
<v Speaker 3>but only for only for 12 minutes,</v>

1753
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:49.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1754
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.280
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

1755
00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.730
<v Speaker 3>and then I,</v>

1756
00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:53.640
<v Speaker 3>I've felt myself being ripped apart.</v>

1757
00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:54.600
<v Speaker 3>There were these things,</v>

1758
00:51:54.601 --> 00:51:55.650
<v Speaker 3>the small things.</v>

1759
00:51:55.651 --> 00:51:57.850
<v Speaker 3>I was looking on some kind of table and they were running around me and they</v>

1760
00:51:57.851 --> 00:51:58.860
<v Speaker 3>were tearing me apart.</v>

1761
00:51:58.861 --> 00:52:00.330
<v Speaker 3>My body was torn to pieces,</v>

1762
00:52:00.331 --> 00:52:04.850
<v Speaker 3>bits where cast of was like a cocoon was being ripped away and,</v>

1763
00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:05.360
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1764
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.960
<v Speaker 3>and then the voice comes again.</v>

1765
00:52:06.961 --> 00:52:09.960
<v Speaker 3>There's like a trumpet call and the voice comes again and now the great</v>

1766
00:52:09.961 --> 00:52:11.790
<v Speaker 3>transformation shall begin.</v>

1767
00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:13.010
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>

1768
00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:15.000
<v Speaker 3>it was the weirdest and strangest experience.</v>

1769
00:52:15.001 --> 00:52:18.930
<v Speaker 3>And I was in this flickering huge space and these little beings we're running</v>

1770
00:52:18.931 --> 00:52:22.800
<v Speaker 3>around me and they were doing it and I was completely helpless and at their</v>

1771
00:52:22.801 --> 00:52:24.090
<v Speaker 3>mercy and that,</v>

1772
00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:25.560
<v Speaker 3>that was scary.</v>

1773
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.700
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

1774
00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.140
<v Speaker 3>But it was not demonic.</v>

1775
00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:28.771
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1776
00:52:28.771 --> 00:52:29.604
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

1777
00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:30.391
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

1778
00:52:30.391 --> 00:52:32.250
<v Speaker 3>this is stuff you need to go through.</v>

1779
00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:33.001
<v Speaker 3>You need to,</v>

1780
00:52:33.001 --> 00:52:34.050
<v Speaker 3>you need to do this.</v>

1781
00:52:34.051 --> 00:52:34.801
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be very,</v>

1782
00:52:34.801 --> 00:52:35.491
<v Speaker 3>very frightening,</v>

1783
00:52:35.491 --> 00:52:37.150
<v Speaker 3>but it's something you need to do.</v>

1784
00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.600
<v Speaker 3>And I did need to do it and it was helpful to me.</v>

1785
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:41.670
<v Speaker 3>Was that the first time you'd heard voices?</v>

1786
00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:41.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1787
00:52:41.911 --> 00:52:42.340
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>

1788
00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:42.691
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

1789
00:52:42.691 --> 00:52:45.540
<v Speaker 3>I did not hear voices speaking to me and DMT ever before.</v>

1790
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:46.221
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1791
00:52:46.221 --> 00:52:46.470
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1792
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:47.270
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1793
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:49.940
<v Speaker 1>my experiences had been filled with voice.</v>

1794
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1795
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:51.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1796
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:51.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1797
00:52:51.771 --> 00:52:53.150
<v Speaker 1>one of the big ones is,</v>

1798
00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:55.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a really childish thing that they would say,</v>

1799
00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:58.040
<v Speaker 1>and this was like when I was about to leave,</v>

1800
00:52:58.041 --> 00:52:59.450
<v Speaker 1>when I was starting to sober up,</v>

1801
00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:00.471
<v Speaker 1>they would say,</v>

1802
00:53:00.471 --> 00:53:02.960
<v Speaker 1>I love you 600 million,</v>

1803
00:53:02.961 --> 00:53:03.890
<v Speaker 1>500,000 times.</v>

1804
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Like a child would say,</v>

1805
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.631
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1806
00:53:05.631 --> 00:53:06.464
<v Speaker 1>I want to hit that.</v>

1807
00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:08.690
<v Speaker 1>I want to hit that more than I wanted to hear your hours.</v>

1808
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:10.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1809
00:53:10.341 --> 00:53:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I think I came into it in a good place.</v>

1810
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.380
<v Speaker 1>I was in a happy place in my life and I wasn't scared.</v>

1811
00:53:15.381 --> 00:53:16.161
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't fighting it.</v>

1812
00:53:16.161 --> 00:53:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1813
00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.100
<v Speaker 1>But that I love you thing was really weird.</v>

1814
00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:22.730
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that it said was the words of Mckenna.</v>

1815
00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 1>And I think when I've tried to analyze this,</v>

1816
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.830
<v Speaker 1>I think that what it was was that I had listened to so much mckenna before I'd</v>

1817
00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.561
<v Speaker 1>gone into it,</v>

1818
00:53:31.561 --> 00:53:35.820
<v Speaker 1>that I had sort of stained my brain with this idea and either my</v>

1819
00:53:35.821 --> 00:53:40.680
<v Speaker 1>subconsciousness was saying this or they were whatever they are,</v>

1820
00:53:40.681 --> 00:53:41.460
<v Speaker 1>whether they're,</v>

1821
00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:41.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1822
00:53:41.821 --> 00:53:42.710
<v Speaker 1>a part of my,</v>

1823
00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:43.870
<v Speaker 1>my thought process,</v>

1824
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:45.990
<v Speaker 1>we're projecting this thing,</v>

1825
00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:47.520
<v Speaker 1>this reminder,</v>

1826
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.560
<v Speaker 1>do not give into astonishment.</v>

1827
00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:52.920
<v Speaker 1>And that that was because it was so mind blowing.</v>

1828
00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:58.220
<v Speaker 1>I was flying down this bumblebee covered like pathway,</v>

1829
00:54:00.961 --> 00:54:02.400
<v Speaker 1>this spinning,</v>

1830
00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:04.710
<v Speaker 1>when I say bumblebee co not covered,</v>

1831
00:54:04.711 --> 00:54:06.270
<v Speaker 1>rather by colored it was,</v>

1832
00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:11.070
<v Speaker 1>there was very clear black and yellow stripes of all this thing,</v>

1833
00:54:11.071 --> 00:54:12.270
<v Speaker 1>like very bright,</v>

1834
00:54:12.271 --> 00:54:14.460
<v Speaker 1>intense black and very bright,</v>

1835
00:54:14.461 --> 00:54:15.510
<v Speaker 1>intense yellow.</v>

1836
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:17.310
<v Speaker 1>And it was moving and like,</v>

1837
00:54:17.311 --> 00:54:17.790
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1838
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:18.120
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1839
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.570
<v Speaker 1>and I was shooting down this thing and then it was,</v>

1840
00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:24.680
<v Speaker 1>it was saying do not give into astonishment and it was the word,</v>

1841
00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.340
<v Speaker 1>the words of Mckenna but not in,</v>

1842
00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:27.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1843
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.051
<v Speaker 1>like it wasn't,</v>

1844
00:54:28.051 --> 00:54:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I was his voice.</v>

1845
00:54:29.401 --> 00:54:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like no voice.</v>

1846
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:33.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just the word that thought.</v>

1847
00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the weird thing about the,</v>

1848
00:54:35.931 --> 00:54:36.210
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1849
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:36.601
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1850
00:54:36.601 --> 00:54:38.930
<v Speaker 1>the telepathic thing that you,</v>

1851
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:41.070
<v Speaker 1>you get from the DMT experiences.</v>

1852
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.810
<v Speaker 1>You understand the words,</v>

1853
00:54:42.811 --> 00:54:44.160
<v Speaker 1>it's speaking to you in English,</v>

1854
00:54:44.161 --> 00:54:46.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really speaking to you.</v>

1855
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:49.560
<v Speaker 1>It's just those things are getting into your brain very clearly,</v>

1856
00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.390
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not really sure you hear them.</v>

1857
00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1858
00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:52.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1859
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:52.801
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1860
00:54:52.801 --> 00:54:53.431
<v Speaker 3>here is a,</v>

1861
00:54:53.431 --> 00:54:54.570
<v Speaker 3>here is an experience,</v>

1862
00:54:54.571 --> 00:54:55.404
<v Speaker 3>which I'm,</v>

1863
00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:55.640
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1864
00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.410
<v Speaker 3>what a pity to go through life and not have that experience ever.</v>

1865
00:54:58.530 --> 00:54:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1866
00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.830
<v Speaker 3>I've said to many people like you,</v>

1867
00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:02.280
<v Speaker 3>you're screwing yourself,</v>

1868
00:55:02.281 --> 00:55:03.000
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1869
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:03.833
<v Speaker 3>You're really,</v>

1870
00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:04.560
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1871
00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.700
<v Speaker 3>it's scary as shit,</v>

1872
00:55:05.701 --> 00:55:06.481
<v Speaker 3>but boy,</v>

1873
00:55:06.481 --> 00:55:07.490
<v Speaker 3>do you get a lot out of them.</v>

1874
00:55:07.491 --> 00:55:07.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1875
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:08.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1876
00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:08.941
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

1877
00:55:08.941 --> 00:55:09.331
<v Speaker 3>in my,</v>

1878
00:55:09.331 --> 00:55:10.021
<v Speaker 3>in my case,</v>

1879
00:55:10.021 --> 00:55:10.530
<v Speaker 3>the previous,</v>

1880
00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:12.590
<v Speaker 3>most of the previous DMT Giannis I'd had,</v>

1881
00:55:12.591 --> 00:55:13.770
<v Speaker 3>had not been terrifying.</v>

1882
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:16.200
<v Speaker 3>They had been gentle and healing and nice.</v>

1883
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.920
<v Speaker 3>I think that I was at a juncture in my life where I needed to make a change.</v>

1884
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:24.480
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that particular DMT experience followed by the five Iowasca</v>

1885
00:55:24.481 --> 00:55:27.210
<v Speaker 3>journeys helped me to make that change.</v>

1886
00:55:27.211 --> 00:55:27.580
<v Speaker 3>And I'm,</v>

1887
00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm eternally grateful for that.</v>

1888
00:55:28.981 --> 00:55:29.311
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1889
00:55:29.311 --> 00:55:31.800
<v Speaker 3>it was a really positive and beneficial thing for them.</v>

1890
00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:32.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1891
00:55:32.241 --> 00:55:34.700
<v Speaker 1>It was very positive and beneficial for me as well.</v>

1892
00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1893
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.863
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1894
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.930
<v Speaker 1>I think I've always wanted a change.</v>

1895
00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1896
00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I want to change now.</v>

1897
00:55:40.491 --> 00:55:42.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean I always want more,</v>

1898
00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.550
<v Speaker 1>more enlightenment,</v>

1899
00:55:43.551 --> 00:55:44.420
<v Speaker 1>more police,</v>

1900
00:55:44.421 --> 00:55:44.991
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

1901
00:55:44.991 --> 00:55:46.250
<v Speaker 1>more serenity,</v>

1902
00:55:46.251 --> 00:55:46.970
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

1903
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1904
00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1905
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.960
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

1906
00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:49.251
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>

1907
00:55:49.251 --> 00:55:50.210
<v Speaker 1>at that time,</v>

1908
00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I think what I was just trying to figure out what are the possibilities,</v>

1909
00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:55.940
<v Speaker 1>what else is out there?</v>

1910
00:55:55.941 --> 00:56:00.941
<v Speaker 1>And it was just this one big rush of impossible possibilities and that redefined</v>

1911
00:56:02.781 --> 00:56:04.820
<v Speaker 1>my view of reality itself.</v>

1912
00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:06.410
<v Speaker 1>It was really scary though.</v>

1913
00:56:06.411 --> 00:56:10.190
<v Speaker 1>The last one was really slippery because after it was over,</v>

1914
00:56:10.191 --> 00:56:15.191
<v Speaker 1>it was so intense and powerful that regular reality didn't seem real to me.</v>

1915
00:56:15.201 --> 00:56:16.034
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>

1916
00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:16.431
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1917
00:56:16.431 --> 00:56:21.431
<v Speaker 1>I went through a period where I feel like my ego was trying to trick me by being</v>

1918
00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:26.200
<v Speaker 1>scared of everything was scared of car accidents and trees falling in front of</v>

1919
00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:29.650
<v Speaker 1>my car and buildings collapsing and earthquakes.</v>

1920
00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:32.770
<v Speaker 1>There's all these thoughts that came into my mind that I just went on for four</v>

1921
00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:34.030
<v Speaker 1>days after the Chinese.</v>

1922
00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1923
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

1924
00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:36.490
<v Speaker 1>it's not intensely strong.</v>

1925
00:56:36.491 --> 00:56:38.620
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like paranoia or um,</v>

1926
00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:39.520
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>

1927
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1928
00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.810
<v Speaker 1>or anxiety.</v>

1929
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.060
<v Speaker 1>It was like this flittering thing that I'd go,</v>

1930
00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:43.901
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1931
00:56:43.901 --> 00:56:44.734
<v Speaker 1>stop it.</v>

1932
00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Stop it.</v>

1933
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1934
00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.320
<v Speaker 1>But like I'd be on the highway and I'd be like,</v>

1935
00:56:47.321 --> 00:56:49.630
<v Speaker 1>what if this guy just fucking flips the fucking road and it comes right towards</v>

1936
00:56:49.631 --> 00:56:50.530
<v Speaker 1>you and smashed his head on the,</v>

1937
00:56:50.531 --> 00:56:50.811
<v Speaker 1>your car,</v>

1938
00:56:50.811 --> 00:56:51.840
<v Speaker 1>your dad and all.</v>

1939
00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:54.560
<v Speaker 1>It was all this nonsense that was just entering into my mind.</v>

1940
00:56:54.561 --> 00:56:58.330
<v Speaker 1>And it's not just being aware of traffic and being smart,</v>

1941
00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.380
<v Speaker 1>but possibilities would.</v>

1942
00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:01.341
<v Speaker 1>And I think when a new,</v>

1943
00:57:01.341 --> 00:57:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been doing that before.</v>

1944
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

1945
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:03.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1946
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.911
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>

1947
00:57:03.911 --> 00:57:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1948
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:08.800
<v Speaker 1>I think what it was was my ego trying to regain some sort of control.</v>

1949
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Is that my ego by protecting me or by keeping me paranoid and keeping me very</v>

1950
00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:17.890
<v Speaker 1>base and primal and animalistic,</v>

1951
00:57:17.891 --> 00:57:21.940
<v Speaker 1>worried about safety and shelter and disasters and things like that.</v>

1952
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:26.170
<v Speaker 1>It was trying to regain some strength because it was so humbled by the</v>

1953
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:28.030
<v Speaker 1>experience as a humbling experience.</v>

1954
00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:28.661
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1955
00:57:28.661 --> 00:57:29.440
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

1956
00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.550
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most,</v>

1957
00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:33.010
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the most humbling experience that is,</v>

1958
00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:34.030
<v Speaker 1>that it's possible to have.</v>

1959
00:57:34.031 --> 00:57:34.421
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1960
00:57:34.421 --> 00:57:35.254
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>

1961
00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:39.100
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's valuable and and who says we shouldn't have experiences because</v>

1962
00:57:39.101 --> 00:57:39.880
<v Speaker 1>they're scary,</v>

1963
00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:40.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1964
00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:45.730
<v Speaker 1>these are amongst the most important experiences it's possible to have.</v>

1965
00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I hear you use flotation tanks?</v>

1966
00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1967
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:50.510
<v Speaker 1>How many of my basement you have a,</v>

1968
00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:51.383
<v Speaker 1>do you use it regularly?</v>

1969
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:51.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1970
00:57:51.911 --> 00:57:52.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1971
00:57:52.241 --> 00:57:54.030
<v Speaker 1>I've been using them for a I.</v>

1972
00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I bought my house in 2003 so,</v>

1973
00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:57.600
<v Speaker 1>so for,</v>

1974
00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:58.930
<v Speaker 1>for more than 10 years,</v>

1975
00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.160
<v Speaker 1>I've had this in my basement.</v>

1976
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Please describe the extent to me.</v>

1977
00:58:01.721 --> 00:58:02.680
<v Speaker 1>You get you get into this.</v>

1978
00:58:02.681 --> 00:58:03.341
<v Speaker 1>We've never done it.</v>

1979
00:58:03.341 --> 00:58:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I've never done.</v>

1980
00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1981
00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:04.930
<v Speaker 1>I want to do it.</v>

1982
00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Where are you staying while you're out here?</v>

1983
00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:06.971
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking money.</v>

1984
00:58:06.971 --> 00:58:07.804
<v Speaker 1>Food with friends.</v>

1985
00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh it perfect.</v>

1986
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you in if you want to go tomorrow.</v>

1987
00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1988
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:12.910
<v Speaker 1>There's a place in Venice called the float lab,</v>

1989
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.690
<v Speaker 1>also the best place in the country and you just go in there and float ass.</v>

1990
00:58:16.691 --> 00:58:17.524
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1991
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:18.490
<v Speaker 1>You don't need anything.</v>

1992
00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:20.050
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to do two hours.</v>

1993
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1994

<v Speaker 1>If I have two hours,</v>

1995
00:58:21.131 --> 00:58:22.000
<v Speaker 1>but if I only have an hour,</v>

1996
00:58:22.001 --> 00:58:24.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll set a timer and I'll put a timer outside of the,</v>

1997
00:58:24.581 --> 00:58:24.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1998
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:26.950
<v Speaker 1>the box so I can hear it when it goes off.</v>

1999
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.820
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2000
00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:28.750
<v Speaker 1>that's my old one.</v>

2001
00:58:28.751 --> 00:58:29.291
<v Speaker 1>You see it up there.</v>

2002
00:58:29.291 --> 00:58:29.920
<v Speaker 1>That's my,</v>

2003
00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.230
<v Speaker 1>that's a Samadi tank that I had.</v>

2004
00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:34.990
<v Speaker 1>The one that I have now though is built by the float lab,</v>

2005
00:58:34.991 --> 00:58:36.760
<v Speaker 1>which is far more complicated.</v>

2006
00:58:36.761 --> 00:58:38.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a really immense,</v>

2007
00:58:38.201 --> 00:58:40.120
<v Speaker 1>huge seven feet tall,</v>

2008
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:42.880
<v Speaker 1>nine feet wide or nine foot long,</v>

2009
00:58:42.881 --> 00:58:43.900
<v Speaker 1>six foot wide.</v>

2010
00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:44.883
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>

2011
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:45.641
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

2012
00:58:45.641 --> 00:58:47.200
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a walk in freezer.</v>

2013
00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2014
00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:49.480
<v Speaker 1>And it has oxygen pumped into it.</v>

2015
00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:50.141
<v Speaker 1>When you're in it,</v>

2016
00:58:50.141 --> 00:58:50.861
<v Speaker 1>you're in water,</v>

2017
00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:51.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2018
00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:52.720
<v Speaker 1>There's salt water to keeps you,</v>

2019
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:53.700
<v Speaker 1>keeps you suspension.</v>

2020
00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:54.533
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a done,</v>

2021
00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:56.980
<v Speaker 1>we're going to change your life tomorrow.</v>

2022
00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:58.990
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2023
00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:02.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like a psychedelic experience except completely natural.</v>

2024
00:59:02.261 --> 00:59:03.011
<v Speaker 1>Completely safe.</v>

2025
00:59:03.011 --> 00:59:04.330
<v Speaker 1>And you can end it anytime you want,</v>

2026
00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:05.860
<v Speaker 1>but that's my new tank.</v>

2027
00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:06.940
<v Speaker 1>But when you,</v>

2028
00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:08.500
<v Speaker 1>when you climb into that thing,</v>

2029
00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:13.910
<v Speaker 1>the water is set to the same temperature as the surface of your skin and there's</v>

2030
00:59:14.441 --> 00:59:16.570
<v Speaker 1>a thousand pounds of salt in that water.</v>

2031
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:20.350
<v Speaker 1>It used to be 800 in my smaller tank or this one's a thousand and so you can't</v>

2032
00:59:20.351 --> 00:59:20.750
<v Speaker 1>sync.</v>

2033
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:21.321
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2034
00:59:21.321 --> 00:59:22.540
<v Speaker 1>It's about 11 inches deep.</v>

2035
00:59:22.541 --> 00:59:24.240
<v Speaker 1>So even if you did sank and you can't fall down,</v>

2036
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.690
<v Speaker 1>you're fine and you're floating.</v>

2037
00:59:26.691 --> 00:59:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Like the half of your body is above the water and as you live there,</v>

2038
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:32.690
<v Speaker 1>you're in total silence,</v>

2039
00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:33.470
<v Speaker 1>total darkness.</v>

2040
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Your ears are actually underwater.</v>

2041
00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:37.790
<v Speaker 1>You close the lid on this thing and you don't hear a thing,</v>

2042
00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't see a thing,</v>

2043
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:43.190
<v Speaker 1>you have no input and you don't feel the water because the water is the same</v>

2044
00:59:43.191 --> 00:59:43.730
<v Speaker 1>temperature,</v>

2045
00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:44.480
<v Speaker 1>your skin,</v>

2046
00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.400
<v Speaker 1>so you're floating completely weightless.</v>

2047
00:59:46.790 --> 00:59:48.740
<v Speaker 1>It's really great for your body.</v>

2048
00:59:48.741 --> 00:59:50.170
<v Speaker 1>It feels great because you,</v>

2049
00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:54.320
<v Speaker 1>you would leave V8 all the pressures of gravity and stress,</v>

2050
00:59:54.330 --> 00:59:56.990
<v Speaker 1>you feel your muscles relaxing and unwinding.</v>

2051
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:58.503
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

2052
00:59:58.580 --> 00:59:59.390
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

2053
00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:01.940
<v Speaker 1>the way I describe it as the first 20 minutes or so,</v>

2054
01:00:01.941 --> 01:00:03.710
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a seminar on my life.</v>

2055
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:06.980
<v Speaker 1>It gets me to start examining various aspects of the stuff that goes through</v>

2056
01:00:06.981 --> 01:00:10.820
<v Speaker 1>like a life review in the absence of sensory input.</v>

2057
01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:11.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2058
01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:13.340
<v Speaker 1>like even while we're having this conversation,</v>

2059
01:00:13.341 --> 01:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>it's very quiet in the air,</v>

2060
01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:15.440
<v Speaker 1>but we're,</v>

2061
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:20.030
<v Speaker 1>we're having to deal with the fact that there's computers or screens,</v>

2062
01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:20.860
<v Speaker 1>ceiling.</v>

2063
01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:23.010
<v Speaker 1>There's your bud is chair.</v>

2064
01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2065
01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:26.540
<v Speaker 1>All those things are gone in that tank and the tank,</v>

2066
01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:28.010
<v Speaker 1>it's just your mind.</v>

2067
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>It's the only place ever,</v>

2068
01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>the only environment on earth where your mind is untethered from your body.</v>

2069
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:35.631
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing,</v>

2070
01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:38.450
<v Speaker 1>amazing experience and completely safe,</v>

2071
01:00:38.451 --> 01:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>completely natural,</v>

2072
01:00:39.501 --> 01:00:40.550
<v Speaker 1>completely beneficial,</v>

2073
01:00:40.551 --> 01:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>completely refreshing.</v>

2074
01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:42.861
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2075
01:00:42.861 --> 01:00:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're not into the psychedelic aspect of it,</v>

2076
01:00:44.961 --> 01:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>you just want to relax.</v>

2077
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:47.270
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

2078
01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.133
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

2079
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>It should be something that everyone has in their home,</v>

2080
01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2081
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:53.450
<v Speaker 1>It would benefit so many people in so many ways.</v>

2082
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Do you get into visionary space?</v>

2083
01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2084
01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're going and little smoker smoking.</v>

2085
01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>But that's say the experience was,</v>

2086
01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:04.400
<v Speaker 1>it said no shows mushrooms enhance it.</v>

2087
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2088
01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2089
01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.070
<v Speaker 1>but although a mushrooms are,</v>

2090
01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.150
<v Speaker 1>it's scary in there.</v>

2091
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.661
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2092
01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I like cannabis,</v>

2093
01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:10.611
<v Speaker 1>cannabis,</v>

2094
01:01:10.611 --> 01:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>eating cannabis is my favorite.</v>

2095
01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I like to eat enough cannabis that I feel like I fucked up and ate too much and</v>

2096
01:01:16.311 --> 01:01:17.000
<v Speaker 1>then get in there.</v>

2097
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2098
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:18.200
<v Speaker 1>That's the about those,</v>

2099
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:21.710
<v Speaker 1>and those are intensely psychedelic and very visionary.</v>

2100
01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.310
<v Speaker 1>But what I like about it is you can end it pretty much at any moment.</v>

2101
01:01:25.311 --> 01:01:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2102
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:26.660
<v Speaker 1>And when you open the door,</v>

2103
01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.381
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2104
01:01:27.381 --> 01:01:29.090
<v Speaker 1>you'll use the cannabis will still affect,</v>

2105
01:01:29.091 --> 01:01:30.980
<v Speaker 1>you still have the weirdness of that,</v>

2106
01:01:30.981 --> 01:01:35.000
<v Speaker 1>but all the nutty hallucinations and visuals will all go away.</v>

2107
01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:36.140
<v Speaker 1>You just step out.</v>

2108
01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:36.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2109
01:01:36.381 --> 01:01:39.800
<v Speaker 1>You just step out and you can get to that place without the cannabis as well.</v>

2110
01:01:39.801 --> 01:01:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people that have really intense psychedelic visions while</v>

2111
01:01:43.521 --> 01:01:45.770
<v Speaker 1>they're in the isolation tank.</v>

2112
01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:46.791
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2113
01:01:46.791 --> 01:01:46.911
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2114
01:01:46.911 --> 01:01:48.230
<v Speaker 1>this is an experience I have to have.</v>

2115
01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:48.801
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have it.</v>

2116
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:49.634
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have it tomorrow.</v>

2117
01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a day off or you're afraid you don't have a total day off?</v>

2118
01:01:51.921 --> 01:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>But I can get two hours.</v>

2119
01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2120
01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:54.620
<v Speaker 1>It will work it in and we'll make it.</v>

2121
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:55.420
<v Speaker 1>We'll make it happen.</v>

2122
01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:55.760
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2123
01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.001
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2124
01:01:56.001 --> 01:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>crash.</v>

2125
01:01:56.570 --> 01:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Who's the guy who runs the float lab in Venice is a great friend and a great</v>

2126
01:02:00.021 --> 01:02:00.854
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

2127
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:01.761
<v Speaker 1>He's a genius.</v>

2128
01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:02.150
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2129
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:05.690
<v Speaker 1>he's the wizard behind the curtain that creates the greatest tanks on earth.</v>

2130
01:02:05.691 --> 01:02:06.501
<v Speaker 1>He's just nutty,</v>

2131
01:02:06.501 --> 01:02:11.501
<v Speaker 1>nutty dude that I just worked incredibly hard to figure out a way to make.</v>

2132
01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:12.830
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>

2133
01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:13.490
<v Speaker 1>there's his,</v>

2134
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:14.323
<v Speaker 1>there's tanks,</v>

2135
01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:15.590
<v Speaker 1>there's like this somebody tank,</v>

2136
01:02:15.591 --> 01:02:16.490
<v Speaker 1>which is a very good tank,</v>

2137
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.271
<v Speaker 1>very functional.</v>

2138
01:02:17.271 --> 01:02:18.020
<v Speaker 1>You can use it.</v>

2139
01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different companies that have tanks and then there's his tank</v>

2140
01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>and the difference is like a modern BMW compared to a model t Ford.</v>

2141
01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2142
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Like literally it's that good.</v>

2143
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:27.841
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2144
01:02:27.841 --> 01:02:28.531
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

2145
01:02:28.531 --> 01:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

2146
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>he's just a genius.</v>

2147
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2148
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>he figured out a way to pump oxygen into them.</v>

2149
01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>He also figured out a way to flush all the water through ozone.</v>

2150
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>It kills all the bacteria.</v>

2151
01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>He has like incredibly intense filtration systems.</v>

2152
01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Four and five step processes are filtering the water,</v>

2153
01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>like all of his equipment that he has attached to all this stuff.</v>

2154
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's rocking it like that.</v>

2155
01:02:49.381 --> 01:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2156
01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:51.540
<v Speaker 1>he takes it too literally.</v>

2157
01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Then he,</v>

2158
01:02:52.651 --> 01:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>the next level is not even a mile from him.</v>

2159
01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2160
01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:56.453
<v Speaker 1>he's gone.</v>

2161
01:02:56.730 --> 01:02:57.190
<v Speaker 1>He's on a,</v>

2162
01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>he's in a place all by his own with what he's creating at the fund.</v>

2163
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.320
<v Speaker 1>You're in total silence.</v>

2164
01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Total silence.</v>

2165
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Total dog.</v>

2166
01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Total darkness.</v>

2167
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:05.640
<v Speaker 1>And you don't feel a thing.</v>

2168
01:03:05.641 --> 01:03:09.690
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're flying through space because your body is completely</v>

2169
01:03:09.691 --> 01:03:10.171
<v Speaker 1>weightless.</v>

2170
01:03:10.171 --> 01:03:11.760
<v Speaker 1>It's the weirdest feeling ever,</v>

2171
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.631
<v Speaker 1>but it's amazing.</v>

2172
01:03:12.631 --> 01:03:13.320
<v Speaker 1>You've convinced me.</v>

2173
01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2174
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you haven't done it,</v>

2175
01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.520
<v Speaker 1>but you're such a psychedelic adventure.</v>

2176
01:03:17.521 --> 01:03:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I would have thought that a been a part of your daily life.</v>

2177
01:03:19.351 --> 01:03:20.130
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't been with it.</v>

2178
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.600
<v Speaker 1>We've got to set you up with one in England,</v>

2179
01:03:21.601 --> 01:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2180
01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.520
<v Speaker 1>We've got to send one over there and,</v>

2181
01:03:23.521 --> 01:03:24.140
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2182
01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>send,</v>

2183
01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:25.323
<v Speaker 1>crash over.</v>

2184
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Have them set you up in your basement or something.</v>

2185
01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:29.160
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2186
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't live in a house if I didn't have space for one.</v>

2187
01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2188
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:32.491
<v Speaker 1>Literally,</v>

2189
01:03:32.491 --> 01:03:33.390
<v Speaker 1>it's that important to you.</v>

2190
01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:34.740
<v Speaker 1>To me it's massive.</v>

2191
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Anytime I've got something I'm thinking about or trying to work on or or,</v>

2192
01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:38.820
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

2193
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:39.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2194
01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.370
<v Speaker 1>new material and ideas,</v>

2195
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:41.881
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2196
01:03:41.881 --> 01:03:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I go through Jujitsu,</v>

2197
01:03:42.991 --> 01:03:43.824
<v Speaker 1>moves in there,</v>

2198
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I go through scenarios,</v>

2199
01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

2200
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

2201
01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I'll visually spar.</v>

2202
01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2203
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2204
01:03:48.751 --> 01:03:49.580
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2205
01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2206
01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:50.521
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2207
01:03:50.521 --> 01:03:50.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2208
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.880
<v Speaker 1>you don't get an opportunity to have the mind at its full resource capacity</v>

2209
01:03:57.570 --> 01:03:58.740
<v Speaker 1>other than in that tank.</v>

2210
01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:04.350
<v Speaker 1>And this world constantly bombarding sensation of all kinds were torn apart and</v>

2211
01:04:06.181 --> 01:04:07.440
<v Speaker 1>they can't wait to talk to you.</v>

2212
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:08.503
<v Speaker 1>You get out.</v>

2213
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this new skull that they found the 1.8 million year old human</v>

2214
01:04:15.391 --> 01:04:16.224
<v Speaker 1>skull?</v>

2215
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:17.310
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2216
01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:17.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2217
01:04:17.701 --> 01:04:21.360
<v Speaker 1>This is a amazing discovery that they found.</v>

2218
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2219
01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:22.501
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2220
01:04:22.501 --> 01:04:23.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2221
01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:26.910
<v Speaker 1>first completely preserved and we see the Gulf commented from the early</v>

2222
01:04:26.911 --> 01:04:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Pleistocene.</v>

2223
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2224
01:04:28.550 --> 01:04:28.741
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2225
01:04:28.741 --> 01:04:29.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2226
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:30.540
<v Speaker 1>See if you could pull that up Jamie.</v>

2227
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:33.000
<v Speaker 1>It's 1.8 million year old skull.</v>

2228
01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2229
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:34.613
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2230
01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:35.250
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2231
01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:38.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a really amazing find and um,</v>

2232
01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:43.440
<v Speaker 1>they found it in Georgia and the eastern Europe and it's the fifth such skull</v>

2233
01:04:43.441 --> 01:04:44.370
<v Speaker 1>from this region,</v>

2234
01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's 1.8 million years old.</v>

2235
01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>That's really old.</v>

2236
01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:49.291
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

2237
01:04:49.291 --> 01:04:50.124
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2238
01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.230
<v Speaker 1>that is a,</v>

2239
01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:52.113
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

2240
01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:53.431
<v Speaker 1>Let me see what they have.</v>

2241
01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Any still images of it,</v>

2242
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.991
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2243
01:04:57.991 --> 01:04:58.501
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2244
01:04:58.501 --> 01:04:59.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2245
01:04:59.100 --> 01:04:59.311
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2246
01:04:59.311 --> 01:05:00.420
<v Speaker 1>they're completely,</v>

2247
01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>it's thrown a gigantic monkey wrench into our timeline of,</v>

2248
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.270
<v Speaker 1>of human evolution.</v>

2249
01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:09.660
<v Speaker 1>They found stone tools and cut marks on animal bones,</v>

2250
01:05:09.661 --> 01:05:13.860
<v Speaker 1>which indicates that the hominids were actively involved in meat processing.</v>

2251
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.600
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing,</v>

2252
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:16.463
<v Speaker 1>but is it a,</v>

2253
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>is it a recognizable species</v>

2254
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.460
<v Speaker 4>of early man has quite prominent brow ridges?</v>

2255
01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:22.810
<v Speaker 4>It's um,</v>

2256
01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:23.321
<v Speaker 4>well it's,</v>

2257
01:05:23.321 --> 01:05:25.030
<v Speaker 4>it's some sort of early man,</v>

2258
01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:25.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2259
01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.410
<v Speaker 4>what they're calling it.</v>

2260
01:05:26.411 --> 01:05:27.131
<v Speaker 4>Let's see what they,</v>

2261
01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:27.880
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2262
01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:28.840
<v Speaker 4>what they're calling it.</v>

2263
01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.090
<v Speaker 4>They haven't,</v>

2264
01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:32.770
<v Speaker 4>it hasn't received a name yet.</v>

2265
01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.930
<v Speaker 4>Have they wanted to kill Lucy?</v>

2266
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:35.680
<v Speaker 4>And any idea about the size of the brain?</v>

2267
01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.060
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2268
01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:37.960
<v Speaker 4>that's a good question.</v>

2269
01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:39.250
<v Speaker 4>They're calling it</v>

2270
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>golf five.</v>

2271
01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.010
<v Speaker 1>It says your skull five is different,</v>

2272
01:05:42.011 --> 01:05:42.671
<v Speaker 1>different even in the,</v>

2273
01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:46.560
<v Speaker 1>for the skulls found in a demand to seize the name.</v>

2274
01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:51.740
<v Speaker 1>The area is found a 2005 and completely and ultimately matched at jaw found in</v>

2275
01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>2000 to make a complete skull.</v>

2276
01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:55.480
<v Speaker 1>After eight years of study,</v>

2277
01:05:55.481 --> 01:05:59.150
<v Speaker 1>scientists on Thursday published a paper in the Journal of Science revealing</v>

2278
01:05:59.151 --> 01:06:00.100
<v Speaker 1>that skull five.</v>

2279
01:06:00.101 --> 01:06:02.440
<v Speaker 1>It's simply not that different from others.</v>

2280
01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:07.720
<v Speaker 1>The five demand demand Hussey individuals are no more different from each other</v>

2281
01:06:07.721 --> 01:06:09.850
<v Speaker 1>than any five modern humans.</v>

2282
01:06:09.851 --> 01:06:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Or chimpanzees said,</v>

2283
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:12.670
<v Speaker 1>neurobiologists blah,</v>

2284
01:06:12.671 --> 01:06:12.791
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2285
01:06:12.791 --> 01:06:13.624
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

2286
01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:14.781
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

2287
01:06:14.781 --> 01:06:18.610
<v Speaker 1>the brain case itself is very small around the third of the size of modern</v>

2288
01:06:18.611 --> 01:06:19.051
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>

2289
01:06:19.051 --> 01:06:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2290
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.641
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2291
01:06:19.641 --> 01:06:22.790
<v Speaker 4>And at the same time or for quite large?</v>

2292
01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:24.110
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2293
01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:24.291
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2294
01:06:24.291 --> 01:06:24.501
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2295
01:06:24.501 --> 01:06:25.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>

2296
01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure I'd need to read it.</v>

2297
01:06:26.511 --> 01:06:29.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure how much that changes history.</v>

2298
01:06:29.361 --> 01:06:29.601
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2299
01:06:29.601 --> 01:06:32.300
<v Speaker 4>we know that there were human species around one,</v>

2300
01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.650
<v Speaker 4>1.8,</v>

2301
01:06:33.651 --> 01:06:34.770
<v Speaker 4>1.9 the,</v>

2302
01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:38.930
<v Speaker 4>our ancestors were making tools two and a half million years ago.</v>

2303
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:39.381
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2304
01:06:39.381 --> 01:06:40.191
<v Speaker 4>so this is,</v>

2305
01:06:40.191 --> 01:06:41.000
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2306
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.260
<v Speaker 4>this is well within that,</v>

2307
01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:42.531
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2308
01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:43.700
<v Speaker 4>within the time frame,</v>

2309
01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:48.350
<v Speaker 4>I think what maybe what it's showing us is that there've been many lines of</v>

2310
01:06:48.351 --> 01:06:49.100
<v Speaker 4>human,</v>

2311
01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:49.700
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2312
01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:50.060
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

2313
01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:51.320
<v Speaker 4>down through the ages and like,</v>

2314
01:06:51.321 --> 01:06:53.470
<v Speaker 4>like this one that they called the Hobbit,</v>

2315
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.751
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2316
01:06:53.751 --> 01:06:55.160
<v Speaker 4>Florida into tiny little creature,</v>

2317
01:06:55.161 --> 01:06:59.540
<v Speaker 4>which lived until 18 or 16,000 years ago and florists in,</v>

2318
01:06:59.541 --> 01:07:00.710
<v Speaker 4>in Indonesia.</v>

2319
01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:01.940
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2320
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:04.490
<v Speaker 4>that was completely unpredicted as well.</v>

2321
01:07:04.491 --> 01:07:09.491
<v Speaker 4>Then maybe there'd been many human types and we don't know where we actually</v>

2322
01:07:09.681 --> 01:07:10.880
<v Speaker 4>come from in this whole,</v>

2323
01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:11.870
<v Speaker 4>in this whole picture.</v>

2324
01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:12.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2325
01:07:12.411 --> 01:07:16.390
<v Speaker 1>These last hominids that they keep discovering like homo floresiensis and like</v>

2326
01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:20.650
<v Speaker 1>that a Russian one that they found that was a basically 40,000</v>

2327
01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.270
<v Speaker 4>is all the completely different,</v>

2328
01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.220
<v Speaker 4>completely defeat the Soviet.</v>

2329
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:25.000
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2330
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:25.751
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating,</v>

2331
01:07:25.751 --> 01:07:26.800
<v Speaker 4>fascinating stuff.</v>

2332
01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:28.480
<v Speaker 4>And 40,000 years ago,</v>

2333
01:07:28.481 --> 01:07:30.040
<v Speaker 4>a blink of an eye blink of an eye.</v>

2334
01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:30.620
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

2335
01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:30.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2336
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:32.650
<v Speaker 4>just a completely different type of human.</v>

2337
01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:33.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2338
01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:33.680
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2339
01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:33.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2340
01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:34.430
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2341
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:37.270
<v Speaker 4>what it adds up to is the realization that we know nothing.</v>

2342
01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:37.850
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>

2343
01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:38.110
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2344
01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:38.370
<v Speaker 4>we'd,</v>

2345
01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:39.280
<v Speaker 4>we know very little.</v>

2346
01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:40.750
<v Speaker 4>We come out of mystery,</v>

2347
01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:44.020
<v Speaker 4>we live in mystery and we end in mystery.</v>

2348
01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.910
<v Speaker 4>Have you heard of the Orang?</v>

2349
01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:47.250
<v Speaker 4>Pendek yes.</v>

2350
01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.610
<v Speaker 4>This is cryptozoology.</v>

2351
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:49.770
<v Speaker 4>What Lazier.</v>

2352
01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.480
<v Speaker 4>That's what my wife comes from Malaysia and they,</v>

2353
01:07:52.481 --> 01:07:55.550
<v Speaker 4>and it's a kind of Yeti Malaysian Yeti or Malaysia and big foot.</v>

2354
01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:56.830
<v Speaker 4>It's tiny,</v>

2355
01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:57.160
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2356
01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:57.790
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

2357
01:07:57.790 --> 01:07:58.481
<v Speaker 4>but it's a,</v>

2358
01:07:58.481 --> 01:08:00.550
<v Speaker 4>it's a wild creature man,</v>

2359
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:02.920
<v Speaker 4>like creature that lives into the lives in the woods.</v>

2360
01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:03.161
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2361
01:08:03.161 --> 01:08:06.240
<v Speaker 4>very similar to Homo Floria and homophobia is,</v>

2362
01:08:06.241 --> 01:08:10.780
<v Speaker 4>and so the suggestion is Orang Pendek is homo floresiensis or whatever it's</v>

2363
01:08:10.781 --> 01:08:11.110
<v Speaker 4>called.</v>

2364
01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:12.010
<v Speaker 4>He's still alive,</v>

2365
01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.400
<v Speaker 4>hanging out in the world.</v>

2366
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:15.620
<v Speaker 4>It would sound ridiculous.</v>

2367
01:08:15.621 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 4>But this</v>

2368
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:16.820
<v Speaker 3>homo,</v>

2369
01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:17.451
<v Speaker 3>what it was called,</v>

2370
01:08:17.451 --> 01:08:17.721
<v Speaker 3>Hobbit,</v>

2371
01:08:17.721 --> 01:08:17.931
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2372
01:08:17.931 --> 01:08:20.120
<v Speaker 3>this hobbit man was only 13,</v>

2373
01:08:20.121 --> 01:08:21.260
<v Speaker 3>14,000 years ago.</v>

2374
01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Very recently within the,</v>

2375
01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:25.430
<v Speaker 3>the span almost of human history.</v>

2376
01:08:25.431 --> 01:08:28.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean go Beckley Tappi and take you where I've just been as 12,000 plus years</v>

2377
01:08:28.881 --> 01:08:29.090
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

2378
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2379
01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:30.320
<v Speaker 3>Making these massive,</v>

2380
01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:32.360
<v Speaker 3>great megalithic pillars there.</v>

2381
01:08:33.230 --> 01:08:35.630
<v Speaker 3>So this creature on Flores is,</v>

2382
01:08:35.631 --> 01:08:36.260
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2383
01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:37.130
<v Speaker 3>just that period,</v>

2384
01:08:37.131 --> 01:08:37.790
<v Speaker 3>just the same,</v>

2385
01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:38.481
<v Speaker 3>the same age as that.</v>

2386
01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:39.314
<v Speaker 3>So the world was,</v>

2387
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:40.460
<v Speaker 3>was filled with,</v>

2388
01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:42.440
<v Speaker 3>with all kinds of different creatures.</v>

2389
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:43.460
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

2390
01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.470
<v Speaker 3>on talking about Indonesia,</v>

2391
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to Indonesia on the 3rd of December,</v>

2392
01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:49.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2393
01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:52.880
<v Speaker 3>because there's been a new site or rather an old site,</v>

2394
01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:55.280
<v Speaker 3>which has been radically redated in Indonesia,</v>

2395
01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:57.710
<v Speaker 3>which is called Gunung Padang,</v>

2396
01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.150
<v Speaker 3>not that far from florists.</v>

2397
01:08:59.151 --> 01:09:00.050
<v Speaker 3>As a matter of fact,</v>

2398
01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:00.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2399
01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.540
<v Speaker 3>it's a megalithic site with,</v>

2400
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:02.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2401
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.510
<v Speaker 3>with gigantic basle columns.</v>

2402
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.501
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2403
01:09:06.501 --> 01:09:06.621
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2404
01:09:06.621 --> 01:09:10.130
<v Speaker 3>this place has been known since the early 20th century,</v>

2405
01:09:10.131 --> 01:09:12.590
<v Speaker 3>thought to be about three or 4,000 years old.</v>

2406
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:15.740
<v Speaker 3>But there's an Australian geologists called Danny Hilman,</v>

2407
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:19.490
<v Speaker 3>who's been working for the Indonesian government on a site survey for the last</v>

2408
01:09:19.491 --> 01:09:20.031
<v Speaker 3>five years.</v>

2409
01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:23.900
<v Speaker 3>And he's just in the last month or two come out with this explosive finding that</v>

2410
01:09:23.901 --> 01:09:27.620
<v Speaker 3>he thinks this site is possibly as much as 20,000 years old,</v>

2411
01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.510
<v Speaker 3>which a Megalithic site,</v>

2412
01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:30.620
<v Speaker 3>20,000 years old.</v>

2413
01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:32.570
<v Speaker 3>That completely rewrites history.</v>

2414
01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:33.051
<v Speaker 3>Go back,</v>

2415
01:09:33.051 --> 01:09:35.000
<v Speaker 3>leave Tapi already pretty much rewrites history.</v>

2416
01:09:35.001 --> 01:09:37.220
<v Speaker 3>But this place in Indonesia totally does it.</v>

2417
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:38.780
<v Speaker 3>And when you take the two together,</v>

2418
01:09:38.781 --> 01:09:39.410
<v Speaker 3>so I'm,</v>

2419
01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:41.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go out and take a look at that site and meet Danny Hilman.</v>

2420
01:09:41.721 --> 01:09:42.590
<v Speaker 3>What is the name of it again?</v>

2421
01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:43.870
<v Speaker 3>Can you spell Pedang?</v>

2422
01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2423
01:09:44.650 --> 01:09:45.410
<v Speaker 3>good on padding.</v>

2424
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:47.270
<v Speaker 3>I may be able to show you a picture of it.</v>

2425
01:09:48.370 --> 01:09:48.740
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

2426
01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:49.311
<v Speaker 3>Put it up right?</v>

2427
01:09:49.311 --> 01:09:50.091
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be padding.</v>

2428
01:09:50.091 --> 01:09:50.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2429
01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:51.320
<v Speaker 3>that is totally good.</v>

2430
01:09:51.321 --> 01:09:52.130
<v Speaker 3>And padding.</v>

2431
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:53.030
<v Speaker 3>I used that picture.</v>

2432
01:09:53.031 --> 01:09:57.890
<v Speaker 3>So all these stones and what made them date this to 20,000 years?</v>

2433
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:58.641
<v Speaker 3>What was the chase?</v>

2434
01:09:58.641 --> 01:10:02.450
<v Speaker 3>So the previous dating has just been based on the surface layers and Danny</v>

2435
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:06.350
<v Speaker 3>Hilleman and his team had been down deep into this manmade hill on on top of</v>

2436
01:10:06.351 --> 01:10:08.360
<v Speaker 3>which the surface layer stand and they've,</v>

2437
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:11.480
<v Speaker 3>and they've gone all the way down and they're finding big megaliths right down</v>

2438
01:10:11.481 --> 01:10:15.530
<v Speaker 3>at the bottom and they're finding associated carbon that that allows them to</v>

2439
01:10:15.531 --> 01:10:17.330
<v Speaker 3>date it to up to 20,000 years old.</v>

2440
01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.070
<v Speaker 3>So this is a,</v>

2441
01:10:19.071 --> 01:10:21.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a real huge game changer that was taking place there.</v>

2442
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:22.790
<v Speaker 3>So when they dated,</v>

2443
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:25.130
<v Speaker 3>when they carbon dated down to 20,000 years old,</v>

2444
01:10:25.131 --> 01:10:26.540
<v Speaker 3>is it based on organic material?</v>

2445
01:10:26.541 --> 01:10:27.200
<v Speaker 3>That has to be,</v>

2446
01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.270
<v Speaker 3>you can't cause you can't date,</v>

2447
01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.270
<v Speaker 3>you can't date stone,</v>

2448
01:10:29.271 --> 01:10:33.890
<v Speaker 3>but what you do is you get into undisturbed layers deep down in that manmade</v>

2449
01:10:33.891 --> 01:10:35.690
<v Speaker 3>hill that we're looking at on the screen right now,</v>

2450
01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:39.020
<v Speaker 3>you get down into undisturbed layers where you're finding megaliths at the</v>

2451
01:10:39.021 --> 01:10:39.741
<v Speaker 3>bottom covered,</v>

2452
01:10:39.741 --> 01:10:40.461
<v Speaker 3>covered by earth,</v>

2453
01:10:40.461 --> 01:10:42.410
<v Speaker 3>being covered by earth for 20,000 years.</v>

2454
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:44.840
<v Speaker 3>And amongst that earth is organic material,</v>

2455
01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:46.100
<v Speaker 3>fragments of bone,</v>

2456
01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.620
<v Speaker 3>fragments of charcoal that you can date with carbon dating.</v>

2457
01:10:48.621 --> 01:10:52.700
<v Speaker 3>So you can then say that those megaliths are at least that old,</v>

2458
01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:53.451
<v Speaker 3>at least,</v>

2459
01:10:53.451 --> 01:10:54.650
<v Speaker 3>at least most likely,</v>

2460
01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:55.250
<v Speaker 3>much older,</v>

2461
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:56.420
<v Speaker 3>maybe much older than that,</v>

2462
01:10:56.421 --> 01:10:57.620
<v Speaker 3>but they're at least that old.</v>

2463
01:10:57.621 --> 01:11:01.910
<v Speaker 3>And the weird thing with this that this place has in common with Gabelli Tapi is</v>

2464
01:11:01.911 --> 01:11:03.920
<v Speaker 3>that both of them are manmade hills,</v>

2465
01:11:03.921 --> 01:11:07.970
<v Speaker 3>which appeared to have had some kind of deliberate burial of the earlier layers,</v>

2466
01:11:07.971 --> 01:11:08.360
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

2467
01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:08.750
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

2468
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:09.830
<v Speaker 3>like a time capsule show.</v>

2469
01:11:09.831 --> 01:11:10.700
<v Speaker 3>I get this feeling that,</v>

2470
01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:11.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2471
01:11:11.421 --> 01:11:12.440
<v Speaker 3>stuff is um,</v>

2472
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:13.680
<v Speaker 3>stuff is out.</v>

2473
01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2474
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.510
<v Speaker 3>stuff is a stuff is coming out into the open that's been been suppressed for a</v>

2475
01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:19.201
<v Speaker 3>long time or,</v>

2476
01:11:19.201 --> 01:11:20.490
<v Speaker 3>or ignored or just not,</v>

2477
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:21.990
<v Speaker 3>not reckoned with for a very,</v>

2478
01:11:21.991 --> 01:11:22.920
<v Speaker 3>for a very long time.</v>

2479
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:23.251
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2480
01:11:23.251 --> 01:11:27.570
<v Speaker 3>go back Lee tabby was a real game changer because that was the first time that</v>

2481
01:11:27.571 --> 01:11:32.400
<v Speaker 3>they had found anything that you had to date back to at least 12,000 years.</v>

2482
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:33.360
<v Speaker 3>Go back,</v>

2483
01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.500
<v Speaker 3>go back to the happy is really,</v>

2484
01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:35.431
<v Speaker 3>really important.</v>

2485
01:11:35.431 --> 01:11:36.210
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I was,</v>

2486
01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:40.980
<v Speaker 3>I was glad to be able to go there in September and spent a lot of time just</v>

2487
01:11:40.981 --> 01:11:43.380
<v Speaker 3>gently getting to getting to know this site.</v>

2488
01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:44.243
<v Speaker 3>The reason,</v>

2489
01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:48.990
<v Speaker 3>the reason it's important is because it was deliberately buried.</v>

2490
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:50.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2491
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:50.741
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2492
01:11:50.741 --> 01:11:52.440
<v Speaker 3>and what it raises is,</v>

2493
01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:52.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2494
01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.470
<v Speaker 3>I just want to show you this cover from New Scientist magazine.</v>

2495
01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:56.131
<v Speaker 3>Can we,</v>

2496
01:11:56.131 --> 01:11:56.964
<v Speaker 3>can we show this?</v>

2497
01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:58.133
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2498
01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.213
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

2499
01:11:59.330 --> 01:12:01.530
<v Speaker 3>The true dawn that we get that up there.</v>

2500
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:01.791
<v Speaker 3>We'll,</v>

2501
01:12:01.791 --> 01:12:03.570
<v Speaker 3>we'll pull it up or have Jamie pull it up.</v>

2502
01:12:03.571 --> 01:12:06.360
<v Speaker 3>Civilization is older and more mysterious than we thought.</v>

2503
01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:06.781
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2504
01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:07.614
<v Speaker 3>New Systems,</v>

2505
01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:11.160
<v Speaker 3>New Scientist magazine in the beginning of October,</v>

2506
01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.120
<v Speaker 3>2013 now new scientists was,</v>

2507
01:12:12.121 --> 01:12:16.990
<v Speaker 3>what are the magazines that attacked me massively back in 1995 when I publish</v>

2508
01:12:16.991 --> 01:12:20.250
<v Speaker 3>fingerprints of the Gods and what did I say is in fingerprints of the gods.</v>

2509
01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.420
<v Speaker 3>Civilization is much older and much more mysterious than we thought and now they</v>

2510
01:12:24.421 --> 01:12:25.470
<v Speaker 3>come out with this cover,</v>

2511
01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:25.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2512
01:12:25.801 --> 01:12:27.150
<v Speaker 3>so I got to feel a certain,</v>

2513
01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:28.440
<v Speaker 3>a certain feeling of,</v>

2514
01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:28.660
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2515
01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:29.010
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

2516
01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:30.240
<v Speaker 3>Almost smugness.</v>

2517
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:30.880
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2518
01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:31.713
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2519
01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.000
<v Speaker 3>You can hear your voice.</v>

2520
01:12:33.001 --> 01:12:33.870
<v Speaker 3>You just get all giddy.</v>

2521
01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:34.793
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>

2522
01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:36.450
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to see them doing that.</v>

2523
01:12:36.451 --> 01:12:39.240
<v Speaker 3>And the reason they're saying that is I've got a lot to do with Rebecca tappy</v>

2524
01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:40.171
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

2525
01:12:40.171 --> 01:12:42.120
<v Speaker 3>because go Beckley Tapi is that,</v>

2526
01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:44.410
<v Speaker 3>it's something completely unpredicted that,</v>

2527
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:48.270
<v Speaker 3>that what are supposed to be a hunter gatherers at the end of the Upper</v>

2528
01:12:48.271 --> 01:12:52.650
<v Speaker 3>Paleolithic or not supposed to have the kind of organizational skills,</v>

2529
01:12:52.651 --> 01:12:56.790
<v Speaker 3>the architectural skills to put together gigantic megalithic circles.</v>

2530
01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:57.990
<v Speaker 3>There's one of the,</v>

2531
01:12:58.050 --> 01:13:00.870
<v Speaker 3>one of the pillows that I went and took a look at,</v>

2532
01:13:00.871 --> 01:13:01.480
<v Speaker 3>which they didn't,</v>

2533
01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:04.500
<v Speaker 3>they never removed it from the quarry because they found a fault in it.</v>

2534
01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2535
01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.690
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't that they couldn't remove it,</v>

2536
01:13:06.691 --> 01:13:07.590
<v Speaker 3>they found a fault in it,</v>

2537
01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:10.710
<v Speaker 3>and that one weighs more than fifth 50 tons,</v>

2538
01:13:10.711 --> 01:13:11.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2539
01:13:11.011 --> 01:13:11.391
<v Speaker 3>as a judge.</v>

2540
01:13:11.391 --> 01:13:13.110
<v Speaker 3>Just a gigantic piece of stone.</v>

2541
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:15.450
<v Speaker 3>And the other intriguing thing about correctly,</v>

2542
01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.480
<v Speaker 3>Tefi is a,</v>

2543
01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.890
<v Speaker 3>which I learned from plush Schmidt when I was talking to him,</v>

2544
01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.900
<v Speaker 3>is they've done ground penetrating radar.</v>

2545
01:13:21.901 --> 01:13:23.340
<v Speaker 3>So right now when you go to the side,</v>

2546
01:13:23.341 --> 01:13:28.341
<v Speaker 3>you see for substantial stone circles on the scale of Stonehenge above ground</v>

2547
01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.000
<v Speaker 3>because you put the microphone costs,</v>

2548
01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:31.213
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

2549
01:13:32.150 --> 01:13:32.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2550
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:33.120
<v Speaker 3>when you go,</v>

2551
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.410
<v Speaker 3>when you go to go back to the Tempe,</v>

2552
01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:35.101
<v Speaker 3>now you see it,</v>

2553
01:13:35.101 --> 01:13:36.810
<v Speaker 3>you see a group of stone circles,</v>

2554
01:13:36.811 --> 01:13:37.740
<v Speaker 3>four of them above,</v>

2555
01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:38.603
<v Speaker 3>above ground.</v>

2556
01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.533
<v Speaker 3>There it is there.</v>

2557
01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:40.290
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2558
01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:40.741
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2559
01:13:40.741 --> 01:13:41.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2560
01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:42.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2561
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.350
<v Speaker 3>what they've done is they've done ground penetrating radar over the site and</v>

2562
01:13:46.351 --> 01:13:50.820
<v Speaker 3>they found that at least 20 times as many stone circles are still underground</v>

2563
01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:53.490
<v Speaker 3>and possibly as many as 50 times as many.</v>

2564
01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:55.680
<v Speaker 3>So it's a just a gigantic site.</v>

2565
01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:56.340
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2566
01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:00.270
<v Speaker 3>and why it's important is that whoever made it 12,000 years ago,</v>

2567
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.760
<v Speaker 3>deliberately buried it 2000 years later,</v>

2568
01:14:02.761 --> 01:14:03.780
<v Speaker 3>10,000 years ago.</v>

2569
01:14:03.781 --> 01:14:08.781
<v Speaker 3>So that meant that the carbon dating record has not been contaminated by later</v>

2570
01:14:09.121 --> 01:14:09.954
<v Speaker 3>cultures.</v>

2571
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:13.120
<v Speaker 3>It's a perfect pristine time capsule.</v>

2572
01:14:13.150 --> 01:14:14.290
<v Speaker 3>And Lo and behold,</v>

2573
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:17.500
<v Speaker 3>the date that it prints out is 12,000 years old.</v>

2574
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2575
01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:22.540
<v Speaker 3>now that then raises questions over lots of other megalithic sites all over the</v>

2576
01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:22.841
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

2577
01:14:22.841 --> 01:14:25.300
<v Speaker 3>which have been contaminated by later cultures.</v>

2578
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.880
<v Speaker 3>The megalithic sites of Malta,</v>

2579
01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:28.720
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2580
01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:31.090
<v Speaker 3>look very like go back the Tempe,</v>

2581
01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.250
<v Speaker 3>they look very likability.</v>

2582
01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:32.620
<v Speaker 3>Tempe,</v>

2583
01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:35.050
<v Speaker 3>but they're only supposed to be 5,000 years old.</v>

2584
01:14:35.051 --> 01:14:39.910
<v Speaker 3>I would now say we need to reconsider that evidence because those sites were</v>

2585
01:14:39.911 --> 01:14:41.290
<v Speaker 3>contaminated by later culture.</v>

2586
01:14:41.291 --> 01:14:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the carbon on which they were dated was introduced by a later culture.</v>

2587
01:14:44.591 --> 01:14:46.530
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it doesn't belong to the,</v>

2588
01:14:46.531 --> 01:14:49.000
<v Speaker 3>the period of the construction of the megaliths.</v>

2589
01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2590
01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:49.901
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2591
01:14:49.901 --> 01:14:50.740
<v Speaker 3>this alone,</v>

2592
01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:51.431
<v Speaker 3>this one,</v>

2593
01:14:51.431 --> 01:14:56.431
<v Speaker 3>discovery alone really is a huge game changer because now we know that people</v>

2594
01:14:56.441 --> 01:14:59.650
<v Speaker 3>were capable of doing something like that 12,000 years ago and,</v>

2595
01:14:59.660 --> 01:14:59.860
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2596
01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:00.191
<v Speaker 3>and not,</v>

2597
01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:03.280
<v Speaker 3>and not a task to be underestimated because you're,</v>

2598
01:15:03.281 --> 01:15:05.830
<v Speaker 3>you're in an area where there isn't a lot of water available.</v>

2599
01:15:05.831 --> 01:15:06.241
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

2600
01:15:06.241 --> 01:15:06.430
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2601
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:06.721
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2602
01:15:06.721 --> 01:15:08.350
<v Speaker 3>you're bringing in hundreds of people.</v>

2603
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:13.500
<v Speaker 3>You're organizing them into teams to construct these gigantic male ethics</v>

2604
01:15:13.591 --> 01:15:14.380
<v Speaker 3>circles.</v>

2605
01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:15.191
<v Speaker 3>You're feeding them,</v>

2606
01:15:15.191 --> 01:15:16.300
<v Speaker 3>you're watering them.</v>

2607
01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:16.841
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2608
01:15:16.841 --> 01:15:17.260
<v Speaker 3>your hat,</v>

2609
01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:18.640
<v Speaker 3>you have site planning and arrangement.</v>

2610
01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:22.390
<v Speaker 3>All of this is the kind of stuff that you expect much later in human history.</v>

2611
01:15:22.391 --> 01:15:24.220
<v Speaker 3>You don't expect it 12,000 years ago.</v>

2612
01:15:24.221 --> 01:15:25.690
<v Speaker 3>And it raises that big question,</v>

2613
01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:26.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2614
01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:27.123
<v Speaker 3>could there,</v>

2615
01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:28.690
<v Speaker 3>could there have been a lost civilization?</v>

2616
01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:29.950
<v Speaker 3>Could we be looking at the work,</v>

2617
01:15:29.951 --> 01:15:31.960
<v Speaker 3>perhaps of the survivors of a lost civilization?</v>

2618
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:34.960
<v Speaker 3>How do we know that they covered it intentionally?</v>

2619
01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:35.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2620
01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.350
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2621
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:38.020
<v Speaker 3>there's a deliberate infill,</v>

2622
01:15:38.021 --> 01:15:38.980
<v Speaker 3>the nature of the,</v>

2623
01:15:38.981 --> 01:15:40.900
<v Speaker 3>of the earth that's been put into it.</v>

2624
01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:44.770
<v Speaker 3>You can pretty much say here where people with spades pouring this earth in all</v>

2625
01:15:44.771 --> 01:15:47.920
<v Speaker 3>in one girl filling it in and amongst the earth there are bits,</v>

2626
01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:48.970
<v Speaker 3>they're fragments of bone,</v>

2627
01:15:48.971 --> 01:15:49.990
<v Speaker 3>there a fragrance of carbon.</v>

2628
01:15:49.991 --> 01:15:50.824
<v Speaker 3>And that's how they've,</v>

2629
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:51.850
<v Speaker 3>that's how they've dated it.</v>

2630
01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:52.331
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

2631
01:15:52.331 --> 01:15:53.164
<v Speaker 3>it's not a,</v>

2632
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.100
<v Speaker 3>it's not a natural sedimentation that built up over a long period of time.</v>

2633
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:58.031
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

2634
01:15:58.031 --> 01:16:01.870
<v Speaker 3>it's something that was done all at once in a planned and organized way.</v>

2635
01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:03.250
<v Speaker 3>So for some reason,</v>

2636
01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:04.320
<v Speaker 3>and the collage,</v>

2637
01:16:04.321 --> 01:16:04.620
<v Speaker 3>Schmidt,</v>

2638
01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:04.771
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2639
01:16:04.771 --> 01:16:07.740
<v Speaker 3>the German archaeologist who's running the site is not clear what this reason</v>

2640
01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:08.320
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

2641
01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.131
<v Speaker 3>For some reason,</v>

2642
01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:10.360
<v Speaker 3>whoever created this place,</v>

2643
01:16:10.361 --> 01:16:12.100
<v Speaker 3>decommissioned it at a certain point,</v>

2644
01:16:12.101 --> 01:16:13.360
<v Speaker 3>about 10,000 years ago,</v>

2645
01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:17.550
<v Speaker 3>they closed it down and then this is eerie.</v>

2646
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:18.820
<v Speaker 3>For the next 10,000 years,</v>

2647
01:16:18.821 --> 01:16:22.150
<v Speaker 3>it remained untouched and nobody went there and nobody,</v>

2648
01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.780
<v Speaker 3>nobody saw it back in the 50s.</v>

2649
01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Some American archeologists were attracted to the site,</v>

2650
01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:31.740
<v Speaker 3>they saw bits of cut stone lying on the surface and the cut stone was so good</v>

2651
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:33.730
<v Speaker 3>that they concluded it was recent.</v>

2652
01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:36.040
<v Speaker 3>They thought it must be from the Ottoman period,</v>

2653
01:16:36.041 --> 01:16:36.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2654
01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:36.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2655
01:16:36.791 --> 01:16:37.241
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

2656
01:16:37.241 --> 01:16:37.931
<v Speaker 3>1600,</v>

2657
01:16:37.931 --> 01:16:38.770
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2658
01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:39.431
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2659
01:16:39.431 --> 01:16:39.791
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2660
01:16:39.791 --> 01:16:40.330
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

2661
01:16:40.330 --> 01:16:41.230
<v Speaker 3>they ignored it.</v>

2662
01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:44.640
<v Speaker 3>And it was a really a lucky turn of the spade by Klaus Schmidt,</v>

2663
01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:44.851
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2664
01:16:44.851 --> 01:16:47.530
<v Speaker 3>this German archeologists that revealed that that's not the case at all.</v>

2665
01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:50.800
<v Speaker 3>And that these are 12,000 year old megalithic pillars.</v>

2666
01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.750
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>

2667
01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:57.640
<v Speaker 3>so we have this incredible innovation in architecture taking place,</v>

2668
01:16:58.090 --> 01:16:59.800
<v Speaker 3>stone circles on the scale of Stonehenge,</v>

2669
01:16:59.801 --> 01:17:04.500
<v Speaker 3>but 7,000 years earlier than Stonehenge being created it correctly Tempe.</v>

2670
01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:05.560
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>

2671
01:17:05.561 --> 01:17:08.320
<v Speaker 3>mysteriously agriculture starts to appear in that area.</v>

2672
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:11.540
<v Speaker 3>There hasn't been agriculture there before or anywhere so far as we know.</v>

2673
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:13.700
<v Speaker 3>And suddenly it starts to appear there.</v>

2674
01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:15.500
<v Speaker 3>Domesticating cattle there,</v>

2675
01:17:15.501 --> 01:17:17.750
<v Speaker 3>domesticating wheat,</v>

2676
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.291
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2677
01:17:18.291 --> 01:17:18.621
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2678
01:17:18.621 --> 01:17:19.071
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2679
01:17:19.071 --> 01:17:19.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2680
01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:19.881
<v Speaker 3>beginning.</v>

2681
01:17:19.881 --> 01:17:21.860
<v Speaker 3>This is the beginning of the agricultural revolution.</v>

2682
01:17:21.861 --> 01:17:23.390
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a center of innovation,</v>

2683
01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:24.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2684
01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:24.501
<v Speaker 3>that we do it,</v>

2685
01:17:24.501 --> 01:17:27.830
<v Speaker 3>that we're doing something unique as far as we know in human history,</v>

2686
01:17:27.831 --> 01:17:28.850
<v Speaker 3>in terms of architecture.</v>

2687
01:17:28.851 --> 01:17:32.570
<v Speaker 3>We're doing something unique in terms of economics producing the first,</v>

2688
01:17:32.571 --> 01:17:34.970
<v Speaker 3>the first agriculture and I,</v>

2689
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:36.990
<v Speaker 3>I can't help feeling that the,</v>

2690
01:17:36.991 --> 01:17:41.991
<v Speaker 3>that this thing happens so suddenly and in such an extraordinary way that maybe,</v>

2691
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.500
<v Speaker 3>maybe this is the,</v>

2692
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:45.590
<v Speaker 3>the missing link that we are looking at.</v>

2693
01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:48.410
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at the fingerprints of a lost civilization,</v>

2694
01:17:48.411 --> 01:17:52.580
<v Speaker 3>the survivors of a lost civilization who settled there with all these skills</v>

2695
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:57.610
<v Speaker 3>already in place and introduce them into the local culture because this period,</v>

2696
01:17:58.041 --> 01:18:02.870
<v Speaker 3>12,000 years ago plus is the period when the earth went through gigantic</v>

2697
01:18:02.871 --> 01:18:05.180
<v Speaker 3>cataclysmic events because it was struck by a comment.</v>

2698
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:05.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2699
01:18:05.961 --> 01:18:06.621
<v Speaker 1>And that's the,</v>

2700
01:18:06.621 --> 01:18:06.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2701
01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.420
<v Speaker 1>that's the other piece of the puzzle.</v>

2702
01:18:08.421 --> 01:18:10.760
<v Speaker 1>The nuclear glass that they've found.</v>

2703
01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.500
<v Speaker 1>How do you say to stop trying,</v>

2704
01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:13.910
<v Speaker 1>try night tight,</v>

2705
01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.670
<v Speaker 1>trinet tight trinet,</v>

2706
01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:21.190
<v Speaker 1>trinet tight and that they have found this stuff all over.</v>

2707
01:18:21.191 --> 01:18:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2708
01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Or Europe</v>

2709
01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:23.070
<v Speaker 3>and all over Asia,</v>

2710
01:18:23.071 --> 01:18:24.950
<v Speaker 3>all over the world at that precise,</v>

2711
01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:26.940
<v Speaker 3>precise 12,000 years ago,</v>

2712
01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:30.180
<v Speaker 3>layer of platinum in the Greenland ice cores.</v>

2713
01:18:30.181 --> 01:18:32.460
<v Speaker 3>All of this says Earth was hit by a,</v>

2714
01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:34.320
<v Speaker 3>by a comet at that,</v>

2715
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:35.183
<v Speaker 3>at that time.</v>

2716
01:18:35.370 --> 01:18:36.630
<v Speaker 3>Is that the Holocene?</v>

2717
01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:37.021
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2718
01:18:37.021 --> 01:18:37.950
<v Speaker 3>that's the beginning of this.</v>

2719
01:18:37.951 --> 01:18:38.611
<v Speaker 3>The end of the,</v>

2720
01:18:38.611 --> 01:18:39.870
<v Speaker 3>it's the beginning of the Holocene.</v>

2721
01:18:39.871 --> 01:18:42.770
<v Speaker 3>The Holocene is our period is the period we still live in now.</v>

2722
01:18:42.810 --> 01:18:43.271
<v Speaker 3>But it's the,</v>

2723
01:18:43.271 --> 01:18:45.180
<v Speaker 3>in in archeological terms,</v>

2724
01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:48.390
<v Speaker 3>it's the juncture between the Upper Paleolithic and the Neolithic.</v>

2725
01:18:48.670 --> 01:18:49.110
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2726
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.943
<v Speaker 3>that's what we're,</v>

2727
01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:51.450
<v Speaker 3>that's what we're talking about here.</v>

2728
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:52.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2729
01:18:52.410 --> 01:18:56.730
<v Speaker 3>and you have this episode that geologists called the younger Dryas,</v>

2730
01:18:56.970 --> 01:19:01.970
<v Speaker 3>which is an episode of a sudden a deep freeze strikes the earth.</v>

2731
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:06.450
<v Speaker 3>The earth has been emerging from the Ice Age until 12,980 years ago.</v>

2732
01:19:06.451 --> 01:19:07.021
<v Speaker 3>And Amazingly,</v>

2733
01:19:07.021 --> 01:19:09.930
<v Speaker 3>you can date it that precisely give or take five years.</v>

2734
01:19:09.931 --> 01:19:12.390
<v Speaker 3>This happened 12,980 years ago.</v>

2735
01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:16.500
<v Speaker 3>And then suddenly the earth flips into this thousand year deep freeze that</v>

2736
01:19:16.501 --> 01:19:21.501
<v Speaker 3>nobody's ever been able to explain before that they called the younger dryas.</v>

2737
01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:26.640
<v Speaker 3>And now we can say for sure that the younger dryas was caused by huge amounts of</v>

2738
01:19:26.641 --> 01:19:30.150
<v Speaker 3>dust being projected into the upper atmosphere of the earth by this comet</v>

2739
01:19:30.151 --> 01:19:30.984
<v Speaker 3>impact.</v>

2740
01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:35.580
<v Speaker 3>And that that dust in shrouded the whole earth and set in motion a kind of what</v>

2741
01:19:35.581 --> 01:19:37.290
<v Speaker 3>we would call a nuclear winter today,</v>

2742
01:19:37.530 --> 01:19:37.951
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

2743
01:19:37.951 --> 01:19:41.310
<v Speaker 3>where the sun's rays could no longer reach the earth and the earth went back</v>

2744
01:19:41.311 --> 01:19:42.780
<v Speaker 3>into a deep freeze.</v>

2745
01:19:42.781 --> 01:19:43.231
<v Speaker 3>And for me,</v>

2746
01:19:43.231 --> 01:19:45.780
<v Speaker 3>this is the smoking gun that lost us,</v>

2747
01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:46.680
<v Speaker 3>the whole civilization.</v>

2748
01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:47.550
<v Speaker 3>And I was just,</v>

2749
01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:47.661
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2750
01:19:47.661 --> 01:19:48.720
<v Speaker 3>yesterday I was,</v>

2751
01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:49.370
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2752
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:49.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2753
01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:54.300
<v Speaker 3>I've come here from North Carolina and I sat down with Randall Carlson who has</v>

2754
01:19:54.301 --> 01:19:54.541
<v Speaker 3>been a,</v>

2755
01:19:54.541 --> 01:19:54.990
<v Speaker 3>met him.</v>

2756
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:56.100
<v Speaker 3>You met Randall is very,</v>

2757
01:19:56.101 --> 01:19:59.820
<v Speaker 3>very fascinating man and he's been working away quietly on this subject for</v>

2758
01:19:59.821 --> 01:20:03.840
<v Speaker 3>years and years and years long before the evidence was in for a comment,</v>

2759
01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:05.880
<v Speaker 3>he was predicting that this is what caused it,</v>

2760
01:20:05.881 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 3>that there was a comment impact and got this very,</v>

2761
01:20:08.251 --> 01:20:09.420
<v Speaker 3>very fascinating theory.</v>

2762
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:11.190
<v Speaker 3>And he's going to take me next year on a,</v>

2763
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:12.300
<v Speaker 3>on a field trip,</v>

2764
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2765
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:16.050
<v Speaker 3>into the Pacific northwest and into Canada to look at,</v>

2766
01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:21.000
<v Speaker 3>to look at areas where there were these massive outflows of floods from the ice</v>

2767
01:20:21.001 --> 01:20:21.780
<v Speaker 3>cap.</v>

2768
01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:26.520
<v Speaker 3>And what Randall is suggesting is that that at least some large fragments of the</v>

2769
01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:30.810
<v Speaker 3>comic that hit the Earth 12,980 years ago actually hit the ice cap.</v>

2770
01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:32.550
<v Speaker 3>They landed on the ice cap,</v>

2771
01:20:32.551 --> 01:20:35.850
<v Speaker 3>which was still in a mile deep and they pulverize it.</v>

2772
01:20:35.851 --> 01:20:39.150
<v Speaker 3>They turned it into water immediately and that's why you have these gigantic</v>

2773
01:20:39.151 --> 01:20:39.841
<v Speaker 3>outburst floods,</v>

2774
01:20:39.841 --> 01:20:42.660
<v Speaker 3>which carried down huge boulders and strew them all over the,</v>

2775
01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:43.920
<v Speaker 3>all over the landscape is a very,</v>

2776
01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.450
<v Speaker 3>very exciting theory and it's,</v>

2777
01:20:45.451 --> 01:20:48.570
<v Speaker 3>and it's great to see Randall's work being being vindicated because he's been</v>

2778
01:20:48.571 --> 01:20:49.860
<v Speaker 3>ignored for far too long.</v>

2779
01:20:49.861 --> 01:20:50.360
<v Speaker 3>And I'm,</v>

2780
01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:53.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking forward to doing a fascinating field trip with him next next year.</v>

2781
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:56.270
<v Speaker 3>I met him in Georgia many years ago.</v>

2782
01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:59.640
<v Speaker 3>The punchline comedy club had a long and really interesting conversation</v>

2783
01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:03.360
<v Speaker 3>conversation about him with him rather about the Holocene comment.</v>

2784
01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:03.810
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2785
01:21:03.810 --> 01:21:03.961
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2786
01:21:03.961 --> 01:21:05.100
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what he's talking about.</v>

2787
01:21:05.101 --> 01:21:05.934
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

2788
01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:06.271
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2789
01:21:06.271 --> 01:21:10.470
<v Speaker 3>he's one of these guys who is just so far ahead of his time that nobody saw it.</v>

2790
01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Nobody,</v>

2791
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:12.360
<v Speaker 3>nobody realized what he was on.</v>

2792
01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:16.260
<v Speaker 3>Now everybody understands that the earth was hit by a comet and there's been a</v>

2793
01:21:16.261 --> 01:21:19.620
<v Speaker 3>big scientific argument about this over the last five or six years,</v>

2794
01:21:19.621 --> 01:21:20.730
<v Speaker 3>but it's really settled now.</v>

2795
01:21:20.731 --> 01:21:22.700
<v Speaker 3>The evidence that the all over the world is,</v>

2796
01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:24.420
<v Speaker 3>is clear that this happened.</v>

2797
01:21:24.421 --> 01:21:27.990
<v Speaker 3>But Randall was onto this years before anybody else and what he's done,</v>

2798
01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:29.880
<v Speaker 3>what he's also doing is just taking it,</v>

2799
01:21:29.881 --> 01:21:34.881
<v Speaker 3>taking it that bit further because we have these mysterious floods that occurred</v>

2800
01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.750
<v Speaker 3>in precisely that period,</v>

2801
01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:39.390
<v Speaker 3>which have traditionally been called outburst floods.</v>

2802
01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:41.010
<v Speaker 3>The idea was that,</v>

2803
01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2804
01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:42.660
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2805
01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:47.660
<v Speaker 3>the ice caps gradually melting down filled up these huge glacial lakes and that</v>

2806
01:21:48.091 --> 01:21:51.420
<v Speaker 3>eventually the ice dam in closing the grace place,</v>

2807
01:21:51.421 --> 01:21:52.620
<v Speaker 3>he'll lake would break.</v>

2808
01:21:52.890 --> 01:21:57.090
<v Speaker 3>But now it looks like we're looking at ice dams a thousand feet high in order to</v>

2809
01:21:57.091 --> 01:21:59.400
<v Speaker 3>account for the massive flow of water.</v>

2810
01:21:59.401 --> 01:22:02.190
<v Speaker 3>And what Randall suggesting is that that theory is actually wrong.</v>

2811
01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.280
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't the outburst floods from Grace Hill legs.</v>

2812
01:22:05.281 --> 01:22:09.330
<v Speaker 3>It was the comet hitting the ice cap that turned all that ice to water and</v>

2813
01:22:09.331 --> 01:22:12.960
<v Speaker 3>produce the gigantic gigantic outflows carrying down boulders,</v>

2814
01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:13.471
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2815
01:22:13.471 --> 01:22:17.910
<v Speaker 3>the size of houses and dumping them over the landscapes and,</v>

2816
01:22:17.911 --> 01:22:21.030
<v Speaker 3>and then you have to consider anything that lay in the way of those floods.</v>

2817
01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:24.720
<v Speaker 3>Anything that lay in the path of floods on that scale is gone,</v>

2818
01:22:24.930 --> 01:22:25.321
<v Speaker 3>gone,</v>

2819
01:22:25.321 --> 01:22:27.270
<v Speaker 3>completely wiped out from human memory.</v>

2820
01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:32.700
<v Speaker 3>And you also have to consider the fact that we absolutely know that these events</v>

2821
01:22:32.701 --> 01:22:34.800
<v Speaker 3>have taken place in a much greater scale.</v>

2822
01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Over the course of the earth has been mass extinction events.</v>

2823
01:22:37.531 --> 01:22:38.040
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>

2824
01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:39.600
<v Speaker 3>this is not preposterous.</v>

2825
01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:40.680
<v Speaker 3>There's not proposed to Roger.</v>

2826
01:22:40.810 --> 01:22:45.810
<v Speaker 3>It's completely logical and it's time that historians and archeologists</v>

2827
01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:50.970
<v Speaker 3>abandoned the model that everything just proceed smoothly and gently in the way</v>

2828
01:22:50.971 --> 01:22:53.370
<v Speaker 3>that we've seen it doing for the last few hundred years,</v>

2829
01:22:53.371 --> 01:22:55.690
<v Speaker 3>which is called uniformitarianism and it,</v>

2830
01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:59.490
<v Speaker 3>and embrace the thought that that cataclysmic events are a key part of the</v>

2831
01:22:59.491 --> 01:23:00.390
<v Speaker 3>history of the earth.</v>

2832
01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:00.681
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2833
01:23:00.681 --> 01:23:02.730
<v Speaker 3>and we should know this already,</v>

2834
01:23:02.731 --> 01:23:04.680
<v Speaker 3>there's massive amount of evidence for it.</v>

2835
01:23:04.681 --> 01:23:05.080
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

2836
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:08.410
<v Speaker 3>it's not something we even need to argue about by history proceeds on the basis</v>

2837
01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:10.690
<v Speaker 3>that there is no such thing as a cataclysm.</v>

2838
01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:11.651
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2839
01:23:11.651 --> 01:23:14.230
<v Speaker 3>it's cataclysms that have written the story of human history.</v>

2840
01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:14.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2841
01:23:14.551 --> 01:23:15.301
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

2842
01:23:15.301 --> 01:23:18.630
<v Speaker 1>when you stop and look at all the ancient stories of the epic,</v>

2843
01:23:18.631 --> 01:23:19.411
<v Speaker 1>of Gilgamesh,</v>

2844
01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:20.101
<v Speaker 1>the Bible,</v>

2845
01:23:20.101 --> 01:23:21.510
<v Speaker 1>the flood of the art.</v>

2846
01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:22.111
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2847
01:23:22.111 --> 01:23:27.111
<v Speaker 1>There's so many stories and involve cataclysmic events about floods and</v>

2848
01:23:27.121 --> 01:23:30.930
<v Speaker 1>cataclysms the idea that those are just fiction has kind of sits totally.</v>

2849
01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:34.140
<v Speaker 3>He totally crazy and they all say that this is a,</v>

2850
01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:37.290
<v Speaker 3>that there was a golden age,</v>

2851
01:23:37.291 --> 01:23:38.490
<v Speaker 3>that there was a former,</v>

2852
01:23:38.730 --> 01:23:40.630
<v Speaker 3>that there was a former civilization that,</v>

2853
01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:42.210
<v Speaker 3>that mankind had had,</v>

2854
01:23:42.211 --> 01:23:46.770
<v Speaker 3>had attained to a very high level and then we angered the gods.</v>

2855
01:23:46.771 --> 01:23:48.000
<v Speaker 3>It's often put that way.</v>

2856
01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:48.610
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

2857
01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:49.441
<v Speaker 3>we angered the gods,</v>

2858
01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:51.240
<v Speaker 3>we fell out of harmony with the universe.</v>

2859
01:23:51.241 --> 01:23:51.811
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>

2860
01:23:51.811 --> 01:23:52.260
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2861
01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:53.310
<v Speaker 3>something went wrong.</v>

2862
01:23:53.311 --> 01:23:54.930
<v Speaker 3>There was some kind of moral,</v>

2863
01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:55.141
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2864
01:23:55.141 --> 01:23:55.351
<v Speaker 3>please.</v>

2865
01:23:55.351 --> 01:23:56.110
<v Speaker 3>I would love some of that.</v>

2866
01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:56.943
<v Speaker 3>This is Phil.</v>

2867
01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:57.390
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2868
01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:57.920
<v Speaker 3>That one,</v>

2869
01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:00.240
<v Speaker 3>there was some kind of moral decline.</v>

2870
01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Like now,</v>

2871
01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:01.650
<v Speaker 3>like now,</v>

2872
01:24:01.650 --> 01:24:02.730
<v Speaker 3>like now this is what I,</v>

2873
01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:03.150
<v Speaker 3>what I,</v>

2874
01:24:03.150 --> 01:24:04.370
<v Speaker 3>I often say that if,</v>

2875
01:24:04.371 --> 01:24:08.670
<v Speaker 3>if I were to look at our civilization in myths and mythical terms,</v>

2876
01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:12.300
<v Speaker 3>there's never been a civilization that looked more like the next lost</v>

2877
01:24:12.301 --> 01:24:13.410
<v Speaker 3>civilization than ours.</v>

2878
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:15.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to spread gloom and doom.</v>

2879
01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in spreading gloom and doom.</v>

2880
01:24:17.311 --> 01:24:18.900
<v Speaker 3>I think we should think positive.</v>

2881
01:24:18.901 --> 01:24:19.770
<v Speaker 3>And I have said earlier,</v>

2882
01:24:19.771 --> 01:24:19.911
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

2883
01:24:19.911 --> 01:24:20.850
<v Speaker 3>and I maintained this,</v>

2884
01:24:20.851 --> 01:24:22.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm very optimistic about the future of the human race,</v>

2885
01:24:22.861 --> 01:24:25.800
<v Speaker 3>but let's not pretend that it's all roses in the garden.</v>

2886
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:28.170
<v Speaker 3>There's a terrible things are happening in the world today.</v>

2887
01:24:28.171 --> 01:24:33.090
<v Speaker 3>We have an unbelievable arrogance and unbelievable pride,</v>

2888
01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:34.170
<v Speaker 3>cruelty,</v>

2889
01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:34.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2890
01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:34.870
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2891
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:35.011
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2892
01:24:35.011 --> 01:24:39.330
<v Speaker 3>an economic model that makes millions mean countless millions,</v>

2893
01:24:39.331 --> 01:24:40.350
<v Speaker 3>incredibly poor,</v>

2894
01:24:40.351 --> 01:24:41.460
<v Speaker 3>and allows tiny,</v>

2895
01:24:41.461 --> 01:24:43.170
<v Speaker 3>tiny numbers to be incredibly,</v>

2896
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:44.550
<v Speaker 3>obscenely rich.</v>

2897
01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:45.151
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2898
01:24:45.151 --> 01:24:45.421
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2899
01:24:45.421 --> 01:24:45.671
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2900
01:24:45.671 --> 01:24:49.080
<v Speaker 3>and the whole system is skewed in the interest of that tiny,</v>

2901
01:24:49.081 --> 01:24:51.120
<v Speaker 3>tiny fraction of 1% of the wealthy.</v>

2902
01:24:51.121 --> 01:24:51.954
<v Speaker 3>And unfortunately,</v>

2903
01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.460
<v Speaker 3>it's really a,</v>

2904
01:24:53.461 --> 01:24:53.620
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

2905
01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:55.440
<v Speaker 3>as bad as it's possible to get in America.</v>

2906
01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:56.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2907
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:58.380
<v Speaker 3>it's just bad in many other countries too,</v>

2908
01:24:58.381 --> 01:24:59.670
<v Speaker 3>but it's really bad in America.</v>

2909
01:24:59.671 --> 01:25:01.650
<v Speaker 3>The skewing of the skewing of wealth and,</v>

2910
01:25:01.651 --> 01:25:01.951
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2911
01:25:01.951 --> 01:25:05.130
<v Speaker 3>and the brainwashing of the population to keep people quiet,</v>

2912
01:25:05.131 --> 01:25:08.130
<v Speaker 3>to stop people thinking the mind control operates in our society.</v>

2913
01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:09.330
<v Speaker 3>It's like a pressure cooker.</v>

2914
01:25:09.331 --> 01:25:10.110
<v Speaker 3>Something's,</v>

2915
01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:11.130
<v Speaker 3>something's got to give.</v>

2916
01:25:11.131 --> 01:25:11.341
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2917
01:25:11.341 --> 01:25:11.760
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2918
01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.000
<v Speaker 3>and ours is a culture which is literally destroying the earth.</v>

2919
01:25:15.001 --> 01:25:15.180
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2920
01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:17.220
<v Speaker 3>I the Amazon jungle,</v>

2921
01:25:17.730 --> 01:25:20.100
<v Speaker 3>this amazing sacred realm,</v>

2922
01:25:20.130 --> 01:25:23.070
<v Speaker 3>this incredible home of biodiversity,</v>

2923
01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:23.761
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2924
01:25:23.761 --> 01:25:26.160
<v Speaker 3>this beautiful,</v>

2925
01:25:26.161 --> 01:25:27.360
<v Speaker 3>beautiful place.</v>

2926
01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:27.991
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2927
01:25:27.991 --> 01:25:29.700
<v Speaker 3>the destruction that's taking place now,</v>

2928
01:25:29.730 --> 01:25:34.620
<v Speaker 3>only a society that is truly insane could allow that to happen.</v>

2929
01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:37.020
<v Speaker 3>And that's unfortunately our society today.</v>

2930
01:25:37.021 --> 01:25:37.854
<v Speaker 3>So we need to wake up</v>

2931
01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:41.690
<v Speaker 1>and you want to talk about the writing on the wall as far as a,</v>

2932
01:25:41.691 --> 01:25:42.920
<v Speaker 1>a powerful,</v>

2933
01:25:42.921 --> 01:25:45.740
<v Speaker 1>advanced civilization being completely wiped off the earth.</v>

2934
01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:48.560
<v Speaker 1>How about our writing is all going to the cloud.</v>

2935
01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:49.603
<v Speaker 1>We have this,</v>

2936
01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:54.700
<v Speaker 1>this crazy trend where everything is going into these databases and hard drives</v>

2937
01:25:55.191 --> 01:25:56.810
<v Speaker 1>and when those are destroyed,</v>

2938
01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.610
<v Speaker 1>there'll be nothing to hold on to.</v>

2939
01:25:58.611 --> 01:25:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Nothing to read.</v>

2940
01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:02.270
<v Speaker 1>All of our knowledge will be memory.</v>

2941
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's almost ensuring</v>

2942
01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:08.220
<v Speaker 4>that there will be nothing remaining total wipe out this side.</v>

2943
01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:09.260
<v Speaker 4>This idea that I've,</v>

2944
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:11.090
<v Speaker 4>that I've talked about many times over the years,</v>

2945
01:26:11.091 --> 01:26:12.890
<v Speaker 4>that we are a species with amnesia.</v>

2946
01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.820
<v Speaker 4>We are going to be a species with Amnesia because again,</v>

2947
01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.190
<v Speaker 4>and our culture has not,</v>

2948
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:21.150
<v Speaker 4>has not at all looked at the,</v>

2949
01:26:21.151 --> 01:26:22.160
<v Speaker 4>at oral traditions,</v>

2950
01:26:22.161 --> 01:26:23.660
<v Speaker 4>we've destroyed the oral tradition.</v>

2951
01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:24.231
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2952
01:26:24.231 --> 01:26:28.460
<v Speaker 4>we've put everything into the written form now beamed it up into the cloud and</v>

2953
01:26:28.461 --> 01:26:29.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2954
01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:29.893
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

2955
01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:30.980
<v Speaker 4>one disaster.</v>

2956
01:26:30.981 --> 01:26:31.760
<v Speaker 4>It's all gone.</v>

2957
01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:34.430
<v Speaker 4>And at least in a written form you have books.</v>

2958
01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:34.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2959
01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:36.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean we don't even have books anymore.</v>

2960
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:37.783
<v Speaker 4>We have,</v>

2961
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.680
<v Speaker 4>we have electronic updates.</v>

2962
01:26:39.930 --> 01:26:40.670
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2963
01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:45.530
<v Speaker 4>it's so crazy to think that all it takes is one asteroidal impacts that wipes</v>

2964
01:26:45.531 --> 01:26:47.480
<v Speaker 4>out the grid and all that stuff's gone.</v>

2965
01:26:47.481 --> 01:26:48.030
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff,</v>

2966
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:49.580
<v Speaker 4>he can't access it anymore.</v>

2967
01:26:49.730 --> 01:26:51.950
<v Speaker 4>You have to rebuild the entire power grid.</v>

2968
01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:53.810
<v Speaker 4>And if the future,</v>

2969
01:26:53.811 --> 01:26:54.081
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2970
01:26:54.081 --> 01:26:56.150
<v Speaker 4>if we lose one or two generations,</v>

2971
01:26:56.151 --> 01:27:00.950
<v Speaker 4>if we had a Holocene type incident again or a big comment hit and wiped out 50%</v>

2972
01:27:00.951 --> 01:27:05.951
<v Speaker 4>of the population and we had to Sorta refigure out databases and refigure out</v>

2973
01:27:06.051 --> 01:27:06.884
<v Speaker 4>hard drives,</v>

2974
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:08.150
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to,</v>

2975
01:27:08.151 --> 01:27:10.850
<v Speaker 4>we're going to gather food and we're gonna figure out agriculture.</v>

2976
01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:13.020
<v Speaker 4>We're going to figure out some real primitive ways to live life.</v>

2977
01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.110
<v Speaker 4>But most of that stuff with three,</v>

2978
01:27:15.111 --> 01:27:16.820
<v Speaker 4>four generations later is gone.</v>

2979
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:17.480
<v Speaker 4>It's gone,</v>

2980
01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.231
<v Speaker 4>gone completely,</v>

2981
01:27:18.231 --> 01:27:19.064
<v Speaker 4>completely gone.</v>

2982
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.331
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2983
01:27:19.331 --> 01:27:19.611
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2984
01:27:19.611 --> 01:27:19.980
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2985
01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:20.813
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2986
01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:24.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean we have these gigantic populations now based in cities where,</v>

2987
01:27:24.670 --> 01:27:25.250
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>

2988
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:26.000
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2989
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.280
<v Speaker 4>actually the food supplies incredibly fragile.</v>

2990
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:32.510
<v Speaker 4>It's like two or three days of food is available at any city at any time.</v>

2991
01:27:32.890 --> 01:27:33.350
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2992
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:36.680
<v Speaker 4>consider the implications of that if that supply chain breaks down.</v>

2993
01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:38.390
<v Speaker 4>And we were very clear,</v>

2994
01:27:38.391 --> 01:27:39.110
<v Speaker 4>we're on record now.</v>

2995
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:40.550
<v Speaker 4>Look what's just happened in the Philippines.</v>

2996
01:27:40.551 --> 01:27:41.240
<v Speaker 4>Look at Hurricane,</v>

2997
01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.200
<v Speaker 4>Hurricane Katrina.</v>

2998
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:44.600
<v Speaker 4>We cannot deal with natural disasters.</v>

2999
01:27:45.650 --> 01:27:46.401
<v Speaker 4>Big One too,</v>

3000
01:27:46.401 --> 01:27:46.641
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3001
01:27:46.641 --> 01:27:47.421
<v Speaker 4>That was a really,</v>

3002
01:27:47.421 --> 01:27:52.421
<v Speaker 4>really scary one that the Philippines superstorm a storm the size of Germany,</v>

3003
01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:53.611
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3004
01:27:53.611 --> 01:27:55.580
<v Speaker 4>believable thousands,</v>

3005
01:27:55.581 --> 01:27:58.270
<v Speaker 4>10,000 more more people killed and,</v>

3006
01:27:58.271 --> 01:28:00.020
<v Speaker 4>and very slow reactions to do,</v>

3007
01:28:00.021 --> 01:28:00.920
<v Speaker 4>to do anything about it.</v>

3008
01:28:00.921 --> 01:28:02.300
<v Speaker 4>We have very bad human rights.</v>

3009
01:28:02.301 --> 01:28:03.260
<v Speaker 4>We could oldest tech,</v>

3010
01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.030
<v Speaker 4>we got all this wealth,</v>

3011
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:07.010
<v Speaker 4>we got all this complacency.</v>

3012
01:28:07.011 --> 01:28:08.570
<v Speaker 4>But actually when,</v>

3013
01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:10.580
<v Speaker 4>when the universe strikes us,</v>

3014
01:28:10.581 --> 01:28:12.170
<v Speaker 4>we are unable to do anything about it.</v>

3015
01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:12.630
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3016
01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:14.990
<v Speaker 4>and that's what's true in the most wealthy country in the world.</v>

3017
01:28:14.991 --> 01:28:16.880
<v Speaker 4>In America as we saw with Hurricane Katrina.</v>

3018
01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.930
<v Speaker 4>And this is three times bigger than three times bigger than countries.</v>

3019
01:28:19.950 --> 01:28:24.200
<v Speaker 4>They showed some a city that was 200,000 people and there's not a single</v>

3020
01:28:24.201 --> 01:28:25.280
<v Speaker 4>structure left standing.</v>

3021
01:28:25.281 --> 01:28:25.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3022
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:26.780
<v Speaker 4>unbelievable.</v>

3023
01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:27.670
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>

3024
01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:28.520
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>

3025
01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:29.421
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

3026
01:28:29.421 --> 01:28:32.930
<v Speaker 4>there have been bigger ones had been bigger storms throughout history than that.</v>

3027
01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:35.510
<v Speaker 4>There's been bigger impacts than the Holocene one.</v>

3028
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:39.620
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing about the universe is that our orbit,</v>

3029
01:28:39.650 --> 01:28:43.160
<v Speaker 4>like where we are is stable and we have the moon,</v>

3030
01:28:43.161 --> 01:28:44.750
<v Speaker 4>which helps our orbit but be still,</v>

3031
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:49.280
<v Speaker 4>but there's hundreds of thousands of near Earth objects that are just floating</v>

3032
01:28:49.281 --> 01:28:52.070
<v Speaker 4>around out there that could easily come down,</v>

3033
01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.450
<v Speaker 4>collide into each other,</v>

3034
01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:54.680
<v Speaker 4>slamming the earth.</v>

3035
01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:55.850
<v Speaker 4>And that's a wrap.</v>

3036
01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:56.451
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

3037
01:28:56.451 --> 01:28:56.661
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

3038
01:28:56.661 --> 01:28:59.900
<v Speaker 4>this again is something is something that needs to be taken very,</v>

3039
01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:00.950
<v Speaker 4>very seriously.</v>

3040
01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:01.531
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

3041
01:29:01.531 --> 01:29:02.364
<v Speaker 4>I want to say</v>

3042
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:06.060
<v Speaker 3>let's emphasize the positive and let's emphasize positive thinking,</v>

3043
01:29:06.061 --> 01:29:08.010
<v Speaker 3>but let's also be rational and reasonable.</v>

3044
01:29:08.011 --> 01:29:12.450
<v Speaker 3>And when you look at the orbits of near Earth Asteroids called Apollo objects,</v>

3045
01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:13.171
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3046
01:29:13.171 --> 01:29:18.171
<v Speaker 3>it's like looking at a cat's cradle a of harm that is surrounding this precious</v>

3047
01:29:18.511 --> 01:29:19.310
<v Speaker 3>jewel of a,</v>

3048
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.861
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

3049
01:29:19.861 --> 01:29:20.520
<v Speaker 3>of a planet.</v>

3050
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.920
<v Speaker 3>And we don't even know them all.</v>

3051
01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:23.130
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

3052
01:29:23.130 --> 01:29:24.440
<v Speaker 3>we know a tiny fraction of them.</v>

3053
01:29:24.450 --> 01:29:28.110
<v Speaker 3>What becomes clear is we only know a little bit of these things.</v>

3054
01:29:28.111 --> 01:29:30.240
<v Speaker 3>Some of them 10 miles wide,</v>

3055
01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.830
<v Speaker 3>which are whinging through,</v>

3056
01:29:31.890 --> 01:29:32.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3057
01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:32.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3058
01:29:32.581 --> 01:29:33.760
<v Speaker 3>outer space and,</v>

3059
01:29:33.761 --> 01:29:35.130
<v Speaker 3>and can hit us at any time.</v>

3060
01:29:35.131 --> 01:29:36.060
<v Speaker 3>And then comments,</v>

3061
01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:36.781
<v Speaker 3>then comments,</v>

3062
01:29:36.781 --> 01:29:37.060
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

3063
01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:37.380
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

3064
01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:39.990
<v Speaker 3>some comments can have 12,000 year orbits.</v>

3065
01:29:40.230 --> 01:29:44.490
<v Speaker 3>The suggestion that we're seeing a lot of increased meteor activity as well</v>

3066
01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:45.360
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

3067
01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:45.810
<v Speaker 3>a lot of,</v>

3068
01:29:45.810 --> 01:29:47.130
<v Speaker 3>a lot of action going on.</v>

3069
01:29:47.490 --> 01:29:48.211
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3070
01:29:48.211 --> 01:29:48.901
<v Speaker 3>the suggestion,</v>

3071
01:29:48.901 --> 01:29:49.321
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

3072
01:29:49.321 --> 01:29:52.650
<v Speaker 3>rather castle's work has been really important in this area is the torrid.</v>

3073
01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:53.690
<v Speaker 3>The tutorial,</v>

3074
01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:54.663
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3075
01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:55.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3076
01:29:55.410 --> 01:29:56.790
<v Speaker 3>asteroid or comet,</v>

3077
01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:57.100
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3078
01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:00.450
<v Speaker 3>the toric shower is a remains of a disintegrated comment.</v>

3079
01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:03.690
<v Speaker 3>And in that shower there may be huge things,</v>

3080
01:30:03.691 --> 01:30:05.130
<v Speaker 3>the size of cities which are,</v>

3081
01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:08.790
<v Speaker 3>which are flowing through and crossing the orbit of the earth regularly.</v>

3082
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.730
<v Speaker 3>It's not just pretty pretty little lights in the sky.</v>

3083
01:30:11.770 --> 01:30:12.310
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3084
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.781
<v Speaker 3>one day,</v>

3085
01:30:12.781 --> 01:30:14.580
<v Speaker 3>one day we're going to run into something,</v>

3086
01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.230
<v Speaker 3>something the size of New York,</v>

3087
01:30:16.231 --> 01:30:16.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3088
01:30:16.501 --> 01:30:18.120
<v Speaker 3>which is going to going to hit us.</v>

3089
01:30:18.121 --> 01:30:18.421
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

3090
01:30:18.421 --> 01:30:19.110
<v Speaker 3>so this is,</v>

3091
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:20.000
<v Speaker 3>this is a matter of,</v>

3092
01:30:20.010 --> 01:30:20.191
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

3093
01:30:20.191 --> 01:30:21.420
<v Speaker 3>for care and concern and,</v>

3094
01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:22.291
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

3095
01:30:22.291 --> 01:30:23.160
<v Speaker 3>look what we do.</v>

3096
01:30:23.161 --> 01:30:23.521
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3097
01:30:23.521 --> 01:30:24.001
<v Speaker 3>we spent,</v>

3098
01:30:24.001 --> 01:30:27.690
<v Speaker 3>we spend billions,</v>

3099
01:30:27.690 --> 01:30:27.750
<v Speaker 3>trillions,</v>

3100
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:28.650
<v Speaker 3>limitless,</v>

3101
01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:33.120
<v Speaker 3>endless amounts of money and inventing new ways to destroy each other and very</v>

3102
01:30:33.121 --> 01:30:34.690
<v Speaker 3>little on actually looking at,</v>

3103
01:30:34.691 --> 01:30:35.524
<v Speaker 3>on how to,</v>

3104
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:36.930
<v Speaker 3>how to protect the earth.</v>

3105
01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:39.420
<v Speaker 3>Could they protect the earth or from something like that?</v>

3106
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.961
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3107
01:30:39.961 --> 01:30:41.070
<v Speaker 3>if we don't look into it,</v>

3108
01:30:41.071 --> 01:30:42.870
<v Speaker 3>we certainly won't have an answer to that question.</v>

3109
01:30:43.410 --> 01:30:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Some of them don't.</v>

3110
01:30:44.371 --> 01:30:48.060
<v Speaker 1>They come from behind the sign and we can't see them because of gravity.</v>

3111
01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:49.130
<v Speaker 3>You can't see them come.</v>

3112
01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:50.320
<v Speaker 3>They can't see them come back.</v>

3113
01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:51.710
<v Speaker 3>But if the kind of,</v>

3114
01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:54.860
<v Speaker 3>if the kind of focused scientific effort that we're presently,</v>

3115
01:30:54.861 --> 01:30:59.861
<v Speaker 3>that is presently put into creating weapons of mass destruction so that we can</v>

3116
01:30:59.931 --> 01:31:01.430
<v Speaker 3>all fight each other.</v>

3117
01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:06.590
<v Speaker 3>If that kind of effort we put into making sure that we understand the orbit of</v>

3118
01:31:06.591 --> 01:31:08.240
<v Speaker 3>every single asteroid that's out there,</v>

3119
01:31:08.241 --> 01:31:09.770
<v Speaker 3>we identify them and find them,</v>

3120
01:31:09.970 --> 01:31:10.130
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3121
01:31:10.130 --> 01:31:11.690
<v Speaker 3>we'd be a lot safer than we are today.</v>

3122
01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:12.730
<v Speaker 1>There's no profit in that.</v>

3123
01:31:12.731 --> 01:31:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Graham Hancock and [inaudible] our corporates stockholders to do.</v>

3124
01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.921
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous,</v>

3125
01:31:17.921 --> 01:31:18.580
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

3126
01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3127
01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3128
01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:23.770
<v Speaker 1>It's almost mimics this cyclical nature of life itself.</v>

3129
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:28.240
<v Speaker 1>It seems like civilization builds up to this incredible point where it's like</v>

3130
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:33.990
<v Speaker 1>completely out of control and just reckless and wild and then boom,</v>

3131
01:31:34.481 --> 01:31:36.960
<v Speaker 1>gets knocked down and then builds back up again.</v>

3132
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:38.260
<v Speaker 1>And it's almost,</v>

3133
01:31:39.190 --> 01:31:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not suggesting that these things floating around in space are there for a</v>

3134
01:31:42.461 --> 01:31:43.210
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

3135
01:31:43.210 --> 01:31:44.110
<v Speaker 1>but if they were,</v>

3136
01:31:44.111 --> 01:31:46.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would be like little reset buttons,</v>

3137
01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.380
<v Speaker 1>a little reset buttons.</v>

3138
01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3139
01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:50.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's what happened when the dinosaurs got it,</v>

3140
01:31:50.221 --> 01:31:51.054
<v Speaker 1>got to a fly the,</v>

3141
01:31:51.130 --> 01:31:52.830
<v Speaker 3>that's why the ancient mythology,</v>

3142
01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:57.420
<v Speaker 3>which consistently says right or wrong,</v>

3143
01:31:57.421 --> 01:32:02.170
<v Speaker 3>consistently says that mankind is implicated in these cataclysms our behavior,</v>

3144
01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:07.150
<v Speaker 3>our wickedness is implicated in this in some way.</v>

3145
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:09.550
<v Speaker 3>I think it's worth listening to that a little bit and,</v>

3146
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.920
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3147
01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:10.960
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3148
01:32:10.961 --> 01:32:12.580
<v Speaker 3>maybe maybe this,</v>

3149
01:32:12.581 --> 01:32:12.940
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3150
01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:15.220
<v Speaker 3>this time we don't have to go through the reset.</v>

3151
01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:15.641
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

3152
01:32:15.641 --> 01:32:19.630
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's possible for mankind to actually wake up now that we are globally</v>

3153
01:32:19.631 --> 01:32:22.870
<v Speaker 3>connected now that we do have this possibility of all talking to one another</v>

3154
01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:24.130
<v Speaker 3>before it's too late,</v>

3155
01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:27.790
<v Speaker 3>we can reset ourselves in a positive direction.</v>

3156
01:32:28.150 --> 01:32:31.360
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the only way we would as if we knew something was coming,</v>

3157
01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:33.160
<v Speaker 3>I think that's almost the only way.</v>

3158
01:32:33.161 --> 01:32:36.070
<v Speaker 3>And we would have to be informed and then we would have to believe it.</v>

3159
01:32:36.071 --> 01:32:39.460
<v Speaker 3>And then there would be disputes and I'm sure the Republicans would start laughs</v>

3160
01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:40.150
<v Speaker 3>nonsense.</v>

3161
01:32:40.150 --> 01:32:43.030
<v Speaker 3>We're a show you right here at the same scientist that brought you climate</v>

3162
01:32:43.031 --> 01:32:46.360
<v Speaker 3>change are telling you right now and there's an asteroid hitting our rank.</v>

3163
01:32:46.361 --> 01:32:47.171
<v Speaker 3>Certainly they would.</v>

3164
01:32:47.171 --> 01:32:47.530
<v Speaker 3>They would.</v>

3165
01:32:47.530 --> 01:32:49.420
<v Speaker 3>They would say that she just is going to protect us.</v>

3166
01:32:49.421 --> 01:32:53.680
<v Speaker 3>What we need to do is cut taxes for corporations and ensure that we can move to</v>

3167
01:32:53.681 --> 01:32:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Mexico and when our factories.</v>

3168
01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:56.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3169
01:32:56.110 --> 01:32:57.100
<v Speaker 3>I wonder,</v>

3170
01:32:57.130 --> 01:33:00.520
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if we would really pay attention if we knew that we had a year left.</v>

3171
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:02.380
<v Speaker 3>If we had a year ago and they'd get that.</v>

3172
01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:03.100
<v Speaker 3>Think of that.</v>

3173
01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:03.860
<v Speaker 3>What a difference.</v>

3174
01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:05.740
<v Speaker 3>What a situation that would be.</v>

3175
01:33:05.810 --> 01:33:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Think of that.</v>

3176
01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:08.050
<v Speaker 3>We barely pay attention to what we're doing.</v>

3177
01:33:08.051 --> 01:33:09.040
<v Speaker 3>That's really obvious.</v>

3178
01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:12.490
<v Speaker 3>Like the polluting of the ocean or the the destroying of the,</v>

3179
01:33:12.491 --> 01:33:12.731
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3180
01:33:12.731 --> 01:33:13.120
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3181
01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.240
<v Speaker 3>the pulling s.</v>

3182
01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:18.250
<v Speaker 3>There's the fish out of the ocean and the alarming rate that doesn't allow them</v>

3183
01:33:18.251 --> 01:33:19.600
<v Speaker 3>to recover insane.</v>

3184
01:33:19.630 --> 01:33:21.910
<v Speaker 3>All of it about the pursuit of short term profits,</v>

3185
01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:24.850
<v Speaker 3>all of it about immediate payoffs.</v>

3186
01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Nobody,</v>

3187
01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:27.250
<v Speaker 3>nobody thinking long term.</v>

3188
01:33:27.610 --> 01:33:28.061
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

3189
01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:29.140
<v Speaker 3>I come back to this.</v>

3190
01:33:29.141 --> 01:33:32.230
<v Speaker 3>We are a deranged society and,</v>

3191
01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:37.290
<v Speaker 3>and a little nodes of sanity are beginning to wake up all around the world,</v>

3192
01:33:37.691 --> 01:33:38.670
<v Speaker 3>but maybe it's not,</v>

3193
01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:39.670
<v Speaker 3>not in enough time.</v>

3194
01:33:39.730 --> 01:33:40.563
<v Speaker 3>And isn't that,</v>

3195
01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:44.170
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it also go back to what you were saying about psychedelics and how</v>

3196
01:33:44.171 --> 01:33:49.171
<v Speaker 3>beneficial psychedelics can be because one of the main themes of Iowasca is save</v>

3197
01:33:49.391 --> 01:33:49.960
<v Speaker 3>the planet.</v>

3198
01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:50.441
<v Speaker 3>It's safe.</v>

3199
01:33:50.441 --> 01:33:50.860
<v Speaker 3>The planet.</v>

3200
01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:52.810
<v Speaker 3>It's a universal theme of Iowasca.</v>

3201
01:33:52.811 --> 01:33:53.770
<v Speaker 3>Sooner or later,</v>

3202
01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:57.520
<v Speaker 3>anybody who works with Iowasca enough is going to start picking up that message</v>

3203
01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:00.280
<v Speaker 3>that this beautiful earth,</v>

3204
01:34:00.281 --> 01:34:00.881
<v Speaker 3>that we have,</v>

3205
01:34:00.881 --> 01:34:03.010
<v Speaker 3>this gift that the universe has given us,</v>

3206
01:34:03.011 --> 01:34:05.410
<v Speaker 3>his precious beyond measure,</v>

3207
01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:10.390
<v Speaker 3>precious beyond imagination and that we are part of it and that we must,</v>

3208
01:34:10.450 --> 01:34:14.660
<v Speaker 3>we must treat it with love and respect and reverence rather than in the,</v>

3209
01:34:14.661 --> 01:34:15.880
<v Speaker 3>in the horrific way that we do.</v>

3210
01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:19.390
<v Speaker 3>And that part of treating the planet with love and respect and reverence is</v>

3211
01:34:19.391 --> 01:34:22.240
<v Speaker 3>treating fellow human beings with love and respect and reference at every,</v>

3212
01:34:22.241 --> 01:34:22.811
<v Speaker 3>at every level.</v>

3213
01:34:22.811 --> 01:34:24.930
<v Speaker 3>This is a very strong message of Iowa.</v>

3214
01:34:24.931 --> 01:34:25.161
<v Speaker 3>Ask.</v>

3215
01:34:25.161 --> 01:34:25.930
<v Speaker 3>It is a message.</v>

3216
01:34:25.930 --> 01:34:27.640
<v Speaker 3>It is fundamentally a message of love,</v>

3217
01:34:27.641 --> 01:34:28.840
<v Speaker 3>not in a wishy washy way,</v>

3218
01:34:28.841 --> 01:34:33.100
<v Speaker 3>but in a really firm and clear way that that is the salvation of the human race.</v>

3219
01:34:33.130 --> 01:34:33.431
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

3220
01:34:33.431 --> 01:34:34.091
<v Speaker 3>Bill Hicks said it,</v>

3221
01:34:34.091 --> 01:34:34.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3222
01:34:34.361 --> 01:34:36.400
<v Speaker 3>the love is the opposite of fear.</v>

3223
01:34:36.401 --> 01:34:36.731
<v Speaker 3>Fear.</v>

3224
01:34:36.731 --> 01:34:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Fear is what is what presses are buttons today.</v>

3225
01:34:39.670 --> 01:34:41.890
<v Speaker 3>It's what's used deliberately depress our buttons.</v>

3226
01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:42.191
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3227
01:34:42.191 --> 01:34:43.950
<v Speaker 3>and what's the opposite of that is,</v>

3228
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:44.740
<v Speaker 3>is love.</v>

3229
01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:45.573
<v Speaker 3>That's what we need.</v>

3230
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:47.470
<v Speaker 3>And then Bill Hicks did a lot of mushrooms.</v>

3231
01:34:47.471 --> 01:34:50.800
<v Speaker 3>Fox and Bill Hicks did a lot of mushrooms and what a brilliant,</v>

3232
01:34:50.801 --> 01:34:51.820
<v Speaker 3>brilliant man he was.</v>

3233
01:34:51.850 --> 01:34:52.271
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3234
01:34:52.271 --> 01:34:53.530
<v Speaker 3>He's one of my comedy heroes.</v>

3235
01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:53.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3236
01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:54.693
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

3237
01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 3>There's a 19 year old inventor who found a way to clean up</v>

3238
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:00.920
<v Speaker 1>the world's ocean in under five years time.</v>

3239
01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3240
01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:02.630
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3241
01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:04.880
<v Speaker 1>he this great Pacific garbage patch.</v>

3242
01:35:04.881 --> 01:35:07.310
<v Speaker 1>This young kid has figured out this,</v>

3243
01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:12.520
<v Speaker 1>this machine that would a absorb all the plastic material in the ocean.</v>

3244
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Really fascinating stuff.</v>

3245
01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3246
01:35:17.210 --> 01:35:17.661
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

3247
01:35:17.661 --> 01:35:19.040
<v Speaker 1>there's an article about it,</v>

3248
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3249
01:35:19.670 --> 01:35:20.140
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

3250
01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:20.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3251
01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:23.840
<v Speaker 1>this is VR dashed zone.com.</v>

3252
01:35:23.841 --> 01:35:25.880
<v Speaker 1>But I'm sure if you do a Google search on that,</v>

3253
01:35:26.150 --> 01:35:29.930
<v Speaker 1>you can find several different sites that have covered that,</v>

3254
01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:35.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's like this is a machine that would essentially sit in the center of the</v>

3255
01:35:35.541 --> 01:35:38.210
<v Speaker 1>ocean and start sucking all the plastic up.</v>

3256
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:39.800
<v Speaker 1>We have a huge,</v>

3257
01:35:39.801 --> 01:35:40.191
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>

3258
01:35:40.191 --> 01:35:41.510
<v Speaker 1>huge problem with this.</v>

3259
01:35:41.511 --> 01:35:45.170
<v Speaker 1>This plastic in the ocean is something that no one even considered until roughly</v>

3260
01:35:45.171 --> 01:35:49.490
<v Speaker 1>a decade or so ago when they started being aware that all the stuff that were</v>

3261
01:35:49.491 --> 01:35:50.260
<v Speaker 1>littering on,</v>

3262
01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

3263
01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:50.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3264
01:35:50.901 --> 01:35:53.960
<v Speaker 1>whether it's throwing off a boat or just finds its way to the ocean through</v>

3265
01:35:53.961 --> 01:35:55.400
<v Speaker 1>drainage pipes or what have you,</v>

3266
01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:57.290
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with a massive,</v>

3267
01:35:57.291 --> 01:36:02.291
<v Speaker 1>massive amount of material and material that's not biodegradable that's being</v>

3268
01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:07.840
<v Speaker 1>turned into like this sludgy sort of shitty stuff that's floating around.</v>

3269
01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.670
<v Speaker 1>There's a kind of symbol of everything that's wrong without culture actually.</v>

3270
01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:11.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3271
01:36:11.121 --> 01:36:12.510
<v Speaker 1>it really is and it's,</v>

3272
01:36:12.710 --> 01:36:16.070
<v Speaker 1>and a bed bed is this guy's idea going to be taken up as well.</v>

3273
01:36:16.071 --> 01:36:16.581
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>

3274
01:36:16.581 --> 01:36:16.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3275
01:36:16.761 --> 01:36:18.920
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty amazing that this 19 year old kid,</v>

3276
01:36:18.921 --> 01:36:19.754
<v Speaker 1>well my,</v>

3277
01:36:19.950 --> 01:36:24.950
<v Speaker 1>the point being that what I find fascinating is that when our back is up against</v>

3278
01:36:25.401 --> 01:36:25.761
<v Speaker 1>the wall,</v>

3279
01:36:25.761 --> 01:36:26.600
<v Speaker 1>like when someone realizes,</v>

3280
01:36:26.601 --> 01:36:27.081
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

3281
01:36:27.081 --> 01:36:27.914
<v Speaker 1>we have this,</v>

3282
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:29.910
<v Speaker 1>this country sized patch of,</v>

3283
01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:33.440
<v Speaker 1>of plastic that's floating around in the ocean.</v>

3284
01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3285
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:35.450
<v Speaker 1>When your back is up against the wall,</v>

3286
01:36:35.451 --> 01:36:37.190
<v Speaker 1>people start thinking when people start thinking,</v>

3287
01:36:37.191 --> 01:36:37.971
<v Speaker 1>they start innovating,</v>

3288
01:36:37.971 --> 01:36:39.800
<v Speaker 1>when they started innovating solutions come about.</v>

3289
01:36:39.801 --> 01:36:41.570
<v Speaker 1>And maybe even a solution when they say,</v>

3290
01:36:41.571 --> 01:36:41.721
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3291
01:36:41.721 --> 01:36:42.500
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

3292
01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:44.660
<v Speaker 1>that plastic is actually,</v>

3293
01:36:44.661 --> 01:36:48.140
<v Speaker 1>you could turn that into stuff that actually could be used as fuel that actually</v>

3294
01:36:48.141 --> 01:36:51.680
<v Speaker 1>could be used to create things that actually could be used in a beneficial way</v>

3295
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:52.550
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3296
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:55.970
<v Speaker 1>but then the problem is going to be how do you keep people from continuing the</v>

3297
01:36:55.971 --> 01:36:59.060
<v Speaker 1>same process and re polluting it again once you've cleaned it up.</v>

3298
01:36:59.090 --> 01:36:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3299
01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3300
01:37:00.050 --> 01:37:00.883
<v Speaker 1>Psychedelics.</v>

3301
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3302
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:02.360
<v Speaker 1>It won't be the only way.</v>

3303
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.540
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3304
01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:02.791
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3305
01:37:02.791 --> 01:37:06.110
<v Speaker 1>the realization that the huge kick up the ass that comes with,</v>

3306
01:37:06.111 --> 01:37:06.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3307
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.620
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

3308
01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:09.800
<v Speaker 1>with a major responsibly taken psychedelic journey.</v>

3309
01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:13.850
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also the challenge of our current trend in these gigantic</v>

3310
01:37:13.851 --> 01:37:17.060
<v Speaker 1>cities and these gigantic cities aren't sustainable.</v>

3311
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:18.800
<v Speaker 1>They're not agriculturally sustainable,</v>

3312
01:37:19.130 --> 01:37:20.000
<v Speaker 1>sustainable.</v>

3313
01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:21.200
<v Speaker 1>So like how do you,</v>

3314
01:37:21.230 --> 01:37:21.660
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

3315
01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:26.090
<v Speaker 1>how do you figure out a way to stop the trend of these gigantic cities or</v>

3316
01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:29.880
<v Speaker 1>provide food or figure out a way to be in a,</v>

3317
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:34.910
<v Speaker 1>in a sustainable environment and still have modern conveniences and technology</v>

3318
01:37:35.121 --> 01:37:36.140
<v Speaker 1>and medicine and all those,</v>

3319
01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:37.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3320
01:37:37.110 --> 01:37:37.943
<v Speaker 1>very difficult,</v>

3321
01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:38.481
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

3322
01:37:38.481 --> 01:37:40.520
<v Speaker 1>very difficult problem if possible,</v>

3323
01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:41.640
<v Speaker 1>how to solve.</v>

3324
01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:45.890
<v Speaker 1>But I'd like all of these gigantic problems if we begin to solve them at a</v>

3325
01:37:45.891 --> 01:37:46.641
<v Speaker 1>personal level,</v>

3326
01:37:46.641 --> 01:37:48.980
<v Speaker 1>within our own sphere of influence within,</v>

3327
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:51.990
<v Speaker 1>within where we live in our relationships with other human beings.</v>

3328
01:37:51.991 --> 01:37:52.824
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good start.</v>

3329
01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:53.141
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3330
01:37:53.141 --> 01:37:54.290
<v Speaker 1>that's where we do have power.</v>

3331
01:37:54.291 --> 01:37:55.170
<v Speaker 1>That's where we do have choice.</v>

3332
01:37:55.171 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 1>We cannot change the</v>

3333
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.520
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

3334
01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:57.353
<v Speaker 4>any one of us,</v>

3335
01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.640
<v Speaker 4>but we can change the way we interact with others.</v>

3336
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:00.271
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3337
01:38:00.271 --> 01:38:04.110
<v Speaker 4>And it seems like that's probably the best way to fix this whole masses.</v>

3338
01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:08.130
<v Speaker 4>To fix it on a macro scale or a micro scale.</v>

3339
01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:08.740
<v Speaker 4>Micro scale.</v>

3340
01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:09.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3341
01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:14.180
<v Speaker 4>Fix it in individuals and spread it like a virus spread.</v>

3342
01:38:14.281 --> 01:38:17.820
<v Speaker 4>This new found realization of what we're really doing,</v>

3343
01:38:17.821 --> 01:38:19.350
<v Speaker 4>what our impact really is,</v>

3344
01:38:19.650 --> 01:38:24.320
<v Speaker 4>the awareness and this sort of new found idea of,</v>

3345
01:38:24.321 --> 01:38:29.160
<v Speaker 4>of connectivity that we have and that we're starting to grasp a hold up because</v>

3346
01:38:29.161 --> 01:38:30.150
<v Speaker 4>of this internet culture,</v>

3347
01:38:30.151 --> 01:38:32.190
<v Speaker 4>because of this new area,</v>

3348
01:38:32.191 --> 01:38:33.870
<v Speaker 4>this new new new area in history,</v>

3349
01:38:33.871 --> 01:38:34.704
<v Speaker 4>this guy,</v>

3350
01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:36.170
<v Speaker 4>this new level of a,</v>

3351
01:38:36.170 --> 01:38:36.700
<v Speaker 4>of admission.</v>

3352
01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:36.890
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3353
01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:37.130
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3354
01:38:37.130 --> 01:38:37.530
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3355
01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:38.580
<v Speaker 4>that's where it's happening.</v>

3356
01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:39.361
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3357
01:38:39.361 --> 01:38:40.110
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

3358
01:38:40.110 --> 01:38:41.910
<v Speaker 4>that's where I take hope,</v>

3359
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:42.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3360
01:38:42.241 --> 01:38:42.701
<v Speaker 4>because I,</v>

3361
01:38:42.701 --> 01:38:45.090
<v Speaker 4>I meet young people every time I go out and give a,</v>

3362
01:38:45.091 --> 01:38:45.570
<v Speaker 4>give a,</v>

3363
01:38:45.570 --> 01:38:46.141
<v Speaker 4>give a lecture,</v>

3364
01:38:46.141 --> 01:38:46.411
<v Speaker 4>give it,</v>

3365
01:38:46.411 --> 01:38:47.244
<v Speaker 4>give a talk,</v>

3366
01:38:47.490 --> 01:38:48.210
<v Speaker 4>I meet,</v>

3367
01:38:48.210 --> 01:38:51.390
<v Speaker 4>I meet young people who have come there and they are thinking in a new way,</v>

3368
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:51.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3369
01:38:51.930 --> 01:38:56.730
<v Speaker 4>the old ideas of nationalism and patriotism and all that bullshit have gone.</v>

3370
01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:58.500
<v Speaker 4>These are people who are thinking in terms of,</v>

3371
01:38:58.550 --> 01:39:00.030
<v Speaker 4>of humanity as a whole.</v>

3372
01:39:00.090 --> 01:39:00.361
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3373
01:39:00.361 --> 01:39:00.640
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3374
01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:00.881
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3375
01:39:00.881 --> 01:39:04.890
<v Speaker 4>and thinking in terms of what a glorious gift the universe has given us with</v>

3376
01:39:04.891 --> 01:39:05.431
<v Speaker 4>this planet.</v>

3377
01:39:05.431 --> 01:39:06.810
<v Speaker 4>And we have to live right there.</v>

3378
01:39:06.811 --> 01:39:09.090
<v Speaker 4>There is a tremendous spirit in the world today.</v>

3379
01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:09.361
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3380
01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:13.920
<v Speaker 4>one of the benefits of travel is that travel sort of erodes the idea of</v>

3381
01:39:13.921 --> 01:39:16.860
<v Speaker 4>nationalism in a way where you meet these people in these other countries and</v>

3382
01:39:16.861 --> 01:39:18.110
<v Speaker 4>you realize well they're just like me.</v>

3383
01:39:18.111 --> 01:39:22.080
<v Speaker 4>Just like they mean they might talk in a different accent or a speak a different</v>

3384
01:39:22.081 --> 01:39:22.411
<v Speaker 4>language,</v>

3385
01:39:22.411 --> 01:39:23.280
<v Speaker 4>but they're just people.</v>

3386
01:39:23.670 --> 01:39:28.670
<v Speaker 4>And I think one of the reasons why people have nationalism is based on a fear of</v>

3387
01:39:29.491 --> 01:39:30.510
<v Speaker 4>those other people.</v>

3388
01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:30.991
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

3389
01:39:30.991 --> 01:39:34.350
<v Speaker 4>fear is the theme and fear and this is fear that can be manipulated,</v>

3390
01:39:34.930 --> 01:39:38.670
<v Speaker 4>that the powers that that run the world at the moment are deliberately</v>

3391
01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:41.610
<v Speaker 4>manipulating all the time to divide us from one another and prevent us from</v>

3392
01:39:41.611 --> 01:39:42.270
<v Speaker 4>realizing.</v>

3393
01:39:42.270 --> 01:39:46.320
<v Speaker 4>And amongst those powers are of course all of the big states and government</v>

3394
01:39:46.321 --> 01:39:49.050
<v Speaker 4>apparatus and are of course all of the big religions,</v>

3395
01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:50.071
<v Speaker 4>Christianity,</v>

3396
01:39:50.071 --> 01:39:52.710
<v Speaker 4>Judaism and Islam are all in the theater business as well.</v>

3397
01:39:52.770 --> 01:39:56.040
<v Speaker 4>They're all in generating fear and telling us that this is the only way to do</v>

3398
01:39:56.041 --> 01:39:58.020
<v Speaker 4>things and we are different and this is the,</v>

3399
01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:00.930
<v Speaker 4>this is the right way to do things of that is the wrong way to do things.</v>

3400
01:40:00.931 --> 01:40:02.250
<v Speaker 4>And that's the old model.</v>

3401
01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:02.741
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3402
01:40:02.741 --> 01:40:03.840
<v Speaker 4>the big corporations,</v>

3403
01:40:03.841 --> 01:40:04.740
<v Speaker 4>they are part of that too.</v>

3404
01:40:04.741 --> 01:40:05.100
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3405
01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:06.240
<v Speaker 4>you have to rely on us.</v>

3406
01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.650
<v Speaker 4>We will be the answer to your all your problems.</v>

3407
01:40:08.670 --> 01:40:09.300
<v Speaker 4>Such bullshit.</v>

3408
01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:10.320
<v Speaker 4>That's the old model.</v>

3409
01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:11.250
<v Speaker 4>And that's the,</v>

3410
01:40:11.250 --> 01:40:14.910
<v Speaker 4>that's the model that is bit by bit day by day one step at a time,</v>

3411
01:40:14.911 --> 01:40:16.740
<v Speaker 4>one brick at a time getting replaced.</v>

3412
01:40:16.890 --> 01:40:17.820
<v Speaker 4>It's really is isn't it?</v>

3413
01:40:17.821 --> 01:40:18.101
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

3414
01:40:18.101 --> 01:40:18.301
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3415
01:40:18.301 --> 01:40:22.260
<v Speaker 4>the model of government itself is a giant chunk of fear with a little bit of</v>

3416
01:40:22.261 --> 01:40:23.094
<v Speaker 4>hope.</v>

3417
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:26.190
<v Speaker 4>And the hope is all lies.</v>

3418
01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.020
<v Speaker 4>No hope is all silly.</v>

3419
01:40:28.021 --> 01:40:31.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean the hope is basically bullshit provided by corporations so they can keep</v>

3420
01:40:31.591 --> 01:40:32.390
<v Speaker 4>fracking.</v>

3421
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3422
01:40:32.710 --> 01:40:33.510
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

3423
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:34.060
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3424
01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:34.410
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3425
01:40:34.410 --> 01:40:34.751
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3426
01:40:34.751 --> 01:40:36.660
<v Speaker 4>I honestly thought fracking,</v>

3427
01:40:36.661 --> 01:40:36.991
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3428
01:40:36.991 --> 01:40:37.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3429
01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:38.333
<v Speaker 4>All fear,</v>

3430
01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:39.353
<v Speaker 4>all fear,</v>

3431
01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:39.930
<v Speaker 4>fear,</v>

3432
01:40:39.930 --> 01:40:40.980
<v Speaker 4>fear generated.</v>

3433
01:40:41.010 --> 01:40:41.510
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3434
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.700
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3435
01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:42.040
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3436
01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:43.290
<v Speaker 4>and this is what we,</v>

3437
01:40:43.291 --> 01:40:45.360
<v Speaker 4>what we need to move beyond government.</v>

3438
01:40:45.630 --> 01:40:49.240
<v Speaker 4>I think the way we've known it for the last centuries on the way it,</v>

3439
01:40:49.290 --> 01:40:50.310
<v Speaker 4>what it's come to today,</v>

3440
01:40:50.311 --> 01:40:50.880
<v Speaker 4>it's done,</v>

3441
01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:51.421
<v Speaker 4>it's over.</v>

3442
01:40:51.421 --> 01:40:52.540
<v Speaker 4>It's stories over it.</v>

3443
01:40:52.541 --> 01:40:53.374
<v Speaker 4>It's hanging.</v>

3444
01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:54.250
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking</v>

3445
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:56.560
<v Speaker 1>everything up as badly as it can.</v>

3446
01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:57.663
<v Speaker 1>But it is done.</v>

3447
01:40:57.670 --> 01:40:58.150
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

3448
01:40:58.150 --> 01:41:02.440
<v Speaker 1>that is a model that will no longer work and whether or not it wants to or not,</v>

3449
01:41:02.441 --> 01:41:04.510
<v Speaker 1>it will slowly be phased out.</v>

3450
01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I think that when you're,</v>

3451
01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:06.640
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about it,</v>

3452
01:41:06.641 --> 01:41:10.090
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting that I think that the very practices that it's using right</v>

3453
01:41:10.091 --> 01:41:14.360
<v Speaker 1>now that our government is using are going to aid its own demise.</v>

3454
01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:17.760
<v Speaker 1>The practices of the NSA monitoring everybody's email and,</v>

3455
01:41:17.761 --> 01:41:19.790
<v Speaker 1>and constantly spying on Americans.</v>

3456
01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:23.980
<v Speaker 1>So ridiculous socially where people are just like completely up in arms and</v>

3457
01:41:23.981 --> 01:41:24.790
<v Speaker 1>upset about it.</v>

3458
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:29.650
<v Speaker 1>But also that technological trend is going to lead to ultimate truth.</v>

3459
01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:33.160
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real issue with the government because the government relies on</v>

3460
01:41:33.161 --> 01:41:36.280
<v Speaker 1>deception and bullshit and bribery and special interest groups.</v>

3461
01:41:36.281 --> 01:41:37.114
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3462
01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:37.651
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3463
01:41:37.651 --> 01:41:39.910
<v Speaker 1>They can't keep that up if you have ultimate truth,</v>

3464
01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:43.280
<v Speaker 1>ultimate access to information and the boundaries between people,</v>

3465
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:44.770
<v Speaker 1>that information are all gone.</v>

3466
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3467
01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:46.360
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to run a country?</v>

3468
01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3469
01:41:46.810 --> 01:41:47.111
<v Speaker 1>The sow,</v>

3470
01:41:47.111 --> 01:41:48.980
<v Speaker 1>the seeds of their own destruction are,</v>

3471
01:41:48.981 --> 01:41:52.060
<v Speaker 1>are already planted in the mechanisms they're putting in place.</v>

3472
01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:52.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3473
01:41:52.421 --> 01:41:53.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's,</v>

3474
01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:54.813
<v Speaker 1>they can't,</v>

3475
01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:56.710
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you ever seen,</v>

3476
01:41:56.740 --> 01:41:57.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3477
01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:57.651
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

3478
01:41:57.651 --> 01:42:01.060
<v Speaker 1>a method of hunting walls that the Eskimos use where they would take a very</v>

3479
01:42:01.061 --> 01:42:04.960
<v Speaker 1>sharp knife and put it in the ground and put blood on the knife and a wolf would</v>

3480
01:42:04.961 --> 01:42:08.560
<v Speaker 1>come along and start to lick the knife because of the blood on the knife,</v>

3481
01:42:08.561 --> 01:42:12.790
<v Speaker 1>taste his own blood and continued to lick and bite the blade and bleed to death.</v>

3482
01:42:12.850 --> 01:42:13.680
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

3483
01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:15.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a story that actually happens.</v>

3484
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3485
01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:16.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3486
01:42:16.061 --> 01:42:17.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a method that they,</v>

3487
01:42:17.171 --> 01:42:17.461
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3488
01:42:17.461 --> 01:42:20.620
<v Speaker 1>the nun people devised of hunting roles,</v>

3489
01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:24.810
<v Speaker 1>they would plant these knives in the ice and that's what our government's does.</v>

3490
01:42:24.850 --> 01:42:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3491
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.840
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

3492
01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:28.270
<v Speaker 1>They're licking their own blood and they don't even realize it.</v>

3493
01:42:28.271 --> 01:42:28.871
<v Speaker 1>But these things,</v>

3494
01:42:28.871 --> 01:42:30.910
<v Speaker 1>like the perfect example is,</v>

3495
01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know the story in our country of General Petraeus who was</v>

3496
01:42:34.751 --> 01:42:35.920
<v Speaker 1>the head of the CIA,</v>

3497
01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:39.370
<v Speaker 1>was exposed through the head of the CIA.</v>

3498
01:42:39.371 --> 01:42:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

3499
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:42.880
<v Speaker 1>that's supposedly the number one spy in the country,</v>

3500
01:42:42.881 --> 01:42:43.151
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3501
01:42:43.151 --> 01:42:43.984
<v Speaker 1>That's the head.</v>

3502
01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3503
01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:45.700
<v Speaker 1>he he was,</v>

3504
01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:50.790
<v Speaker 1>he was fired because it was exposed that he was having an affair and that affair</v>

3505
01:42:51.110 --> 01:42:54.100
<v Speaker 1>x fair was a s exposed through email exchanges.</v>

3506
01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3507
01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:57.070
<v Speaker 1>When the FBI examined the CIA,</v>

3508
01:42:57.490 --> 01:43:02.490
<v Speaker 1>the FBI is ratting on the CIA and getting rid of the number one CIA guy through</v>

3509
01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:04.413
<v Speaker 1>email,</v>

3510
01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:06.610
<v Speaker 1>through a transparency and email exchanges.</v>

3511
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.781
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3512
01:43:07.781 --> 01:43:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Completely fascinating.</v>

3513
01:43:08.931 --> 01:43:09.320
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

3514
01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:11.220
<v Speaker 1>It is because it's that this is the,</v>

3515
01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:15.240
<v Speaker 1>this is the main government entity that's involved in spine,</v>

3516
01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:16.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3517
01:43:16.031 --> 01:43:17.890
<v Speaker 1>other than the NSA and it's just,</v>

3518
01:43:17.891 --> 01:43:20.680
<v Speaker 1>it all like you guys are going to get exposed to,</v>

3519
01:43:20.710 --> 01:43:23.440
<v Speaker 1>everyone's going to get exposed is getting exposed and the,</v>

3520
01:43:23.441 --> 01:43:26.590
<v Speaker 1>the real problem isn't in affairs.</v>

3521
01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean affairs are obviously are an issue,</v>

3522
01:43:28.691 --> 01:43:33.610
<v Speaker 1>but the real problem is going to be in the structure of power itself and what</v>

3523
01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:38.080
<v Speaker 1>the influence is so clearly exposed the influence,</v>

3524
01:43:38.081 --> 01:43:40.330
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a special interest groups of corporations,</v>

3525
01:43:40.331 --> 01:43:41.470
<v Speaker 1>of lobbyists,</v>

3526
01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:42.371
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

3527
01:43:42.371 --> 01:43:46.930
<v Speaker 1>when it's so clearly exposed that it cannot be tolerated by rational people bear</v>

3528
01:43:46.931 --> 01:43:47.530
<v Speaker 1>it anymore.</v>

3529
01:43:47.530 --> 01:43:49.840
<v Speaker 1>There's this growing anger about all of this.</v>

3530
01:43:49.841 --> 01:43:50.720
<v Speaker 1>This is what the what the,</v>

3531
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:52.190
<v Speaker 1>the in the people</v>

3532
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:53.510
<v Speaker 4>in big government who are,</v>

3533
01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:57.690
<v Speaker 4>who are advocating this continual surveillance and invasion of our privacy in</v>

3534
01:43:57.691 --> 01:43:57.920
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>

3535
01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:58.580
<v Speaker 4>in every possible way.</v>

3536
01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:00.740
<v Speaker 4>They're not getting the anger in society.</v>

3537
01:44:00.741 --> 01:44:03.530
<v Speaker 4>People like just not prepared to put up with this shit any longer.</v>

3538
01:44:03.531 --> 01:44:07.310
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's a great thing because I think there's nothing wrong with</v>

3539
01:44:07.311 --> 01:44:07.941
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

3540
01:44:07.941 --> 01:44:10.970
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with having a mayor.</v>

3541
01:44:10.971 --> 01:44:12.530
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with having a president.</v>

3542
01:44:12.531 --> 01:44:16.940
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with police as long as everyone's honest and rational and</v>

3543
01:44:16.941 --> 01:44:18.470
<v Speaker 4>ethical truth is the key.</v>

3544
01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:21.020
<v Speaker 4>And they'll be forced to do that.</v>

3545
01:44:21.021 --> 01:44:24.770
<v Speaker 4>It's not like we're advocating that the government needs to be destroyed and</v>

3546
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:26.540
<v Speaker 4>anarchy nonsense.</v>

3547
01:44:26.541 --> 01:44:27.680
<v Speaker 4>We want honest government,</v>

3548
01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.270
<v Speaker 4>completely truth possible.</v>

3549
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:31.810
<v Speaker 4>And if it's forced then then,</v>

3550
01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:32.660
<v Speaker 4>then it's forced.</v>

3551
01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:37.190
<v Speaker 4>But if it's forced because of technology and innovation instead of some crazy</v>

3552
01:44:37.191 --> 01:44:39.140
<v Speaker 4>radical violent revolution,</v>

3553
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:40.520
<v Speaker 4>it's just as powerful,</v>

3554
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:41.660
<v Speaker 4>just as powerful to change.</v>

3555
01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:42.080
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

3556
01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:44.000
<v Speaker 4>California and undeniable,</v>

3557
01:44:44.050 --> 01:44:44.510
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3558
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:46.730
<v Speaker 4>Can't just build up a wall to keep the Internet out.</v>

3559
01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:47.240
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3560
01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:47.970
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3561
01:44:47.970 --> 01:44:48.410
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3562
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:48.771
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>

3563
01:44:48.771 --> 01:44:49.880
<v Speaker 4>Definitely not know the truth.</v>

3564
01:44:49.881 --> 01:44:51.260
<v Speaker 4>The truth is the truth is key.</v>

3565
01:44:51.261 --> 01:44:51.951
<v Speaker 4>This is what matters.</v>

3566
01:44:51.951 --> 01:44:54.350
<v Speaker 4>And also also those who go,</v>

3567
01:44:54.351 --> 01:44:54.620
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

3568
01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:57.020
<v Speaker 4>who go into into government.</v>

3569
01:44:58.220 --> 01:44:58.971
<v Speaker 4>They shouldn't be,</v>

3570
01:44:58.971 --> 01:45:01.730
<v Speaker 4>they shouldn't be this huge status and power associated with it.</v>

3571
01:45:01.731 --> 01:45:02.001
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3572
01:45:02.001 --> 01:45:02.241
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

3573
01:45:02.241 --> 01:45:02.520
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

3574
01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:03.290
<v Speaker 4>it's a mistake.</v>

3575
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:03.861
<v Speaker 4>It should be.</v>

3576
01:45:03.861 --> 01:45:04.551
<v Speaker 4>It should be done.</v>

3577
01:45:04.551 --> 01:45:08.230
<v Speaker 4>It should be the person who doesn't want to go into government.</v>

3578
01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:09.560
<v Speaker 4>That's the person who should be in government.</v>

3579
01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:10.551
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3580
01:45:10.551 --> 01:45:12.710
<v Speaker 4>It's unfortunate that that is how,</v>

3581
01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:15.080
<v Speaker 4>how it's been for a long time.</v>

3582
01:45:15.130 --> 01:45:16.720
<v Speaker 4>It's the people that should,</v>

3583
01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:18.900
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be president of the ones that want to be present.</v>

3584
01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:20.930
<v Speaker 4>It's been that way for a long time.</v>

3585
01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:21.800
<v Speaker 4>Give them Iowasca.</v>

3586
01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:26.570
<v Speaker 4>I would hope and I would hope also that the trend is moving.</v>

3587
01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:26.781
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3588
01:45:26.781 --> 01:45:30.380
<v Speaker 4>if you go back to these people that we're talking about that existed these pre</v>

3589
01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:33.080
<v Speaker 4>humans that existed 1.8 million years ago,</v>

3590
01:45:33.081 --> 01:45:35.060
<v Speaker 4>and the way they conducted each other,</v>

3591
01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:36.170
<v Speaker 4>conducted their lives,</v>

3592
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:40.010
<v Speaker 4>and then look at how we conduct our lives in 2013 it's been a massive,</v>

3593
01:45:40.011 --> 01:45:43.640
<v Speaker 4>incredible amount of progress and understanding each other that this trend will</v>

3594
01:45:43.641 --> 01:45:47.060
<v Speaker 4>continue and if we don't get hit by some kind of giant media,</v>

3595
01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:52.080
<v Speaker 4>that we will ultimately reach a level of understanding that will sort of make</v>

3596
01:45:54.591 --> 01:45:55.221
<v Speaker 4>this happen.</v>

3597
01:45:55.221 --> 01:45:57.400
<v Speaker 4>Whether or not psychedelics are involved or not,</v>

3598
01:45:57.410 --> 01:45:57.671
<v Speaker 4>that we'll,</v>

3599
01:45:57.671 --> 01:45:59.240
<v Speaker 4>we'll just reach this level.</v>

3600
01:45:59.270 --> 01:46:00.103
<v Speaker 4>As I say,</v>

3601
01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:01.130
<v Speaker 4>it's happening.</v>

3602
01:46:01.131 --> 01:46:01.611
<v Speaker 4>It's happening,</v>

3603
01:46:01.611 --> 01:46:02.540
<v Speaker 4>it's happening now.</v>

3604
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:05.390
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting that psychedelics are a catalyst in it.</v>

3605
01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:05.900
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3606
01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:06.131
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3607
01:46:06.131 --> 01:46:06.371
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3608
01:46:06.371 --> 01:46:10.040
<v Speaker 4>the come up again and again in the conversation and what it boils down to is</v>

3609
01:46:10.041 --> 01:46:10.580
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3610
01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:11.391
<v Speaker 4>the recognition,</v>

3611
01:46:11.391 --> 01:46:13.800
<v Speaker 4>and I've been banging on about this for a long time there,</v>

3612
01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:14.660
<v Speaker 4>the recognition of,</v>

3613
01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:18.650
<v Speaker 4>of the adult sovereign individual that we have a right to explore our own</v>

3614
01:46:18.651 --> 01:46:19.280
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>

3615
01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:24.280
<v Speaker 4>That is a grotesque invasion of our privacy and our sovereignty over our own</v>

3616
01:46:24.411 --> 01:46:26.150
<v Speaker 4>bodies that a government would,</v>

3617
01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:30.920
<v Speaker 4>would even have the temerity to suggest that it's got a right to punish us for</v>

3618
01:46:30.921 --> 01:46:31.630
<v Speaker 4>doing that.</v>

3619
01:46:31.630 --> 01:46:31.980
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

3620
01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:32.930
<v Speaker 4>this is the,</v>

3621
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:35.330
<v Speaker 4>it's not the issue of the psychedelics themselves.</v>

3622
01:46:35.331 --> 01:46:38.870
<v Speaker 4>It's the issue of the right to make sovereign decisions about our own bodies and</v>

3623
01:46:38.871 --> 01:46:39.651
<v Speaker 4>our own consciousness.</v>

3624
01:46:39.651 --> 01:46:39.981
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>

3625
01:46:39.981 --> 01:46:42.650
<v Speaker 4>I see a big awakening all over the world taking place,</v>

3626
01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:43.940
<v Speaker 4>Litmus test.</v>

3627
01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:44.571
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

3628
01:46:44.571 --> 01:46:45.021
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

3629
01:46:45.021 --> 01:46:48.690
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those things where we're going to look back on through history and</v>

3630
01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:50.310
<v Speaker 4>the way we look at the inquisition,</v>

3631
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:54.000
<v Speaker 3>the way we look at burning witches were we're going to look at the prosecution</v>

3632
01:46:54.001 --> 01:46:55.320
<v Speaker 3>of people for using psychedelics.</v>

3633
01:46:55.321 --> 01:46:58.350
<v Speaker 3>And it's just as ridiculous with horror as a,</v>

3634
01:46:58.351 --> 01:46:58.741
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

3635
01:46:58.741 --> 01:47:02.490
<v Speaker 3>as a horrific episode when human society made terrible mistakes.</v>

3636
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:05.820
<v Speaker 3>Your book supernatural is a fascinating book.</v>

3637
01:47:05.821 --> 01:47:06.840
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoyed that.</v>

3638
01:47:06.841 --> 01:47:08.930
<v Speaker 3>And that details the,</v>

3639
01:47:08.931 --> 01:47:13.931
<v Speaker 3>the concept of human beings learning from psychedelic experiences and actually</v>

3640
01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:19.800
<v Speaker 3>it giving birth to a new level of creativity and a new level of culture.</v>

3641
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:21.090
<v Speaker 3>I believe that,</v>

3642
01:47:21.091 --> 01:47:21.331
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3643
01:47:21.331 --> 01:47:22.260
<v Speaker 3>that there's,</v>

3644
01:47:22.261 --> 01:47:26.310
<v Speaker 3>there's no doubt that psychedelics have played a huge unrecognized role in the</v>

3645
01:47:26.311 --> 01:47:26.941
<v Speaker 3>human story.</v>

3646
01:47:26.941 --> 01:47:29.850
<v Speaker 3>And I want to pay tribute to Terence Mckenna for being one of the early people</v>

3647
01:47:29.851 --> 01:47:31.020
<v Speaker 3>to recognize that again,</v>

3648
01:47:31.021 --> 01:47:31.950
<v Speaker 3>in so many ways,</v>

3649
01:47:32.190 --> 01:47:33.090
<v Speaker 3>Terence mckenna,</v>

3650
01:47:33.150 --> 01:47:35.220
<v Speaker 3>just an incredible genius,</v>

3651
01:47:35.570 --> 01:47:35.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3652
01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:37.230
<v Speaker 3>that stoned ape theory that,</v>

3653
01:47:37.231 --> 01:47:37.500
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3654
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:37.770
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3655
01:47:37.770 --> 01:47:40.050
<v Speaker 3>that he came up with is absolutely key to this.</v>

3656
01:47:40.050 --> 01:47:40.381
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

3657
01:47:40.381 --> 01:47:43.410
<v Speaker 3>he was far ahead of his time academics followed behind him in this,</v>

3658
01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:48.800
<v Speaker 3>in this that we need to recognize that these demonized plants have played a huge</v>

3659
01:47:49.891 --> 01:47:51.270
<v Speaker 3>role in the human story.</v>

3660
01:47:51.271 --> 01:47:53.130
<v Speaker 3>Just in my recent travels in South America,</v>

3661
01:47:53.131 --> 01:47:55.980
<v Speaker 3>I was in a place called corral a 200,</v>

3662
01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:59.820
<v Speaker 3>200 kilometers north of Lima in Peru.</v>

3663
01:47:59.930 --> 01:48:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3664
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:01.920
<v Speaker 3>now back in the 90s,</v>

3665
01:48:01.921 --> 01:48:03.450
<v Speaker 3>people were saying that there was no,</v>

3666
01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:07.350
<v Speaker 3>that could be no relationship between old world pyramids and New World Pyramids</v>

3667
01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:09.720
<v Speaker 3>because all the pyramids in the new world were much younger.</v>

3668
01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:14.610
<v Speaker 3>That story is now gone as a result of chorale and another site ban Doria in</v>

3669
01:48:14.611 --> 01:48:14.971
<v Speaker 3>Peru,</v>

3670
01:48:14.971 --> 01:48:19.230
<v Speaker 3>which are definitively 2,500 to 3000 BC,</v>

3671
01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:21.150
<v Speaker 3>the same date that is put on the,</v>

3672
01:48:21.151 --> 01:48:22.620
<v Speaker 3>the Great Pyramids of Giza.</v>

3673
01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:25.500
<v Speaker 3>And what's fascinating at Caroll is a couple of things.</v>

3674
01:48:25.501 --> 01:48:26.310
<v Speaker 3>Firstly,</v>

3675
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:30.810
<v Speaker 3>there was a big city complex there 5,000 years ago and absolutely no evidence of</v>

3676
01:48:30.811 --> 01:48:31.920
<v Speaker 3>warfare whatsoever.</v>

3677
01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:33.930
<v Speaker 3>It was traditionally it was believed that,</v>

3678
01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:34.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3679
01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:39.240
<v Speaker 3>the evolution of cities was connected with warfare in some way that people came</v>

3680
01:48:39.241 --> 01:48:41.280
<v Speaker 3>in to cities to protect themselves from war.</v>

3681
01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:42.450
<v Speaker 3>No warfare,</v>

3682
01:48:42.510 --> 01:48:43.290
<v Speaker 3>none whatsoever.</v>

3683
01:48:43.290 --> 01:48:44.460
<v Speaker 3>These people did not make war.</v>

3684
01:48:44.461 --> 01:48:44.911
<v Speaker 3>Secondly,</v>

3685
01:48:44.911 --> 01:48:46.140
<v Speaker 3>they were using psychedelics,</v>

3686
01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:47.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3687
01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:48.540
<v Speaker 3>quite clear evidence of this.</v>

3688
01:48:48.610 --> 01:48:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3689
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:49.980
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

3690
01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:54.750
<v Speaker 3>this unexamined part of the human story needs to be brought back into prominence</v>

3691
01:48:54.751 --> 01:48:58.590
<v Speaker 3>and we need to realize we owe a lot to the visionary plants and we're making a</v>

3692
01:48:58.591 --> 01:49:00.870
<v Speaker 3>mistake to create a society that seeks to cut,</v>

3693
01:49:01.050 --> 01:49:04.920
<v Speaker 3>cut us off from that source of learning and that source of teaching.</v>

3694
01:49:04.921 --> 01:49:08.040
<v Speaker 3>It's not an accident in the Amazon that they call these plants teachers.</v>

3695
01:49:08.130 --> 01:49:08.970
<v Speaker 3>They are teachers.</v>

3696
01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:11.900
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's also very fascinating that the,</v>

3697
01:49:11.901 --> 01:49:15.420
<v Speaker 3>the academic world has in many ways,</v>

3698
01:49:15.421 --> 01:49:15.810
<v Speaker 3>in many ways,</v>

3699
01:49:15.810 --> 01:49:18.900
<v Speaker 3>especially the older academic world that grew up without the internet,</v>

3700
01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:22.890
<v Speaker 3>has turned their back on the concept of psychedelics being beneficial to the</v>

3701
01:49:22.891 --> 01:49:26.370
<v Speaker 3>point where it's laughed at and Poo pooed to the point where it Mckenna's</v>

3702
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Psychedelic,</v>

3703
01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:30.150
<v Speaker 3>a stoned ape theory is if you don't know the theory,</v>

3704
01:49:30.151 --> 01:49:33.180
<v Speaker 3>his theory involves the evolution of humans,</v>

3705
01:49:33.181 --> 01:49:36.930
<v Speaker 3>the doubling of the human brain size directly related to the consumption of</v>

3706
01:49:36.931 --> 01:49:37.890
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic mushrooms.</v>

3707
01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:39.780
<v Speaker 3>It's an incredibly controversial theory,</v>

3708
01:49:39.781 --> 01:49:42.270
<v Speaker 3>but when I had Dennis Mckenna on the podcast,</v>

3709
01:49:42.271 --> 01:49:47.271
<v Speaker 3>Dennis explained it in a very scientific way that would show how the psych,</v>

3710
01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 3>the</v>

3711
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:51.370
<v Speaker 4>consumption of psychedelic mushrooms would correlate with the creating of</v>

3712
01:49:51.371 --> 01:49:52.204
<v Speaker 4>language,</v>

3713
01:49:52.210 --> 01:49:53.740
<v Speaker 4>with the expansion of consciousness.</v>

3714
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.370
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3715
01:49:54.370 --> 01:49:59.370
<v Speaker 4>it's an incredibly intricate and detailed idea that's completely ignored by so</v>

3716
01:50:00.521 --> 01:50:01.630
<v Speaker 4>many mainstream people,</v>

3717
01:50:01.631 --> 01:50:04.000
<v Speaker 4>but if they have had,</v>

3718
01:50:04.510 --> 01:50:04.841
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

3719
01:50:04.841 --> 01:50:07.750
<v Speaker 4>if they have had any psychedelic experience themselves,</v>

3720
01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:12.010
<v Speaker 4>they would know what an incredibly different experience that is.</v>

3721
01:50:12.011 --> 01:50:13.840
<v Speaker 4>Then the normal state of consciousness.</v>

3722
01:50:14.230 --> 01:50:15.910
<v Speaker 4>If you were looking for a culprit,</v>

3723
01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:20.980
<v Speaker 4>a thing that would change conscious beings or intelligent beings like lower</v>

3724
01:50:20.981 --> 01:50:21.814
<v Speaker 4>hominids,</v>

3725
01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:25.420
<v Speaker 4>something that would just rock them out of their current state.</v>

3726
01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:27.030
<v Speaker 4>What better thing than,</v>

3727
01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:28.150
<v Speaker 4>than psychedelic trucks?</v>

3728
01:50:28.151 --> 01:50:30.640
<v Speaker 4>What other culprits that you could connect to?</v>

3729
01:50:30.641 --> 01:50:32.500
<v Speaker 4>A doubling of the human brain size?</v>

3730
01:50:32.710 --> 01:50:36.310
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it attributed to a bunch of different things like consumption of fish,</v>

3731
01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:36.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3732
01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:38.350
<v Speaker 4>through the throwing arm,</v>

3733
01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:41.770
<v Speaker 4>all these different things like don't bears eat fish,</v>

3734
01:50:41.771 --> 01:50:42.750
<v Speaker 4>not these stupid as fuck.</v>

3735
01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:47.530
<v Speaker 4>I guess the Omega threes would help a little,</v>

3736
01:50:47.531 --> 01:50:48.364
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>

3737
01:50:49.150 --> 01:50:52.980
<v Speaker 4>what's humans are a different thing that humans are very different thing.</v>

3738
01:50:52.981 --> 01:50:53.270
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3739
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.921
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

3740
01:50:53.921 --> 01:50:54.310
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3741
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:55.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean I have,</v>

3742
01:50:55.090 --> 01:50:58.090
<v Speaker 4>I have no doubt in my mind it was psychedelics that played that role.</v>

3743
01:50:58.091 --> 01:50:59.940
<v Speaker 4>And this was one thing that I looked at in,</v>

3744
01:50:59.941 --> 01:51:00.250
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

3745
01:51:00.250 --> 01:51:01.540
<v Speaker 4>in supernatural was,</v>

3746
01:51:01.541 --> 01:51:04.720
<v Speaker 4>was this whole issue of the cave art because that's where,</v>

3747
01:51:04.890 --> 01:51:05.171
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3748
01:51:05.171 --> 01:51:08.770
<v Speaker 4>that's where in the long evolutionary story of the human species,</v>

3749
01:51:08.771 --> 01:51:10.900
<v Speaker 4>you suddenly find us confronting ourselves.</v>

3750
01:51:10.901 --> 01:51:13.050
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at this amazing symbolic art,</v>

3751
01:51:13.051 --> 01:51:13.960
<v Speaker 4>this incredible,</v>

3752
01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:15.280
<v Speaker 4>incredible works.</v>

3753
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:15.760
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3754
01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:20.760
<v Speaker 4>and these very mysterious Erie spaces that you go into like the Cape of Lesko.</v>

3755
01:51:22.210 --> 01:51:22.720
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3756
01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:23.171
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3757
01:51:23.171 --> 01:51:23.620
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3758
01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:25.150
<v Speaker 4>from the nature of the art itself,</v>

3759
01:51:25.151 --> 01:51:26.680
<v Speaker 4>it's clear it was visionary art.</v>

3760
01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:27.221
<v Speaker 4>These were,</v>

3761
01:51:27.221 --> 01:51:30.040
<v Speaker 4>these were people who were working with psychedelics and painting their visions</v>

3762
01:51:30.041 --> 01:51:31.840
<v Speaker 4>just as Sherman's doing the Amazon today.</v>

3763
01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:34.150
<v Speaker 4>Did you see Werner Herzog's documentary?</v>

3764
01:51:34.151 --> 01:51:37.250
<v Speaker 4>I did cave of a shy dreams about Chavon.</v>

3765
01:51:37.310 --> 01:51:38.143
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3766
01:51:38.370 --> 01:51:41.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean it wasn't that like 40,000 plus years ago.</v>

3767
01:51:41.021 --> 01:51:46.021
<v Speaker 4>The stuff 33 or 33,000 years ago gave a show bay amazing,</v>

3768
01:51:46.331 --> 01:51:47.164
<v Speaker 4>amazing place.</v>

3769
01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:47.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3770
01:51:47.690 --> 01:51:50.590
<v Speaker 4>Just so strange to think that these Pete,</v>

3771
01:51:50.591 --> 01:51:52.240
<v Speaker 4>but it's so hard for us to,</v>

3772
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:53.680
<v Speaker 4>when you get to a number,</v>

3773
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:54.970
<v Speaker 4>even a thousand years,</v>

3774
01:51:54.971 --> 01:51:56.560
<v Speaker 4>it's like I can't see it.</v>

3775
01:51:56.650 --> 01:51:57.011
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

3776
01:51:57.011 --> 01:51:57.880
<v Speaker 4>it's too far away.</v>

3777
01:51:58.210 --> 01:52:00.220
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like it's over the curve of the earth.</v>

3778
01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:04.870
<v Speaker 4>It's like a thousand years to wrap my head around what it was like during the</v>

3779
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:06.010
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] era,</v>

3780
01:52:06.050 --> 01:52:06.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3781
01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:08.030
<v Speaker 4>nevermind 33,000.</v>

3782
01:52:08.050 --> 01:52:08.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3783
01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.870
<v Speaker 4>That's where it gets like incredibly squirly.</v>

3784
01:52:11.170 --> 01:52:13.870
<v Speaker 4>And when you talk to guys like John Anthony West,</v>

3785
01:52:13.871 --> 01:52:18.400
<v Speaker 4>it started talking about the hieroglyphs that depict a civil is ancient and not</v>

3786
01:52:18.401 --> 01:52:18.881
<v Speaker 4>just that,</v>

3787
01:52:18.881 --> 01:52:22.540
<v Speaker 4>but named the Pharaohs of 30 plus thousand years ago.</v>

3788
01:52:22.541 --> 01:52:23.374
<v Speaker 4>It's loosely,</v>

3789
01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:24.220
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

3790
01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:26.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is something that really annoys me about Egypt.</v>

3791
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:29.290
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] John Anthony West is just such a brilliant man.</v>

3792
01:52:29.291 --> 01:52:29.950
<v Speaker 4>He's an old,</v>

3793
01:52:29.950 --> 01:52:32.320
<v Speaker 4>old friend of mine going wait way back to the 90s.</v>

3794
01:52:32.330 --> 01:52:32.651
<v Speaker 4>Super,</v>

3795
01:52:32.651 --> 01:52:34.390
<v Speaker 4>Super Guy and he's done so much to,</v>

3796
01:52:34.690 --> 01:52:36.910
<v Speaker 4>to bring to light the mysteries and the,</v>

3797
01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:37.900
<v Speaker 4>and the magic of,</v>

3798
01:52:37.930 --> 01:52:38.770
<v Speaker 4>of ancient Egypt.</v>

3799
01:52:38.771 --> 01:52:41.080
<v Speaker 4>And he's absolutely right because you go to the temple of Seti,</v>

3800
01:52:41.081 --> 01:52:44.470
<v Speaker 4>the first and the avatars and you will see a mural,</v>

3801
01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:46.280
<v Speaker 4>a cop in high relief</v>

3802
01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:46.451
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

3803
01:52:46.451 --> 01:52:48.290
<v Speaker 3>on a wall in the Cardo was shows,</v>

3804
01:52:48.610 --> 01:52:49.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3805
01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:49.941
<v Speaker 3>the pharaoh Seti,</v>

3806
01:52:49.941 --> 01:52:52.640
<v Speaker 3>the first showing his young son Ramesses the second,</v>

3807
01:52:52.641 --> 01:52:55.220
<v Speaker 3>the list of all the pharaohs who've ruled before their time.</v>

3808
01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:57.230
<v Speaker 3>Now this is called a king list.</v>

3809
01:52:57.530 --> 01:52:58.700
<v Speaker 3>And the Egyptologists,</v>

3810
01:52:58.701 --> 01:53:03.701
<v Speaker 3>they take these king lists and they use them as the basis for the chronology</v>

3811
01:53:03.861 --> 01:53:05.390
<v Speaker 3>that we are given of ancient Egypt.</v>

3812
01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:08.420
<v Speaker 3>As long as it fits into their reference frame.</v>

3813
01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:09.590
<v Speaker 3>So the king list is,</v>

3814
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:10.611
<v Speaker 3>is fine.</v>

3815
01:53:10.611 --> 01:53:12.980
<v Speaker 3>It's accepted back to 3000 BC.</v>

3816
01:53:12.981 --> 01:53:15.620
<v Speaker 3>The first dentisty when civilization is supposed to have begun,</v>

3817
01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:19.790
<v Speaker 3>they then completely ignore the fact that the king list continues long before</v>

3818
01:53:19.791 --> 01:53:21.680
<v Speaker 3>that for tens of thousands of years,</v>

3819
01:53:21.681 --> 01:53:26.210
<v Speaker 3>as much as 36,000 years before that lists of pharaohs and the time when the gods</v>

3820
01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:26.870
<v Speaker 3>walked the earth.</v>

3821
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:28.790
<v Speaker 3>All of this is in the king lists as well.</v>

3822
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.600
<v Speaker 3>So the fee,</v>

3823
01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:29.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3824
01:53:29.871 --> 01:53:33.650
<v Speaker 3>the Egyptologist grab the bit that fits their prejudice and ignore the rest and</v>

3825
01:53:33.651 --> 01:53:33.831
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

3826
01:53:33.831 --> 01:53:34.100
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>

3827
01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:36.590
<v Speaker 3>The ancient Egyptians were just making that up.</v>

3828
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:37.251
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3829
01:53:37.251 --> 01:53:41.690
<v Speaker 3>And then there's of course the water erosion on the Sphinx that John Anthony</v>

3830
01:53:41.690 --> 01:53:43.410
<v Speaker 3>West and Robert Schoch exposure actually.</v>

3831
01:53:43.411 --> 01:53:44.600
<v Speaker 3>So really,</v>

3832
01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:46.070
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

3833
01:53:46.071 --> 01:53:49.650
<v Speaker 3>one of the most undeniable things that I've heard people deny.</v>

3834
01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:50.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3835
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.361
<v Speaker 3>It's one,</v>

3836
01:53:50.361 --> 01:53:55.361
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the most of it is one of the most important pieces of evidence for a</v>

3837
01:53:55.641 --> 01:53:56.780
<v Speaker 3>lost civilization.</v>

3838
01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:57.031
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

3839
01:53:57.031 --> 01:53:57.221
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3840
01:53:57.221 --> 01:53:57.531
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3841
01:53:57.531 --> 01:54:00.830
<v Speaker 3>and this is John Anthony West and professor Robert Schoch at Boston University.</v>

3842
01:54:00.831 --> 01:54:01.201
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

3843
01:54:01.201 --> 01:54:01.730
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3844
01:54:01.730 --> 01:54:06.110
<v Speaker 3>the evidence that the Great Sphinx was rained upon for thousands and thousands</v>

3845
01:54:06.110 --> 01:54:06.440
<v Speaker 3>of years.</v>

3846
01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:06.830
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

3847
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:07.340
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

3848
01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:08.420
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting,</v>

3849
01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:09.430
<v Speaker 3>and again got Beckley,</v>

3850
01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:11.000
<v Speaker 3>he comes into this story,</v>

3851
01:54:11.330 --> 01:54:14.210
<v Speaker 3>is that Egypt ologists at the time said,</v>

3852
01:54:14.211 --> 01:54:14.540
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3853
01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:17.630
<v Speaker 3>there's no way that the Sphinx could be 12,000 years old.</v>

3854
01:54:17.631 --> 01:54:22.070
<v Speaker 3>The geological evidence must be wrong because if there was a culture that was</v>

3855
01:54:22.071 --> 01:54:25.610
<v Speaker 3>capable of creating a monument on the scale of the Sphinx 12,000 years ago,</v>

3856
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:26.001
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3857
01:54:26.001 --> 01:54:26.210
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

3858
01:54:26.210 --> 01:54:29.060
<v Speaker 3>We would find other monuments that are 12,000 years old,</v>

3859
01:54:29.090 --> 01:54:29.990
<v Speaker 3>other big monuments.</v>

3860
01:54:29.991 --> 01:54:33.950
<v Speaker 3>And they regarded that as the killer argument against the geological weathering</v>

3861
01:54:33.951 --> 01:54:34.371
<v Speaker 3>of this thing.</v>

3862
01:54:34.371 --> 01:54:35.001
<v Speaker 3>So that you know,</v>

3863
01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:37.010
<v Speaker 3>that shock and West must just be wrong.</v>

3864
01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:37.311
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3865
01:54:37.311 --> 01:54:41.630
<v Speaker 3>now we have good Beckley Tempe and it is 12,000 years old and it is on the scale</v>

3866
01:54:41.631 --> 01:54:42.150
<v Speaker 3>of this things.</v>

3867
01:54:42.150 --> 01:54:44.030
<v Speaker 3>And it's not even that far from this things,</v>

3868
01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:44.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3869
01:54:44.751 --> 01:54:45.760
<v Speaker 3>and suddenly the,</v>

3870
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.981
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3871
01:54:45.981 --> 01:54:47.900
<v Speaker 3>that old argument about the Sphinx,</v>

3872
01:54:47.901 --> 01:54:51.230
<v Speaker 3>which was dismissed by academia back in the 90s,</v>

3873
01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:52.820
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have to reconsider it very,</v>

3874
01:54:52.821 --> 01:54:53.031
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

3875
01:54:53.031 --> 01:54:53.720
<v Speaker 3>very carefully.</v>

3876
01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:57.200
<v Speaker 3>That Charlton Heston hosted documentary on the Sphinx,</v>

3877
01:54:57.201 --> 01:54:58.034
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>

3878
01:54:58.040 --> 01:54:59.330
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was on NBC.</v>

3879
01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:00.193
<v Speaker 3>It was on NBC.</v>

3880
01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:00.950
<v Speaker 3>I watched it.</v>

3881
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:05.000
<v Speaker 3>I found an incredibly fascinating but in infuriating when you hear that</v>

3882
01:55:05.001 --> 01:55:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Egyptologist just laughing at Robert Schoch saying,</v>

3883
01:55:08.481 --> 01:55:10.010
<v Speaker 3>where's the evidence of this culture?</v>

3884
01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Show me the pot shit.</v>

3885
01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3886
01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:12.680
<v Speaker 3>And what's crazy is,</v>

3887
01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:17.480
<v Speaker 3>what do you think would be there when you're dealing with something that's that</v>

3888
01:55:17.481 --> 01:55:17.810
<v Speaker 3>old?</v>

3889
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:18.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3890
01:55:18.290 --> 01:55:19.310
<v Speaker 3>and when,</v>

3891
01:55:19.311 --> 01:55:20.001
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>

3892
01:55:20.001 --> 01:55:22.130
<v Speaker 3>about a thousand years being over the horizon,</v>

3893
01:55:22.131 --> 01:55:22.964
<v Speaker 3>I can't see it.</v>

3894
01:55:23.150 --> 01:55:24.380
<v Speaker 3>12,000 years,</v>

3895
01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:27.170
<v Speaker 3>you might as well just be speaking another language.</v>

3896
01:55:27.171 --> 01:55:28.004
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand.</v>

3897
01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:32.120
<v Speaker 3>My stupid brain can't wrap my head around how long ago that is.</v>

3898
01:55:32.150 --> 01:55:32.481
<v Speaker 3>Terribly.</v>

3899
01:55:32.481 --> 01:55:32.811
<v Speaker 3>Terribly.</v>

3900
01:55:32.811 --> 01:55:33.091
<v Speaker 3>A little bit.</v>

3901
01:55:33.091 --> 01:55:37.400
<v Speaker 3>What would be left if you left a car outside for 12,000 years,</v>

3902
01:55:37.401 --> 01:55:40.040
<v Speaker 3>you came back 12,000 years later thing you'd find zero.</v>

3903
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.700
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

3904
01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:41.580
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely nothing.</v>

3905
01:55:41.581 --> 01:55:42.950
<v Speaker 3>The earth would just reabsorb it.</v>

3906
01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3907
01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:46.410
<v Speaker 3>What would be laughing and what would be left would be the stones.</v>

3908
01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:46.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3909
01:55:46.890 --> 01:55:47.790
<v Speaker 3>and that's what we're,</v>

3910
01:55:47.791 --> 01:55:48.810
<v Speaker 3>that's what we're left with.</v>

3911
01:55:49.050 --> 01:55:51.450
<v Speaker 3>I was just in tea when Arco in Bolivia,</v>

3912
01:55:51.451 --> 01:55:52.284
<v Speaker 3>and there are,</v>

3913
01:55:52.410 --> 01:55:53.790
<v Speaker 3>there are stone structures.</v>

3914
01:55:53.791 --> 01:55:55.440
<v Speaker 3>They're beautifully cut,</v>

3915
01:55:55.770 --> 01:55:58.230
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable precision cutting of the stone.</v>

3916
01:55:58.530 --> 01:56:01.140
<v Speaker 3>They looked to me like they had metal parts fitted into them.</v>

3917
01:56:01.290 --> 01:56:02.760
<v Speaker 3>At some point the metals gone,</v>

3918
01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:06.900
<v Speaker 3>the stone is left and where we're left to wonder what was going on there.</v>

3919
01:56:06.901 --> 01:56:07.560
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

3920
01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:11.190
<v Speaker 3>the passage of time rubs out all memory and all traces and,</v>

3921
01:56:11.191 --> 01:56:11.580
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3922
01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:12.000
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3923
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.360
<v Speaker 3>and it's very easy to get the wrong idea about the past.</v>

3924
01:56:15.361 --> 01:56:19.110
<v Speaker 3>But places like Rebecca TAPI pieces like good on padding in Indonesia are going</v>

3925
01:56:19.111 --> 01:56:19.944
<v Speaker 3>to change this.</v>

3926
01:56:20.130 --> 01:56:20.550
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

3927
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:22.980
<v Speaker 3>what year did people start using metal?</v>

3928
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:24.833
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3929
01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:25.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3930
01:56:25.081 --> 01:56:26.400
<v Speaker 3>the ancient Egyptians,</v>

3931
01:56:26.610 --> 01:56:26.941
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3932
01:56:26.941 --> 01:56:27.240
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3933
01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:27.560
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3934
01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:29.120
<v Speaker 3>they didn't make that,</v>

3935
01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:29.661
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

3936
01:56:29.661 --> 01:56:31.110
<v Speaker 3>they knew meteoritic ion.</v>

3937
01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:34.530
<v Speaker 3>The only form of iron that was available to the ancient Egyptians was iron that</v>

3938
01:56:34.531 --> 01:56:35.700
<v Speaker 3>came in and meatier rights.</v>

3939
01:56:35.730 --> 01:56:39.420
<v Speaker 3>And there is the odd knife that's been crafted from meteoritic iron,</v>

3940
01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:41.430
<v Speaker 3>but the metal that they used,</v>

3941
01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:43.800
<v Speaker 3>if you go back to 3000 or 2000,</v>

3942
01:56:43.801 --> 01:56:45.360
<v Speaker 3>800 BC was copper.</v>

3943
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:46.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3944
01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:48.240
<v Speaker 3>but they had a way of hardening the copper,</v>

3945
01:56:48.690 --> 01:56:49.021
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3946
01:56:49.021 --> 01:56:49.411
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

3947
01:56:49.411 --> 01:56:51.870
<v Speaker 3>some loss technique of making the copper harder.</v>

3948
01:56:51.930 --> 01:56:52.380
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

3949
01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:54.390
<v Speaker 3>that was definitely definitely present.</v>

3950
01:56:54.430 --> 01:56:56.850
<v Speaker 3>How do we know this is the Orthodox view that I wrote because,</v>

3951
01:56:56.851 --> 01:56:59.900
<v Speaker 3>because the couple was used to cut stone and copy your card.</v>

3952
01:56:59.910 --> 01:57:03.930
<v Speaker 3>Cut Stone with copper is way too soft so they must have been some method of</v>

3953
01:57:03.931 --> 01:57:05.190
<v Speaker 3>making the copper harder.</v>

3954
01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:05.581
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

3955
01:57:05.581 --> 01:57:06.361
<v Speaker 3>this is the argument,</v>

3956
01:57:06.361 --> 01:57:07.860
<v Speaker 3>but that this is the orthodox view.</v>

3957
01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3958
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:09.930
<v Speaker 3>we don't really know.</v>

3959
01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:10.291
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3960
01:57:10.291 --> 01:57:10.680
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3961
01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:13.470
<v Speaker 3>what they had and maybe metal wasn't the only way to cut stone.</v>

3962
01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:15.780
<v Speaker 3>This is where I'd maybe get a little bit mystical,</v>

3963
01:57:15.781 --> 01:57:16.860
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you know,</v>

3964
01:57:16.861 --> 01:57:20.760
<v Speaker 3>because our society has done things a certain way that we use mechanical</v>

3965
01:57:20.761 --> 01:57:24.660
<v Speaker 3>advantage that we use machine tools that we want to look for that in the past.</v>

3966
01:57:24.661 --> 01:57:25.380
<v Speaker 3>But maybe,</v>

3967
01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:29.160
<v Speaker 3>maybe there are all sorts of untapped faculties of the human mind that the</v>

3968
01:57:29.161 --> 01:57:30.670
<v Speaker 3>ancients were working with in,</v>

3969
01:57:30.671 --> 01:57:31.410
<v Speaker 3>in one way or another.</v>

3970
01:57:31.410 --> 01:57:36.410
<v Speaker 3>Certainly when you go to a place like one man in Peru outside of Cusco and you</v>

3971
01:57:36.811 --> 01:57:39.210
<v Speaker 3>see these gigantic blocks of stone hundred,</v>

3972
01:57:39.210 --> 01:57:39.841
<v Speaker 3>hundred and 50 tons,</v>

3973
01:57:39.841 --> 01:57:42.090
<v Speaker 3>each fit it together like jigsaw puzzle,</v>

3974
01:57:42.091 --> 01:57:44.340
<v Speaker 3>the edges kind of melting into one another.</v>

3975
01:57:44.610 --> 01:57:48.360
<v Speaker 3>The notion that some sort of heat might've been used to shape these stones</v>

3976
01:57:48.361 --> 01:57:49.920
<v Speaker 3>begins to make a weird kind of sense,</v>

3977
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:51.660
<v Speaker 3>some sort of heat heat here.</v>

3978
01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:53.070
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>

3979
01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:54.810
<v Speaker 3>And there's vitrified stone up there.</v>

3980
01:57:54.811 --> 01:57:55.360
<v Speaker 3>I've in,</v>

3981
01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:56.580
<v Speaker 3>in my journey in Peru,</v>

3982
01:57:56.581 --> 01:57:57.090
<v Speaker 3>I spent,</v>

3983
01:57:57.090 --> 01:58:00.030
<v Speaker 3>I spent several days with a local guy called hey Swisscom morrow,</v>

3984
01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:02.160
<v Speaker 3>who is now 77 years old.</v>

3985
01:58:02.161 --> 01:58:02.994
<v Speaker 3>And his father,</v>

3986
01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:04.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid O'mara,</v>

3987
01:58:04.770 --> 01:58:05.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3988
01:58:05.250 --> 01:58:07.800
<v Speaker 3>was working on that site back at the,</v>

3989
01:58:07.801 --> 01:58:09.300
<v Speaker 3>at the beginning of the 19 hundreds.</v>

3990
01:58:09.630 --> 01:58:10.110
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3991
01:58:10.110 --> 01:58:10.561
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3992
01:58:10.561 --> 01:58:11.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3993
01:58:11.250 --> 01:58:15.540
<v Speaker 3>they as a family have been studying the megaliths of the Andes for,</v>

3994
01:58:15.630 --> 01:58:17.190
<v Speaker 3>for a hundred plus years now.</v>

3995
01:58:17.550 --> 01:58:20.340
<v Speaker 3>And they are actually descended from the anchors.</v>

3996
01:58:20.910 --> 01:58:24.540
<v Speaker 3>So you would think if anybody had an investment in saying that the ink has made</v>

3997
01:58:24.541 --> 01:58:24.841
<v Speaker 3>all this,</v>

3998
01:58:24.841 --> 01:58:25.411
<v Speaker 3>it would be them.</v>

3999
01:58:25.411 --> 01:58:26.161
<v Speaker 3>But they say no,</v>

4000
01:58:26.161 --> 01:58:27.390
<v Speaker 3>he's just Gomorrah is adamant.</v>

4001
01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:32.010
<v Speaker 3>The inkers have been wrongly handed the majority of the architecture in the</v>

4002
01:58:32.011 --> 01:58:33.210
<v Speaker 3>Andes by archaeology.</v>

4003
01:58:33.211 --> 01:58:36.870
<v Speaker 3>The Incas only did a fraction of it and most of what they did was pretty poor</v>

4004
01:58:36.871 --> 01:58:37.704
<v Speaker 3>quality.</v>

4005
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:41.380
<v Speaker 3>The great stuff was done by earliest civilizations and he took me and he showed</v>

4006
01:58:41.381 --> 01:58:42.400
<v Speaker 3>me vitrified stone,</v>

4007
01:58:42.401 --> 01:58:44.960
<v Speaker 3>which has been subjected to fantastic heat and,</v>

4008
01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:46.750
<v Speaker 3>and melted and shines in a,</v>

4009
01:58:46.751 --> 01:58:47.840
<v Speaker 3>in a way that's um,</v>

4010
01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:50.920
<v Speaker 3>really stunning and striking and convincing when you see it.</v>

4011
01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:51.581
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4012
01:58:51.581 --> 01:58:55.600
<v Speaker 3>that some kind of technology that is not the technology that we use today was</v>

4013
01:58:55.601 --> 01:58:57.910
<v Speaker 3>being employed to put these stones into place.</v>

4014
01:58:57.911 --> 01:59:01.060
<v Speaker 3>And archeologists have dismissed such ideas for a very long time,</v>

4015
01:59:01.061 --> 01:59:03.280
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not sure how much longer they're going to be able to dismiss them.</v>

4016
01:59:03.370 --> 01:59:08.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they can dismiss those enormous stones that have strange shapes</v>

4017
01:59:08.801 --> 01:59:11.140
<v Speaker 3>that are fitting like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle.</v>

4018
01:59:11.141 --> 01:59:11.830
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

4019
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:13.990
<v Speaker 3>it was like giants a hundred feet tall,</v>

4020
01:59:14.170 --> 01:59:16.530
<v Speaker 3>decided to make a three dimensional jigsaw puzzle.</v>

4021
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:18.730
<v Speaker 3>Tell Jimmy what those images would be to pull those up.</v>

4022
01:59:18.731 --> 01:59:19.400
<v Speaker 3>What would they be?</v>

4023
01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:20.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4024
01:59:20.230 --> 01:59:21.910
<v Speaker 3>I maybe if I show you an image,</v>

4025
01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:25.750
<v Speaker 3>have him pull OkayWell Saksaywaman as a c,</v>

4026
01:59:25.751 --> 01:59:26.740
<v Speaker 3>s a y,</v>

4027
01:59:26.741 --> 01:59:27.101
<v Speaker 3>h.</v>

4028
01:59:27.101 --> 01:59:27.281
<v Speaker 3>U.</v>

4029
01:59:27.281 --> 01:59:29.680
<v Speaker 3>A M a n say,</v>

4030
01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:31.113
<v Speaker 3>and is also,</v>

4031
01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:36.120
<v Speaker 3>there's one stone that Giorgio sucralose showed me where it was carved out of</v>

4032
01:59:36.251 --> 01:59:38.560
<v Speaker 3>this piece of stone.</v>

4033
01:59:38.590 --> 01:59:43.590
<v Speaker 3>There's this slab carved through the back of it and removed and they don't have</v>

4034
01:59:46.751 --> 01:59:49.390
<v Speaker 3>no idea how they got through this stone and Co.</v>

4035
01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:49.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4036
01:59:49.630 --> 01:59:50.530
<v Speaker 3>they look at that image.</v>

4037
01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:51.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

4038
01:59:52.690 --> 01:59:53.510
<v Speaker 3>That's me.</v>

4039
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:54.910
<v Speaker 3>Which we'll pull it towards you.</v>

4040
01:59:54.911 --> 01:59:55.744
<v Speaker 3>This word,</v>

4041
01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:56.890
<v Speaker 3>this way.</v>

4042
01:59:56.890 --> 01:59:57.101
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4043
01:59:57.101 --> 01:59:57.251
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4044
01:59:57.251 --> 01:59:57.371
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4045
01:59:57.371 --> 01:59:57.491
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4046
01:59:57.491 --> 01:59:57.671
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4047
01:59:57.671 --> 01:59:57.821
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4048
01:59:57.821 --> 01:59:58.060
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4049
01:59:58.060 --> 01:59:58.691
<v Speaker 3>Just flatten.</v>

4050
01:59:58.691 --> 01:59:59.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4051
01:59:59.110 --> 01:59:59.943
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

4052
02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:00.820
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

4053
02:00:00.820 --> 02:00:03.210
<v Speaker 3>That's you standing next to me standing next,</v>

4054
02:00:03.370 --> 02:00:06.670
<v Speaker 3>standing next to that stone and look at the way those studs are fitted together.</v>

4055
02:00:06.671 --> 02:00:07.031
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4056
02:00:07.031 --> 02:00:07.271
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4057
02:00:07.271 --> 02:00:07.630
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

4058
02:00:07.630 --> 02:00:09.310
<v Speaker 3>there's a really monstrous thing to do.</v>

4059
02:00:09.311 --> 02:00:09.721
<v Speaker 3>It's a jet,</v>

4060
02:00:09.721 --> 02:00:13.650
<v Speaker 3>just a gigantic work of art that they've created and,</v>

4061
02:00:13.670 --> 02:00:15.340
<v Speaker 3>and it goes on for hundreds of feet.</v>

4062
02:00:15.370 --> 02:00:16.320
<v Speaker 3>This is not just this,</v>

4063
02:00:16.330 --> 02:00:17.590
<v Speaker 3>there's not just that section.</v>

4064
02:00:17.591 --> 02:00:19.270
<v Speaker 3>It goes on forever in these,</v>

4065
02:00:19.271 --> 02:00:23.410
<v Speaker 3>these huge walls and it does feel like a three dimensional jigsaw puzzle.</v>

4066
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:24.990
<v Speaker 3>And so beautiful too.</v>

4067
02:00:25.020 --> 02:00:26.440
<v Speaker 3>It means that the way they did it,</v>

4068
02:00:26.690 --> 02:00:27.340
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

4069
02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:30.430
<v Speaker 3>they didn't make everything square and know and level.</v>

4070
02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:30.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4071
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:35.790
<v Speaker 3>they just decided to use this sort of method of turning these stones into these</v>

4072
02:00:36.581 --> 02:00:37.810
<v Speaker 3>puzzle pieces and you go,</v>

4073
02:00:37.811 --> 02:00:40.810
<v Speaker 3>when you go look at it up close and you realize that you can't get a sheet of</v>

4074
02:00:40.811 --> 02:00:42.550
<v Speaker 3>paper in the gaps between the joints,</v>

4075
02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:46.870
<v Speaker 3>you realize that you are looking at some sort of technology that we don't get.</v>

4076
02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:48.160
<v Speaker 3>There's something they were there.</v>

4077
02:00:48.190 --> 02:00:51.940
<v Speaker 3>There was some way that these people were able to do this and make it incredibly</v>

4078
02:00:51.941 --> 02:00:54.610
<v Speaker 3>difficult for themselves if it was done in any modern way.</v>

4079
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:57.760
<v Speaker 3>What's the mainstream explanation for that?</v>

4080
02:00:58.180 --> 02:00:59.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4081
02:00:59.620 --> 02:01:03.970
<v Speaker 3>hours and hours of patient Labor by tens of thousands of people grinding away at</v>

4082
02:01:03.971 --> 02:01:05.200
<v Speaker 3>the stones and making them all fit.</v>

4083
02:01:05.201 --> 02:01:06.190
<v Speaker 3>Consider the planning,</v>

4084
02:01:06.191 --> 02:01:06.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4085
02:01:06.431 --> 02:01:07.480
<v Speaker 3>to make that happen.</v>

4086
02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:09.010
<v Speaker 3>Let me show the whole wall.</v>

4087
02:01:09.011 --> 02:01:09.381
<v Speaker 3>I've got the,</v>

4088
02:01:09.381 --> 02:01:10.660
<v Speaker 3>I've got a picture of the whole wall.</v>

4089
02:01:10.690 --> 02:01:12.670
<v Speaker 3>We could pull it up if you just tell us what patient,</v>

4090
02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:13.560
<v Speaker 3>there's the whole world.</v>

4091
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:14.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

4092
02:01:16.050 --> 02:01:17.260
<v Speaker 3>When I say the whole wall,</v>

4093
02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:19.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's just a section of the whole wall.</v>

4094
02:01:19.481 --> 02:01:22.330
<v Speaker 3>That wall runs for hundreds of feet in all directions.</v>

4095
02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4096
02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:27.250
<v Speaker 3>the planning that's involved in making no single block of stone is the same size</v>

4097
02:01:27.251 --> 02:01:27.790
<v Speaker 3>as another.</v>

4098
02:01:27.790 --> 02:01:29.050
<v Speaker 3>They're all different sizes.</v>

4099
02:01:29.051 --> 02:01:31.340
<v Speaker 3>They're all tongue and grooved into each other in this,</v>

4100
02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:34.510
<v Speaker 3>in this incredible way and it really feels like they were melted.</v>

4101
02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:36.150
<v Speaker 3>They were kind of softened.</v>

4102
02:01:36.151 --> 02:01:37.600
<v Speaker 3>That's what his whiskey O'mara says.</v>

4103
02:01:37.601 --> 02:01:41.840
<v Speaker 3>He says these stores were softened by some technique that we don't understand.</v>

4104
02:01:41.841 --> 02:01:42.980
<v Speaker 3>He thinks he'd was involved,</v>

4105
02:01:42.981 --> 02:01:46.010
<v Speaker 3>they were softened and in a soft state they were fitted together and then they</v>

4106
02:01:46.011 --> 02:01:46.844
<v Speaker 3>solidified.</v>

4107
02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:50.930
<v Speaker 3>Is that possible that they figured out some way to make a blow torch or</v>

4108
02:01:50.931 --> 02:01:51.441
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

4109
02:01:51.441 --> 02:01:52.310
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's possible.</v>

4110
02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:52.971
<v Speaker 3>But even then,</v>

4111
02:01:52.971 --> 02:01:54.560
<v Speaker 3>how do you push them into place?</v>

4112
02:01:54.590 --> 02:01:55.940
<v Speaker 3>Not a blow torch necessarily,</v>

4113
02:01:55.941 --> 02:01:59.820
<v Speaker 3>but so this is something goes on the defies explanation there and what's there</v>

4114
02:01:59.821 --> 02:02:02.060
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think we need aliens to explain it.</v>

4115
02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:03.320
<v Speaker 3>I think it's human work.</v>

4116
02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:04.910
<v Speaker 3>I think it's human workmanship,</v>

4117
02:02:04.911 --> 02:02:08.090
<v Speaker 3>but it's at a level and at a standard that we do not fully understand.</v>

4118
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4119
02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:09.141
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

4120
02:02:09.141 --> 02:02:09.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4121
02:02:09.590 --> 02:02:09.981
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

4122
02:02:09.981 --> 02:02:12.470
<v Speaker 3>that alien thing gets real weird,</v>

4123
02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:13.100
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4124
02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:13.221
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4125
02:02:13.221 --> 02:02:13.490
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

4126
02:02:13.490 --> 02:02:13.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4127
02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:14.623
<v Speaker 3>I have been,</v>

4128
02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:19.660
<v Speaker 3>I've had the privilege of traveling around this planet for the last 25 years,</v>

4129
02:02:21.261 --> 02:02:22.580
<v Speaker 3>looking at ancient sites.</v>

4130
02:02:22.580 --> 02:02:23.413
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

4131
02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:26.380
<v Speaker 3>Amazing that sex.</v>

4132
02:02:26.381 --> 02:02:27.214
<v Speaker 3>Say Walmart.</v>

4133
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:29.060
<v Speaker 3>How big are the largest stones?</v>

4134
02:02:29.410 --> 02:02:29.630
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4135
02:02:29.630 --> 02:02:31.040
<v Speaker 3>we're about 20 feet high.</v>

4136
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:33.650
<v Speaker 3>150 to 200 tons in weight.</v>

4137
02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:34.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4138
02:02:34.610 --> 02:02:36.020
<v Speaker 3>six to eight feet thick.</v>

4139
02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:36.681
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4140
02:02:36.681 --> 02:02:37.100
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

4141
02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:38.180
<v Speaker 3>just monstrous.</v>

4142
02:02:38.590 --> 02:02:41.060
<v Speaker 3>200 tons is 400,000 pounds?</v>

4143
02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:41.991
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

4144
02:02:41.991 --> 02:02:43.040
<v Speaker 3>200 tons.</v>

4145
02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:45.350
<v Speaker 3>I think of it in kilos.</v>

4146
02:02:45.351 --> 02:02:46.610
<v Speaker 3>A ton is a ton.</v>

4147
02:02:46.611 --> 02:02:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Is a thousand kilograms.</v>

4148
02:02:47.841 --> 02:02:48.350
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4149
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.441
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4150
02:02:48.441 --> 02:02:50.420
<v Speaker 3>you're kilo man killing man.</v>

4151
02:02:50.421 --> 02:02:50.961
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

4152
02:02:50.961 --> 02:02:52.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't do it in pounds anymore.</v>

4153
02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:52.930
<v Speaker 3>Police.</v>

4154
02:02:52.930 --> 02:02:54.140
<v Speaker 3>You don't do it in stone.</v>

4155
02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:56.840
<v Speaker 3>Now we go to England,</v>

4156
02:02:57.410 --> 02:03:00.210
<v Speaker 3>UFC Wayans we have to say like 10 stone.</v>

4157
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.791
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

4158
02:03:01.791 --> 02:03:03.920
<v Speaker 3>There were 14 pounds in a stone.</v>

4159
02:03:04.370 --> 02:03:04.701
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

4160
02:03:04.701 --> 02:03:07.240
<v Speaker 3>so 10 stone made your 140 pounds.</v>

4161
02:03:08.090 --> 02:03:08.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4162
02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:09.291
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

4163
02:03:09.291 --> 02:03:10.460
<v Speaker 3>It's really complicated.</v>

4164
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:11.121
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4165
02:03:11.121 --> 02:03:12.050
<v Speaker 3>They're sexy woman.</v>

4166
02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:14.660
<v Speaker 3>Now the point looking up at the top left of the screen there,</v>

4167
02:03:14.661 --> 02:03:18.550
<v Speaker 3>there's some inferior work on top of the better work and what [inaudible] is</v>

4168
02:03:18.551 --> 02:03:20.720
<v Speaker 3>saying and the inferior work was the work of the anchors,</v>

4169
02:03:20.721 --> 02:03:21.980
<v Speaker 3>but the other stuff is much older.</v>

4170
02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:24.610
<v Speaker 3>So the smaller rocks that were easily manipulated,</v>

4171
02:03:25.130 --> 02:03:29.210
<v Speaker 3>now they were copying the oldest style and respecting it and overbuilding and</v>

4172
02:03:29.211 --> 02:03:30.110
<v Speaker 3>building around it,</v>

4173
02:03:30.111 --> 02:03:30.380
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

4174
02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:34.040
<v Speaker 3>but they were honoring an earlier and earlier work of construction and the</v>

4175
02:03:34.041 --> 02:03:37.010
<v Speaker 3>conventional dating of this is very recent.</v>

4176
02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:37.700
<v Speaker 3>The anchors,</v>

4177
02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:40.220
<v Speaker 3>the anchors were wiped out by the Spanish.</v>

4178
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.970
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4179
02:03:40.970 --> 02:03:41.990
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

4180
02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:42.680
<v Speaker 3>30,</v>

4181
02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:43.161
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

4182
02:03:43.161 --> 02:03:43.790
<v Speaker 3>40.</v>

4183
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:45.110
<v Speaker 3>They were destroyed as an empire.</v>

4184
02:03:45.111 --> 02:03:45.381
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

4185
02:03:45.381 --> 02:03:48.500
<v Speaker 3>he existed according to history for 150 years before that,</v>

4186
02:03:48.770 --> 02:03:52.280
<v Speaker 3>200 years before that at the outside and all of this work,</v>

4187
02:03:52.281 --> 02:03:55.310
<v Speaker 3>this incredible megalithic work that's all over the Andes mountains.</v>

4188
02:03:55.311 --> 02:03:55.631
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

4189
02:03:55.631 --> 02:03:57.050
<v Speaker 3>you can't move for bumping into it.</v>

4190
02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:00.530
<v Speaker 3>All of it is supposed to have been built in that 200 year period by the Incas</v>

4191
02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:04.580
<v Speaker 3>because archaeology can't just can't bear the idea that there might've been some</v>

4192
02:04:04.581 --> 02:04:05.414
<v Speaker 3>earlier culture.</v>

4193
02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:06.500
<v Speaker 3>Why date it then?</v>

4194
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:09.090
<v Speaker 3>It seems like if it's so confusing and so there,</v>

4195
02:04:09.091 --> 02:04:14.091
<v Speaker 3>there's so many open ended questions where when you see these enormous pieces,</v>

4196
02:04:14.841 --> 02:04:16.100
<v Speaker 3>when we see them fitted together,</v>

4197
02:04:16.101 --> 02:04:17.780
<v Speaker 3>when you don't have an explanation for how they did it,</v>

4198
02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:20.960
<v Speaker 3>you're not exactly sure who did it because the history gets really murky when</v>

4199
02:04:20.961 --> 02:04:21.760
<v Speaker 3>you get that far back.</v>

4200
02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:22.960
<v Speaker 3>You know why date it?</v>

4201
02:04:23.180 --> 02:04:24.230
<v Speaker 3>I agree why data,</v>

4202
02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:24.621
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

4203
02:04:24.621 --> 02:04:26.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand why they have to do that.</v>

4204
02:04:26.590 --> 02:04:26.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4205
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:30.560
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that archeology comes to history with a preexisting reference</v>

4206
02:04:30.561 --> 02:04:32.960
<v Speaker 3>frame and makes everything fit into it,</v>

4207
02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:36.530
<v Speaker 3>makes everything fit into it and that's been the mistake of science down the</v>

4208
02:04:36.531 --> 02:04:36.990
<v Speaker 3>ages.</v>

4209
02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:40.890
<v Speaker 3>There was a long period that very good example of this is is that the notion</v>

4210
02:04:40.891 --> 02:04:45.450
<v Speaker 3>that the notion that the sun revolved around the earth that was based on a</v>

4211
02:04:45.451 --> 02:04:47.340
<v Speaker 3>preexisting reference seemed to make sense.</v>

4212
02:04:47.610 --> 02:04:48.391
<v Speaker 3>Get up in the morning,</v>

4213
02:04:48.391 --> 02:04:49.620
<v Speaker 3>look at the sonic rises,</v>

4214
02:04:49.621 --> 02:04:50.520
<v Speaker 3>goes through the sky,</v>

4215
02:04:51.150 --> 02:04:52.350
<v Speaker 3>but it was complete nonsense.</v>

4216
02:04:52.351 --> 02:04:53.730
<v Speaker 3>It's the earth that's going around the sun.</v>

4217
02:04:53.731 --> 02:04:57.960
<v Speaker 3>You have to change the reference frame in order to see what's really going on.</v>

4218
02:04:57.961 --> 02:05:00.120
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the problem with history and archeology.</v>

4219
02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:00.991
<v Speaker 3>What impact,</v>

4220
02:05:00.991 --> 02:05:01.441
<v Speaker 3>if any,</v>

4221
02:05:01.441 --> 02:05:02.310
<v Speaker 3>has this go back?</v>

4222
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:03.480
<v Speaker 3>Lee TAPI discovered,</v>

4223
02:05:03.870 --> 02:05:04.261
<v Speaker 3>go back,</v>

4224
02:05:04.261 --> 02:05:04.771
<v Speaker 3>Lee Tempe,</v>

4225
02:05:04.771 --> 02:05:08.460
<v Speaker 3>discovery changed archeologists view of,</v>

4226
02:05:08.490 --> 02:05:08.840
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

4227
02:05:08.840 --> 02:05:09.081
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

4228
02:05:09.081 --> 02:05:10.740
<v Speaker 3>of back dating things.</v>

4229
02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:11.461
<v Speaker 3>As I mentioned,</v>

4230
02:05:11.461 --> 02:05:13.170
<v Speaker 3>I liked clash Schmidt when I met him,</v>

4231
02:05:13.171 --> 02:05:14.890
<v Speaker 3>the archeologist who is working on Quebec City,</v>

4232
02:05:14.891 --> 02:05:15.724
<v Speaker 3>Tempe.</v>

4233
02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:16.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4234
02:05:16.410 --> 02:05:17.101
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was,</v>

4235
02:05:17.101 --> 02:05:20.160
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was charming and enthusiastic and I enjoyed his energy.</v>

4236
02:05:20.190 --> 02:05:22.710
<v Speaker 3>But when I asked him about when I said,</v>

4237
02:05:23.070 --> 02:05:23.903
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4238
02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:27.390
<v Speaker 3>so what does it feel like to be the man who discovered the site?</v>

4239
02:05:27.391 --> 02:05:29.400
<v Speaker 3>There's rewriting history and he said,</v>

4240
02:05:29.401 --> 02:05:29.820
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4241
02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:31.320
<v Speaker 3>it's not rewriting history.</v>

4242
02:05:31.321 --> 02:05:34.110
<v Speaker 3>It's adding a new chapter to existing history.</v>

4243
02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:37.800
<v Speaker 3>He still wants to fit it into that reference frame somehow that we have to,</v>

4244
02:05:37.801 --> 02:05:38.011
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4245
02:05:38.011 --> 02:05:40.770
<v Speaker 3>we have to completely rethink our ideas about the upper paleolithic,</v>

4246
02:05:40.771 --> 02:05:44.220
<v Speaker 3>but somehow desperately we must look at this site in a way that's not going to</v>

4247
02:05:44.221 --> 02:05:45.480
<v Speaker 3>rock the boat too much.</v>

4248
02:05:45.481 --> 02:05:46.500
<v Speaker 3>And I was sad to hear that.</v>

4249
02:05:46.500 --> 02:05:47.160
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

4250
02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:48.120
<v Speaker 3>I think especially when,</v>

4251
02:05:48.270 --> 02:05:52.050
<v Speaker 3>when he himself admits that at least 20 times as much if not 50 times as much,</v>

4252
02:05:52.051 --> 02:05:54.480
<v Speaker 3>it's still under the ground or waiting to be excavated.</v>

4253
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:55.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4254
02:05:55.560 --> 02:06:00.560
<v Speaker 3>I think a little bit of provisional thinking is needed before you just attribute</v>

4255
02:06:00.601 --> 02:06:02.250
<v Speaker 3>that to him being a professional academic.</v>

4256
02:06:02.251 --> 02:06:02.610
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4257
02:06:02.610 --> 02:06:04.920
<v Speaker 3>I think the professional professional academia,</v>

4258
02:06:04.921 --> 02:06:09.921
<v Speaker 3>particularly in the realm of archeology encourages those who are working in the</v>

4259
02:06:09.991 --> 02:06:13.830
<v Speaker 3>field to think in terms of the existing paradigm,</v>

4260
02:06:14.070 --> 02:06:17.310
<v Speaker 3>not to think in terms of challenging the paradigm because it's dangerous.</v>

4261
02:06:17.311 --> 02:06:18.720
<v Speaker 3>If you challenge the paradigm,</v>

4262
02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:19.321
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4263
02:06:19.321 --> 02:06:19.651
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4264
02:06:19.651 --> 02:06:22.070
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be ridiculed by your colleagues and,</v>

4265
02:06:22.071 --> 02:06:24.350
<v Speaker 3>and regarded as completely lunatic and,</v>

4266
02:06:24.351 --> 02:06:24.530
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4267
02:06:24.530 --> 02:06:25.860
<v Speaker 3>and attacked and insulted.</v>

4268
02:06:26.250 --> 02:06:26.701
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4269
02:06:26.701 --> 02:06:28.560
<v Speaker 3>so it's better not to challenge that paradigm,</v>

4270
02:06:28.590 --> 02:06:33.180
<v Speaker 3>but what a fascinating area of research to not challenge the paradigm,</v>

4271
02:06:33.181 --> 02:06:37.440
<v Speaker 3>an area where you have so little information about what could have possibly</v>

4272
02:06:37.441 --> 02:06:40.410
<v Speaker 3>happened when you get back to 5,000 years ago,</v>

4273
02:06:40.411 --> 02:06:41.490
<v Speaker 3>6,000 years ago,</v>

4274
02:06:41.491 --> 02:06:42.540
<v Speaker 3>7,000 years ago,</v>

4275
02:06:42.541 --> 02:06:45.990
<v Speaker 3>and you're trying to piece these puzzles again to pretend that you have the</v>

4276
02:06:45.991 --> 02:06:47.310
<v Speaker 3>entire timeline.</v>

4277
02:06:47.550 --> 02:06:48.780
<v Speaker 3>It seems a little silly.</v>

4278
02:06:48.781 --> 02:06:49.614
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty crazy.</v>

4279
02:06:49.740 --> 02:06:50.550
<v Speaker 3>It seems so,</v>

4280
02:06:50.550 --> 02:06:50.731
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4281
02:06:50.731 --> 02:06:54.150
<v Speaker 3>it's one thing if you're trying to pretend that you have a timeline when you're</v>

4282
02:06:54.151 --> 02:06:55.140
<v Speaker 3>dealing with something,</v>

4283
02:06:55.290 --> 02:06:55.981
<v Speaker 3>or excuse me,</v>

4284
02:06:55.981 --> 02:06:57.390
<v Speaker 3>to pretend you have all the information.</v>

4285
02:06:57.391 --> 02:07:00.360
<v Speaker 3>When you're dealing with something like mathematics or when you're dealing with</v>

4286
02:07:00.361 --> 02:07:02.520
<v Speaker 3>something like very clear,</v>

4287
02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:03.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4288
02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:04.560
<v Speaker 3>manuscripts,</v>

4289
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:05.280
<v Speaker 3>you know like,</v>

4290
02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:05.461
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4291
02:07:05.461 --> 02:07:06.294
<v Speaker 3>we have a,</v>

4292
02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:06.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4293
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:08.760
<v Speaker 3>the Dead Sea scrolls very clearly,</v>

4294
02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:10.050
<v Speaker 3>x amount of years old.</v>

4295
02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:13.800
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing with history where you have written documents that you can</v>

4296
02:07:13.801 --> 02:07:16.470
<v Speaker 3>draw upon where you have those written documents.</v>

4297
02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:18.720
<v Speaker 3>You can be reasonably certain about what's going on.</v>

4298
02:07:19.170 --> 02:07:20.370
<v Speaker 3>The further back we go,</v>

4299
02:07:20.430 --> 02:07:22.830
<v Speaker 3>we don't have the written documents beyond 5,000 years.</v>

4300
02:07:22.831 --> 02:07:26.820
<v Speaker 3>We have no written documents and to draw a fixed and firm conclusions about what</v>

4301
02:07:26.821 --> 02:07:30.330
<v Speaker 3>happened before 5,000 years ago on the basis of a few things dug out of the</v>

4302
02:07:30.331 --> 02:07:31.164
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

4303
02:07:31.170 --> 02:07:32.040
<v Speaker 3>It's not good enough.</v>

4304
02:07:32.150 --> 02:07:32.360
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

4305
02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:32.561
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4306
02:07:32.561 --> 02:07:32.950
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4307
02:07:32.950 --> 02:07:35.590
<v Speaker 3>it's a mistake that's being made and that I believe is going to,</v>

4308
02:07:35.591 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 3>is going</v>

4309
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:36.401
<v Speaker 4>to change.</v>

4310
02:07:36.401 --> 02:07:37.211
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be painful.</v>

4311
02:07:37.211 --> 02:07:38.044
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be slow.</v>

4312
02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:41.320
<v Speaker 4>It was painful to change the Ptolemaic system to the COPERNICAN system,</v>

4313
02:07:41.590 --> 02:07:42.520
<v Speaker 4>but it will happen.</v>

4314
02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.110
<v Speaker 4>The system will change.</v>

4315
02:07:44.410 --> 02:07:45.040
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

4316
02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:45.251
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4317
02:07:45.251 --> 02:07:47.200
<v Speaker 4>the backdating of the Sphinx,</v>

4318
02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:52.300
<v Speaker 4>has there been any progress on that now because of go back Lee tamping because</v>

4319
02:07:52.330 --> 02:07:52.911
<v Speaker 4>the what,</v>

4320
02:07:52.911 --> 02:07:56.800
<v Speaker 4>what Robert Schoch did in exposing the erosion,</v>

4321
02:07:56.801 --> 02:07:57.760
<v Speaker 4>the water erosion,</v>

4322
02:07:57.900 --> 02:07:59.380
<v Speaker 4>and we briefly touched on this before,</v>

4323
02:07:59.381 --> 02:08:02.860
<v Speaker 4>but I've seen people dispute it and boy itself,</v>

4324
02:08:02.890 --> 02:08:05.530
<v Speaker 4>it seems so forced and labored there.</v>

4325
02:08:05.531 --> 02:08:07.690
<v Speaker 4>They're disputing the,</v>

4326
02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:09.880
<v Speaker 4>I have no doubt that rubber shock is right.</v>

4327
02:08:09.881 --> 02:08:11.710
<v Speaker 4>Robert Robert Shotgun and John Anthony West,</v>

4328
02:08:11.711 --> 02:08:13.150
<v Speaker 4>they're right about the sphinx.</v>

4329
02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:16.180
<v Speaker 4>And they have been attacked in all kinds of ways,</v>

4330
02:08:16.181 --> 02:08:17.350
<v Speaker 4>in all kinds of elaborate,</v>

4331
02:08:17.351 --> 02:08:21.130
<v Speaker 4>contorted explanations have been given to explain away that kind of weathering.</v>

4332
02:08:21.131 --> 02:08:23.110
<v Speaker 4>But the fact is they remained to be right.</v>

4333
02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:25.830
<v Speaker 4>And now we have the tappy.</v>

4334
02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:27.130
<v Speaker 4>Now on the other side of the world,</v>

4335
02:08:27.131 --> 02:08:28.210
<v Speaker 4>we have Gunung Padang,</v>

4336
02:08:28.211 --> 02:08:32.490
<v Speaker 4>we have sites that are 12,000 plus years old indisputably.</v>

4337
02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:36.790
<v Speaker 4>So I think it sooner or later will cause a reconsideration of the Sphinx.</v>

4338
02:08:36.850 --> 02:08:37.600
<v Speaker 4>I hope so.</v>

4339
02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:38.570
<v Speaker 4>And that's something that I,</v>

4340
02:08:38.571 --> 02:08:40.360
<v Speaker 4>I also intend to focus on.</v>

4341
02:08:40.690 --> 02:08:40.841
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4342
02:08:40.841 --> 02:08:41.621
<v Speaker 4>I think it has to.</v>

4343
02:08:41.621 --> 02:08:43.690
<v Speaker 4>And as soon as John Jamie gets back from the bathroom,</v>

4344
02:08:43.691 --> 02:08:45.400
<v Speaker 4>we'll show some of the images of the,</v>

4345
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.701
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4346
02:08:45.701 --> 02:08:49.240
<v Speaker 4>the Sphinx in closure then led Robert Schoch,</v>

4347
02:08:49.241 --> 02:08:54.241
<v Speaker 4>who is a geologist to very clearly proclaimed that what you're dealing with is</v>

4348
02:08:54.881 --> 02:08:58.320
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years of water erodes just as if he has a wheelchair.</v>

4349
02:08:58.600 --> 02:08:59.980
<v Speaker 4>The smoothness of it,</v>

4350
02:08:59.981 --> 02:09:00.940
<v Speaker 4>the curves,</v>

4351
02:09:00.941 --> 02:09:04.750
<v Speaker 4>the fact that there's all these fissures that indicate water running down.</v>

4352
02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:05.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4353
02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:06.790
<v Speaker 4>And then the area,</v>

4354
02:09:06.791 --> 02:09:10.390
<v Speaker 4>I honestly think shock Rabbids Shulkin John West are going to be seen in future</v>

4355
02:09:10.391 --> 02:09:14.850
<v Speaker 4>generations as the Copernicus of their time that they saw what nobody else saw.</v>

4356
02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:15.240
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

4357
02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:16.720
<v Speaker 4>and they had the courage to put,</v>

4358
02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:18.400
<v Speaker 4>to put the information out there and,</v>

4359
02:09:18.430 --> 02:09:19.780
<v Speaker 4>and they were attacked for it.</v>

4360
02:09:19.781 --> 02:09:20.614
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

4361
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:23.380
<v Speaker 4>people don't get bent at the stake these days for,</v>

4362
02:09:23.410 --> 02:09:25.390
<v Speaker 4>for proposing alternative ideas.</v>

4363
02:09:25.391 --> 02:09:26.500
<v Speaker 4>But in a kind of way,</v>

4364
02:09:26.590 --> 02:09:26.831
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4365
02:09:26.831 --> 02:09:27.400
<v Speaker 4>we do,</v>

4366
02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:27.971
<v Speaker 4>there's the,</v>

4367
02:09:27.971 --> 02:09:28.171
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4368
02:09:28.171 --> 02:09:28.381
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4369
02:09:28.381 --> 02:09:32.200
<v Speaker 4>the vicious nature of the attacks on people who propose an alternative view of</v>

4370
02:09:32.201 --> 02:09:32.591
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>

4371
02:09:32.591 --> 02:09:33.900
<v Speaker 4>But I think in,</v>

4372
02:09:33.901 --> 02:09:34.840
<v Speaker 4>in our lifetimes,</v>

4373
02:09:34.841 --> 02:09:35.770
<v Speaker 4>we will see this change.</v>

4374
02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:37.120
<v Speaker 4>And if folks haven't seen,</v>

4375
02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:37.600
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4376
02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:42.460
<v Speaker 4>or haven't heard me talk about John Anthony West amazing documentary series on</v>

4377
02:09:42.461 --> 02:09:42.941
<v Speaker 4>Egypt,</v>

4378
02:09:42.941 --> 02:09:46.360
<v Speaker 4>it's called magical Egypt and I can't recommend it enough.</v>

4379
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:48.880
<v Speaker 4>It is absolutely fascinating.</v>

4380
02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:50.440
<v Speaker 4>So in depth,</v>

4381
02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:51.071
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

4382
02:09:51.071 --> 02:09:52.840
<v Speaker 4>is it six or seven DVDs?</v>

4383
02:09:52.841 --> 02:09:53.381
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many,</v>

4384
02:09:53.381 --> 02:09:54.011
<v Speaker 4>like that big,</v>

4385
02:09:54.011 --> 02:09:55.210
<v Speaker 4>big collection of DVDs.</v>

4386
02:09:55.230 --> 02:09:56.470
<v Speaker 4>It's a massive,</v>

4387
02:09:56.471 --> 02:09:57.790
<v Speaker 4>massive amount of work.</v>

4388
02:09:57.820 --> 02:10:01.750
<v Speaker 4>And John is a man who's devoted his whole life to understanding an,</v>

4389
02:10:01.780 --> 02:10:01.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4390
02:10:01.930 --> 02:10:06.100
<v Speaker 4>an alternative understanding of Egypt done with great wisdom and great care.</v>

4391
02:10:06.910 --> 02:10:07.241
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4392
02:10:07.241 --> 02:10:08.470
<v Speaker 4>it's a really,</v>

4393
02:10:08.471 --> 02:10:11.200
<v Speaker 4>really incredible series that I've watched many,</v>

4394
02:10:11.201 --> 02:10:15.420
<v Speaker 4>many times over and over again and try to absorb as much of it as I,</v>

4395
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:16.031
<v Speaker 4>as I can.</v>

4396
02:10:16.031 --> 02:10:17.050
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

4397
02:10:17.051 --> 02:10:18.130
<v Speaker 4>it's so staggering.</v>

4398
02:10:18.250 --> 02:10:23.250
<v Speaker 4>And he also showed very clear that there's some different styles of techniques</v>

4399
02:10:23.741 --> 02:10:24.100
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

4400
02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:28.900
<v Speaker 4>of building and that these older techniques that you find or different</v>

4401
02:10:28.901 --> 02:10:32.020
<v Speaker 4>techniques or all on a lower level of the soil,</v>

4402
02:10:32.050 --> 02:10:32.861
<v Speaker 4>it's exactly,</v>

4403
02:10:32.861 --> 02:10:34.370
<v Speaker 4>it's exactly like</v>

4404
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:36.230
<v Speaker 3>it is in the Peruvian Andes and,</v>

4405
02:10:36.231 --> 02:10:36.501
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4406
02:10:36.501 --> 02:10:36.891
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4407
02:10:36.891 --> 02:10:37.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4408
02:10:37.190 --> 02:10:37.880
<v Speaker 3>Bolivia.</v>

4409
02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:38.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4410
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:39.260
<v Speaker 3>that what,</v>

4411
02:10:39.261 --> 02:10:43.760
<v Speaker 3>what has happened I think is that archeology has taken the work of the latest</v>

4412
02:10:43.761 --> 02:10:47.180
<v Speaker 3>culture to work on the site and handed the whole site over to,</v>

4413
02:10:47.181 --> 02:10:49.400
<v Speaker 3>it actually gives us a very complicated site.</v>

4414
02:10:49.670 --> 02:10:52.400
<v Speaker 3>You have the Subterranean Chamber beneath the great pyramid.</v>

4415
02:10:52.610 --> 02:10:56.390
<v Speaker 3>Why do we have to believe that that is from the same date as the pyramid itself?</v>

4416
02:10:56.640 --> 02:10:56.871
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4417
02:10:56.871 --> 02:10:57.780
<v Speaker 3>you have the,</v>

4418
02:10:57.781 --> 02:10:59.990
<v Speaker 3>the so called mortuary temples and valley temples,</v>

4419
02:10:59.991 --> 02:11:01.670
<v Speaker 3>these gigantic megalithic structures.</v>

4420
02:11:01.970 --> 02:11:06.890
<v Speaker 3>The Valley Temple beside the Sphinx is actually made of blocks of limestone that</v>

4421
02:11:06.891 --> 02:11:10.010
<v Speaker 3>were cut out from around the Sphinx to create the body of the Sphinx.</v>

4422
02:11:10.011 --> 02:11:11.840
<v Speaker 3>So if the Sphinx is 12,000 years old,</v>

4423
02:11:11.841 --> 02:11:12.860
<v Speaker 3>and I honestly think it is,</v>

4424
02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:15.680
<v Speaker 3>then the valley temples are 12,000 years old as well.</v>

4425
02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:16.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4426
02:11:16.530 --> 02:11:16.790
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4427
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:17.170
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4428
02:11:17.170 --> 02:11:20.720
<v Speaker 3>what we have are very complex multilayered sites where there's a very ancient</v>

4429
02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:24.260
<v Speaker 3>megalithic layer of architecture and the later culture comes along perhaps</v>

4430
02:11:24.261 --> 02:11:27.200
<v Speaker 3>venerates that perhaps overbuilds around it,</v>

4431
02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:28.193
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4432
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:30.380
<v Speaker 3>and attempts to copy it in some ways.</v>

4433
02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:35.060
<v Speaker 3>And the mistake has been both in the Andes and in Egypt that the later culture</v>

4434
02:11:35.061 --> 02:11:36.590
<v Speaker 3>has been attributed with all the work.</v>

4435
02:11:36.591 --> 02:11:38.390
<v Speaker 3>We need a more sophisticated,</v>

4436
02:11:38.391 --> 02:11:41.360
<v Speaker 3>the more in depth exploration of this and I think correctly Tempe is going to</v>

4437
02:11:41.361 --> 02:11:42.200
<v Speaker 3>force us to do that.</v>

4438
02:11:42.250 --> 02:11:42.651
<v Speaker 3>If Jamie,</v>

4439
02:11:42.651 --> 02:11:46.150
<v Speaker 3>if you could pull up some of the images that Robert Schoch uh,</v>

4440
02:11:46.190 --> 02:11:49.910
<v Speaker 3>created of the water errosion as opposed to,</v>

4441
02:11:49.911 --> 02:11:50.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4442
02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:51.740
<v Speaker 3>you showed it a little animated,</v>

4443
02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:52.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4444
02:11:52.260 --> 02:11:55.040
<v Speaker 3>or illustrated image of it before,</v>

4445
02:11:55.340 --> 02:11:59.570
<v Speaker 3>but it's pretty fascinating stuff and that seems to me to be the ones smoking</v>

4446
02:11:59.571 --> 02:12:00.440
<v Speaker 3>gun in Egypt,</v>

4447
02:12:00.441 --> 02:12:01.290
<v Speaker 3>that sort of points.</v>

4448
02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:02.990
<v Speaker 3>It's a smoking gun for sure.</v>

4449
02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:03.980
<v Speaker 3>It's a smoking gun,</v>

4450
02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:08.900
<v Speaker 3>which the mainstream academia has tried to ignore the smoke,</v>

4451
02:12:08.930 --> 02:12:10.760
<v Speaker 3>but if the smoke is there and,</v>

4452
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:11.623
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

4453
02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:13.280
<v Speaker 3>go back to Tappi going padding,</v>

4454
02:12:13.281 --> 02:12:15.380
<v Speaker 3>other sites are going to force them to reconsider that.</v>

4455
02:12:15.710 --> 02:12:18.440
<v Speaker 3>What are they going to do if they dig up something that's 30,000 years old?</v>

4456
02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:19.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4457
02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:20.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4458
02:12:20.150 --> 02:12:23.900
<v Speaker 3>I hope that they're not going to hide it and pretend it works.</v>

4459
02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:24.201
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4460
02:12:24.201 --> 02:12:25.550
<v Speaker 3>I know of cases where it's happened.</v>

4461
02:12:25.551 --> 02:12:27.950
<v Speaker 3>I know it happened in Malta when what happened in Malta,</v>

4462
02:12:27.980 --> 02:12:28.970
<v Speaker 3>in the hyper igm,</v>

4463
02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.680
<v Speaker 3>which is an underground structure in mortar of amazing undergrads,</v>

4464
02:12:32.690 --> 02:12:33.570
<v Speaker 3>one of the one plate,</v>

4465
02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:35.300
<v Speaker 3>this should be on everybody's bucket list.</v>

4466
02:12:35.301 --> 02:12:35.691
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

4467
02:12:35.691 --> 02:12:38.630
<v Speaker 3>the hyper GM in multimedia is an incredible place.</v>

4468
02:12:38.631 --> 02:12:39.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4469
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:42.320
<v Speaker 3>it's like a huge temple complex cutout underground.</v>

4470
02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:43.221
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4471
02:12:43.221 --> 02:12:43.521
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4472
02:12:43.521 --> 02:12:44.410
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

4473
02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:47.540
<v Speaker 3>there are traces of red ochre paint on the walls.</v>

4474
02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:49.730
<v Speaker 3>They look much more like the caves,</v>

4475
02:12:49.731 --> 02:12:52.610
<v Speaker 3>the painted caves than they look like stuff from the Neolithic.</v>

4476
02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:54.620
<v Speaker 3>And there was at one time,</v>

4477
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:55.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4478
02:12:55.090 --> 02:12:57.200
<v Speaker 3>a figure of a hybrid creature,</v>

4479
02:12:57.201 --> 02:12:58.360
<v Speaker 3>a half bison,</v>

4480
02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:59.240
<v Speaker 3>half bull.</v>

4481
02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:00.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4482
02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:05.140
<v Speaker 3>such a figure would be normal in the painted caves from 30,000 years ago,</v>

4483
02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:10.100
<v Speaker 3>but doesn't fit in with the idea that the hyper g and belongs to 5,000 years</v>

4484
02:13:10.101 --> 02:13:10.820
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

4485
02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:11.341
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4486
02:13:11.341 --> 02:13:11.521
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4487
02:13:11.521 --> 02:13:14.930
<v Speaker 3>this was solved by a certain gentleman who shall remain nameless,</v>

4488
02:13:14.931 --> 02:13:19.931
<v Speaker 3>who had the bison bull scrubbed off the walls of the hyper geome in Malta.</v>

4489
02:13:21.110 --> 02:13:22.760
<v Speaker 3>It was literally scrubbed off.</v>

4490
02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:25.670
<v Speaker 3>I reported this at some length in my book.</v>

4491
02:13:25.671 --> 02:13:26.460
<v Speaker 3>Underworld.</v>

4492
02:13:26.460 --> 02:13:26.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4493
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:27.220
<v Speaker 3>who do,</v>

4494
02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:28.340
<v Speaker 3>who do they think scrubbed it?</v>

4495
02:13:28.490 --> 02:13:28.641
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4496
02:13:28.641 --> 02:13:29.570
<v Speaker 3>we know who scrubbed it.</v>

4497
02:13:29.810 --> 02:13:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4498
02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:32.280
<v Speaker 3>it was the former director of museums</v>

4499
02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:33.150
<v Speaker 4>and in Malta.</v>

4500
02:13:33.390 --> 02:13:33.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4501
02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:35.460
<v Speaker 4>back in back in the 60s.</v>

4502
02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:38.760
<v Speaker 4>He scrubbed it off the walls and when I took the,</v>

4503
02:13:38.761 --> 02:13:39.610
<v Speaker 4>I took the,</v>

4504
02:13:39.611 --> 02:13:41.850
<v Speaker 4>the national museums of multitask over this,</v>

4505
02:13:41.851 --> 02:13:44.430
<v Speaker 4>when I was back there making a documentary with channel four,</v>

4506
02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:48.900
<v Speaker 4>we put in a formal document to them asking them to answer this charge and they</v>

4507
02:13:48.901 --> 02:13:49.980
<v Speaker 4>refuse to answer it.</v>

4508
02:13:49.981 --> 02:13:51.630
<v Speaker 4>They would not comment upon it at all.</v>

4509
02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:53.610
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

4510
02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:54.211
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

4511
02:13:54.211 --> 02:13:57.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean archeologists do actually sometimes do incredibly dishonest things to</v>

4512
02:13:57.451 --> 02:13:58.620
<v Speaker 4>maintain the view of history.</v>

4513
02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:00.360
<v Speaker 4>That's so sad.</v>

4514
02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:01.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4515
02:14:01.260 --> 02:14:05.520
<v Speaker 4>it just think about the whole cycle of thinking that goes from being a young</v>

4516
02:14:05.521 --> 02:14:07.740
<v Speaker 4>person wanting to explore history,</v>

4517
02:14:07.741 --> 02:14:09.210
<v Speaker 4>wanting to become an archeologist,</v>

4518
02:14:09.211 --> 02:14:10.290
<v Speaker 4>getting involved in archeology,</v>

4519
02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:15.180
<v Speaker 4>getting involved in academia and then destroying evidence that's contrary to</v>

4520
02:14:15.181 --> 02:14:17.340
<v Speaker 4>what you've been taught or are teaching.</v>

4521
02:14:17.570 --> 02:14:18.860
<v Speaker 4>It's the opposite of science,</v>

4522
02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:20.193
<v Speaker 4>pure science.</v>

4523
02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:25.940
<v Speaker 4>It's so scary that human nature and even in a scientific work sometimes finds</v>

4524
02:14:27.241 --> 02:14:29.710
<v Speaker 4>its way to rear its ugly head that the,</v>

4525
02:14:29.790 --> 02:14:34.260
<v Speaker 4>the nasty aspects of human nature can even find their way into archeology.</v>

4526
02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:35.071
<v Speaker 4>Most unfortunate,</v>

4527
02:14:35.071 --> 02:14:35.520
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4528
02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:39.810
<v Speaker 4>That they can't in certain sciences because it's so cut and dry mathematics and</v>

4529
02:14:39.811 --> 02:14:40.890
<v Speaker 4>physics and you know,</v>

4530
02:14:41.070 --> 02:14:41.600
<v Speaker 4>but in,</v>

4531
02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:42.301
<v Speaker 4>in archeology,</v>

4532
02:14:42.301 --> 02:14:46.740
<v Speaker 4>so much is based on interpretation and the interpretation of very limited facts</v>

4533
02:14:46.741 --> 02:14:47.574
<v Speaker 4>actually.</v>

4534
02:14:47.700 --> 02:14:49.020
<v Speaker 4>So what's next for you?</v>

4535
02:14:49.021 --> 02:14:50.040
<v Speaker 4>What do you do from here?</v>

4536
02:14:50.670 --> 02:14:51.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4537
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:52.770
<v Speaker 4>I am writing at,</v>

4538
02:14:52.890 --> 02:14:57.240
<v Speaker 4>at the moment I'm researching and writing a sequel to fingerprints of the gods,</v>

4539
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:58.020
<v Speaker 4>fingerprints as that goes,</v>

4540
02:14:58.020 --> 02:14:59.730
<v Speaker 4>it was published in 1995.</v>

4541
02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:00.570
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4542
02:15:00.570 --> 02:15:03.420
<v Speaker 4>the reason I'm doing a sequel is because of the new evidence.</v>

4543
02:15:03.450 --> 02:15:05.580
<v Speaker 4>We've talked about Gunung Padang in Indonesia,</v>

4544
02:15:05.581 --> 02:15:07.260
<v Speaker 4>we've talked about back Lee tappy,</v>

4545
02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:08.790
<v Speaker 4>we've talked about the comment.</v>

4546
02:15:08.791 --> 02:15:13.080
<v Speaker 4>The comment for me is the cataclysmic smoking gun that explains how we lost a</v>

4547
02:15:13.081 --> 02:15:16.050
<v Speaker 4>whole civilization and a whole lot of material like this.</v>

4548
02:15:16.051 --> 02:15:18.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to write an update to fingerprints of the gods.</v>

4549
02:15:18.301 --> 02:15:20.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to write a completely new book and that book,</v>

4550
02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:22.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the process of researching.</v>

4551
02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:24.330
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm on these travels at the moment.</v>

4552
02:15:24.331 --> 02:15:26.460
<v Speaker 4>That's where I'm going to Indonesia at the beginning of December.</v>

4553
02:15:26.910 --> 02:15:27.151
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4554
02:15:27.151 --> 02:15:29.250
<v Speaker 4>that book will be published at the end,</v>

4555
02:15:29.550 --> 02:15:29.821
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4556
02:15:29.821 --> 02:15:34.821
<v Speaker 4>in the fall of 2015 I'm due to deliver it to the publishers in December,</v>

4557
02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:38.880
<v Speaker 4>2014 and it'll be published in the fall of 2015.</v>

4558
02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:39.271
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

4559
02:15:39.271 --> 02:15:40.380
<v Speaker 4>and this,</v>

4560
02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:41.760
<v Speaker 4>I see this as,</v>

4561
02:15:41.761 --> 02:15:42.594
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4562
02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:43.441
<v Speaker 4>in a way,</v>

4563
02:15:43.441 --> 02:15:47.490
<v Speaker 4>a kind of summation of my life's work on this whole issue of a lost</v>

4564
02:15:47.491 --> 02:15:48.324
<v Speaker 4>civilization.</v>

4565
02:15:48.630 --> 02:15:50.190
<v Speaker 4>And I feel very committed to doing it.</v>

4566
02:15:50.191 --> 02:15:50.791
<v Speaker 4>But honestly,</v>

4567
02:15:50.791 --> 02:15:52.770
<v Speaker 4>my heart these days is in writing novels.</v>

4568
02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:53.401
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

4569
02:15:53.401 --> 02:15:54.420
<v Speaker 4>I love writing novels.</v>

4570
02:15:54.421 --> 02:15:54.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4571
02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:57.990
<v Speaker 4>So it took a long time for you to break away from,</v>

4572
02:15:58.090 --> 02:16:01.720
<v Speaker 4>you were originally a journalist then went from journalism to writing about the</v>

4573
02:16:01.730 --> 02:16:04.710
<v Speaker 4>ancient history and an alternative view of ancient history,</v>

4574
02:16:05.340 --> 02:16:05.821
<v Speaker 4>but it was a,</v>

4575
02:16:05.821 --> 02:16:08.470
<v Speaker 4>it was a psychedelic experience that led you to want to write.</v>

4576
02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:13.350
<v Speaker 4>It was a psychedelic experience with Iowasca back in 2007 that set me on the</v>

4577
02:16:13.351 --> 02:16:14.820
<v Speaker 4>track to write my first novel,</v>

4578
02:16:14.821 --> 02:16:15.301
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

4579
02:16:15.301 --> 02:16:16.230
<v Speaker 4>which is entangled,</v>

4580
02:16:16.231 --> 02:16:16.621
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

4581
02:16:16.621 --> 02:16:16.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4582
02:16:16.820 --> 02:16:19.020
<v Speaker 4>which is a story of two young women,</v>

4583
02:16:19.050 --> 02:16:23.880
<v Speaker 4>one living 24,000 years ago in the Stone Age one living in modern Los Angeles,</v>

4584
02:16:23.881 --> 02:16:24.210
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

4585
02:16:24.210 --> 02:16:25.910
<v Speaker 4>whose destinies are entangled.</v>

4586
02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:27.450
<v Speaker 4>The time is not what it seems,</v>

4587
02:16:27.451 --> 02:16:29.190
<v Speaker 4>that it's a kind of spiral,</v>

4588
02:16:29.290 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 4>a cat's cradle</v>

4589
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:32.200
<v Speaker 3>of into crossing lines rather than an arrow.</v>

4590
02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:37.600
<v Speaker 3>And they are brought together by a benign supernatural force who I call the blue</v>

4591
02:16:37.601 --> 02:16:41.410
<v Speaker 3>angel to do battle with a demon who travels through time.</v>

4592
02:16:41.530 --> 02:16:43.840
<v Speaker 3>And then since then I've written war God,</v>

4593
02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:44.800
<v Speaker 3>which is a,</v>

4594
02:16:44.801 --> 02:16:47.590
<v Speaker 3>which is a novel about the Spanish conquest of Mexico,</v>

4595
02:16:48.010 --> 02:16:48.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4596
02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:52.110
<v Speaker 3>did get a British publisher for that book that book's being published in,</v>

4597
02:16:52.140 --> 02:16:52.361
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

4598
02:16:52.361 --> 02:16:52.841
<v Speaker 3>in Britain.</v>

4599
02:16:52.841 --> 02:16:53.501
<v Speaker 3>And it did okay.</v>

4600
02:16:53.501 --> 02:16:56.800
<v Speaker 3>It did well enough at any rate for the publishers in Britain to commission</v>

4601
02:16:56.801 --> 02:16:58.600
<v Speaker 3>volumes two and three because it's a,</v>

4602
02:16:58.840 --> 02:16:59.770
<v Speaker 3>because it's a series,</v>

4603
02:16:59.771 --> 02:17:02.410
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get any American publisher to take that book on.</v>

4604
02:17:02.710 --> 02:17:03.191
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

4605
02:17:03.191 --> 02:17:03.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4606
02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:07.840
<v Speaker 3>because publishing sees people in terms of brands and I am branded as a</v>

4607
02:17:07.841 --> 02:17:11.710
<v Speaker 3>nonfiction author and how dare I write fiction as I dare you.</v>

4608
02:17:11.830 --> 02:17:12.910
<v Speaker 3>How dare I do that.</v>

4609
02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:13.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4610
02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:14.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4611
02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:15.040
<v Speaker 3>life is short.</v>

4612
02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:15.550
<v Speaker 3>I wanted,</v>

4613
02:17:15.550 --> 02:17:16.960
<v Speaker 3>I want to try many,</v>

4614
02:17:16.961 --> 02:17:18.180
<v Speaker 3>many things and uh,</v>

4615
02:17:18.190 --> 02:17:22.570
<v Speaker 3>so what I've done is a published it a pretty much effectively self published it</v>

4616
02:17:22.571 --> 02:17:27.571
<v Speaker 3>in America through Amazon and the book is available on amazon.com.</v>

4617
02:17:28.390 --> 02:17:29.680
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks like by the way,</v>

4618
02:17:30.010 --> 02:17:32.970
<v Speaker 3>the u s edition people can also order uniforms.</v>

4619
02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:38.410
<v Speaker 3>People can also order it from bookshops but it's easier to get it from</v>

4620
02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:39.490
<v Speaker 3>amazon.com.</v>

02:18:54.161 --> 02:18:56.080
<v Speaker 3>That image of the Aztec skull.</v>

4661
02:18:56.290 --> 02:18:58.810
<v Speaker 3>He had read something somewhere where scholars were,</v>

4662
02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:02.880
<v Speaker 3>they were contemplating whether or not they were incorrect about the,</v>

4663
02:19:02.881 --> 02:19:03.880
<v Speaker 3>the sacrifice.</v>

4664
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:05.110
<v Speaker 3>And they were saying that there,</v>

4665
02:19:05.111 --> 02:19:09.370
<v Speaker 3>there may be a possibility that they played a game where they sacrificed the</v>

4666
02:19:09.371 --> 02:19:10.204
<v Speaker 3>winning team.</v>

4667
02:19:11.140 --> 02:19:11.973
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4668
02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:15.040
<v Speaker 3>human sacrifice was conducted on an industrial scale.</v>

4669
02:19:15.070 --> 02:19:16.150
<v Speaker 3>If it has take empire.</v>

4670
02:19:16.180 --> 02:19:16.431
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4671
02:19:16.431 --> 02:19:17.860
<v Speaker 3>I've investigated this very,</v>

4672
02:19:17.861 --> 02:19:18.491
<v Speaker 3>very thoroughly.</v>

4673
02:19:18.491 --> 02:19:19.540
<v Speaker 3>This novel is a novel.</v>

4674
02:19:19.541 --> 02:19:20.111
<v Speaker 3>It's a work of,</v>

4675
02:19:20.111 --> 02:19:21.400
<v Speaker 3>it's a work of fiction,</v>

4676
02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:24.520
<v Speaker 3>but I've thoroughly grounded it in the historical facts.</v>

4677
02:19:24.521 --> 02:19:25.060
<v Speaker 3>And it ended,</v>

4678
02:19:25.060 --> 02:19:26.830
<v Speaker 3>this was a tough history to investigate.</v>

4679
02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:27.621
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4680
02:19:27.621 --> 02:19:28.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

4681
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:30.920
<v Speaker 3>the Aztecs were truly a terrifying culture.</v>

4682
02:19:31.310 --> 02:19:31.910
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4683
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:36.910
<v Speaker 3>the Spanish who turned up with 490 men in 11 ships on the Gulf of Mexico in 15,</v>

4684
02:19:37.221 --> 02:19:40.550
<v Speaker 3>19 where if anything and even more terrifying culture,</v>

4685
02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:41.241
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4686
02:19:41.241 --> 02:19:41.540
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

4687
02:19:41.540 --> 02:19:44.780
<v Speaker 3>these are two martial cultures who are brought together in this,</v>

4688
02:19:44.781 --> 02:19:46.250
<v Speaker 3>in this horrendous conflict.</v>

4689
02:19:46.610 --> 02:19:47.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4690
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.421
<v Speaker 3>but you've,</v>

4691
02:19:47.421 --> 02:19:47.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4692
02:19:47.871 --> 02:19:48.270
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4693
02:19:48.270 --> 02:19:49.280
<v Speaker 3>it was a different time.</v>

4694
02:19:49.281 --> 02:19:50.830
<v Speaker 3>It was a different world then in,</v>

4695
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:51.651
<v Speaker 3>in 15,</v>

4696
02:19:51.651 --> 02:19:52.370
<v Speaker 3>19.</v>

4697
02:19:52.370 --> 02:19:52.760
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4698
02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:53.061
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4699
02:19:53.061 --> 02:19:53.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4700
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:56.720
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to tell the story through the eyes of ordinary human beings.</v>

4701
02:19:56.721 --> 02:19:59.000
<v Speaker 3>My main heroin is a true historical figure.</v>

4702
02:19:59.330 --> 02:20:03.890
<v Speaker 3>A woman called Molly [inaudible] who became the mistress and the interpreter of</v>

4703
02:20:03.891 --> 02:20:04.461
<v Speaker 3>Cortez.</v>

4704
02:20:04.461 --> 02:20:05.840
<v Speaker 3>And when she enters history,</v>

4705
02:20:06.200 --> 02:20:07.670
<v Speaker 3>she's given to Cortez as a,</v>

4706
02:20:08.090 --> 02:20:10.100
<v Speaker 3>as a surrender gift by the Maya.</v>

4707
02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:11.420
<v Speaker 3>When she enters history,</v>

4708
02:20:11.421 --> 02:20:14.870
<v Speaker 3>it's already clear that she has a grudge against Moctezuma,</v>

4709
02:20:15.170 --> 02:20:16.220
<v Speaker 3>the Aztec Emperor,</v>

4710
02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:20.570
<v Speaker 3>and that she is going to use Cortez as her instrument to bring him down.</v>

4711
02:20:20.571 --> 02:20:25.190
<v Speaker 3>And I was just interested in her quest for revenge against the Aztec Empire and</v>

4712
02:20:25.191 --> 02:20:25.731
<v Speaker 3>also to have,</v>

4713
02:20:25.731 --> 02:20:26.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4714
02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:28.910
<v Speaker 3>a woman who was a hero in a story rather than just a man.</v>

4715
02:20:29.090 --> 02:20:29.480
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

4716
02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:30.290
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>

4717
02:20:30.290 --> 02:20:31.460
<v Speaker 3>trying to think through the first little bit.</v>

4718
02:20:31.500 --> 02:20:31.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4719
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:36.650
<v Speaker 3>What is the origin of this horrific level of human sacrifice?</v>

4720
02:20:36.651 --> 02:20:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

4721
02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:39.110
<v Speaker 3>what started it all with the Aztecs?</v>

4722
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.620
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>

4723
02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:39.801
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4724
02:20:39.801 --> 02:20:40.640
<v Speaker 3>that's again,</v>

4725
02:20:40.641 --> 02:20:45.590
<v Speaker 3>that's a reason why I've written war God as a novel because for the Aztecs,</v>

4726
02:20:45.620 --> 02:20:49.550
<v Speaker 3>they believe that they were in touch with a supernatural entity that they called</v>

4727
02:20:49.551 --> 02:20:49.941
<v Speaker 3>Witsell,</v>

4728
02:20:49.941 --> 02:20:51.530
<v Speaker 3>a poshly hummingbird.</v>

4729
02:20:51.531 --> 02:20:54.470
<v Speaker 3>I use his name in the English translation in the book Hummingbird,</v>

4730
02:20:54.830 --> 02:20:56.210
<v Speaker 3>who is their god of war?</v>

4731
02:20:56.211 --> 02:20:56.721
<v Speaker 3>He's there.</v>

4732
02:20:56.721 --> 02:20:57.760
<v Speaker 3>He's there war guard.</v>

4733
02:20:57.770 --> 02:20:58.160
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4734
02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:02.720
<v Speaker 3>and this is an area where we have to recognize that there is a dark side to</v>

4735
02:21:02.721 --> 02:21:03.554
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics.</v>

4736
02:21:04.010 --> 02:21:07.310
<v Speaker 3>I am a big fan of psychedelics and I do think that psychedelics have a hugely</v>

4737
02:21:07.311 --> 02:21:08.150
<v Speaker 3>important role to play.</v>

4738
02:21:08.151 --> 02:21:12.800
<v Speaker 3>But the Aztecs were using psilocybin mushrooms in their human sacrifice rituals.</v>

4739
02:21:13.130 --> 02:21:18.130
<v Speaker 3>And Moctezuma was encountering this demonic entity Hummingbird,</v>

4740
02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:19.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4741
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:21.410
<v Speaker 3>in Psilocybin trances and,</v>

4742
02:21:21.411 --> 02:21:24.110
<v Speaker 3>and was constantly being given incredibly bad,</v>

4743
02:21:24.111 --> 02:21:25.760
<v Speaker 3>even wicked advice by him.</v>

4744
02:21:25.761 --> 02:21:26.570
<v Speaker 3>And there's this,</v>

4745
02:21:26.570 --> 02:21:26.971
<v Speaker 3>so I'm,</v>

4746
02:21:26.971 --> 02:21:31.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm playing with the idea of dark spiritual forces at work behind human history,</v>

4747
02:21:31.880 --> 02:21:33.770
<v Speaker 3>manipulating Moctezuma,</v>

4748
02:21:34.010 --> 02:21:38.960
<v Speaker 3>manipulating Cortez and plunging mankind into this sea of,</v>

4749
02:21:38.990 --> 02:21:41.120
<v Speaker 3>of cruelty in and misery.</v>

4750
02:21:41.640 --> 02:21:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4751
02:21:42.170 --> 02:21:42.921
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

4752
02:21:42.921 --> 02:21:45.830
<v Speaker 3>what redeems the story for me and does it at all times,</v>

4753
02:21:45.831 --> 02:21:48.410
<v Speaker 3>is that the human spirit's still shines through.</v>

4754
02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Even in the darkest times.</v>

4755
02:21:50.180 --> 02:21:51.020
<v Speaker 3>There is courage,</v>

4756
02:21:51.050 --> 02:21:51.890
<v Speaker 3>there is decency,</v>

4757
02:21:51.891 --> 02:21:53.030
<v Speaker 3>there is love people.</v>

4758
02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:56.100
<v Speaker 3>People struggle to show the best in themselves and,</v>

4759
02:21:56.130 --> 02:21:56.560
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4760
02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:57.100
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4761
02:21:57.100 --> 02:21:58.550
<v Speaker 3>and to deliver the best in themselves.</v>

4762
02:21:58.551 --> 02:22:00.340
<v Speaker 3>So I've tried to show both sides of this.</v>

4763
02:22:00.410 --> 02:22:02.510
<v Speaker 3>This book is about the battle of good against evil.</v>

4764
02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:05.720
<v Speaker 3>And it's not that the Spanish are good and the Aztecs evil because the Spanish</v>

4765
02:22:05.721 --> 02:22:06.291
<v Speaker 3>were wicked,</v>

4766
02:22:06.291 --> 02:22:06.621
<v Speaker 3>wicked,</v>

4767
02:22:06.621 --> 02:22:07.520
<v Speaker 3>wicked as well.</v>

4768
02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:08.420
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4769
02:22:08.420 --> 02:22:09.500
<v Speaker 3>and they did terrible things.</v>

4770
02:22:09.501 --> 02:22:10.940
<v Speaker 3>They fed people to dogs.</v>

4771
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4772
02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:11.880
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4773
02:22:11.880 --> 02:22:12.251
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4774
02:22:12.251 --> 02:22:13.480
<v Speaker 3>they burned people at the state.</v>

4775
02:22:13.481 --> 02:22:15.380
<v Speaker 3>What is actually burning somebody at the stake,</v>

4776
02:22:15.381 --> 02:22:16.970
<v Speaker 3>if not a form of human sacrifice.</v>

4777
02:22:17.030 --> 02:22:19.010
<v Speaker 3>That's what the Spanish were due to their God.</v>

4778
02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:21.100
<v Speaker 3>They were sacrificing people to their gods.</v>

4779
02:22:21.101 --> 02:22:23.660
<v Speaker 3>So no different from the Aztecs and that respect,</v>

4780
02:22:23.690 --> 02:22:25.340
<v Speaker 3>the level of sacrifice.</v>

4781
02:22:25.530 --> 02:22:26.500
<v Speaker 3>So insane that I,</v>

4782
02:22:26.501 --> 02:22:30.210
<v Speaker 3>I tried to explain it to a friend of mine and he literally told me I was</v>

4783
02:22:30.211 --> 02:22:31.680
<v Speaker 3>bullshitting when I told them,</v>

4784
02:22:31.681 --> 02:22:31.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4785
02:22:31.950 --> 02:22:34.090
<v Speaker 3>that 80,000 people were sacrificing.</v>

4786
02:22:34.210 --> 02:22:37.470
<v Speaker 3>Thousand were sacrificed period of like four days,</v>

4787
02:22:37.471 --> 02:22:38.230
<v Speaker 3>four days,</v>

4788
02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:38.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4789
02:22:38.460 --> 02:22:39.630
<v Speaker 3>with teams of killers,</v>

4790
02:22:39.631 --> 02:22:43.470
<v Speaker 3>50 teams of killers working at the top of the great pyramid to process people</v>

4791
02:22:43.471 --> 02:22:46.590
<v Speaker 3>within a minute or two per process.</v>

4792
02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:46.850
<v Speaker 3>Them,</v>

4793
02:22:46.850 --> 02:22:47.461
<v Speaker 3>I think of it,</v>

4794
02:22:47.461 --> 02:22:48.151
<v Speaker 3>that's how it's done.</v>

4795
02:22:48.151 --> 02:22:49.950
<v Speaker 3>It was an done on an industrial scale.</v>

4796
02:22:49.951 --> 02:22:53.520
<v Speaker 3>Cues of victims stretching a mile in every direction,</v>

4797
02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:54.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4798
02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:57.690
<v Speaker 3>marching up the pyramid and having there and having their hearts cutout and all</v>

4799
02:22:57.691 --> 02:22:59.450
<v Speaker 3>of this in honor of a,</v>

4800
02:22:59.470 --> 02:23:00.840
<v Speaker 3>of a demonic,</v>

4801
02:23:01.180 --> 02:23:01.321
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4802
02:23:01.321 --> 02:23:02.370
<v Speaker 3>demonic entity,</v>

4803
02:23:02.490 --> 02:23:04.770
<v Speaker 3>which the Aztecs passionately believed in.</v>

4804
02:23:04.830 --> 02:23:08.100
<v Speaker 3>They believed that he needed to be fed human hearts and blood.</v>

4805
02:23:08.101 --> 02:23:08.934
<v Speaker 3>And when they call,</v>

4806
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:10.620
<v Speaker 3>they called him Witsell a poshly,</v>

4807
02:23:10.621 --> 02:23:13.020
<v Speaker 3>which means hummingbird at the left hand of the son.</v>

4808
02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:14.460
<v Speaker 3>He's the war God after whom,</v>

4809
02:23:14.461 --> 02:23:16.870
<v Speaker 3>this after whom this novel is a is,</v>

4810
02:23:16.871 --> 02:23:17.180
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

4811
02:23:17.180 --> 02:23:18.013
<v Speaker 3>is named.</v>

4812
02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:18.601
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4813
02:23:18.601 --> 02:23:19.351
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

4814
02:23:19.351 --> 02:23:19.591
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4815
02:23:19.591 --> 02:23:20.071
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>

4816
02:23:20.071 --> 02:23:21.000
<v Speaker 3>the way I look at it,</v>

4817
02:23:21.340 --> 02:23:26.220
<v Speaker 3>the same demonic entity is manipulating both Moctezuma and Cortez.</v>

4818
02:23:26.221 --> 02:23:29.660
<v Speaker 3>He appears to Cortez in dreams and takes on the disguise of Saint Peter.</v>

4819
02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:31.850
<v Speaker 3>He appears to Moctezuma as the,</v>

4820
02:23:31.860 --> 02:23:32.581
<v Speaker 3>as the war garb,</v>

4821
02:23:32.581 --> 02:23:34.890
<v Speaker 3>but it's the same demon that's playing with men.</v>

4822
02:23:34.891 --> 02:23:36.570
<v Speaker 3>And that's one reason why I wrote this as a novel,</v>

4823
02:23:36.571 --> 02:23:38.820
<v Speaker 3>because you can't get into this stuff in a nonfiction book,</v>

4824
02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:39.811
<v Speaker 3>but it's very real.</v>

4825
02:23:39.811 --> 02:23:43.710
<v Speaker 3>It's a very real part of human history and the whole shape of the world we live</v>

4826
02:23:43.711 --> 02:23:44.544
<v Speaker 3>in today.</v>

4827
02:23:44.820 --> 02:23:45.190
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

4828
02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:47.730
<v Speaker 3>the terrible genocide that happened in North America,</v>

4829
02:23:47.731 --> 02:23:49.620
<v Speaker 3>the destruction of North American Indians,</v>

4830
02:23:49.890 --> 02:23:51.600
<v Speaker 3>the conquest of Peru,</v>

4831
02:23:51.810 --> 02:23:54.420
<v Speaker 3>the whole relationship of the European powers to,</v>

4832
02:23:54.470 --> 02:23:55.830
<v Speaker 3>to Africa for example.</v>

4833
02:23:55.831 --> 02:24:00.110
<v Speaker 3>All of this was based on what happened in those years between 15,</v>

4834
02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:01.050
<v Speaker 3>19 and 15,</v>

4835
02:24:01.051 --> 02:24:04.440
<v Speaker 3>21 when the Spanish conquest of Mexico and folded.</v>

4836
02:24:04.670 --> 02:24:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4837
02:24:05.150 --> 02:24:05.450
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4838
02:24:05.450 --> 02:24:06.230
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

4839
02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:08.430
<v Speaker 3>I think we would let on to a dark track.</v>

4840
02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:11.130
<v Speaker 3>Imagine how it could have been if those two cultures,</v>

4841
02:24:11.131 --> 02:24:14.970
<v Speaker 3>if the Spanish and the Aztecs had met one another in a spirit of mutual</v>

4842
02:24:14.971 --> 02:24:15.660
<v Speaker 3>learning,</v>

4843
02:24:15.660 --> 02:24:17.250
<v Speaker 3>how much there was to exchange,</v>

4844
02:24:17.251 --> 02:24:20.800
<v Speaker 3>how much each side of the Atlantic could have learned from the other instead of</v>

4845
02:24:20.801 --> 02:24:21.000
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

4846
02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:24.300
<v Speaker 3>It becomes this kind of conflagration of,</v>

4847
02:24:24.310 --> 02:24:24.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4848
02:24:24.580 --> 02:24:24.990
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

4849
02:24:24.990 --> 02:24:25.823
<v Speaker 3>of blood,</v>

4850
02:24:26.010 --> 02:24:31.010
<v Speaker 3>but it's difficult to place ourselves in the mindset of the people of that time.</v>

4851
02:24:31.300 --> 02:24:33.240
<v Speaker 3>It is difficult for us to do that today.</v>

4852
02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:33.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4853
02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:34.920
<v Speaker 3>and I have to say,</v>

4854
02:24:34.921 --> 02:24:36.420
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the Spaniards,</v>

4855
02:24:36.450 --> 02:24:41.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean 490 men turn up on the coast of Mexico in 11 ships and they are going to</v>

4856
02:24:41.311 --> 02:24:45.960
<v Speaker 3>take on this empire that can put 200,000 men into the field that will,</v>

4857
02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:47.100
<v Speaker 3>if they catch you,</v>

4858
02:24:47.310 --> 02:24:49.740
<v Speaker 3>will match you up the pyramid and cut your heart out.</v>

4859
02:24:49.770 --> 02:24:53.070
<v Speaker 3>And many Spaniards were sacrificed in sight of their,</v>

4860
02:24:53.071 --> 02:24:53.970
<v Speaker 3>of their colleagues.</v>

4861
02:24:54.390 --> 02:24:54.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4862
02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:56.610
<v Speaker 3>it was an extraordinary time.</v>

4863
02:24:56.611 --> 02:24:59.600
<v Speaker 3>It was an extraordinary event and men of those times were different from,</v>

4864
02:24:59.710 --> 02:25:00.543
<v Speaker 3>from men of today,</v>

4865
02:25:00.570 --> 02:25:01.403
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>

4866
02:25:01.410 --> 02:25:06.410
<v Speaker 3>What is the mainstream explanation for human sacrifice?</v>

4867
02:25:06.631 --> 02:25:07.110
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

4868
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:09.090
<v Speaker 3>what do they believe started off?</v>

4869
02:25:09.150 --> 02:25:09.361
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4870
02:25:09.361 --> 02:25:09.751
<v Speaker 3>that it's,</v>

4871
02:25:09.751 --> 02:25:14.751
<v Speaker 3>that it's a feeding of psychic energy to supernatural beings.</v>

4872
02:25:14.820 --> 02:25:16.650
<v Speaker 3>That's what human sacrifices about that,</v>

4873
02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:21.680
<v Speaker 3>that that you take the psychic energy of the individual you're going to kill</v>

4874
02:25:21.691 --> 02:25:21.930
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4875
02:25:21.930 --> 02:25:22.763
<v Speaker 3>kill them,</v>

4876
02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:27.190
<v Speaker 3>take their psychic energy and feed it to these vampire like creatures that are</v>

4877
02:25:27.191 --> 02:25:28.720
<v Speaker 3>lying in the beyond that,</v>

4878
02:25:28.780 --> 02:25:31.780
<v Speaker 3>that thrive on human misery and pain.</v>

4879
02:25:32.290 --> 02:25:32.891
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

4880
02:25:32.891 --> 02:25:35.320
<v Speaker 3>who are we to say that such things do not exist?</v>

4881
02:25:35.321 --> 02:25:37.360
<v Speaker 3>We don't understand the nature of reality.</v>

4882
02:25:37.630 --> 02:25:39.130
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at human culture day,</v>

4883
02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:40.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at wars,</v>

4884
02:25:40.481 --> 02:25:42.370
<v Speaker 3>look at wars that are happening in the world today.</v>

4885
02:25:42.370 --> 02:25:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Look at the tens of thousands of people that are being slaughtered in warfare</v>

4886
02:25:45.401 --> 02:25:45.940
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

4887
02:25:45.940 --> 02:25:47.890
<v Speaker 3>That's also a kind of human sacrifice.</v>

4888
02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:52.240
<v Speaker 3>I think we have to consider the possibility that some kind of demonic force is</v>

4889
02:25:52.241 --> 02:25:53.740
<v Speaker 3>thriving on this and,</v>

4890
02:25:53.741 --> 02:25:54.370
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4891
02:25:54.370 --> 02:25:56.140
<v Speaker 3>and being nourished by it.</v>

4892
02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:59.500
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things that we need to do as human beings is to separate</v>

4893
02:25:59.501 --> 02:26:00.550
<v Speaker 3>ourselves from that and say,</v>

4894
02:26:00.551 --> 02:26:01.300
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4895
02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:02.320
<v Speaker 3>we will not do that.</v>

4896
02:26:02.350 --> 02:26:04.150
<v Speaker 3>We will not feed that energy.</v>

4897
02:26:04.390 --> 02:26:08.150
<v Speaker 3>We will not offer lives easier.</v>

4898
02:26:08.170 --> 02:26:08.621
<v Speaker 3>The beyond.</v>

4899
02:26:08.621 --> 02:26:10.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't go with you on that,</v>

4900
02:26:10.090 --> 02:26:11.410
<v Speaker 3>but I do in a way,</v>

4901
02:26:11.530 --> 02:26:13.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in demons,</v>

4902
02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:14.681
<v Speaker 3>but I do.</v>

4903
02:26:14.681 --> 02:26:19.681
<v Speaker 3>I think it's undeniable that there have been massive groups of people that have</v>

4904
02:26:20.231 --> 02:26:22.480
<v Speaker 3>participated in horrific things.</v>

4905
02:26:22.690 --> 02:26:23.830
<v Speaker 3>So what is that,</v>

4906
02:26:23.860 --> 02:26:25.510
<v Speaker 3>if not demonic?</v>

4907
02:26:25.690 --> 02:26:26.290
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's,</v>

4908
02:26:26.290 --> 02:26:27.160
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's demonic.</v>

4909
02:26:27.161 --> 02:26:28.360
<v Speaker 3>I can't prove it.</v>

4910
02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:30.280
<v Speaker 3>I can't prove that that's the case.</v>

4911
02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:34.270
<v Speaker 3>I just think we should stay open to that possibility that the nature of reality</v>

4912
02:26:34.271 --> 02:26:38.800
<v Speaker 3>is so complex and so multilayered that there may be much more going on than we</v>

4913
02:26:38.801 --> 02:26:39.191
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

4914
02:26:39.191 --> 02:26:40.060
<v Speaker 3>And that if we just,</v>

4915
02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:44.500
<v Speaker 3>if we just confine our explanations of things to purely economic and material</v>

4916
02:26:44.501 --> 02:26:44.891
<v Speaker 3>terms,</v>

4917
02:26:44.891 --> 02:26:46.540
<v Speaker 3>we may be missing part of the picture.</v>

4918
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:47.091
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4919
02:26:47.091 --> 02:26:51.070
<v Speaker 3>and that when the ancient spoke of angels and demons to use words,</v>

4920
02:26:51.071 --> 02:26:53.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that I believe in angels or demons as such,</v>

4921
02:26:53.741 --> 02:26:56.500
<v Speaker 3>but when they spoke of Lawton light and dark forces,</v>

4922
02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:59.590
<v Speaker 3>negative and positive forces playing on the,</v>

4923
02:26:59.591 --> 02:27:00.341
<v Speaker 3>on the human race,</v>

4924
02:27:00.341 --> 02:27:01.690
<v Speaker 3>maybe they had something going.</v>

4925
02:27:01.691 --> 02:27:02.910
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there was something to that.</v>

4926
02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4927
02:27:03.140 --> 02:27:06.790
<v Speaker 3>I always consider the fact that human beings have this incredibly broad spectrum</v>

4928
02:27:06.850 --> 02:27:07.840
<v Speaker 3>of possibility.</v>

4929
02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:08.870
<v Speaker 3>It's incredibly bar,</v>

4930
02:27:09.010 --> 02:27:11.230
<v Speaker 3>broad spectrum of behavior and personality,</v>

4931
02:27:11.231 --> 02:27:12.011
<v Speaker 3>of circumstance,</v>

4932
02:27:12.011 --> 02:27:12.844
<v Speaker 3>of genetics,</v>

4933
02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.430
<v Speaker 3>and that there's this Yin and Yang of life.</v>

4934
02:27:15.430 --> 02:27:17.770
<v Speaker 3>There's this pull and push of life,</v>

4935
02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:20.830
<v Speaker 3>and that the extreme ends of it are good and evil,</v>

4936
02:27:20.860 --> 02:27:21.380
<v Speaker 3>good and evil.</v>

4937
02:27:21.380 --> 02:27:21.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4938
02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:21.970
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4939
02:27:21.970 --> 02:27:22.540
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

4940
02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:23.980
<v Speaker 3>it may not be a demon,</v>

4941
02:27:23.981 --> 02:27:26.020
<v Speaker 3>but it might as well be a demon if you're marching.</v>

4942
02:27:26.021 --> 02:27:28.780
<v Speaker 3>80,000 people off the side of a pyramid and cutting their heart out with a</v>

4943
02:27:28.781 --> 02:27:29.950
<v Speaker 3>fucking stone tool.</v>

4944
02:27:29.980 --> 02:27:30.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4945
02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:31.450
<v Speaker 3>That's demonic.</v>

4946
02:27:31.450 --> 02:27:32.283
<v Speaker 3>It might as well be,</v>

4947
02:27:32.390 --> 02:27:33.370
<v Speaker 3>might as well be a demon.</v>

4948
02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:33.761
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4949
02:27:33.761 --> 02:27:34.001
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4950
02:27:34.001 --> 02:27:34.331
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4951
02:27:34.331 --> 02:27:35.290
<v Speaker 3>and that is a,</v>

4952
02:27:35.291 --> 02:27:36.310
<v Speaker 3>that is worth considering.</v>

4953
02:27:36.311 --> 02:27:36.581
<v Speaker 3>And the A,</v>

4954
02:27:36.581 --> 02:27:37.151
<v Speaker 3>and the question is,</v>

4955
02:27:37.151 --> 02:27:37.820
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>

4956
02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:38.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4957
02:27:38.100 --> 02:27:39.040
<v Speaker 3>what is going on here?</v>

4958
02:27:39.041 --> 02:27:44.041
<v Speaker 3>I have a very dear friend called James Tiburon who refers to this world that we</v>

4959
02:27:44.201 --> 02:27:49.000
<v Speaker 3>live in as a university of [inaudible] that we have,</v>

4960
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:49.863
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4961
02:27:49.930 --> 02:27:52.240
<v Speaker 3>that we have lessons to learn from duality,</v>

4962
02:27:52.241 --> 02:27:53.140
<v Speaker 3>maybe dualities,</v>

4963
02:27:53.141 --> 02:27:53.921
<v Speaker 3>not the whole thing.</v>

4964
02:27:53.921 --> 02:27:56.730
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there is an overarching unity and oneness in,</v>

4965
02:27:56.731 --> 02:27:57.430
<v Speaker 3>in all things.</v>

4966
02:27:57.430 --> 02:28:00.160
<v Speaker 3>But right now here in this incarnation on planet earth,</v>

4967
02:28:00.430 --> 02:28:02.110
<v Speaker 3>we have to learn from duality.</v>

4968
02:28:02.111 --> 02:28:05.260
<v Speaker 3>And the thing about duality is human beings can choose.</v>

4969
02:28:05.261 --> 02:28:06.340
<v Speaker 3>We can always choose,</v>

4970
02:28:06.341 --> 02:28:09.220
<v Speaker 3>even in the most straightened and difficult circumstances,</v>

4971
02:28:09.221 --> 02:28:12.130
<v Speaker 3>we can always choose for the light rather than the darkness.</v>

4972
02:28:12.131 --> 02:28:13.780
<v Speaker 3>We can always choose for good rather than evil.</v>

4973
02:28:13.781 --> 02:28:17.740
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to take that act that causes pain and suffering to another human</v>

4974
02:28:17.741 --> 02:28:18.101
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

4975
02:28:18.101 --> 02:28:19.390
<v Speaker 3>We never have to do that.</v>

4976
02:28:19.660 --> 02:28:21.130
<v Speaker 3>We can always choose not to.</v>

4977
02:28:21.380 --> 02:28:26.060
<v Speaker 3>The alarming thing is that people often will choose the act that causes pain and</v>

4978
02:28:26.061 --> 02:28:30.050
<v Speaker 3>suffering to others and we are defined by our choices and this is where we need</v>

4979
02:28:30.051 --> 02:28:32.270
<v Speaker 3>to grow up as a species and start to choose,</v>

4980
02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:33.620
<v Speaker 3>start to choose the light.</v>

4981
02:28:33.650 --> 02:28:36.290
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that this broad spectrum of possibilities,</v>

4982
02:28:36.350 --> 02:28:39.080
<v Speaker 3>whether it's possibilities of thinking or behavior,</v>

4983
02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:44.440
<v Speaker 3>it's almost there to educate us as to the possibilities of this destructive</v>

4984
02:28:44.841 --> 02:28:49.841
<v Speaker 3>possibilities that this huge spectrum that we have is is it's so open ended and</v>

4985
02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:55.160
<v Speaker 3>so massive as to indicate that there are these extreme variables and these</v>

4986
02:28:55.161 --> 02:28:59.750
<v Speaker 3>extreme variables can push us by understanding of the consequences into a more</v>

4987
02:28:59.751 --> 02:29:00.584
<v Speaker 3>positive way.</v>

4988
02:29:00.930 --> 02:29:01.970
<v Speaker 3>They didn't exist.</v>

4989
02:29:02.180 --> 02:29:06.140
<v Speaker 3>If these horrific ideas of war and of human sacrifice didn't exist,</v>

4990
02:29:06.290 --> 02:29:08.270
<v Speaker 3>maybe we wouldn't appreciate love as much.</v>

4991
02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:11.540
<v Speaker 3>We would not appreciate love as much and we would have nothing to learn from</v>

4992
02:29:11.541 --> 02:29:11.930
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

4993
02:29:11.930 --> 02:29:16.250
<v Speaker 3>this strange and troublesome and mysterious and beautiful thing called being a</v>

4994
02:29:16.251 --> 02:29:17.084
<v Speaker 3>human being.</v>

4995
02:29:17.330 --> 02:29:18.650
<v Speaker 3>We have to learn here.</v>

4996
02:29:18.651 --> 02:29:20.810
<v Speaker 3>We learn here because there are those,</v>

4997
02:29:20.870 --> 02:29:24.830
<v Speaker 3>those two different poles at the extreme end of which are good and evil with all</v>

4998
02:29:24.831 --> 02:29:26.570
<v Speaker 3>kinds of gradations in between.</v>

4999
02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:30.890
<v Speaker 3>That is what teaches us and then it's the choices we make day by day as we go</v>

5000
02:29:30.891 --> 02:29:33.590
<v Speaker 3>through life that define us ultimately.</v>

5001
02:29:33.591 --> 02:29:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

5002
02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:37.160
<v Speaker 3>whether there is any transcendental consequence to that,</v>

5003
02:29:37.161 --> 02:29:38.720
<v Speaker 3>something beyond this life,</v>

5004
02:29:38.750 --> 02:29:39.620
<v Speaker 3>something that some,</v>

5005
02:29:39.621 --> 02:29:40.280
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

5006
02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:42.180
<v Speaker 3>some reckoning to take place as,</v>

5007
02:29:42.181 --> 02:29:44.330
<v Speaker 3>as the ancient Egyptians certainly believe there was.</v>

5008
02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:45.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't know for sure but I,</v>

5009
02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:50.710
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that a lifetime of making decisions that cause pain and suffering</v>

5010
02:29:50.871 --> 02:29:52.470
<v Speaker 3>to others and that inflict and,</v>

5011
02:29:52.480 --> 02:29:55.040
<v Speaker 3>and that detract from their sovereignty,</v>

5012
02:29:55.430 --> 02:29:55.821
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5013
02:29:55.821 --> 02:29:56.391
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

5014
02:29:56.391 --> 02:29:56.651
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

5015
02:29:56.651 --> 02:29:56.931
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

5016
02:29:56.931 --> 02:30:00.740
<v Speaker 3>is a life that ultimately the person who's lived that life is diminished by it.</v>

5017
02:30:01.070 --> 02:30:04.400
<v Speaker 3>I want to know how they got 80,000 people to get an aligned,</v>

5018
02:30:04.401 --> 02:30:06.530
<v Speaker 3>to give their heart to cut out terror.</v>

5019
02:30:07.220 --> 02:30:08.031
<v Speaker 3>Total terror.</v>

5020
02:30:08.031 --> 02:30:10.430
<v Speaker 3>They were the dominant military force in,</v>

5021
02:30:10.490 --> 02:30:13.580
<v Speaker 3>in the Valley of Mexico at that they were very dominant.</v>

5022
02:30:13.600 --> 02:30:14.031
<v Speaker 3>They asked,</v>

5023
02:30:14.031 --> 02:30:15.740
<v Speaker 3>tex had a huge secret police force.</v>

5024
02:30:15.741 --> 02:30:16.880
<v Speaker 3>They spied on one another.</v>

5025
02:30:16.881 --> 02:30:17.840
<v Speaker 3>They spied on their neighbors.</v>

5026
02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:22.130
<v Speaker 3>They would carry out human sacrifices as object lessons to their neighbors.</v>

5027
02:30:22.131 --> 02:30:24.530
<v Speaker 3>You will pay us tribute or this is what we will do to you.</v>

5028
02:30:24.531 --> 02:30:26.090
<v Speaker 3>They skinned people alive.</v>

5029
02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:26.660
<v Speaker 3>They would,</v>

5030
02:30:26.660 --> 02:30:27.471
<v Speaker 3>they would truly,</v>

5031
02:30:27.471 --> 02:30:28.700
<v Speaker 3>truly awful.</v>

5032
02:30:29.030 --> 02:30:29.301
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5033
02:30:29.301 --> 02:30:29.571
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

5034
02:30:29.571 --> 02:30:31.040
<v Speaker 3>and it was their awfulness.</v>

5035
02:30:31.070 --> 02:30:35.930
<v Speaker 3>It was the horrific nature of as tech behavior that led them to lose that battle</v>

5036
02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:37.310
<v Speaker 3>against Cortez,</v>

5037
02:30:37.660 --> 02:30:37.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5038
02:30:37.910 --> 02:30:38.361
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

5039
02:30:38.361 --> 02:30:40.430
<v Speaker 3>because quarter had numbers are crazy.</v>

5040
02:30:40.460 --> 02:30:40.911
<v Speaker 3>Cortez,</v>

5041
02:30:40.911 --> 02:30:44.360
<v Speaker 3>490 men as TX 200,000 is pretty,</v>

5042
02:30:44.430 --> 02:30:46.040
<v Speaker 3>you think it's pretty obvious who's going to win?</v>

5043
02:30:46.041 --> 02:30:46.791
<v Speaker 3>How does Cortez,</v>

5044
02:30:46.791 --> 02:30:47.840
<v Speaker 3>when he wins,</v>

5045
02:30:47.841 --> 02:30:50.480
<v Speaker 3>because the Aztecs neighbors hate the Aztecs.</v>

5046
02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:53.600
<v Speaker 3>They have lived in terror of them for 200 years,</v>

5047
02:30:53.900 --> 02:30:55.580
<v Speaker 3>and they see him as a liberator.</v>

5048
02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:59.840
<v Speaker 3>They see him as somebody who is going to lift this yoke off their shoulders and,</v>

5049
02:30:59.850 --> 02:31:01.820
<v Speaker 3>and allow them to be free.</v>

5050
02:31:01.821 --> 02:31:02.181
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

5051
02:31:02.181 --> 02:31:03.350
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know that.</v>

5052
02:31:03.351 --> 02:31:04.910
<v Speaker 3>He was just gonna make things worse.</v>

5053
02:31:05.240 --> 02:31:05.541
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5054
02:31:05.541 --> 02:31:05.781
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

5055
02:31:05.781 --> 02:31:05.901
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5056
02:31:05.901 --> 02:31:06.681
<v Speaker 3>in the time,</v>

5057
02:31:06.681 --> 02:31:07.580
<v Speaker 3>in the nature of things,</v>

5058
02:31:07.581 --> 02:31:08.211
<v Speaker 3>at the time,</v>

5059
02:31:08.211 --> 02:31:09.410
<v Speaker 3>that was how it was felt.</v>

5060
02:31:09.411 --> 02:31:09.621
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5061
02:31:09.621 --> 02:31:13.400
<v Speaker 3>it's a fact that there were 30 million people in Mexico in 15,</v>

5062
02:31:13.401 --> 02:31:15.320
<v Speaker 3>19 and 50 years later,</v>

5063
02:31:15.321 --> 02:31:16.400
<v Speaker 3>they were just 1 million.</v>

5064
02:31:16.730 --> 02:31:20.130
<v Speaker 3>The Spanish were responsible for a genocide of 29 million people.</v>

5065
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:21.840
<v Speaker 3>So they didn't make things better,</v>

5066
02:31:21.841 --> 02:31:23.700
<v Speaker 3>but it looked like they'd make things better.</v>

5067
02:31:23.790 --> 02:31:25.220
<v Speaker 3>And they came as a kind of comma.</v>

5068
02:31:25.221 --> 02:31:25.650
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

5069
02:31:25.650 --> 02:31:26.760
<v Speaker 3>and here's the weird thing again,</v>

5070
02:31:26.761 --> 02:31:29.550
<v Speaker 3>I'll show this cover because beside it is the feathered serpent,</v>

5071
02:31:30.050 --> 02:31:30.570
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5072
02:31:30.570 --> 02:31:31.403
<v Speaker 3>in this,</v>

5073
02:31:31.740 --> 02:31:32.573
<v Speaker 3>in this,</v>

5074
02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:33.463
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5075
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:34.343
<v Speaker 3>photograph,</v>

5076
02:31:34.500 --> 02:31:35.970
<v Speaker 3>and that's quite solid collateral.</v>

5077
02:31:36.180 --> 02:31:36.471
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

5078
02:31:36.471 --> 02:31:37.920
<v Speaker 3>the feathered serpent who is,</v>

5079
02:31:37.921 --> 02:31:38.521
<v Speaker 3>who is there.</v>

5080
02:31:38.521 --> 02:31:41.160
<v Speaker 3>And this is another reason why Cortez one,</v>

5081
02:31:41.500 --> 02:31:41.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5082
02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:46.760
<v Speaker 3>because he was able to play on the prophecy that a god of peace would return and</v>

5083
02:31:47.311 --> 02:31:47.431
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

5084
02:31:47.431 --> 02:31:49.890
<v Speaker 3>that God would overthrow wicked king.</v>

5085
02:31:50.160 --> 02:31:51.780
<v Speaker 3>And he was the feathered serpent.</v>

5086
02:31:51.781 --> 02:31:55.110
<v Speaker 3>He was quite psychiatry and it was predicted that he would return in the Aztec</v>

5087
02:31:55.111 --> 02:31:56.760
<v Speaker 3>year one reed.</v>

5088
02:31:57.090 --> 02:32:01.140
<v Speaker 3>And it so happened that Cortez landed on the coast of Mexico with his tiny army</v>

5089
02:32:01.470 --> 02:32:03.810
<v Speaker 3>in the Aztec year one reed 15,</v>

5090
02:32:03.811 --> 02:32:05.430
<v Speaker 3>19 was the year one reed.</v>

5091
02:32:05.431 --> 02:32:09.810
<v Speaker 3>So the return of [inaudible] was a key part of Cortez is a victory.</v>

5092
02:32:09.811 --> 02:32:10.644
<v Speaker 3>And my heroin.</v>

5093
02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:13.740
<v Speaker 3>Molly Nol is the person who tells Cortez about this.</v>

5094
02:32:13.741 --> 02:32:14.041
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

5095
02:32:14.041 --> 02:32:19.041
<v Speaker 3>she's the one who shows him how to exploit this and how to play Moctezuma's</v>

5096
02:32:19.141 --> 02:32:22.350
<v Speaker 3>superstition and fear to represent himself as this God,</v>

5097
02:32:22.351 --> 02:32:23.070
<v Speaker 3>but of course,</v>

5098
02:32:23.070 --> 02:32:24.450
<v Speaker 3>Cortez is not a god of peace.</v>

5099
02:32:24.450 --> 02:32:25.230
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>

5100
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:26.280
<v Speaker 3>he's a god of war.</v>

5101
02:32:26.370 --> 02:32:28.020
<v Speaker 3>It's a quite a quite a coincidence.</v>

5102
02:32:28.180 --> 02:32:28.950
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>

5103
02:32:28.950 --> 02:32:30.000
<v Speaker 3>Amazing coincidence.</v>

5104
02:32:30.001 --> 02:32:31.820
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is or is it a prophecy?</v>

5105
02:32:31.890 --> 02:32:32.191
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

5106
02:32:32.191 --> 02:32:33.030
<v Speaker 3>you have to wonder.</v>

5107
02:32:33.330 --> 02:32:34.710
<v Speaker 3>You have to wonder how this,</v>

5108
02:32:34.711 --> 02:32:37.620
<v Speaker 3>how this could have happened because the prophecy was quite specific.</v>

5109
02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:42.750
<v Speaker 3>That quits our collateral and his companions would return in the year one reed,</v>

5110
02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:46.770
<v Speaker 3>they would return in ships that moved by themselves without paddles.</v>

5111
02:32:46.830 --> 02:32:48.660
<v Speaker 3>What were the Spanish ships with their sales,</v>

5112
02:32:48.661 --> 02:32:50.730
<v Speaker 3>but ships that move by themselves without paddles.</v>

5113
02:32:51.090 --> 02:32:56.090
<v Speaker 3>They would be dressed in shining metal armor and they would deploy weapons</v>

5114
02:32:56.941 --> 02:32:58.080
<v Speaker 3>called she who cattle,</v>

5115
02:32:58.081 --> 02:32:59.550
<v Speaker 3>which means fire serpents,</v>

5116
02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:01.830
<v Speaker 3>which would dismember man at a distance,</v>

5117
02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:02.970
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

5118
02:33:02.970 --> 02:33:02.970
<v Speaker 3>E.</v>

5119
02:33:02.970 --> 02:33:03.030
<v Speaker 3>Guns,</v>

5120
02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:03.960
<v Speaker 3>all of this cannon,</v>

5121
02:33:03.990 --> 02:33:06.540
<v Speaker 3>all of this was right there in the prophecy.</v>

5122
02:33:06.650 --> 02:33:09.000
<v Speaker 3>And Cortez was able to step right into that,</v>

5123
02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:13.440
<v Speaker 3>into that role and to turn around what should have been an obvious defeat for</v>

5124
02:33:13.441 --> 02:33:14.610
<v Speaker 3>his tiny force into,</v>

5125
02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:16.260
<v Speaker 3>into a stunning,</v>

5126
02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:17.580
<v Speaker 3>stunning victory.</v>

5127
02:33:17.880 --> 02:33:19.590
<v Speaker 3>That is absolutely fascinating.</v>

5128
02:33:19.591 --> 02:33:22.140
<v Speaker 3>So many correlating ideas.</v>

5129
02:33:22.170 --> 02:33:22.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5130
02:33:22.580 --> 02:33:22.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5131
02:33:22.830 --> 02:33:24.570
<v Speaker 3>So many correlating ideas come together.</v>

5132
02:33:24.780 --> 02:33:28.170
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I felt I want to write a book about this and that's why I thought</v>

5133
02:33:28.171 --> 02:33:31.860
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to get inside the heads of the characters and deal with that battle of</v>

5134
02:33:31.861 --> 02:33:33.030
<v Speaker 3>good against evil at a,</v>

5135
02:33:33.031 --> 02:33:33.811
<v Speaker 3>at a level that won't,</v>

5136
02:33:33.811 --> 02:33:35.280
<v Speaker 3>can't do in a nonfiction book.</v>

5137
02:33:35.370 --> 02:33:37.620
<v Speaker 3>How old was this prophesy?</v>

5138
02:33:37.650 --> 02:33:37.921
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5139
02:33:37.921 --> 02:33:39.360
<v Speaker 3>that image that I showed of the,</v>

5140
02:33:39.361 --> 02:33:40.590
<v Speaker 3>of the feathered serpent,</v>

5141
02:33:40.830 --> 02:33:41.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5142
02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:41.641
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

5143
02:33:41.641 --> 02:33:43.800
<v Speaker 3>I show it that image of the feathered serpent,</v>

5144
02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:46.200
<v Speaker 3>which side of my screen and my own here,</v>

5145
02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:48.750
<v Speaker 3>that image of the feathered serpent is,</v>

5146
02:33:48.751 --> 02:33:52.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm from La Venta in the Gulf of Mexico.</v>

5147
02:33:52.290 --> 02:33:55.260
<v Speaker 3>And that is in the oldest archeological strata of Mexico.</v>

5148
02:33:55.590 --> 02:34:00.300
<v Speaker 3>That image dates to an archeological strata that is about 1,500 BC,</v>

5149
02:34:00.690 --> 02:34:01.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5150
02:34:01.410 --> 02:34:02.520
<v Speaker 3>3000,</v>

5151
02:34:02.521 --> 02:34:04.050
<v Speaker 3>500 years ago.</v>

5152
02:34:04.410 --> 02:34:06.720
<v Speaker 3>The stone itself may be much older than that,</v>

5153
02:34:06.721 --> 02:34:10.020
<v Speaker 3>but the strategist dug up from was already 3,500 years old.</v>

5154
02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:10.950
<v Speaker 3>So this notion,</v>

5155
02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:12.790
<v Speaker 3>and there are many images of,</v>

5156
02:34:12.791 --> 02:34:17.791
<v Speaker 3>of people with kind of Caucasian features found in the same stratum notion of a</v>

5157
02:34:17.950 --> 02:34:22.180
<v Speaker 3>mysterious strangers who were in Mexico at some time and who would return is</v>

5158
02:34:22.181 --> 02:34:24.010
<v Speaker 3>very ancient in the Mexican system.</v>

5159
02:34:24.370 --> 02:34:24.701
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

5160
02:34:24.701 --> 02:34:25.960
<v Speaker 3>And how did they,</v>

5161
02:34:25.961 --> 02:34:26.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a,</v>

5162
02:34:26.651 --> 02:34:29.740
<v Speaker 3>there's a very different language that they used then,</v>

5163
02:34:29.741 --> 02:34:30.431
<v Speaker 3>then hours.</v>

5164
02:34:30.431 --> 02:34:34.030
<v Speaker 3>And it was very difficult for them to decipher a lot of the,</v>

5165
02:34:34.031 --> 02:34:34.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5166
02:34:34.390 --> 02:34:37.000
<v Speaker 3>especially the Mayan there were in the Aztec,</v>

5167
02:34:37.210 --> 02:34:37.961
<v Speaker 3>the way their,</v>

5168
02:34:37.961 --> 02:34:38.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5169
02:34:38.310 --> 02:34:38.510
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

5170
02:34:38.510 --> 02:34:40.090
<v Speaker 3>what exactly they were saying.</v>

5171
02:34:40.210 --> 02:34:42.280
<v Speaker 3>How did they figure out that the,</v>

5172
02:34:42.330 --> 02:34:47.290
<v Speaker 3>they're saying ships without oars and things.</v>

5173
02:34:47.350 --> 02:34:48.690
<v Speaker 3>It's fired guns the whole day.</v>

5174
02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:50.170
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting point that you raise.</v>

5175
02:34:50.171 --> 02:34:52.690
<v Speaker 3>So when Cortez fest lands in Mexico,</v>

5176
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:55.210
<v Speaker 3>he lands in the Yucatan,</v>

5177
02:34:55.630 --> 02:34:55.991
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5178
02:34:55.991 --> 02:34:58.360
<v Speaker 3>and the people who live in the Yucatan are the Maya.</v>

5179
02:34:58.400 --> 02:34:59.300
<v Speaker 3>They're not the Aztecs.</v>

5180
02:34:59.310 --> 02:35:00.970
<v Speaker 3>They are the first people he encounters.</v>

5181
02:35:01.570 --> 02:35:03.790
<v Speaker 3>And there he has an incredible stroke of luck.</v>

5182
02:35:03.791 --> 02:35:05.380
<v Speaker 3>He can't speak a word of mine.</v>

5183
02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:08.320
<v Speaker 3>And nor can anybody else in his group of Spaniards.</v>

5184
02:35:08.620 --> 02:35:13.420
<v Speaker 3>But they discovered that somebody who looks like them is living on the mainland</v>

5185
02:35:13.421 --> 02:35:14.710
<v Speaker 3>as a prisoner of the Maya.</v>

5186
02:35:14.750 --> 02:35:17.950
<v Speaker 3>They're Spanish first landed in Cozumel holiday resort today,</v>

5187
02:35:18.310 --> 02:35:19.270
<v Speaker 3>and the the,</v>

5188
02:35:19.271 --> 02:35:21.970
<v Speaker 3>the Mayan tribe on Cozumel were relatively peaceful,</v>

5189
02:35:21.971 --> 02:35:23.530
<v Speaker 3>but the people on the mainland were not.</v>

5190
02:35:23.531 --> 02:35:24.311
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

5191
02:35:24.311 --> 02:35:24.560
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

5192
02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:29.050
<v Speaker 3>the Maya have Cozumel came to Cortez and they said this with sign language.</v>

5193
02:35:29.051 --> 02:35:32.830
<v Speaker 3>They pointed at him and they said Castilian they actually told him he was a</v>

5194
02:35:32.831 --> 02:35:34.090
<v Speaker 3>Castilian and caught his thought.</v>

5195
02:35:34.091 --> 02:35:35.590
<v Speaker 3>How can they know I'm a Castilian?</v>

5196
02:35:35.591 --> 02:35:36.910
<v Speaker 3>That's what the Spanish called themselves.</v>

5197
02:35:37.210 --> 02:35:37.490
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

5198
02:35:37.490 --> 02:35:38.920
<v Speaker 3>and gradually through sign language,</v>

5199
02:35:38.921 --> 02:35:40.330
<v Speaker 3>he figured out what it was,</v>

5200
02:35:40.570 --> 02:35:44.170
<v Speaker 3>that there was a Spaniard who'd been shipwrecked on the coast of Mexico.</v>

5201
02:35:44.170 --> 02:35:44.921
<v Speaker 3>At some point,</v>

5202
02:35:44.921 --> 02:35:46.600
<v Speaker 3>it turned out it was 11 years before.</v>

5203
02:35:46.601 --> 02:35:46.931
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

5204
02:35:46.931 --> 02:35:51.931
<v Speaker 3>26 Spaniards had been shipwrecked 11 years before 25 of them had been eaten by</v>

5205
02:35:52.541 --> 02:35:53.374
<v Speaker 3>the Maya,</v>

5206
02:35:53.530 --> 02:35:57.100
<v Speaker 3>but one Hiroshima Aguilar had survived.</v>

5207
02:35:57.101 --> 02:36:00.130
<v Speaker 3>So Cortez grabbed him and I tell this story in my book,</v>

5208
02:36:00.131 --> 02:36:02.050
<v Speaker 3>and Cortez became a Aguilar,</v>

5209
02:36:02.051 --> 02:36:03.730
<v Speaker 3>became Cortez is first interpreter.</v>

5210
02:36:03.731 --> 02:36:04.181
<v Speaker 3>So suddenly,</v>

5211
02:36:04.181 --> 02:36:05.410
<v Speaker 3>because he spoke fluent Maya.</v>

5212
02:36:05.411 --> 02:36:05.740
<v Speaker 3>By then,</v>

5213
02:36:05.740 --> 02:36:10.030
<v Speaker 3>he'd been living amongst the Maya for 11 years and he spoke Spanish as well.</v>

5214
02:36:10.180 --> 02:36:12.250
<v Speaker 3>So suddenly they could understand the Maya,</v>

5215
02:36:12.251 --> 02:36:13.870
<v Speaker 3>they could communicate with the Maya,</v>

5216
02:36:14.590 --> 02:36:19.090
<v Speaker 3>but then when they went on and they encountered the Aztecs for the first time,</v>

5217
02:36:19.330 --> 02:36:22.720
<v Speaker 3>the Aztec spoke another language and that language was not a wattle.</v>

5218
02:36:22.930 --> 02:36:25.840
<v Speaker 3>The language of the Aztecs and ag will are suddenly became useless.</v>

5219
02:36:25.990 --> 02:36:28.900
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't speak Nahuatl and that's where my heroine,</v>

5220
02:36:28.901 --> 02:36:30.190
<v Speaker 3>who is a true historical figure,</v>

5221
02:36:30.430 --> 02:36:32.600
<v Speaker 3>Malina thrusts herself forward.</v>

5222
02:36:32.620 --> 02:36:35.230
<v Speaker 3>She's already been handed over to Cortez as a prisoner.</v>

5223
02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:36.900
<v Speaker 3>She speaks fluent Navajo,</v>

5224
02:36:36.910 --> 02:36:38.860
<v Speaker 3>Atul and fluent Maya,</v>

5225
02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:40.600
<v Speaker 3>and she communicates to Cortez,</v>

5226
02:36:40.601 --> 02:36:40.960
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

5227
02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:42.160
<v Speaker 3>I can work with your man,</v>

5228
02:36:42.161 --> 02:36:42.994
<v Speaker 3>Aguilar.</v>

5229
02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:44.630
<v Speaker 3>I will give you,</v>

5230
02:36:44.670 --> 02:36:46.480
<v Speaker 3>you will put the words from Spanish,</v>

5231
02:36:47.050 --> 02:36:47.980
<v Speaker 3>you'll speak Spanish.</v>

5232
02:36:48.010 --> 02:36:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Aguilar will give me those words in Maya and I will translate them into now</v>

5233
02:36:52.030 --> 02:36:55.000
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii and the reverse with the Aztec and pastors.</v>

5234
02:36:55.001 --> 02:36:57.880
<v Speaker 3>And within weeks she has replaced Anguillara.</v>

5235
02:36:57.910 --> 02:36:58.900
<v Speaker 3>She's a genius.</v>

5236
02:36:59.110 --> 02:37:00.610
<v Speaker 3>She mastered Spanish.</v>

5237
02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:05.790
<v Speaker 3>She becomes Cortez sole interpreter and she's communicating for him with the</v>

5238
02:37:06.071 --> 02:37:06.521
<v Speaker 3>Aztecs.</v>

5239
02:37:06.521 --> 02:37:10.180
<v Speaker 3>And there's an amazing scene where she encounters Moctezuma directly,</v>

5240
02:37:10.540 --> 02:37:13.660
<v Speaker 3>she and Cortez face to face with Moctezuma.</v>

5241
02:37:13.661 --> 02:37:16.700
<v Speaker 3>And in those days if you looked Moctezuma in the eye,</v>

5242
02:37:16.730 --> 02:37:17.563
<v Speaker 3>you were killed.</v>

5243
02:37:17.570 --> 02:37:18.440
<v Speaker 3>This is what the Aztecs,</v>

5244
02:37:18.441 --> 02:37:19.490
<v Speaker 3>nobody could look them in the eye.</v>

5245
02:37:19.491 --> 02:37:23.060
<v Speaker 3>They had to fall on their faces and the local accounts from the time tell us how</v>

5246
02:37:23.061 --> 02:37:27.680
<v Speaker 3>Marinell standing there on the causeway outside Tenochtitlan looked Moctezuma</v>

5247
02:37:27.681 --> 02:37:28.730
<v Speaker 3>straight in the eye.</v>

5248
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:32.390
<v Speaker 3>She never lowered her eyes for a second as she gave him the words of Cortez.</v>

5249
02:37:32.600 --> 02:37:35.640
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just fascinated by the courage of this woman and,</v>

5250
02:37:35.641 --> 02:37:38.740
<v Speaker 3>and what drove her to use Cortez,</v>

5251
02:37:38.780 --> 02:37:40.910
<v Speaker 3>her instrument to bring Moctezuma down.</v>

5252
02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:42.110
<v Speaker 3>And she's a real historic,</v>

5253
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:43.220
<v Speaker 3>real historical figure.</v>

5254
02:37:43.221 --> 02:37:45.290
<v Speaker 3>There's still a statue of here in Mexico City today.</v>

5255
02:37:45.291 --> 02:37:48.620
<v Speaker 3>She became not only Cortez is a interpreter,</v>

5256
02:37:48.650 --> 02:37:52.010
<v Speaker 3>but also his mistress and um,</v>

5257
02:37:52.190 --> 02:37:53.870
<v Speaker 3>the mother and the mother of his child.</v>

5258
02:37:53.871 --> 02:37:53.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5259
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:55.010
<v Speaker 3>And by all accounts,</v>

5260
02:37:55.011 --> 02:37:56.390
<v Speaker 3>she was a very beautiful woman.</v>

5261
02:37:56.520 --> 02:37:58.040
<v Speaker 3>I'd would be disappointed if you didn't banger.</v>

5262
02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:06.470
<v Speaker 3>You can't find a single cell bad angle as tech painting of Cortez that doesn't</v>

5263
02:38:06.471 --> 02:38:07.580
<v Speaker 3>have [inaudible] in it.</v>

5264
02:38:08.090 --> 02:38:10.070
<v Speaker 3>And she was in the heart of every battle.</v>

5265
02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:10.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5266
02:38:10.460 --> 02:38:12.950
<v Speaker 3>and there's another Spanish writer of the time,</v>

5267
02:38:13.430 --> 02:38:14.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5268
02:38:14.060 --> 02:38:14.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5269
02:38:14.450 --> 02:38:14.691
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

5270
02:38:14.691 --> 02:38:19.580
<v Speaker 3>who spoke about her as a bee Bernardy as a common soldier who wrote a memoir</v>

5271
02:38:19.581 --> 02:38:21.470
<v Speaker 3>called the history of the conquest of new Spain.</v>

5272
02:38:21.890 --> 02:38:22.723
<v Speaker 3>And it's He who,</v>

5273
02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:24.560
<v Speaker 3>who tells us that Martinelle's beauty,</v>

5274
02:38:24.561 --> 02:38:25.191
<v Speaker 3>her grace,</v>

5275
02:38:25.191 --> 02:38:25.821
<v Speaker 3>her courage,</v>

5276
02:38:25.821 --> 02:38:26.041
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

5277
02:38:26.041 --> 02:38:26.370
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

5278
02:38:26.370 --> 02:38:26.590
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

5279
02:38:26.590 --> 02:38:27.230
<v Speaker 3>her charm.</v>

5280
02:38:27.230 --> 02:38:29.600
<v Speaker 3>She's regarded as a traitor in Mexico today.</v>

5281
02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:31.190
<v Speaker 3>Cause she,</v>

5282
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:32.210
<v Speaker 3>Cortez said it,</v>

5283
02:38:32.211 --> 02:38:32.511
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

5284
02:38:32.511 --> 02:38:33.860
<v Speaker 3>aside from God himself,</v>

5285
02:38:33.890 --> 02:38:36.920
<v Speaker 3>it was Marlina who gave me this conquest of Mexico.</v>

5286
02:38:37.430 --> 02:38:37.941
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5287
02:38:37.941 --> 02:38:38.330
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

5288
02:38:38.330 --> 02:38:39.530
<v Speaker 3>and that's it.</v>

5289
02:38:39.531 --> 02:38:41.690
<v Speaker 3>One woman changed the history of the world.</v>

5290
02:38:42.070 --> 02:38:42.410
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5291
02:38:42.410 --> 02:38:43.070
<v Speaker 3>Lamar Lynch.</v>

5292
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:44.180
<v Speaker 3>That's how the Spanish knew her.</v>

5293
02:38:44.181 --> 02:38:45.410
<v Speaker 3>They knew her as Lama lynching.</v>

5294
02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:46.220
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

5295
02:38:46.220 --> 02:38:47.240
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

5296
02:38:47.241 --> 02:38:49.010
<v Speaker 3>So she's the central character in my novel,</v>

5297
02:38:49.011 --> 02:38:52.490
<v Speaker 3>and we'd meet her in the fattening pen at the foot of the great pyramid,</v>

5298
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:55.370
<v Speaker 3>along with another woman who plays a big part in my story,</v>

5299
02:38:55.371 --> 02:38:55.701
<v Speaker 3>a young,</v>

5300
02:38:55.701 --> 02:38:56.780
<v Speaker 3>which called Toci.</v>

5301
02:38:57.080 --> 02:38:58.070
<v Speaker 3>And this is the motive.</v>

5302
02:38:58.071 --> 02:38:58.904
<v Speaker 3>This is why Marla,</v>

5303
02:38:58.990 --> 02:38:59.751
<v Speaker 3>Marla escapes.</v>

5304
02:38:59.751 --> 02:39:04.400
<v Speaker 3>But this is why she wants to bring Moctezuma down because she sees him as the</v>

5305
02:39:04.401 --> 02:39:05.810
<v Speaker 3>head of an empire of terror.</v>

5306
02:39:06.230 --> 02:39:10.490
<v Speaker 3>And she sees Cortez as the only way to bring Moctezuma to his knees.</v>

5307
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.701
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5308
02:39:10.701 --> 02:39:11.501
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinated.</v>

5309
02:39:11.501 --> 02:39:13.820
<v Speaker 3>They would regard her as a traitor.</v>

5310
02:39:13.821 --> 02:39:16.820
<v Speaker 3>When you think about what Montezuma had done to his own people.</v>

5311
02:39:16.821 --> 02:39:17.630
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

5312
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:18.590
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

5313
02:39:18.620 --> 02:39:18.891
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5314
02:39:18.891 --> 02:39:19.251
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

5315
02:39:19.251 --> 02:39:19.941
<v Speaker 3>to give balance,</v>

5316
02:39:19.941 --> 02:39:22.970
<v Speaker 3>we have to say that the Spanish did in horrible,</v>

5317
02:39:23.190 --> 02:39:23.961
<v Speaker 3>horrible things.</v>

5318
02:39:23.961 --> 02:39:25.220
<v Speaker 3>Feeding people to dogs,</v>

5319
02:39:25.221 --> 02:39:27.830
<v Speaker 3>using people as target practice for their weapons.</v>

5320
02:39:27.900 --> 02:39:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if this Spanish Toledo steel,</v>

5321
02:39:30.290 --> 02:39:32.030
<v Speaker 3>we'll cut off this man's arm.</v>

5322
02:39:32.031 --> 02:39:32.301
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5323
02:39:32.301 --> 02:39:32.541
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

5324
02:39:32.541 --> 02:39:33.051
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

5325
02:39:33.051 --> 02:39:33.560
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

5326
02:39:33.560 --> 02:39:33.940
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

5327
02:39:33.940 --> 02:39:34.400
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

5328
02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:35.930
<v Speaker 3>they were true,</v>

5329
02:39:35.931 --> 02:39:36.350
<v Speaker 3>true,</v>

5330
02:39:36.350 --> 02:39:36.891
<v Speaker 3>true horrors.</v>

5331
02:39:36.891 --> 02:39:37.370
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

5332
02:39:37.370 --> 02:39:41.780
<v Speaker 3>and Cortez was a man of war in every possible way and an a machiavellian player.</v>

5333
02:39:41.781 --> 02:39:42.614
<v Speaker 3>Very cunning,</v>

5334
02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:43.693
<v Speaker 3>very clever.</v>

5335
02:39:43.860 --> 02:39:44.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5336
02:39:44.330 --> 02:39:46.700
<v Speaker 3>you can't help admiring him in certain ways,</v>

5337
02:39:46.701 --> 02:39:47.150
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

5338
02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:48.800
<v Speaker 3>but he was unbelievably cruel.</v>

5339
02:39:48.980 --> 02:39:52.760
<v Speaker 3>What brought down Cortez Cortez was brought down by old age.</v>

5340
02:39:52.761 --> 02:39:52.981
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

5341
02:39:52.981 --> 02:39:53.451
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

5342
02:39:53.451 --> 02:39:53.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5343
02:39:53.690 --> 02:39:58.690
<v Speaker 3>wanted to become the king of Mexico after he eventually apocalyptic final</v>

5344
02:39:59.601 --> 02:40:00.320
<v Speaker 3>battle.</v>

5345
02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:02.240
<v Speaker 3>When the Spanish took tell us did land,</v>

5346
02:40:02.241 --> 02:40:06.920
<v Speaker 3>which is the old name for make to Mexico City and Cortez really it's clear that</v>

5347
02:40:06.921 --> 02:40:09.650
<v Speaker 3>his plan was to become the new king of Mexico,</v>

5348
02:40:09.950 --> 02:40:13.860
<v Speaker 3>but the king of Spain had different ideas and they pulled Cortez down.</v>

5349
02:40:13.890 --> 02:40:14.070
<v Speaker 3>They</v>

5350
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:14.850
<v Speaker 4>gave him,</v>

5351
02:40:14.850 --> 02:40:15.870
<v Speaker 4>they gave him a title,</v>

5352
02:40:15.871 --> 02:40:17.310
<v Speaker 4>he became a Marquess.</v>

5353
02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:18.300
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

5354
02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:20.640
<v Speaker 4>he was never allowed to fulfill his dreams.</v>

5355
02:40:20.641 --> 02:40:22.800
<v Speaker 4>And I see Karma at work in that as well.</v>

5356
02:40:23.210 --> 02:40:23.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5357
02:40:23.700 --> 02:40:24.750
<v Speaker 4>if he'd been a better man,</v>

5358
02:40:24.751 --> 02:40:27.300
<v Speaker 4>perhaps he would have been allowed to fulfill some dreams,</v>

5359
02:40:27.430 --> 02:40:28.000
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

5360
02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:29.370
<v Speaker 4>The guy lived to be old.</v>

5361
02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:34.110
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing for those times and those times you live to be 60,</v>

5362
02:40:34.111 --> 02:40:34.830
<v Speaker 4>you were old.</v>

5363
02:40:34.830 --> 02:40:35.663
<v Speaker 4>How old did he live?</v>

5364
02:40:35.670 --> 02:40:36.960
<v Speaker 4>He lived to be about 58.</v>

5365
02:40:37.020 --> 02:40:37.860
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

5366
02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:38.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5367
02:40:38.460 --> 02:40:39.480
<v Speaker 4>No antibiotics,</v>

5368
02:40:39.481 --> 02:40:40.220
<v Speaker 4>no asprin.</v>

5369
02:40:40.220 --> 02:40:40.550
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

5370
02:40:40.550 --> 02:40:42.810
<v Speaker 4>And they had a massive war.</v>

5371
02:40:42.811 --> 02:40:43.201
<v Speaker 4>Wounds.</v>

5372
02:40:43.201 --> 02:40:43.861
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

5373
02:40:43.861 --> 02:40:45.180
<v Speaker 4>he was clubbed on the head.</v>

5374
02:40:45.181 --> 02:40:46.230
<v Speaker 4>His skull was broken.</v>

5375
02:40:46.430 --> 02:40:46.730
<v Speaker 4>They've,</v>

5376
02:40:46.730 --> 02:40:49.890
<v Speaker 4>they've examined the skull of Cortez and there's three separate times that his</v>

5377
02:40:49.891 --> 02:40:50.760
<v Speaker 4>skull was fractured.</v>

5378
02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:53.030
<v Speaker 4>What battles and a,</v>

5379
02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:54.680
<v Speaker 4>in each time he recovered and,</v>

5380
02:40:54.681 --> 02:40:55.500
<v Speaker 4>and bounced back.</v>

5381
02:40:55.500 --> 02:40:56.610
<v Speaker 4>They were men of steel.</v>

5382
02:40:56.611 --> 02:40:57.330
<v Speaker 4>The Spaniards.</v>

5383
02:40:57.330 --> 02:40:57.960
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

5384
02:40:57.960 --> 02:40:59.430
<v Speaker 4>they were the ultimate warriors.</v>

5385
02:40:59.430 --> 02:41:01.500
<v Speaker 4>We have a tiny though they were small,</v>

5386
02:41:01.530 --> 02:41:04.830
<v Speaker 4>but they were mean like how big were they in five feet,</v>

5387
02:41:04.890 --> 02:41:05.723
<v Speaker 4>five feet tall?</v>

5388
02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:06.983
<v Speaker 4>They were small guys.</v>

5389
02:41:07.010 --> 02:41:09.800
<v Speaker 4>Was that because of a lack of food and I guess a Trisha I guess.</v>

5390
02:41:09.870 --> 02:41:10.470
<v Speaker 4>I guess so.</v>

5391
02:41:10.470 --> 02:41:10.771
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

5392

<v Speaker 4>it's a nutritional issue.</v>

5393
02:41:11.821 --> 02:41:12.240
<v Speaker 4>They're all,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That is absolutely fascinating,</v>

5397
02:41:17.161 --> 02:41:17.461
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

5398
02:41:17.461 --> 02:41:20.520
<v Speaker 4>How much does stitch the shape of human beings has changed?</v>

5399
02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:21.391
<v Speaker 4>Take Japan,</v>

5400
02:41:21.391 --> 02:41:24.180

5401
02:41:24.181 --> 02:41:25.170
<v Speaker 4>in the last 50 years,</v>

02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:30.031
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

5406
