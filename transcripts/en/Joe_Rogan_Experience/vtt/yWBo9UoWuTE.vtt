1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.920
Oh r three listen,
you dirty freaks.
This is,

2
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.770
this is the commercial version of the podcast for commercial portion of the

3
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:12.180
podcast and sometimes when we do this thing we say funny shit and sometimes we

4
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:16.260
just get right to the point B.
You know why?
Because we're allowed to,

5
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:19.200
we can do whatever we want.
This is just a podcast.
There's,
there's no,

6
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:22.980
this is good things and bad things about that.
The bad things is,
yeah,

7
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.030
we fuck a lot of shit up,

8
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.110
but the good things is we don't have to listen to anybody else and the only

9
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.020
people that we work with are people that we actually like.

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.330
So if you hear a commercial from this podcast,

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.660
it's 100% because we are representing a cool company that has good ethics and

12
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.970
that sells a product that we think is legit and worth something.

13
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.890
One of them is kerosene games.

14
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.850
Kersey and Games is a company that we just started doing business with and

15
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:48.900
they're a startup.

16
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.850
This is their first game and they're making games directly for the IPAD and for

17
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.130
iPhones and starting,

18
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.080
I believe in February they're going to be available for high end android phones

19
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:04.710
as well.
So really cool game.
The first one is blade slinger and it's,

20
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.860
the graphics are fucking fantastic.
It's,

21
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.140
we're at a really cool time now and technology where the technology of just an

22
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.380
Ipad,

23
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.580
the visual processing power is just stunning and what they can do with these

24
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:21.390
things.
You know you used to take,
when I was gaming,

25
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:22.640
when I was really in a computer games,

26
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.600
what the hell was that when I was really into the game itself when I was a

27
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:29.250
really into computer games,

28
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.790
I had like a 400 megahertz PC with like some big giant stupid video card and

29
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:43.140
that couldn't do anything compared to the graphics power that these little iPads

30
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:44.190
have.
It's incredible.

31
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:49.191
They just can crunch images so well that you can have these beautiful games like

32
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.260
blade slayer and this game is made designed completely for the iPad and I touch

33
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:56.310
any touch.
It's touch screen device.

34
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.220
So they're not porting it over from a PC game.

35
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.550
It's a game they've designed to be intuitive with the controls that you can get

36
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:06.180
from touchscreen and the unprecedented visual quality.
I mean,

37
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:09.480
it's fucking beautiful and it's a really cool fun game.

38
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:11.430
It's filled with a lot of wacky nonsense.

39
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:14.550
You're like a cowboy in the future and you get the fuck shit up.

40
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.610
It's like a bionic cowboy.
What the fuck is a bionic cowboy is?
He really does.

41
00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:21.660
You really have cows.
There's no cows in the student's life,
but whatever,

42
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.360
you're out there with this guy and you're fucking shit up.

43
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:28.500
And it's only $2 and 99 cents.
Um,
up until January 1st,

44
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:32.690
I think it was a dollar cause it yesterday,
whenever it was that it ended,

45
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:34.440
it's over bitch.
So now it's two 99,

46
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:37.720
but it's still a very good deal and a great company and they're,

47
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.090
they're cool to work with.
So we just started doing this with them.
Um,

48
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.130
so what if you're into video games,
uh,
support these people.

49
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:46.440
Go out and pick up the game.
It's 23 bucks.

50
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.210
You're going to miss three bucks and it's pretty dope.

51
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.780
And if you're on an airplane,
it will fucking save your mind.
Look at that thing.

52
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.740
The visual quality is just amazing.
We're also sponsored by Alpha brain,
uh,

53
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.090
on it.com we've talked about,
uh,
the,
uh,

54
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.120
the website on it so much that I,

55
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.730
I get sick when I have to spell it out when I have to double in it.
Uh,

56
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.230
but I have to,
because if you just go to onnit.com which is o nit,

57
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:11.050
it's like something totally different and you'll be fucking baffled.

58
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.630
But if you go to on it,
O n,

59
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.640
n I t you can use a code name Brogan and save 10% off any and all supplements,

60
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:23.920
all the Groovy Shit that we have to benefit your health and your mind.

61
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.430
And,
um,
this,
this,
Whoa,
what are you doing?
You're dropping shit.

62
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:28.840
You don't even know what the fuck is going on over there.

63
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.600
There's a problem in the sound.
Do you hear that?

64
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.970
What does that technology technology just fucked this again?

65
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.610
Anyway,
um,
the,
uh,

66
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.960
the different products and everything we have at [inaudible] dot com is all shit

67
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.790
that we use or that we know is the best stuff available.
Like for instance,

68
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:52.780
we just started carrying Dave Asprey's coffee.
Um,
Dave Asprey.

69
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:54.970
I mean he like coffee.
Really coffee's good for you,

70
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.040
not nearly as bad for you as you think.

71
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.760
Here's the thing that according to Dave Asprey is bad for you.
Toxic mold.
And uh,

72
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.720
we had Bert Christ in the show yesterday.
He was on the travel channel with that,

73
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:07.450
uh,
that showed,
I think it's called dangerous grounds.

74
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:10.960
It's about the difficulty in acquiring like exotic coffees and all these

75
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:13.480
different places.
It's kind of traveling and a,

76
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:18.220
they were saying that it's just commonly known that mold is on like 90% of the

77
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:21.670
coffee that you buy.
And unfortunately a lot of that stuff is very bad for you.

78
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.190
We have Dave Asprey's would,

79
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:28.270
he calls upgraded coffee and this is a bulletproof executive guy.

80
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:32.670
That's a Dave Asprey's whole ideology is to be bulletproof,

81
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.130
have everything just rock solid,
have your health rock solid,

82
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:39.400
your mind rock solid.
I mean he's a bio hacker.
What does that mean?

83
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:43.780
You got to go to the bulletproof exec to understand it's all really intense shit

84
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:48.480
and I'm quite honestly a little bit too stupid to understand it,
but uh,

85
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.540
he's a brilliant guy and I had personally have benefited from a lot of the

86
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:54.150
things that I learned from the guy.
And uh,

87
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.680
so we just started carrying his coffee and that's the kind of shit we do.

88
00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:00.830
Like if we,
you know,
kettle bells for instance,
I'm always preaching the,
the,

89
00:05:00.831 --> 00:05:04.270
the use of kettle bells and functional strength and how it's so much better than

90
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:07.360
just going to a gym.
And it's like doing bench press and stuff like that.

91
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:12.190
Like you'd be amazed at how much a athletic benefit you can get from doing

92
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:15.130
functional strength exercises.
So we started carrying that.

93
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:18.160
We started carrying kettle bells and battle ropes and I'll any kind of different

94
00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:21.910
shit that we think is going to benefit you physically and mentally.

95
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.120
I mean when we used to do music behind these,
that noise again though,

96
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.930
that crackly static things in the,
what's it say my headphones?

97
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.480
<v 1>Can I interject a story on the way over casting every talking about mold and uh,</v>

98
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.360
he,
we're talking about,
my wife grew up in Mozambique,
right?

99
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.430
And there are a lot of peanut based foods there and there's a mold that grows on

100
00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:45.290
peanuts that really fucks up your liver.

101
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.570
So they're really high rates of liver cancer.

102
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.610
And she was saying she thinks that something that's underappreciated in the West

103
00:05:52.611 --> 00:05:55.400
because there's so much peanut butter eating here and that's all industrial.

104
00:05:55.401 --> 00:05:57.740
And there's of course there's mold growing on that,
you know,

105
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.890
but it goes into the peanut butter who notices?
Yeah.

106
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.280
I don't know what that survive the peanut butter making process.

107
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.200
<v 0>Some of it would.
Yeah,
some like they say prions,</v>

108
00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.810
those things that create mad cow disease,
these can,

109
00:06:10.811 --> 00:06:14.620
they can survive like a thousand degrees for like six hours or something crazy.

110
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.710
I mean you're talking about these weird super organisms that can stay alive and

111
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.560
to really disgusting situations.

112
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.520
<v 1>You know,
mold.
That's crazy for human beings to be one of those organisms.
I mean,</v>

113
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:27.830
do you ever been to like the bad part of Hong Kong?

114
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.031
<v 0>Well,</v>

115
00:06:28.031 --> 00:06:31.430
I have a whole piece that I did in the opening of one of my comedy specials that

116
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:34.280
if you looked at the earth from outer space,
if you were an alien,

117
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:37.210
completely objective to our culture or our physical body,
right.

118
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.990
And you just looked at us,
you would say there,
this is a,
this is a mold.

119
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.070
This is like,
this is a growth round.
Yeah,

120
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:49.240
there's a big brown spreading things,
smokes coming out of them,

121
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.640
Burns everything up and shits it out.
And if you,
you know,

122
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.580
if the earth comes in and takes it back,
it's just rebuilt.
Just build back up.

123
00:06:56.581 --> 00:06:59.990
But it's like a tumor that you can't get rid of.
Like it's a crazy idea when you,

124
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:03.680
but when you look at how much damage and devastation we really do to the world,

125
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:06.210
and it's not a bad analogy,
it's really,
if you,

126
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.590
if you are objective and you looked at it from outer space,

127
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:11.210
that you might look at it that way.
You make,

128
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:13.520
oh well this thing is infected with people.

129
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.530
You got to fucking people problem on this.

130
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.740
<v 1>Pissing all is good too.
You got a people problem on this planet planet,</v>

131
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:25.880
but it's fucking people there.
Ooh Man.
Do you know the earth almost wiped us out?

132
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.040
Yeah.
You mainly want to get on with your university

133
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.860
<v 0>commercial.
Listen,
go to on it.
Get swole and press the fuck out of everybody.</v>

134
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.090
Feel better about yourself.
Get your shit together and uh,
and use the code name,

135
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:39.110
Rogan and saved 10%

136
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.120
<v 1>seen.
Also make it sponsor correction.
If we did set something wrong.
Yes,
yes,</v>

137
00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:47.260
definitely.
Okay.
I think yesterday you said that if you sign up for 10,

138
00:07:47.261 --> 00:07:52.180
you get $50 credit,
but I think it's 25 now.
What will they changed it?

139
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.780
I,
if it was tin or it was one of the [inaudible] yesterday.

140
00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.280
Well I just have to be,
it would have to be tank.
Hold on a second.
That's gross.

141
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.660
You can't do that.
Let me sent me a Twitter thing about Tang.

142
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.230
I did and I checked it out.
That's right.
Because you're a,
your cell phone.

143
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.680
You were talking to them about how bad your,
um,
your service was.
Yeah.

144
00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:15.340
It looks good.
Tang.
It looks really good.
I liked what I saw.
Unfortunately,

145
00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:16.540
I'm on an iPhone,
so

146
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.330
<v 0>yeah,
they can't do that yet.
But I'm telling you,
man,
um,
if you,</v>

147
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.080
if you fuck with these,
um,
these new Samsung Galaxy s three is,

148
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:28.620
it's the first film that I've ever used that not just rivals in iPhone,
but it,

149
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.180
yeah,
it's only $25 credit now.
Whoa.
It used to be 50 bucks.

150
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.330
Why didn't they let me know that?
Listen Tang you cheap cons,

151
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.370
that's only $25.
You just,
he just made us all look stupid for 25 bucks.

152
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.870
Do you really need that 25 bucks?

153
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.870
<v 1>Well,
Joel,
it's $25 times.
How many people sign up and action?</v>

154
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.531
<v 0>My opinion,</v>

155
00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:53.870
it's very difficult when you give people money off and then you reduce that
shit,

156
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.820
especially if you don't tell,
you know,
like ladies and gentlemen,

157
00:08:56.821 --> 00:09:00.210
I'm not telling you how to run your company.
Okay?
I use your phone.

158
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:05.010
You've got an excellent service.
I support it 100%.
But um,

159
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.960
you should have told me that it's 25 bucks.
Now you know what?
My dumb ass,

160
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.080
my dumb ass publisher two days ago sent out a new version to the kindle.

161
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.720
It erased everyone's notes that they'd taken on the first floor.
Oh No.

162
00:09:19.721 --> 00:09:22.400
I get this review on amazon.com from this day and was like,

163
00:09:22.401 --> 00:09:25.430
do not buy this fucking book.
They erased all my notes.

164
00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:29.900
I had read 200 pages and no,
uh oh no.

165
00:09:29.901 --> 00:09:34.600
Nice move.
Harpercollins well,
unbeknownst to them,
yeah,
we have a podcast to run,

166
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.990
but we need to play music before it's official.
That's fucked up though.

167
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.260
The Joe Rogan experience.

168
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.873
<v 2>Yes.</v>

169
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.690
<v 0>Uh,
Chris Ryan,
how are you sir?</v>

170
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.310
Thanks for doing this man.
I really appreciate it.

171
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.320
I'm sorry if we allegedly got you too high before the show to talk.
Well,

172
00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:06.780
that long commercial gave me a chance to calm down.

173
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.720
That's what those are good for.
You stumbled through those commercials.

174
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:14.690
It's sorta like,
it's Sorta like when you,
uh,
have a car and it's a manual and it,

175
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.850
it can't start button.
You could push that pitch and then pop the tab.

176
00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.720
I'll start and then once it's gone,
you're okay.
Right.
That's what it's like.

177
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.620
So the commercial access,
so sort of like a scaffolding for us to get our,

178
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.310
or our sea legs under us for,
we,
uh,

179
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.990
venture out into the podcast world.
Right.
So,
uh,
thanks for doing this man.

180
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:37.030
Your book,
if people don't know it's called sex at dawn.
And uh,

181
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:41.220
it was suggested to me by our very good friend Duncan Trussell and a,

182
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:44.730
I read it and I fucking loved it,
man.
It's a really,
really interesting stuff,

183
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.870
you know?
Uh,
I,
I use the,
uh,
the one,
uh,

184
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.360
one of the things that I read that was,
that never heard before.

185
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:55.740
It was the origins of the word [inaudible].
Yeah.
That's really fascinating stuff,

186
00:10:55.741 --> 00:10:59.100
man.
Yeah,
it was a misunderstanding.
And that what the,

187
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.550
is it out Mayan person mean?
Who would you say,
where am I in mind?
Yeah.

188
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.770
That what they were saying was essentially,
I don't understand.
You ask him,

189
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.630
what does this place called?
Right?
They were saying,

190
00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:12.330
I don't understand you and that I don't understand.

191
00:11:12.331 --> 00:11:15.000
You became right in a garbled sort of a way,

192
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.960
what they described the areas exactly describing it as I don't understand.
Yeah.

193
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.330
Yeah.
It's amazing because it sounds so authentic.
If you say,
well,

194
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:28.410
we went camping in the Yucatan,
it's like,
you know,
you sound like,
you know,

195
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:31.410
you're like fucking eating organic salads and doing the right thing.

196
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.730
You're out in nature.
But meanwhile what you're,
you're,
you're at.
I don't know,

197
00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:40.620
understand you.
That's where you are.
That's,
that's,
that is,
uh,
in my opinion,

198
00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:42.900
like if you look at the whole human race,

199
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.920
that's a good example of like how,
how screw Bali,

200
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.210
this whole system that we operate under is for it.
You know?
It's like,
Whoa,

201
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.160
like that's still the name.
Like it's still America.
How about that?

202
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.760
How about there's still Indians?
You know what,
how about,

203
00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:01.570
that's even more ridiculous when we name ourselves after some dude that nobody

204
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:04.360
knows.
You ask any kid who Mary and Mary Gove was Poochie.

205
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:06.550
Is that what his name was?
The Guy Who American?
Yeah.

206
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.980
<v 1>Maybe like the only Italian who ever did anything in those days,
you know,</v>

207
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.490
other than write poems and check.
But I mean,
as far as exploring,

208
00:12:13.491 --> 00:12:17.870
you don't hear a lot about the Italian explorer and we still celebrate Columbus

209
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.620
Day,
although it's incredibly clear now.
The Columbus was a huge asshole.

210
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.790
Do you know about Columbus?
I talking about like original encounters,
right?

211
00:12:25.791 --> 00:12:30.020
When Columbus,
uh,
first arrived in Hispaniola on the first trip,
he was,

212
00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.070
he wrote a letter back to the queen explaining what this place was like that he,

213
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.840
he and his men had found.
Right.

214
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.430
And it's amazing to read because the first nine sentences are all about how

215
00:12:40.431 --> 00:12:44.900
great the people are,
how they,
they,
um,
you know,
if there's food,

216
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:49.010
they share it without thinking.
If,
if you admire a piece of clothing,

217
00:12:49.011 --> 00:12:51.290
they give it to you without thinking.
They're incredibly generous.

218
00:12:51.291 --> 00:12:54.650
They're incredibly healthy,
beautiful,
nicely foreign bodies.

219
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.280
They've got fruit in the trees and all the fish they could possibly want.

220
00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:03.470
He said with 500 men,
I could subjugate the entire island.

221
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.680
Wow.
Or however many,
200 or whatever it was.

222
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.720
But it's just this whole litany of how wonderful these people are.
In fact,

223
00:13:11.721 --> 00:13:15.800
it's even thought by some historians that the reason that people are called

224
00:13:15.801 --> 00:13:19.700
Indians is not this whole thing about Columbus thinking he was going to India.

225
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.600
Right.
It's actually that in this document that I'm describing to you,

226
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:28.540
Columbus wrote [inaudible] even Indios,

227
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.860
which means these are certain,
certainly people who live in God.
Whoa.

228
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:38.200
Indios and in Spanish they're still calling Dios,
right?

229
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.610
Yeah.
Wow.
Crazy.
Huh?
Wow.
I mean,

230
00:13:43.611 --> 00:13:48.560
we came so close.
He could have just said,
fuck Europe.
Let's stay here.

231
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.290
Right.
Which other people did other explorers did do.

232
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.440
It's very difficult when someone's a client to turn them around and it's very

233
00:13:57.351 --> 00:14:00.500
difficult when that's the culturally accepted way to live.
What does that noise,

234
00:14:00.501 --> 00:14:04.940
man,
do you have your plan Schamens Shit in the background,
dude.

235
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.090
I thought it was crazy.
Crickets.

236
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.550
<v 0>Did you even know you were doing that?
That wasn't the purpose was it?</v>

237
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.530
It turned on by itself,
I think.
Uh,
like it's on a,
it was playing the,
nevermind.

238
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.680
It's stupid stuff.
You got bugs getting computers.
Literally.
Yeah.

239
00:14:18.681 --> 00:14:21.600
That sounded like there was some dude in the background with like a rattle.
Yeah.

240
00:14:21.601 --> 00:14:24.740
It would be dancing in some way.
Maybe trying to bring back the old days.

241
00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.360
It was the Joe Rogan theme on repeat in the background turned down Super Low.

242
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.230
The Owl,

243
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:34.690
I mean it would be so difficult when you grow up in uh,

244
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.120
the environment of the 14 hundreds and Europe,

245
00:14:38.121 --> 00:14:43.121
which was just chaos and disease and war and famine and you know,

246
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.170
all these goddamn problems.
And then to like a band in that once you got here,

247
00:14:48.171 --> 00:14:52.100
I think they probably couldn't do it.
I think there were just so fucked.
And then

248
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:57.100
<v 1>all of the also like Desperado from a couple of months in a boat on the ocean,</v>

249
00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.650
you know,
that's got to drive you fucking squirrely your,
your,

250
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:04.610
your feelings about human life have to erode.
I mean they have to,

251
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.120
your appreciation for human life has to erode.

252
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.300
And it's like really worst case scenario,
you take the craziest Fox,

253
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.580
you can find people that are willing to get on a fro,

254
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.990
a floating piece of wood and you're gonna push it out into this never ending

255
00:15:17.991 --> 00:15:21.920
ocean.
And it might take a few months and some of you are going to die.
Who's in?

256
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.760
Who's that in it's self selection mechanism at work there.

257
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.670
You ever seen the Hertzog film a good are any of the wrath of God?
No,
but oh,

258
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.220
you got to see that.
What is that about?

259
00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:35.930
It's about the conquistadores in Brazil and it's the main lead.

260
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.960
The lead role is played by Klaus Kinski who is this super intense too?

261
00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.320
I'm actually,
Mick Jagger was suppose supposed to play the role,
but he,

262
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.890
he got sick or he had a concert or there was some delay.
He couldn't do it.

263
00:15:48.891 --> 00:15:53.500
So they running Kinski how many movies is ain't Jagger done?
I know.

264
00:15:53.501 --> 00:15:58.370
It's a weird choice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
Mick Jagger was the first choice.

265
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:03.440
Oh really?
Yeah.
Wow.
I love that shit.
I love,
I mean that,

266
00:16:03.441 --> 00:16:06.560
that's a great movie.
But what was the other one?
Uh,

267
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.990
do you know who was supposed to play Hannibal Lecter?
Who?

268
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.740
It was first offered the role and turned it down.
Keith Richards.
Jack Nicholson.

269
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.180
Whoa.
Imagine that role with Jack Nicholson or it would have been different.

270
00:16:17.181 --> 00:16:19.430
It would've been great,
but very different.
Yeah.

271
00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:22.940
It probably would have been equally great just to sit in a different way,

272
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.840
you know?
And you know,
people would go crazy.
No.
It must be Anthony Hopkins,

273
00:16:26.841 --> 00:16:31.490
like relax.
No,
it must not be.
You know,
when Nicholson first came to Hollywood,

274
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:35.550
he was a screenwriter.
He wasn't an actor.
Really.
Yeah.
And he was,
uh,

275
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.870
he was living with this dude who was an act or trying to be an actor.

276
00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:42.260
They're sharing a room somewhere,
a place somewhere.
And I,

277
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:47.440
the story as it was told to me was that Nicholson was so unsuccessful selling

278
00:16:48.171 --> 00:16:51.800
stuff that he was ready to go back to Kansas or wherever the fuck he was from

279
00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:53.990
our new,
yeah.
Kansas,
I think.

280
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.320
And his friends had just come to this audition with me,
man.

281
00:16:57.321 --> 00:17:00.320
Maybe you'll get an extra roll or something.
Just some money.
So he,

282
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:04.490
he read for the role and the producers said,
Mr. Nicholson,

283
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:08.210
we don't need you for this,
but if we ever need,
you will need you very much.

284
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.970
Hmm.
You think about that in terms of Nicholson?
He's always Nichols.
You know,

285
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.170
he's always jack.
He can't be anything other than Jack.
Yeah.
Yeah.

286
00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:21.610
There's an issue with guys that get to a certain role,
like,
uh,

287
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.650
like sort of like a characteristic role.

288
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.860
Like Al Pachino like your voice has to yell now he's in like,

289
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:31.990
he's always got to have begged,
beg,

290
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:37.490
preferably blind screaming.
You know,
like when he played the devil,

291
00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:40.400
that dude jump the shark and everybody played the devil.

292
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.790
Was it a Keanu Reeves movie?
Didn't even remember the advocate.

293
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.090
Is that what it was?
Yeah,
he played the devil.
I'm like,
listen,

294
00:17:47.091 --> 00:17:52.000
the devil would not be so fucking verbose.
Devil wouldn't be screaming.
Why?

295
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.900
Devil wouldn't even be emotional with sand.

296
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.550
<v 0>You don't understand what real torture would be like.</v>

297
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.220
Would it be some little fucking old dude screaming,

298
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.660
<v 1>stop it.
Terracing yourself.</v>

299
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.270
Reptilian evil's got to be reptilian.
Sure.

300
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:11.310
<v 0>Obviously planned out rant.
You stop it.
Devil scare me.</v>

301
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.160
You got the devil.
That's the devil lying to you.

302
00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:17.940
Trying to trick you into thinking that he's not that.
Not that scary.

303
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.270
There wasn't that.
That was Terence Mckenna.
His idea of what,
um,

304
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.440
what aliens really where is that aliens would,
uh,

305
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.100
hide themselves in the,

306
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:33.270
the idea of an extraterrestrial being,
uh,

307
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.480
that looked like us and walked like this and flew in space ship.

308
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:41.460
They would hide themselves in that form as to not disturb us with their true

309
00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:45.810
identity,
which would it be?
So alien should be incomprehensible.

310
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.220
So that,
you know,

311
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.090
he thought that that's what they were doing when they were appearing in such

312
00:18:51.091 --> 00:18:53.190
weird sort of a classic forum.

313
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.980
<v 1>You're talking about the little Elvin things,</v>

314
00:18:54.981 --> 00:18:59.810
a little grays with the big black flash around.
Yeah.
Okay.
Is it,

315
00:18:59.811 --> 00:19:02.690
this is something that they would,
they would hide in.

316
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:07.310
Terence mechanic got me in a lot of trouble.
How's that?

317
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:12.110
I was,
uh,
well this is the last time I took acid.

318
00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:18.200
Um,
I got some acid from a guy who sort of knew the grateful dead and so the acid

319
00:19:18.201 --> 00:19:22.670
was coming from this pure source,
pretty sweet source from the stream.

320
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.160
So I s I said,
yeah,
I'll take some fine.
Um,

321
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.640
and this guy gave me all this liquid,
right?

322
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:33.280
And I gave something to some friends and whatever cause I,

323
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.310
what am I going to do with a hundred hits of acid?
You know,

324
00:19:35.311 --> 00:19:38.720
I was like shirty five or something.
And uh,

325
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.560
so one friend of mine is a psychiatrist and he's like 50 or something.

326
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.510
This is in Spain.
And he had,

327
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.660
he had done acid back when psychiatrists would order it and you know,

328
00:19:47.661 --> 00:19:49.700
from Santos and they just send it mail order.

329
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:55.190
And so he tried three hits and came back the next day and said,
yeah,

330
00:19:55.191 --> 00:19:57.290
that's good.
It's clean,
it's mellow,
it's cool.

331
00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:02.120
So I was reading Terence Mckenna and all this shit about heroic doses.
Right.

332
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.210
And I had like done a bunch of acid when I was younger,

333
00:20:05.211 --> 00:20:09.260
but I never like it had been awhile since I'd approached anything.

334
00:20:09.261 --> 00:20:10.790
You could call it heroic dose.

335
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:14.540
And so I thought this is the last time I'm probably going to trip,
right?
I,

336
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.600
I'm sort of at the end of this part of my life,
I think.

337
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:22.750
So I'm going to go out with a bang and I took four hits of this stuff and it

338
00:20:22.851 --> 00:20:27.320
turned into a very intense afternoon that ended up with me.
Uh,

339
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.770
a few steps from a psychiatric hospital.

340
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.410
Yeah.
I think it was Howard Howard

341
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:41.410
<v 0>stern who had a story about taking acid in like losing his mind for like a</v>

342
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.390
couple of weeks.
They took too much.
You can,

343
00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.070
you can get to a point on a psychedelic trip where

344
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.780
<v 1>you question reality to the t,
like to the brink of sanity.
You know,</v>

345
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:53.920
you get like,
you don't,

346
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.830
you don't know if you're ever going to get back from this one.
Yeah.

347
00:20:56.831 --> 00:21:01.270
I mean honestly that's not a feeling that I've had much tripping and that's why

348
00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:05.100
I love tripping because I always felt I really had my feet under me and you
know,

349
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:09.850
if I was with people and Shit went down,
which at sometimes did,
um,

350
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.510
I was like the go to guy,
you can keep it together,
right?

351
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.970
Like I could always like,
okay,
get down to,
it's just funnier.

352
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:21.490
We'd like to be cocky and think that we can handle it because we've handled it

353
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:24.880
before.
Right.
But then all you have to do is just to keep going with the level,

354
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:28.360
right.
I'll take five minutes.
Right,
right,
right.
Okay.

355
00:21:28.361 --> 00:21:31.240
Can you handle Phi and then you're a baby once again.
Well,

356
00:21:31.241 --> 00:21:36.040
the thing is recognizing where your limits are and approaching them,

357
00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:39.850
testing them,
but not ever crossing number.
Disrespecting them.

358
00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.740
And that's the way you ride a motorcycle.
It's,

359
00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:47.080
I like to do dangerous things in a smart way so I don't die.

360
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.000
But I like doing interesting,
exciting,
crazy things.
You know,

361
00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:57.150
the problem with acid or any of the drugs that are not legal is that we don't

362
00:21:58.571 --> 00:22:03.100
necessarily know what we're getting.
You know,
if you go to a vodka store,

363
00:22:03.101 --> 00:22:04.090
so liquor store rather than,

364
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:08.530
you buy vodka pretty pretty well be assured that you're buying vodka,
right?

365
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.880
I mean,
it's a pretty standard.

366
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.340
Everyone knows that the dosage have a couple of shots,

367
00:22:12.341 --> 00:22:13.240
you're gonna get fucked up.

368
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.910
That's cultural sort of information that's passed on and it's super readily

369
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:22.240
available.
Whereas with drugs,
there's a lot of,
are you sure?

370
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:27.280
Are you sure he's done this?
Where'd this come from?
Who got this?
If you're smart,

371
00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:29.830
you're doing that.
If you're not,
you take some pills somebody gives you.

372
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.830
And I used to do a lot of research.
I didn't do research.

373
00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:36.460
I wrote about research that was happening in the world of psychedelics.
Right?

374
00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:40.880
And people saw,
I gave talks at medical schools and you know,

375
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.020
I'd go around and sort of be the authority figure on this.

376
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.980
And so people always came up to me afterwards like,
Hey,
you know,

377
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.170
what's the deal with ecstasy?
Really?
Is it dangerous?
Is it not dangerous?

378
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.200
And it's always complicated because it's exactly what you're saying.

379
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.990
If your MDM is one thing,

380
00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:01.240
but what you're buying in a club is if you're lucky,
partly Mtma,

381
00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.280
it might not have any MDM at all,

382
00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:06.670
or at least it's a minor ingredient and there's a bunch of other shit in there

383
00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.970
that's unregulated and controller,
nobody knows what it is.

384
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:15.100
In Spain you can send to ecstasy to allow or their guys in the clubs with labs

385
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.150
that will test it for you.
Yeah,
I just got it.

386
00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.270
I got some tested the other day that smoked.

387
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:20.920
I guess that was the big thing of it's smoke.

388
00:23:20.921 --> 00:23:25.921
That means it's like almost a hundred percent pure and it was night and day

389
00:23:26.051 --> 00:23:27.790
difference from what I was used to taking.

390
00:23:27.791 --> 00:23:31.290
It was just like fall to the ground and melt.
It was amazing.
Right,
right.

391
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.900
It's a very different thing and like you say,
it's dangerous,
you know,

392
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.780
because the shit that they mix in them,
but acid,

393
00:23:37.781 --> 00:23:42.781
LSD isn't really like that too much because it's very cheap and easy to make LSD

394
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:46.060
relatively for a chemist.
So whole new fad lst

395
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.270
<v 0>occasionally like what's mad?</v>

396
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.860
The whole thing in the 60 like don't eat the brown acid was government

397
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:56.360
propaganda and mass hysteria because Lsd as I,

398
00:23:56.361 --> 00:23:57.110
I'm no chemist,

399
00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:02.110
but I've been told LSD is like if you set up a lab to make LSD to just make LSD

400
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:02.930
but you're not,

401
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.660
there's nothing that's going to be cheaper or easier to make instead.

402
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.360
Whereas Mtma is much more complicated.

403
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:11.100
And then there's money in mixing shit in MDME.

404
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:16.430
Lsd seems to me to be a legitimate threat to your sanity.

405
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:17.630
There's,
there's a,

406
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:22.690
there's quite a few people that have gone bonkers after big LSD hits.

407
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.450
It seems to me that if you don't have a good solid grip on it,
there's a,

408
00:24:26.451 --> 00:24:29.770
it's possible for it to get away from you and you never get it back.
Yeah.

409
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.340
They suspected that happened to the unibomber.
Ted Kaczynski was a part of the,

410
00:24:34.341 --> 00:24:38.690
uh,
the Harvard,
a psychedelic studies like the,
in the no real SD studies.

411
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.290
And,
uh,
when he got out of school,
he,
uh,

412
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.370
he went and taught for a few years to save up all his money so he could get this

413
00:24:46.371 --> 00:24:50.520
cabin and then start his attack on,
on technology.
But,
you know,

414
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:55.310
the thought was that they cooked his brain.
There was a documentary detailing,

415
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:57.050
I think it's called the net thing.

416
00:24:57.051 --> 00:25:01.400
That's a foreign documentary and it's in subtitles.
But look that up again.
But,

417
00:25:01.401 --> 00:25:05.570
but do you really think Kaczynski was insane?
Oh,
well,
obviously it was insane.

418
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.400
He thinks killing all these fucking people.
Yeah.

419
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:12.110
But wasn't he operating essentially out of the same thing that you and I were

420
00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:15.170
talking about earlier where we said you got a people problem on that planet.

421
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.270
Yeah.
He was sort of like sort of murdering innovators.
Yeah.

422
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:24.040
That's not the way that,
that's insanity.
It's 100% Saturday.
You know,

423
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.620
even if you thought that the world was doing something bad,

424
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.280
that there was something wrong with,
how wouldn't you work to try to change it?

425
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.370
Why would you work to try to kill the people that are creating technology?

426
00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:38.450
I can't,
I mean that's the thing.
If you think technology's the enemy,
I'm not,
I'm,

427
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.230
I'm not an advocate for the uniform.

428
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:42.950
I think that that's a limited way of looking at things.

429
00:25:42.951 --> 00:25:46.350
Cause I think the technology,
uh,
the,

430
00:25:46.351 --> 00:25:50.930
the way human beings operate as the technology will always constantly move,

431
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.270
be moving forward.
We're always going to try to innovate.

432
00:25:53.271 --> 00:25:55.220
Where are we going to try to create better and new things.

433
00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:59.540
But I think that same sort of mentality can be applied to cleaning things up or

434
00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:01.310
using things in a sustainable way.

435
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.520
And I don't think that it's outside the realm of possibility for us to figure

436
00:26:06.771 --> 00:26:09.800
out a way to process pollution and make it turn into some sort of a clean fuel.

437
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:14.090
I think the idea of making hydrogen and are using hydrogen and hydrogen turns

438
00:26:14.091 --> 00:26:16.980
into water,
you know,
which is,
you know,
there's,

439
00:26:16.981 --> 00:26:21.720
there's ways we can have fuel and energy that in the future that we can't figure

440
00:26:21.721 --> 00:26:23.060
it out right now,
but there's,

441
00:26:23.061 --> 00:26:27.110
there's potential in the future for cleaning up the environment,

442
00:26:27.111 --> 00:26:31.880
cleaning up the air,
and actually using that as fuel.
You know,
it is possible.

443
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:35.600
I read somewhere I just,
in the last few days like Norway or Denmark,

444
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:40.010
one of those countries is importing garbage from other countries to use as a

445
00:26:40.011 --> 00:26:42.470
fuel source because they don't have enough of their own garbage.

446
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.100
That's hilarious.
Yeah.
Yeah.

447
00:26:44.101 --> 00:26:47.830
There is so fucking smart in those little small European countries like Iceland,

448
00:26:47.831 --> 00:26:49.380
Lee,
through all the bankers in jail,

449
00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:53.010
they only have to be fucking assholes and elected a lesbian to president.

450
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.030
Powerful lesbian trailer,
by the way.
Oh,
is this it?

451
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.660
No,
this is not,
that is not this.
Brian,
stop it.
Sandra Bullock.
No,
no,
no,

452
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.220
no,
no.
It was a documentary.
You fuck

453
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.650
you guys being silly over there and then on purpose.
Did you do that on purpose?

454
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:19.280
It's not the end.
All right,
so talking about the evils of technology,
right?
Yeah.

455
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.030
<v 1>That day I took all that acid,</v>

456
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:25.110
I went into this park with his friend and we were lying under a tree and my

457
00:27:25.111 --> 00:27:27.600
friend was like,
not,
I got to walk,
I gotta to move.
And he's like,
okay,

458
00:27:27.601 --> 00:27:29.580
you move man.
I'm just going to stay under this tree.

459
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.750
I'm under this tree and it's this big beautiful tree.
Don't over.
And it's uh,

460
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.410
you know,
you can see the blue sky behind the leaves twittering and stuff.

461
00:27:37.411 --> 00:27:38.250
It's just so nice.

462
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:43.670
And I started getting into the vibe of this tree and I could actually like feel

463
00:27:43.711 --> 00:27:48.240
the vibrations of the tree,
the,
the energy vibrations of this tree.
And,

464
00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:52.480
and I would align my own energetic vibrations with the,

465
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:57.050
those of the tree.
And it was like a fucking brain orgasm.
It would just be like,

466
00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:01.500
and like,
whoa.
And I couldn't take more than a few seconds of it.

467
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.880
So then I'd like get out of phase,
right.
And then just sorta like,
oh,

468
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.980
this is all like with my conscious energies.
It's sort of dancing around,

469
00:28:07.981 --> 00:28:11.610
getting into and out of phase with this tree's energy and every time it was like

470
00:28:11.611 --> 00:28:15.930
a full brain orgasm.
It was amazing.
Wow.

471
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.430
So anyway,
I'd have to like an hour or two of this.
I was exhausted.

472
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.380
I walked out and I sent it to try to walk.

473
00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:25.960
I got out and walked out from under the tree and I still heard this buzzing the

474
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.570
vibrations of the tree.
We're sort of moving with me.
I turned,

475
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.600
I look back and right above the tree where these high tension power lines and

476
00:28:34.771 --> 00:28:39.620
the buzz was coming from the electrical cables on the power of God.

477
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:43.440
I thought I was making love with nature.
I was being fucked by technology.

478
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.220
<v 0>I felt so violated.</v>

479
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:51.030
What do you think was going on then when you were trying to tune into the energy

480
00:28:51.031 --> 00:28:54.770
of the train?
It had all this electricity,
like what was going on?

481
00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.240
Some sort of,
you know,
energy overload,
you know,
frying the circuits.
In my brain.

482
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:04.170
They say when you're around certain certain of those towers,

483
00:29:04.171 --> 00:29:07.770
you could feel it like you feel like it just feels fucked up.

484
00:29:07.771 --> 00:29:09.780
It feels like there's,
we used to,
when I was a kid,

485
00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:14.310
we used to take 'em fluorescent light bulbs out and if you walked under them

486
00:29:14.311 --> 00:29:17.190
with the light bulbs at night,
they'd light up,
get the fuck out of here.

487
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:22.260
They light up
with that made the people that lived under,
I'm like,

488
00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:23.310
have superpowers.

489
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.610
Could you imagine everybody wouldn't want to live underneath that and take the

490
00:29:26.611 --> 00:29:30.660
chances if like one dude became the flash,
like from like DC comic book,

491
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.960
She's like,
you grow up,
you're a baby under electricity.
Constantly.
Just,

492
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:39.720
you just see things that other people can't see,
but no,
actually it fucks her.

493
00:29:39.721 --> 00:29:43.820
Right.
Yeah.
It's not good to live into those things and I don't think so.
Yeah.

494
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:47.950
I think it's a,
if they ever shown that health wise to be,
if they did,

495
00:29:47.951 --> 00:29:49.780
I doubt there'd be houses underneath them still,

496
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.440
but I don't think there are houses underneath them.
I'm good at Burbank.

497
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.350
It's fucking crazy.
Oh yeah.
Out in the country.

498
00:29:56.351 --> 00:29:59.380
They cut a line through the woods for them.
They don't build houses in Durham.

499
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:03.220
Yeah.
Those things are creepy as fuck.
It seems like a stupid way to do it.

500
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.930
You know,
in Europe.
Cables or awards.
I mean those are above ground,

501
00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:11.830
but most cables in Europe or underground.
Yeah.
Why aren't these underground?

502
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:13.380
Why didn't they have them on the ground?
Well,

503
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.910
actually they would worry about some of digging in there and hit me.
Um,

504
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:20.140
have you ever seen what happens when they fuck up and hit like a gas line and

505
00:30:20.141 --> 00:30:25.110
blow up a whole block?
You know,
I,
have you ever seen those?
They,

506
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.080
one of them have on recently,
I believe it was Indiana.
It was unbelievable.

507
00:30:29.081 --> 00:30:30.490
The destruction.
They,

508
00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:34.930
someone tapped into a gas line in the house was just devastated.

509
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.860
It,
whatever happened,
it was probably the pilot light in the,
uh,

510
00:30:38.861 --> 00:30:42.970
the stove or something,
you know,
some sort of a gas leak.
There was no house.

511
00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.450
It was nothing.
And in the houses next to it,
we're all fucked up too.

512
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:51.330
But it was just complete splinters.
And these are like in our neighborhood.

513
00:30:51.331 --> 00:30:53.200
It's like there's bombs everywhere.

514
00:30:53.201 --> 00:30:56.800
Just waiting to go off like high pressure gas being pumped into almost

515
00:30:56.801 --> 00:31:00.030
everyone's house.
He sounded like woody Allen and everybody's cool with it.

516
00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.950
Woody Allen.
Woody Allen talking like that.

517
00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.650
A fearful bombs everywhere waiting to go off that.
He's a,

518
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.070
I mean if you're near a house that did that,

519
00:31:09.071 --> 00:31:12.400
what you would start thinking that it's just a weed or a house that did that.

520
00:31:12.401 --> 00:31:13.750
You wouldn't be thinking at all,
man,

521
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:18.490
what of your fairly close within a couple of blocks and do managers survive?

522
00:31:18.491 --> 00:31:22.180
But then you stop and think about it and go,
what the fuck man.
See,

523
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:26.940
pull up some photos,
man.
The Indiana a house explosion ago.

524
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.910
Yeah,
the,
that's nothing though.
That's,
there's still a house.

525
00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:33.430
It's on fire and everything,
but it's still a house in Indiana.

526
00:31:33.431 --> 00:31:35.660
Like the house was gone.
There was no house,
you know,

527
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.150
these are like tornado or something.

528
00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:42.040
We were just so willy nilly with the fact that we've got gigantic sources of

529
00:31:42.041 --> 00:31:46.750
power and our grasp all the time,
electricity and every wall in your house.

530
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:51.370
And very few people even understand it.
We just so turn the light switch on,

531
00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:55.310
turn the light,
switch off,
no thinking.
Meanwhile,

532
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.700
some poor fuck has to put up those crazy cables

533
00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:03.930
and hope that it doesn't give him cancer too.
So,
um,

534
00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:08.650
this book that you wrote is a,
I would have to say a very controversial book.

535
00:32:08.651 --> 00:32:12.520
Was it you or was it Bert Kreischer that was telling us a story about,
uh,

536
00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.660
someone was at Bert about bringing up sex at dawn and someone got angry.

537
00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:21.710
<v 1>Oh No,
I bought it a long time ago in a Dunkin first started talking about it.</v>

538
00:32:21.711 --> 00:32:23.950
He just got it.
I think he told me that he's like,

539
00:32:23.951 --> 00:32:26.080
you should check out this book man.
And I was like,
okay.

540
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.210
So that's how I bought it.
And then,
uh,

541
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.390
I started reading it and then I left it in my car.

542
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.700
And then the girl I was dating at the time was like,

543
00:32:33.701 --> 00:32:36.400
what's this book I want a book to read tonight?
I'm like,
all right.
I take that.

544
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.410
And I'm like,
then right when I'm giving it to her,
I'm like,
wait,

545
00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:41.030
that was probably a really bad idea what I heard.
You know why?

546
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.160
Because she read it and she was just like,
oh my God,

547
00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:47.210
this is so anti marriage and blah blah blah and anti relationship and,

548
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.160
and stuff like that.
And she didn't like whatever.

549
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.990
She read to me what you're saying.
She didn't know.
She just got upset.

550
00:32:53.991 --> 00:32:56.680
She's like,
why are you reading this book?
Like she almost got nervous,
you know?

551
00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.670
That's hilarious.
You know what I uh,

552
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:03.380
first really one of the first people that read the book was,

553
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:09.140
I guess I can say his name.
What the fuck?
What was his name?
He was a child actor.

554
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:13.610
He was in,
in YPD blue.
Ricky Schroeder.
Do you know what I'm talking about?

555
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:18.630
We know Ricky.
What did he say?
Oh fuck,
I shouldn't tell you this story.

556
00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.530
He's crazy.
He's a nice guy.

557
00:33:21.531 --> 00:33:26.420
But go ahead and tell the story story is that,
uh,
okay.

558
00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:30.500
So I met him right at lax.
I didn't know who he was.
We started talking,

559
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:34.670
we're on the same flight to Spain,
actually London and then Barcelona.
Right.

560
00:33:34.671 --> 00:33:39.650
Cause he was living in Barcelona for a while and it asked me what I did.

561
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:43.580
I said,
I just about to publish this book.
I had one in the galleys,
the early,

562
00:33:43.581 --> 00:33:47.600
the prepublication copies and we talked about the book and then he came back,

563
00:33:47.601 --> 00:33:49.400
he was in first class or something.
He came back,

564
00:33:49.401 --> 00:33:52.520
there were empty seats and he and I sat and talked like most of the way to

565
00:33:52.521 --> 00:33:56.030
London and he was really excited about it.
He was like,

566
00:33:56.031 --> 00:33:59.310
this is going to be amazing.
This is really interesting,
you know?
And,

567
00:33:59.311 --> 00:34:02.360
and then we talked about a screenplay,
his cause he was like,
you know,

568
00:34:02.361 --> 00:34:03.890
could you do,
is there a movie in this?

569
00:34:03.891 --> 00:34:08.870
And he told me about a movie he was working on at the time about Arab terrorists

570
00:34:08.871 --> 00:34:13.130
or something like that.
Anyway.
Um,
so,
uh,

571
00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.010
he was really into it and I told him the screenplay idea and he was like,
yeah,

572
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.870
Kevin Kline in the lead and you know,

573
00:34:17.871 --> 00:34:20.570
we're talking about who would look and he was like super enthusiastic.

574
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:24.230
So he said,
do you have a kid?
I read the book and you have a car.
I said,

575
00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:28.160
I've got this like one copy,
it's my last copy,
but it'll be out in two months,

576
00:34:28.161 --> 00:34:29.060
you know,
whatever.
But yeah,

577
00:34:29.061 --> 00:34:33.230
you can have this great cause I'm going skiing in France or Switzerland or

578
00:34:33.231 --> 00:34:35.290
somewhere and I'll read it.
And uh,

579
00:34:35.291 --> 00:34:38.360
so he was going to get in touch with me when he's back in Barcelona a couple of

580
00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.250
weeks,
never heard from the guy.
And so it's talking to Stanley,

581
00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.500
my professor about this.
And Stanley said,
well,
you know,

582
00:34:45.501 --> 00:34:49.070
I'm going to see Ricky Schroder and two months in Washington at this event for

583
00:34:49.071 --> 00:34:53.030
veterans,
I'll ask him what,
what's up?
So he did,

584
00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:54.710
he saw a Ricky at this thing and he said,
hey,

585
00:34:54.711 --> 00:34:56.150
you met this friend of mine and you know,

586
00:34:56.151 --> 00:35:00.710
you were really interested in all this stuff.
What happened?
And Ricky's wife,

587
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.240
according to Stanley,

588
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.350
said I threw that book in the trash.

589
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:11.480
Nobody talks to Ricky about sex except me.
Whoa.

590
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:14.890
Yeah,
that's the story I heard.
Well the,

591
00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:18.560
I would never repeat that story because it's a store that you heard.

592
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:22.610
It's really hard to get a real solid story through more than one person.

593
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:26.240
So it was just one person.
But even I,
I,
I mean if we could cut it out,

594
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:31.290
cut it out as live.
Oh really?
It's live.
It's all of this is live.
Um,

595
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.760
I,
well,
you know,
who knows,
who knows what.
Anyways,
ocean,

596
00:35:34.761 --> 00:35:39.761
they had wine is that a lot girlfriends and wives have been a non interested in

597
00:35:39.931 --> 00:35:42.000
the book and also husbands.
I got to say,

598
00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:46.690
<v 0>Ricky's a very nice guy.
Um,
he's a,
he's a friend of the family.</v>

599
00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:51.250
Told him I said Hi.
I've hung out with him and his wife many times.

600
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:52.990
What was his wife's a wonderful lady.

601
00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:58.000
<v 1>Oh no thank you.
Said tell him he could cut it out.
Good.</v>

602
00:35:58.001 --> 00:35:58.990
I didn't know.
I don't know.

603
00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.950
<v 0>Knows what really happened.
Listen man,
people get into situations.
It's not bad.</v>

604
00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.960
You know,
it's your,

605
00:36:04.961 --> 00:36:09.961
your book to a lot of people that have sort of a Sandra Bullock movie view of

606
00:36:10.391 --> 00:36:13.690
the world.
It becomes very disconcerting.

607
00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:17.930
The idea of for folks who don't know,
uh,
sex at dawn.
Oh,

608
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.820
how would you describe the book and what's the,
the best description of it?

609
00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.610
<v 1>Looking at,
uh,
the origin and evolution of human sexuality.</v>

610
00:36:27.611 --> 00:36:31.960
So it's,
it's sort of looking at how human beings behave sexually.

611
00:36:31.961 --> 00:36:33.280
Before there were

612
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.370
<v 0>civilizations telling them what to do and what not to do.</v>

613
00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:41.680
Now when that subject gets breached,
for whatever reason,

614
00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.420
a lot of women will panic.

615
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:48.750
Like if you start talking about what people used to do orgiastic culture and for

616
00:36:48.941 --> 00:36:50.230
whatever reason,
like the,

617
00:36:50.231 --> 00:36:54.460
the idea that somehow or another things were different at one point in time and

618
00:36:54.461 --> 00:36:58.960
you know,
maybe males would find that more preferable or maybe you know,

619
00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:03.940
whatever it is that freaks them out when a guy would read a book like that,

620
00:37:03.941 --> 00:37:08.770
that's sort of describing just basically a statement of pretty much fact of

621
00:37:08.771 --> 00:37:09.131
history.

622
00:37:09.131 --> 00:37:11.980
There's a tremendous amount of evidence to backup the idea that there were

623
00:37:11.981 --> 00:37:15.830
orgiastic cultures.
So what's wrong with saying that?
Like I don't,

624
00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:20.110
that that becomes like a real weird,
do you,
did you feel a lot of that?

625
00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:21.580
Did you feel that your people,

626
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:25.770
<v 1>sure.
Sure.
You know,
and there's a good reason for that response.
I mean,</v>

627
00:37:25.771 --> 00:37:30.771
the fact is that women are in a situation now and have been for millennia where

628
00:37:31.041 --> 00:37:32.350
the only thing they're,

629
00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.560
the only way they could survive really was through a man,

630
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:39.090
<v 0>either their father or their husband</v>

631
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:40.440
<v 1>and,</v>

632
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.510
and the only thing they had to negotiate with was their sexuality because the

633
00:37:44.511 --> 00:37:48.410
men can,
men had all the property,
all the money,
all the power,
all the,
everything.

634
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.750
The only thing women had was their sexuality.

635
00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:56.080
So it's not surprising that women feel threatened if the value of that

636
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.300
negotiating chip is lessened as it is.

637
00:37:59.301 --> 00:38:02.570
If you start talking about orgiastic societies,
right,

638
00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:05.780
then you don't trade your sexuality for your food,

639
00:38:05.781 --> 00:38:08.240
your status and all that other stuff.
Um,

640
00:38:08.241 --> 00:38:10.760
but the key is to understand that they didn't need to,

641
00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:14.810
our ancestors did need to because the women had direct access to their food and

642
00:38:14.811 --> 00:38:17.630
their status and whatever they needed.
In terms of power.

643
00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:22.340
These are very egalitarian societies,
but we're not in an egalitarian society.

644
00:38:22.341 --> 00:38:23.480
Now.
It's getting better,

645
00:38:23.481 --> 00:38:27.890
although women are still making 70 cents on the dollar to men for the same work.

646
00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:31.970
Um,
but yeah,
if you're a single mother,
it's tough in this,

647
00:38:31.971 --> 00:38:35.710
in this specialty in the United States because you're not getting much support.

648
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:41.070
So those women feel threatened if their negotiating position visa vi man is,

649
00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:45.100
is threatened,
uh,
as it is.

650
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:48.880
If you start talking about loosening up sexual morality,
that's funny.

651
00:38:48.881 --> 00:38:52.270
Then negotiating position,
that's really funny.
That's,

652
00:38:52.271 --> 00:38:54.160
and that essentially is what a lot of men become.

653
00:38:54.161 --> 00:38:55.690
They become negotiating positions.

654
00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:59.680
It's a very disturbing thing to see your friends sort of co opted by some chick

655
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:04.090
who sort of made her way into his life and now as a inside of him like a

656
00:39:04.091 --> 00:39:07.300
parasite working the controls,
it becomes really weird.

657
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.080
Becomes really weird to say.
Yeah.
But it's also,
I mean,

658
00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:14.350
we should never forget that women are put in that position.

659
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:18.640
They don't necessarily choose,
it's not their nature.
In other words,
the gold,

660
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.490
you know,
we're talking about gold diggers or whenever we're talking about,

661
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:24.430
you know,
it prostitutes,
whatever,

662
00:39:24.431 --> 00:39:27.970
women who are trading their sexuality for something explicitly,

663
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:33.370
but we put them in that position.
How is that so if some women don't do it?

664
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.710
Well,
they,
I mean,
women do it to the sentence,
you know,
like the,
uh,

665
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:42.010
I think it's all just a matter of circumstance and a matter of where they are,

666
00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.820
they are and how it turns out because there's a lot of women who obviously don't

667
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:50.740
do any of those things because they can work for the first time in western

668
00:39:50.741 --> 00:39:55.570
history.
So we have to understand that it's a very novel moment in our history.

669
00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:59.470
And you still go to play,
you know,
Pakistan or you know,
most of Africa,

670
00:39:59.471 --> 00:40:03.220
most of Latin America,
women don't have direct access to what they need.

671
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:07.390
So in the origins of civilization,

672
00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:11.920
like when we moved from having the sort of a small tribes,

673
00:40:11.921 --> 00:40:13.600
people to larger cities,

674
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:18.700
is that when the transition sort of happened for women and women became reliant

675
00:40:18.701 --> 00:40:20.770
upon men and their jobs less than,

676
00:40:20.771 --> 00:40:25.390
because now they're living in cities and well before cities even just just

677
00:40:25.391 --> 00:40:29.620
settled,
um,
society.
So we're talking about the advent of agriculture,

678
00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:33.310
which is about 10,000 years ago at the earliest.

679
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.410
And what's important to understand there is that that's when the notion of

680
00:40:38.411 --> 00:40:43.411
private property really entered human society according to our vision of,

681
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:45.580
of this stuff.
Um,

682
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:50.680
so women weren't th that that affected women in two ways.

683
00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:55.390
One way is that it became very important to trace property.

684
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.860
So you had to know who your sons were because it was going,
it was my,
uh,

685
00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.890
patrilineal,
right?
So it's going down.
The mail.
Property was passed father to son.

686
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.690
So who are your sons?
Well,

687
00:41:04.691 --> 00:41:08.470
the only way to know they're your sons is controlling this woman's sexuality,

688
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.160
right?
That's the only way.
And there are no DNA tests.
Right?

689
00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:15.310
And also this is the time when people started breeding animals.

690
00:41:15.311 --> 00:41:20.311
So it became very clear that one sex act could result in a offspring.

691
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:25.820
Um,
so,
so this is very important thing.
And if you look in the Bible,
uh,

692
00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.690
what's the line?
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.
Right?

693
00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:33.290
That sounds like something that's talking about respecting your neighbors

694
00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:34.124
marriage.

695
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:39.680
But if you read it in context that continues nor his house,
nor his servants,

696
00:41:39.681 --> 00:41:41.870
nor his ox or his sheep,
et cetera.

697
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:47.120
So it's now shalt not covet thy neighbor's property and his wife is just part of

698
00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:50.330
the property.
So women really became like,

699
00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:54.800
they went from having nearly equal status to males and almost every hunter

700
00:41:54.801 --> 00:41:59.420
gatherer society that we know of to being property.

701
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:04.080
<v 0>That's fascinating.
What prompted that?
I mean,
what,
how did that,
uh,</v>

702
00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:09.140
how did they morph from these tribal societies of equality to these,

703
00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.810
you know,
city societies?

704
00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.153
<v 1>Well,</v>

705
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:19.480
it's obviously it would be very complicated to talk about all the different

706
00:42:19.481 --> 00:42:20.291
things that happen,

707
00:42:20.291 --> 00:42:25.120
but it's important to understand that the life human life before,

708
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:25.960
um,

709
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.960
civilization or the agriculture and after agriculture changed radically in

710
00:42:31.571 --> 00:42:35.530
almost every way our diet,
our exercise patterns,

711
00:42:35.531 --> 00:42:39.010
our understanding of interpersonal relationships,

712
00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:43.300
governmental structure,
how we're,
how we rule,

713
00:42:43.301 --> 00:42:47.530
what kind of decision making happens.
Childcare,
sexuality,

714
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:52.930
<v 0>yeah,
it's really fucked up everything about it,
but a society,
a city,
uh,</v>

715
00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.940
you know,
agriculture,
that was really the first technology.

716
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:58.460
It's like you don't think of it as technology,

717
00:42:58.461 --> 00:43:02.480
but that really was when they figured out how to create things and build things

718
00:43:02.481 --> 00:43:06.800
and set things up that made life more convenient for them or made life easier.

719
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:11.870
And then from then it's really been all about accelerating that process,

720
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:14.750
accelerating that process of invention and innovation,

721
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.730
which really started off with agriculture.

722
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:20.300
If you really stop and think about what we were like when we were hunters and

723
00:43:20.301 --> 00:43:22.310
gatherers,
these small tribes,

724
00:43:22.311 --> 00:43:26.660
a very tightly knit people that had to stay together and lived off the land to

725
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:30.110
the first city.
From that point on,

726
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.710
it was a one way ticket to nuclear explosions.
It was just,

727
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:38.711
we were just on our way to innovating and creating more shelter and safety so

728
00:43:39.411 --> 00:43:42.020
you can create better and crazier shit.

729
00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.980
I mean literally the first house,
the first,
the first city,

730
00:43:45.981 --> 00:43:49.880
the first fence is they set up.
That was a,
that was the,
the first steps.

731
00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:54.980
And if you follow it to the pollution of the earth and the nuclear explosions

732
00:43:54.981 --> 00:43:57.810
and the space shuttle,
all the different things that we've done,

733
00:43:57.811 --> 00:44:01.610
that it literally all comes from that idea.
If we never did that,

734
00:44:01.611 --> 00:44:05.000
we would be living exactly like these people that are living in tribal

735
00:44:05.001 --> 00:44:09.290
situations in the Amazon and parts of Africa.
It's,
it's kind of amazing.

736
00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.820
<v 1>Yeah.
And they'll see that at the beginning of,</v>

737
00:44:11.821 --> 00:44:14.020
of that you said to make life easier

738
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:17.710
<v 0>or whatever.
I shouldn't say easier.
Make it easier.
Right then</v>

739
00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:21.640
<v 1>it is.
Yeah,
exactly.
It's easier right then.
But yeah,
that's the key.</v>

740
00:44:21.641 --> 00:44:24.790
And people often say,
well then why,
you know,
why did we choose to do this if,

741
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.460
you know,
cause we argue pretty strongly in sex at dawn and,

742
00:44:27.461 --> 00:44:30.220
and then the next book is called civilized to death.

743
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:33.030
And I told you where I'm going with that one.
Right?
Um,

744
00:44:33.031 --> 00:44:36.900
so I really question whether it's made life easier or better,
you know,

745
00:44:36.901 --> 00:44:41.610
and so that's the argument I want to make in that book.
Um,
but you know,

746
00:44:41.611 --> 00:44:45.900
people think of it as if we chose it as if our ancestors chose like,
hey,

747
00:44:45.901 --> 00:44:50.520
let's all just hang out here and plant some corn,
you know,
whatever.
No,
what,

748
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:55.470
what seems to have happened,
agriculture is arisen four or five different times.

749
00:44:55.471 --> 00:44:57.300
Bontanica something different parts of the world.

750
00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:01.920
And in all of those different parts of the world in the years before by looking

751
00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:04.650
at pollen,
a residue and fossils and stuff,

752
00:45:04.651 --> 00:45:09.651
they can tell that the years before the advent of agriculture generally attended

753
00:45:09.781 --> 00:45:14.130
to be a unusually rich,
lots of rain,
fall,

754
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:18.390
lots of plant life,
lots of life going on.
And then,
um,

755
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.310
and then they entered a period where it tightened up and there's much less

756
00:45:23.311 --> 00:45:26.290
rainfall.
And that's when I grew culture arose.

757
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:29.670
So you see that pattern all around.
So the I,
the thinking is,
okay,

758
00:45:29.671 --> 00:45:33.990
you've got really rich environment 20,
30,
40 years,
right?
Several generations,

759
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:38.850
population levels get really high.
Then suddenly there's a contraction.

760
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:41.880
So suddenly there's not enough food for everybody,
right?

761
00:45:41.881 --> 00:45:45.240
Because hunter gatherer societies tended to be pretty much in balance with like

762
00:45:45.241 --> 00:45:49.650
every other species with the food supply.
So suddenly there's way overpopulation,

763
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.500
most of the time they would just die off.
But occasion,
you know,

764
00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:56.790
in these five instances,
someone figured out like,
wait a minute,

765
00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:00.210
this is where all these things grow.
There's not enough water,

766
00:46:00.211 --> 00:46:02.700
but there's a stream over there.
We could dig a channel.

767
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.820
So generally the first steps of agriculture,

768
00:46:05.821 --> 00:46:09.720
I thought to have been the irrigation.
Then later they figured out,
wait,

769
00:46:09.721 --> 00:46:11.790
we could take the seeds and put the seeds over here.

770
00:46:11.791 --> 00:46:15.850
First it was just bringing the water to where the staff was.
And it's the,

771
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:17.820
it's really freaky when they,
uh,

772
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:22.060
they keep moving the date of that actually happening back further and further

773
00:46:22.061 --> 00:46:22.860
and further.

774
00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:27.860
They've just found evidence of cheesemaking from one to 7,000 years.

775
00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:28.800
Yeah.

776
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:33.180
They found evidence in the area near go Beckley Tempe where they might've been

777
00:46:33.181 --> 00:46:35.370
making beer 10,000 years ago.

778
00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.250
It's a really fascinating,

779
00:46:38.251 --> 00:46:41.970
like if they keep going further and further back to when people actually figured

780
00:46:41.971 --> 00:46:45.830
it out,
but,
and apparently hemp was the first thing ever cultivated.

781
00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:51.030
Pretty crazy.
So easy to do.
Stoners figured it out,
you know?

782
00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:56.010
Uh,
the not hydroponic.
They were in soil.
Yeah.

783
00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:58.920
Yeah.
They didn't figure out the whole closet setup yet.

784
00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:01.950
We'd go over someone's house and you're like,
why are you fucking,

785
00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:03.850
why did it so the hum,
what does that home,

786
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:09.390
what's that light coming out from under the door and that door?
And you go,
whoa.

787
00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:13.920
Yeah,
that the feeling that you,
you,
uh,
didn't really get,

788
00:47:13.921 --> 00:47:16.910
but thought you got it from a tree.
Like you can Kinda,

789
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.250
you can get a weird communication when you're in a room full of weed plants.

790
00:47:20.251 --> 00:47:22.920
I love,
I love growing marijuana.

791
00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:30.010
Really in Spain it's legal man,
and I had plans

792
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:34.570
<v 0>every summer on our terrorists that were like Christmas trees by the end of the</v>

793
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.070
summer.
It's so stupid that people think that if you want to,

794
00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.590
if you want pot to be legal,

795
00:47:38.591 --> 00:47:41.310
than you also probably want to overthrow the government and you know what I
mean?

796
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:46.000
I don't support taxes and you'd think we should be all hippies.
No,
no,
stupid.

797
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:49.150
You shouldn't be able to tell people what they can and can't do.
Right.

798
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:54.270
When it's been clearly proven to not be nearly as dangerous as almost everything

799
00:47:54.971 --> 00:47:58.090
else on the world.
Right.
It's just so stupid.

800
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:01.270
It's so stupid at this point in time that you can't have a house,

801
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:02.320
a room in your house.

802
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:05.410
We just have all these plants hanging out and you can go in there and chill with

803
00:48:05.411 --> 00:48:09.440
them.
Know,
well,
our cats always would hang out in the plant.

804
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.900
Halian fuckers cancer,
a little fucking Weirdos.

805
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.990
If you could just teach them to hunt those little worms,
you know,

806
00:48:16.991 --> 00:48:19.540
like make yourself useful,
Pete.
The worms.

807
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:23.170
The first time I ever went to a grow room can now granted I was intoxicated.

808
00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:27.130
I was under the spell of the sacred plant,
but when I walked into that room,

809
00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:30.400
it was literally like walking into like a,

810
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:32.500
like a different sort of consciousness.

811
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:37.180
There was like a different sort of a life coming out of these plants and there's

812
00:48:37.181 --> 00:48:40.210
like 20 or 30 of them in this room and they were huge.

813
00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.900
And I remember being in there going,
whoa,
like this feels crazy.

814
00:48:43.901 --> 00:48:46.570
Like this feels like these things are,

815
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:50.680
they're aware or if not aware there's something coming off of them.

816
00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:55.120
It's not as simple as a,
you know,
this is a rock.
This statistic,

817
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:58.630
I wasn't that stone.
I was stolen but not like stoned enough through.

818
00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.410
I thought that,
uh,
you know,
I wasn't really here anymore.
It wasn't that,

819
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:05.800
it was just fairly normal.
It was like I am right now.

820
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:10.510
But just walking into the room was like,
Whoa,
like this is a,
this is intense.

821
00:49:10.511 --> 00:49:11.500
I wonder what that is.

822
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:15.250
And then people will tell you that like you can talk around plants and it

823
00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.630
actually makes them grow better.

824
00:49:16.631 --> 00:49:20.740
But how much of that is horse shit you ever been to Findhorn no.

825
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.460
You know what I'm talking about that that's where the whole playing music for

826
00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:29.320
your plants and talk to them and they'll vet,
uh,
started in northern Finland.

827
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.620
I heard,
sorry.
Scotland's the music part is bullshit,

828
00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.730
but the talking part or there's some evidence that shows that it might actually

829
00:49:36.731 --> 00:49:40.860
help.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I haven't investigated it myself,
but well,

830
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:43.450
I know that if I went over to your house and all your plants are wilted,

831
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:47.260
I might think you're creepy.
Fuck.
You know what I'm saying?

832
00:49:47.261 --> 00:49:50.740
If you go over someone's house and they're fucking plants are all jack like

833
00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:55.720
toxic.
I kill Pam is Joe at my house.
I'm like those bamboo,

834
00:49:55.721 --> 00:49:59.980
good luck bamboo plants there almost should not be able to kill him things and

835
00:49:59.981 --> 00:50:03.070
you just put it in bottled water and I still kept those things somehow.
Oh Man,

836
00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:09.070
I'm glad you're proud.
I'm not proud,
excited.
They just dial in life forms.

837
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:14.200
I put him cat cats are weird animals.
I've been,
they,
they,
you know,

838
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:17.550
they would make sense that they would go and hang out in the weed room,
you know?

839
00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:21.210
Sure.
To pick up on it.
Smells good.
Yeah.

840
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.160
And plus it looks like the jungle,
those little creepy fucks.

841
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.860
All those trees are probably thinking that there'll be a little jack something.

842
00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:27.990
It's

843
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:32.240
<v 1>funny,
we have a cat,
a cat.
I love cats.
I have two cats.
They're,
you know,</v>

844
00:50:32.241 --> 00:50:35.150
they're selfish little assholes.
But um,
it's weird.

845
00:50:35.151 --> 00:50:38.540
My cat is it just a big fluffy cat?
She's 16 years old,

846
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:41.600
but I put her in the yard and there was a bird in the yard and she fucking went

847
00:50:41.601 --> 00:50:43.250
after it and try to kill it.
I mean,

848
00:50:43.251 --> 00:50:46.880
it's like you can have him in the house given I'm Kat from him for 16 years,

849
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.670
but he'd get them anywhere near a bourbon.
They go fucking crazy.

850
00:50:49.671 --> 00:50:52.310
They will eyes go and then they make that noise.

851
00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:57.020
Is your cat have one of those cat water fountains?
I just got one.

852
00:50:57.050 --> 00:51:01.040
It's the coolest thing.
Cats love the waterfowl moving water.

853
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:02.170
So cool.

854
00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:04.820
So they play with it as I wanted to just sit there and put their mouth in it and

855
00:51:04.821 --> 00:51:07.990
just sit there.
And then my cat just like wipes his face and then wipes.

856
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.520
It's Paul's in it.
I was playing with it.
Tell,
give me a link and I'll uh,

857
00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:17.350
<v 0>powerful Amazon.
Um,
yeah.
Well,
you know about toxoplasma.</v>

858
00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.273
Do you know about all that?

859
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:18.871
<v 1>Oh yeah.</v>

860
00:51:18.871 --> 00:51:23.871
The strange little thing that makes mice attracted to the smell of cat piss.

861
00:51:24.961 --> 00:51:27.250
Yeah.
What a great evolutionary quirk that had.

862
00:51:27.251 --> 00:51:29.860
It removes their fear of them too strange.
Yeah.

863
00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:33.260
<v 0>And uh,
the,
the,
the crazy thing is the numbers of humans in the,</v>

864
00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:37.420
in the planet that are infested with this stuff.
Yeah.
That it affects behavior.

865
00:51:37.421 --> 00:51:41.980
And that might be,
they said to France at one point in time was higher than 60%.

866
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:45.730
Yeah.
They say they've got it down to around 50 something now,
but I mean,

867
00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:50.080
how the fuck do they know who's getting tested for toxo plasma they think is at

868
00:51:50.081 --> 00:51:51.960
least 60 million Americans that haven't,

869
00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.390
I think it's related to schizophrenia or they said could be,
they don't know.

870
00:51:55.391 --> 00:51:59.290
They know that there's a sub,
Paul ski out of Stanford is a,

871
00:51:59.291 --> 00:52:03.970
the leading guy in it.
I've been trying to get him.
Yeah,
he's a primatologist.

872
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:09.100
He's a really interesting guy.
He's a fascinating dude.
He apparently is uh,
the,

873
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:12.450
the leading light in this,
uh,
this thing.
Maybe this isn't the same

874
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:16.130
<v 1>well crazy beard like Hasidic Jew look or not Hasidic,</v>

875
00:52:16.131 --> 00:52:18.410
but just Yachty wacky beard.
Yeah.

876
00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:22.230
<v 0>Video videos online.
Talking about it,</v>

877
00:52:22.231 --> 00:52:25.350
about how he used to work in an emergency room and they found that a

878
00:52:25.351 --> 00:52:30.030
disproportionate number of motorcycle victims,
uh,
had tested for this toxoplasma.

879
00:52:30.031 --> 00:52:33.120
Rarely.
Yeah.
That it makes you reckless,
makes you reckless.

880
00:52:33.121 --> 00:52:34.710
It makes you take more chances.
Right?

881
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.730
<v 1>Right.
Yeah.
They don't know exactly what,</v>

882
00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.660
<v 0>what the fuck it's doing to you.
You know,</v>

883
00:52:38.661 --> 00:52:42.560
they don't know exactly like how much of an effect that it has on some people

884
00:52:42.561 --> 00:52:46.400
and other people,
whether it takes over their life,
you know,
but for mice,

885
00:52:46.401 --> 00:52:50.360
it's this fucking death sentence.
They just,
the dicks get hard for campus.

886
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:53.330
<v 1>It's the craziest thing ever.
It's the craziest thing ever.</v>

887
00:52:53.331 --> 00:52:55.340
And then they go find them,
these rats and mice.

888
00:52:55.341 --> 00:52:58.820
And if you ever seen the videos of them,
yeah.
It's pretty crazy.
Yeah.

889
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:02.300
I've run up to the cats.
They're like running up to the cats dick.

890
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:07.850
It's crazy.
What's the doctor's name that,
that found that,
so Paul Scheme?
Yeah,

891
00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:12.080
he's a Robert Sapolsky tells one of my favorite stories ever talking about

892
00:53:12.081 --> 00:53:13.070
humanity and all that.

893
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:17.420
He's for 20 some years he's been going to Kenya and studying baboons.

894
00:53:17.421 --> 00:53:22.340
They're always the same.
He's been at the same place for 20 years.
Wow.
And um,

895
00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:26.130
so he's seeing generations come and go.
He is a great book called

896
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:29.910
<v 4>the primates,
a memoir,
beautiful book about his years in Kenya.
That's him.</v>

897
00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:33.930
And he's a great writer.
Yeah.
That's in there.
And a pimp.

898
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:38.740
So he got us and give a fuck.
Yeah,
he's great.

899
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.570
I'm a grooming.
Yeah.

900
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:46.860
I mean he shoots these baboons with blowguns.
Oh my God.

901
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.170
And then he like gets a bad mugs.
Yeah.

902
00:53:49.171 --> 00:53:51.650
Triangle goes in and does blood tests on there.
Uh,

903
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:54.660
he's particularly interested in the neurobiology of stress.

904
00:53:54.661 --> 00:53:58.090
So he's looking at like how different males in different points of the hierarchy

905
00:53:58.091 --> 00:54:02.730
you experience stress and stuff.
So,
um,
anyway,
so the story is that he's been,

906
00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:04.950
he's watched all these generations come and go and,

907
00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:08.850
and the baboons troop is very male dominated and they're very,

908
00:54:08.851 --> 00:54:11.850
the males are very fierce and they,
they sort of,
you know,

909
00:54:11.851 --> 00:54:14.550
they're nasty to the females into each other and everything.

910
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:18.180
So in the years he'd been going there,
they,

911
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:23.210
the Messiah built a hotel for tourists and this tourist that,

912
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:27.450
this hotel has a dump and his baboons troops started going to this dump cause

913
00:54:27.451 --> 00:54:29.730
there's good food there and the best food,

914
00:54:29.731 --> 00:54:32.910
of course he's meat scraps of meat that are thrown out by the hotel.

915
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:36.960
So the dominant males tend to get that meat.
Nobody else gets any.

916
00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:42.320
So one time they threw out some meat that was tainted with tuberculosis and the

917
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:47.900
upper echelon of this baboons male dominance hierarchy got wiped out.

918
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.210
Whoa.
It was like a bomb went off in Washington or something.

919
00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:56.400
And so he was like,
Whoa,
now what's going to happen?
This is going to be horrible.

920
00:54:56.401 --> 00:55:01.320
Because when the males reach adulthood,
they shift out into a different group.

921
00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:04.470
They go out,
they leave their natal group and they go looking for another group.

922
00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:08.160
So these new males are going to come in full of testosterone looking to kick ass

923
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:10.110
and there won't be anyone here to fight them off.

924
00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:14.100
It's going to be like pirates landing on an island with no men on it,
you know?

925
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:19.410
And but what happened was the new males came in.
In the meantime,

926
00:55:19.411 --> 00:55:23.220
the group developed a much more egalitarian,
low stress way of life.

927
00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:27.870
And when the new males came in,
they adopted this new way of life.
Whoa.

928
00:55:27.871 --> 00:55:32.640
So five years later it last,
I heard from him five years later,
this group,

929
00:55:32.641 --> 00:55:37.080
this troop of baboons was still significantly less uptight than any other truth

930
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:39.450
that has ever been studied.
Isn't that hilarious?

931
00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:43.800
That sort of mirrors America that if you could like poison the military

932
00:55:43.801 --> 00:55:46.780
industrial complex was like sacred caviar from,

933
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:50.460
see now we're back to the Unabomber.
Right?
I'm not defending him.

934
00:55:50.461 --> 00:55:53.740
I'm just saying there is because he was,

935
00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:57.600
he was going after fucking scientists and professors.
He's a nut.

936
00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:00.990
If it is like senators,
he would've been fine.

937
00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:03.660
It's like that quote that no one ever wants to get heard saying.

938
00:56:03.661 --> 00:56:07.590
Well Hitler had a couple of good ideas.
Exactly.

939
00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:12.540
And so I mean most people that are,
you know,
uh,

940
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:16.050
young folks,
people that have regular jobs,

941
00:56:16.051 --> 00:56:20.100
people that are out there sort of tuned in and connected to the world are very

942
00:56:20.101 --> 00:56:24.040
frustrated by the way this country and the world in general is run because

943
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:29.040
<v 5>it's run by this one small group of people all throughout the world that have a</v>

944
00:56:30.041 --> 00:56:34.120
vested interest in keeping it running that way.
And in that situation,

945
00:56:34.121 --> 00:56:36.190
I mean no one's advocating the anybody do this,

946
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:40.390
but in that situation it really does mirror this babbling society where these

947
00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:44.590
dominator baboons got jacked and then everybody just chill the fuck out.

948
00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:47.560
And then new people came in and they also chilled the fuck out.
Right.

949
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:51.820
<v 6>The problem with that,
I mean I,
I tend to agree with you,</v>

950
00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:55.150
but I th I think comedy has the Patriot Act.
You can't even say that shit.

951
00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:57.610
What's that?
I said the problem with that is the Patriot Act.

952
00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:02.050
Even just saying that it was like can get you in trouble.
Yeah.
So I tell,

953
00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:04.740
I tell a bad story and you get thrown in prison and this,

954
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:08.510
this is going really well so far.
It's a very good story though.

955
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:12.550
But what I was going to say is that I'm a little less hopeful than you are in

956
00:57:12.551 --> 00:57:15.850
the sense that I think even if the upper echelon of the,
you know,

957
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:17.440
the male baboons got wiped out,

958
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:22.600
we'd probably end up right back where we are because of there's too many people.

959
00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:26.050
<v 5>Yeah.
There's too many people,
that's for sure.
But there's,
um,</v>

960
00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:27.610
there's not too many people.

961
00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.820
If everybody stops jacking each other and stealing resources,

962
00:57:30.821 --> 00:57:35.140
there's not too many people.
If we don't engage in the,
the,
the,

963
00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:38.800
I mean our culture is essentially a war culture.
I mean,
that's just what it is.

964
00:57:38.801 --> 00:57:41.350
When we're constantly involved,
these oversee conflicts,

965
00:57:41.351 --> 00:57:44.770
controlling parts of the world that we don't really have any business in.

966
00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:48.370
We have military presence in something like a hundred different countries.

967
00:57:48.371 --> 00:57:52.710
I mean we're,
we're crazy and that's a lot of money.
That's a lot of taxes.

968
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:53.583
A lot of shit.

969
00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:58.270
And if we weren't spending it on that and we were instead spending on some sort

970
00:57:58.271 --> 00:57:59.320
of sustainability,

971
00:57:59.321 --> 00:58:02.980
I mean if you could get the direct proportion amount of money that's spent

972
00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:08.070
waging war and spend that same amount of money trying to enhance the life of

973
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:11.170
people that are in shit situations,

974
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:14.800
we would have an exponentially more beautiful world to live in.

975
00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:17.860
And the same amount of money would still be circling around.

976
00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:21.670
It's not like industry couldn't exist if it wasn't for war.
That's nonsense.

977
00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:24.850
That's just something we've been told by the people that are controlling where

978
00:58:24.851 --> 00:58:25.640
we go and what we,

979
00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:26.090
<v 6>yeah,</v>

980
00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:30.800
but isn't war uniquely profitable in that you're destroying very expensive

981
00:58:30.801 --> 00:58:35.180
stuff,
whether it's the infrastructure of a country or your own munitions,

982
00:58:35.810 --> 00:58:36.171
you know,

983
00:58:36.171 --> 00:58:39.470
1 million bucks a pop for a Predator drone strike or something like that,

984
00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:44.420
that always needs to be replenished.
Right.
Whereas if you're building,

985
00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:49.400
you know,
TV's or chairs or,
or you know,
jerk off cans or whatever it is that,

986
00:58:49.401 --> 00:58:50.234
you know,

987
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:53.570
there's a certain number that you build and then like that's all anyone needs

988
00:58:53.571 --> 00:58:54.640
for awhile.
Yeah.

989
00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:59.860
So I think there's a builtin impetus to blow shit up cause then you get paid to

990
00:59:00.171 --> 00:59:04.700
rebuild it.
That's the Halliburton ideology.
Exactly.
I don't know about that.

991
00:59:04.701 --> 00:59:05.534
I mean

992
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.560
<v 5>certainly seems that that's something that goes on.</v>

993
00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:13.120
I mean that certainly seems to be fueling a lot of the activity that we do,

994
00:59:13.121 --> 00:59:14.950
but I don't crave that that's necessary.

995
00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:18.820
I don't know if you fly over the country just one time,

996
00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:21.480
you realize how much open space there really is.
You know?

997
00:59:21.481 --> 00:59:24.720
And that's not just here,
that's like that.
There's the,

998
00:59:24.721 --> 00:59:28.740
I mean the idea of overpopulation is mostly based around the fact that 80% of

999
00:59:28.741 --> 00:59:30.960
our people live near water.
You know,

1000
00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:35.460
if we figured out a way to make our lives more sustainable,

1001
00:59:35.461 --> 00:59:37.980
to make cities more sustainable,
to pollute less,

1002
00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:42.390
and had all the people that are involved in all this nonsense over seas and

1003
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:45.870
dedicated to doing that,
we wouldn't be as reliant on foreign oil.

1004
00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:49.470
We wouldn't be as reliant on all these things that we need in these other
places.

1005
00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:51.960
Sure.
It's just,
we're just,
we're just,

1006
00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:57.060
we're governed in a shitty way.
And we're governed in this,

1007
00:59:57.061 --> 01:00:00.810
this representative way that where nobody feels connected to the actual

1008
01:00:00.811 --> 01:00:03.900
decisions that are being made vaguely connected

1009
01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.390
<v 6>cause he was being represented.
Let's be serious.</v>

1010
01:00:06.391 --> 01:00:09.210
It's corporations are being represented.
The rest of us,

1011
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:13.650
it's wasn't Zappa who said politics is the entertainment division of the

1012
01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:15.270
military industrial complex.

1013
01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:21.230
<v 5>That's brilliant.
That night.
Oh,
Zappa was brilliant.
And what a great quote.
Yeah.</v>

1014
01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:25.250
And that,
until that becomes,

1015
01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:29.780
until puments actually get a say in everything that happens until the United

1016
01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:30.130
States gets to

1017
01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:34.480
<v 6>vote on our activities is the thing,
you know,
there's so many fucking people.</v>

1018
01:00:34.481 --> 01:00:36.220
It's to manage this many people.

1019
01:00:36.221 --> 01:00:40.060
I think the systems that work are dehumanizing,

1020
01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:41.830
inherently dehumanizing.

1021
01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:47.280
I think that there's a question of scale that it seems to be,

1022
01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:52.360
um,
you know,
it just sort of makes sense.
If you're talking to 10 people,
you know,

1023
01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.520
each of those people gets a 10th of your attention.

1024
01:00:54.521 --> 01:00:57.550
If you're talking to 100 million people,
you know,

1025
01:00:57.551 --> 01:00:59.820
nobody's getting your attention.
Right,
right.
And,

1026
01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:04.780
and so I think there's sort of a mathematical,
almost like a quality of life,

1027
01:01:04.781 --> 01:01:09.160
uh,
like,
uh,
a limited quality of life.
And the more people there are,

1028
01:01:09.161 --> 01:01:12.670
the more people are taking a little piece of it and the smaller the pieces get,

1029
01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:13.410
you know,

1030
01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:15.840
<v 5>that's fascinating.
But then how could I,
if that's the case,</v>

1031
01:01:15.841 --> 01:01:18.000
then how come some people are just fucking living high on the hog?

1032
01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:21.220
<v 6>Well,
that's the people,
you know,
we're talking about this upper echelon,
right?</v>

1033
01:01:21.221 --> 01:01:25.260
The people who meet in Davos or whatever,
right?
You know,
in Switzerland,
oh,

1034
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:29.830
those guys meet in the builder Burger type character kind of thing.
Um,

1035
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.870
I,
I've known some of those people,
not a lot.
I've known some people who very,

1036
01:01:34.871 --> 01:01:39.310
very up in the world and they're no happier than anybody else,
man.

1037
01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:40.391
You know?

1038
01:01:40.391 --> 01:01:45.391
And I think a lot of them are actually less happy because happiness isn't about

1039
01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:49.660
being able to buy whatever you want.
You know,
I mean,
that wears out.

1040
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:51.081
<v 5>It is,</v>

1041
01:01:51.081 --> 01:01:55.880
unless you're in a great neighborhood and you have good friends and you know a

1042
01:01:55.881 --> 01:01:59.730
good escort agency,
if you have all that,
you know,

1043
01:01:59.731 --> 01:02:03.470
are we going into a commercial here?
No,
we don't.
We're not represented.

1044
01:02:03.471 --> 01:02:07.620
But anything.
Escort agencies.
Yes.
Hollow.
Exactly.
Yeah.

1045
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:10.760
The idea that the richest people are the happiest people is ridiculous.

1046
01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:16.320
The another Herzog of video that I really enjoyed was life in the Thai girl.

1047
01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:19.770
Happy People.
It's called the happy be a bowl of life and the Taco.
Ah,
no,

1048
01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:21.000
I haven't smelled Siberia.

1049
01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:25.260
These people that live up in Siberia in the Eagle hunters.
No,
no,
that's a,

1050
01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:28.500
that's in Tibet actually.
Siberia is a,

1051
01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:32.070
the life and the Taiga people are these trappers that live in this very small

1052
01:02:32.071 --> 01:02:33.630
town where they essentially don't use money.

1053
01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:38.460
They trap and they take the money from trapping and that's what buys like tools

1054
01:02:38.461 --> 01:02:41.820
and equipment and shit.
And you know,
the usage of trade for different things.

1055
01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:45.600
But all they do is hunt and fish.
They hunt,
they fish,

1056
01:02:45.601 --> 01:02:49.260
they grow food and they're,
they're so happy.
And the men,

1057
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:52.590
they disappear in the winter to go trapping.
They take snowmobiles,

1058
01:02:52.591 --> 01:02:56.490
they drive like a fucking hundred miles in a snowmobile and when they come back,

1059
01:02:56.491 --> 01:02:57.241
everybody's happy.

1060
01:02:57.241 --> 01:03:00.850
They have these celebrations that dogs run behind them when they come back and

1061
01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:04.980
the dogs don't make it tough shit.
And these people have like no mental illness.

1062
01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:08.070
They're were all happy.
They're all like cheering and dancing and singing.

1063
01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.130
It really makes you wonder,
like when you look at us,

1064
01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:14.420
you know people are sitting on their couch.
Oh,
I'm so bummed out.
Right.

1065
01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:17.630
So depressed.
Like for what?
What are you bummed out about?

1066
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.290
Like you don't have to do anything right now.

1067
01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:22.440
Like you are in a position right now where you can actually relax.
Let's see.

1068
01:03:22.441 --> 01:03:23.274
That's it.

1069
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:26.420
<v 6>That's it.
He's bummed.
Cause he doesn't have to do anything right now.</v>

1070
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:29.150
Not The problem.
There's no meaning.
There's no meaning.

1071
01:03:29.151 --> 01:03:31.880
It's like there's meaning and food.
When you grow it,

1072
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:33.200
like we're talking about marijuana.

1073
01:03:33.201 --> 01:03:38.150
There's meaning when you're smoking bud that you grew and you cut and trimmed

1074
01:03:38.151 --> 01:03:41.960
and you cured.
It's like you love,
if you make your own beer,
your own wine,

1075
01:03:41.961 --> 01:03:45.680
you cook your own dinner,
whatever it is,
right.
I went hunting recently.

1076
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:49.070
I killed a deer and I've been eating this deer for the past four months and when

1077
01:03:49.071 --> 01:03:52.850
I eat it,
I feel like a sense of satisfaction was a lot of effort.

1078
01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:57.210
<v 5>We go like hiking in Montana and camping outside and 12 degrees and I got this</v>

1079
01:03:57.211 --> 01:03:57.810
thing.
It's like,

1080
01:03:57.810 --> 01:04:01.130
it's like such a much better connection than going to the store and just,

1081
01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:02.540
<v 6>yeah,
picking on a steak.
Yeah.</v>

1082
01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:06.520
We still have all these reward systems set up from hunter gatherer cultures
done.

1083
01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.540
That's it.
That's it.
And the problem that the sort of the,

1084
01:04:10.541 --> 01:04:15.541
the ultimately destructive conundrum at the heart of civilization is that it

1085
01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:20.950
leads us to where we think we want to go,
but it isn't really where we should be.

1086
01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:24.380
It isn't really the place that's going to make us happy.
Right,
right.

1087
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:27.070
Like everyone thinks if you win the lottery,
you're going to be happy.

1088
01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:29.650
Look at studies of people who've actually won the lottery.

1089
01:04:29.651 --> 01:04:33.340
Their lives get destroyed in short order.
That's because they don't know me.

1090
01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:36.370
<v 5>I can hook them up there.
They're hanging around with the wrong people.</v>

1091
01:04:36.371 --> 01:04:38.890
They're staying in the same neighborhood.
They didn't change their name.

1092
01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.430
The first thing you do,
you take all that money and going to Canada,
right to,

1093
01:04:42.431 --> 01:04:47.420
can I go to Toronto where nobody knows you and he party,
Bitch,
star partying.

1094
01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.560
You got how much money?
Oh Man.
You just need an organizer.

1095
01:04:50.561 --> 01:04:53.550
You just need someone to monitor.
You want $300 million you were,

1096
01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:55.010
we're going to make you happy,
dude.
Yeah,

1097
01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:00.010
and then he'd get him enrolled in Yoga classes,
keep his brain sharp,
you know,

1098
01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.950
give him crossword puzzles to do.
This is going to be okay.

1099
01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:07.720
We'll take care of you for $100 million will take care of the problem with those

1100
01:05:07.721 --> 01:05:12.280
dudes as they stay in Georgia.
The chick filets fuck themselves.
They fall apart.

1101
01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.950
You can become happier when you win the lottery.

1102
01:05:14.951 --> 01:05:17.470
You just got to get hooked up with the right people.
It's possible,

1103
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.380
but in general,
that's not what happened.
No,
you can't.

1104
01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:22.540
You can't appreciate all joking aside.

1105
01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:25.870
You can appreciate things unless you earned them.
You know,
you really,
you know,

1106
01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:30.160
you,
if I joked about it once when I was younger,

1107
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:35.161
that the amount of work involved to become a standup comedian,

1108
01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:39.820
it's so,
so difficult to go from in the beginning where you just suck too.

1109
01:05:39.821 --> 01:05:41.410
Being a competent standup comedian,

1110
01:05:41.411 --> 01:05:46.210
that the idea of doing it all again is absolutely terrifying.
It's terrifying.

1111
01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:49.240
And I would have never done it if I hit the lottery,

1112
01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:52.090
like I would hit the lottery,
who knows 21 and I have millions of dollars,

1113
01:05:52.091 --> 01:05:54.480
where would my ambition goal,
where would wear?

1114
01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:58.600
And then with that gone also there's like the character lessons,

1115
01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:03.640
then failing and then you know,
awkward moments and in social situations,

1116
01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:04.360
all the different,

1117
01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:08.230
various little bits of information that you use to sort of formulate your own

1118
01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:11.730
personality and view of the world.
Those wouldn't exist,
right?

1119
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.110
They would exist in a completely different form.
Right?

1120
01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.810
Because you wouldn't be struggling to make your way through the world with

1121
01:06:16.811 --> 01:06:18.220
insecurity like most of us have.

1122
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:22.570
You would all sudden have fucking $300 million would be in your underwear,

1123
01:06:22.571 --> 01:06:24.620
in a yacht.
Like you're in a JC video.

1124
01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:30.250
You would just keep going until the wheels fell off.

1125
01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:34.870
<v 6>But the other thing is you wouldn't really have any friends because if you,</v>

1126
01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:38.050
if you,
if you're just a regular person and people hang out with you,

1127
01:06:38.051 --> 01:06:40.450
you can be pretty sure they're hanging out with you because they like hanging

1128
01:06:40.451 --> 01:06:41.300
out with you.
Right.

1129
01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.500
If you just won the lottery and people are hanging out with you on your yacht in

1130
01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:47.680
the year z video,
you know why those people are there.

1131
01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:52.340
<v 5>That's true.
But I've heard that argument before about like being a celebrity,</v>

1132
01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:54.260
like people just like you just because you know,

1133
01:06:54.261 --> 01:06:55.820
how do you know when people actually like you?

1134
01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.730
You can kind of tell when people like it.
Yeah.
But that's,
cause you're,

1135
01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:02.840
you've been through it.
Yeah.
And if you come up in that world,
yeah,

1136
01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:06.410
well you can definitely,
you'll definitely see people that are bullshitting,

1137
01:07:06.411 --> 01:07:09.640
you know,
for sure.
I mean,
if you just won $300 million,
he's going to have,

1138
01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:14.300
you're going to have some good friends,
you know,
how are you?
Oh my God.

1139
01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:18.910
Oh my God.
We would celebrate.
Oh my God.
It.
Next thing you know,

1140
01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.650
someone's trying to fucking look at you like you're a puzzle.

1141
01:07:21.651 --> 01:07:24.010
I kind of figured out a way in this mother fucker and get some,

1142
01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.880
extract some money off of this pitch.

1143
01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:29.630
Now the people will look at you like that if you were some dude who just,

1144
01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.250
especially if you just got lucky,

1145
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:35.360
it's one thing if you're some crazy fuck starts a landscaping business and owns

1146
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:36.910
a hundred different,
you know,

1147
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:39.920
fucking warehouse is filled with lawn mowers and you're sending people out

1148
01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:43.520
everyday.
You know what I mean?
You like plus your ass and then created an empire.

1149
01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:48.090
That's one thing.
Like you respect that guy.
Yeah.

1150
01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.900
People won't immediately,
if they know that you're,
you know,

1151
01:07:50.901 --> 01:07:54.800
Lenny the landscape or king,
they,
they don't,
they don't go after you,

1152
01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.560
but if your some,
you're Lenny the fucking Douche bag.

1153
01:07:57.561 --> 01:07:59.240
It was working in a lottery king.
Yeah.

1154
01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:03.560
He's working at cvs and all of a sudden scratched the right ticket.
Boom.

1155
01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:06.080
They will go after you.
You don't deserve it.
They're like,
fuck that guy.

1156
01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:08.780
You just got to get your money's worth from everyone and that girls,
you know,

1157
01:08:08.781 --> 01:08:10.430
just really used them all day long,

1158
01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:13.520
but it's not girls or they're going to go after you.
It's business people.

1159
01:08:13.850 --> 01:08:16.040
It's a lot of people like,
come,
I got this business,
I'm going

1160
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:16.521
<v 0>to get started.</v>

1161
01:08:16.521 --> 01:08:18.890
You know how many times people would come up to me and want to start a business

1162
01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:22.170
and I'm so,
it's such a ridiculous idea,
but I'm always like,
not,

1163
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:24.690
I'm not going into business with you.
We're not,

1164
01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:27.500
we're not starting a business together.
Like what the fuck are you talking about?

1165
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:32.030
How you might go to a bank pitch,
there's money in there.
They have money.

1166
01:08:32.031 --> 01:08:35.180
You go and you sign out some papers.
You get alone.

1167
01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:40.400
The crazy ass this thing,
years ago,
like 10 years ago,
this guy,

1168
01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:44.180
he didn't win the lottery,
but he inherited like $20 million.

1169
01:08:44.181 --> 01:08:47.330
His parents had a farming business or something that is the lottery,

1170
01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.170
so he inherits $20 million.
He's like 24 years old or something.

1171
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.680
And he gets a few friends together and they fly to Monaco and he's like,

1172
01:08:56.811 --> 01:08:56.931
yeah,

1173
01:08:56.931 --> 01:09:00.200
he's going to celebrate with a wild weekend in Monaco with five or six of his

1174
01:09:00.201 --> 01:09:04.520
friends.
Four days later,
all $20 million was gone.

1175
01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:09.480
Whoa.
Lost it all.
Oh my God.
Days.
Monaco.
Yeah.

1176
01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:14.150
Oh my God.
So they said to him,
how did it happen?
And he said,

1177
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:19.100
well,
gradually at first and suddenly at the end,
oh my God.

1178
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:24.350
Oh my God.
Sums it up,
doesn't it man?
Wow,
that is insanity.

1179
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:27.380
Well,
you can go insane gambling.
That's one of the,
uh,

1180
01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:30.650
the arguments for gambling being illegal.
I do.
I don't support that argument.

1181
01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:35.870
I don't agree with it whatsoever.
I'm a 100% proponent of personal freedom,

1182
01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:38.270
but I'm in personal responsibility.

1183
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.150
But I've seen people get that crazy gambling I,

1184
01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:45.500
and it's a sickness and it's to exploit that sickness.
It's like,
I mean,

1185
01:09:45.501 --> 01:09:48.590
it's akin to having sex with a girl is passed out for being drunk.

1186
01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.880
That's exploiting that.
It really all exploding the Gambler,

1187
01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:57.110
right?
Who's that sick and over the end.

1188
01:09:57.110 --> 01:10:00.230
And just like letting him continue to gamble.
Like someone needs to come.

1189
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:04.310
I'm not aiming.
No,
because I believe in personal responsibility.
No,

1190
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:06.290
but realistically,

1191
01:10:06.291 --> 01:10:10.790
if you were like eve had any ethics whatsoever and he saw some guys about to bet

1192
01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:15.620
$20 million,
you know,
he would go,
hey,
hey,
yeah,

1193
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:20.420
this is not a good time.
Okay,
you moved to my neighborhood,
my friends Tom down.

1194
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:21.510
Okay,

1195
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:25.340
I need one thing to play a little black Jack thousand dollar hand here or there.

1196
01:10:25.341 --> 01:10:28.130
Let's get crazy and give yourself a fucking women.

1197
01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.700
You're about to lose $20 million in a day.
Uh,
stop it.

1198
01:10:32.150 --> 01:10:36.710
So it sounds to me like you've got the same sort of career ambitions I have.

1199
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:37.640
What does that,

1200
01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:42.640
which is to hang out with really wealthy people and help them not fuck up.

1201
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:49.670
I mean,
I had this dream of like,
I was going to be like the psychiatrist too,

1202
01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:53.450
you know,
like I'll just,
I'll be a psych nurse psychologist too.
Like,
you know,

1203
01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:57.260
movies.
George Clooney would be much better off if I would hang out at his house.

1204
01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.310
Know you say that,
and it's kind of a funny thing,
but in,
in other cultures,

1205
01:11:01.311 --> 01:11:03.780
they mean throughout history there's,

1206
01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.880
there have been wise men that hung around great men that her advice.

1207
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:13.010
Yeah,
definitely.
Especially men who are like big

1208
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.280
<v 5>and,
you know,
and,
and back in the day,
you know,
conquerors even would,
would,</v>

1209
01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:22.230
would have a sit down with scholars and they would discuss certain issues.

1210
01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:26.340
It was like important to sort of be surrounded by people like that.

1211
01:11:26.341 --> 01:11:28.560
But in this sort of society,

1212
01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:31.890
it's sort of gone the way of the Shaman that there's no Shamans,

1213
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.710
there's no scholars in your midst.
Just know,
you know,

1214
01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:38.670
just intellectual that you keep handy.
Now we have Google,

1215
01:11:38.671 --> 01:11:43.020
we don't need that guy anymore.
Right.
But,
but,
but wisdom,
you know,

1216
01:11:43.021 --> 01:11:47.610
and especially wisdom and response to personal issues.
Yeah.
Right.

1217
01:11:47.611 --> 01:11:52.110
We have it.
I guess personal coaching is sort of got away.

1218
01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:56.880
Yeah.
No,
no,
seriously.
I'm talking about the modern rendition,
you know,

1219
01:11:56.881 --> 01:12:00.100
like people who are your personal code,
like life coaches,
life coaches.

1220
01:12:00.101 --> 01:12:04.500
Here's my example with a life coach.
There was a guy who was a,

1221
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:08.310
I am fascinated by um,

1222
01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:13.490
women who always successful women who always date losers and a,

1223
01:12:13.591 --> 01:12:17.880
I've seen quite a few examples of it.
It's really fascinating to me,
you know,

1224
01:12:17.881 --> 01:12:22.750
to watch this weird dynamic when there's a really successful woman and a guy who

1225
01:12:22.751 --> 01:12:27.150
who's essentially a fuck up just to total fuckup.
Well this guy was a,

1226
01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:31.110
he was a nanny to this really successful woman,
a male nanny.

1227
01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:34.650
And my friend who like knows the family was like,

1228
01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:37.920
what the fuck is that?
Oh that's not going to end well of course,

1229
01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:38.730
doesn't that unwell?

1230
01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:42.180
She winds up dumping her boyfriend and hooking up with a male nanny.

1231
01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:45.570
So then the male nanny is living in the house,

1232
01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.180
like the big house where he was like taking care of the kids.

1233
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:53.330
He's the boyfriend now and now he's a life coach and Hellboy out of nowhere the

1234
01:12:54.361 --> 01:12:57.510
nannies,
a fucking life coach.
And I'm like,
Whoa,

1235
01:12:57.511 --> 01:13:00.480
like there's some fuckery of foot.
And now that household,

1236
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:02.670
this someone is just like,

1237
01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:07.230
that's like a guy who like essentially like a two or three steps removed from

1238
01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:12.231
being a con artist and he's managed to fit himself into this semi legit

1239
01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:17.550
situation where he's got this for poor,
confused rich lady.

1240
01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:21.210
So is he coaching his clients to get jobs,

1241
01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:23.670
families for poor kids are for rich ladies.

1242
01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:28.700
I've resisted getting close to them in like conversations at parties and stuff

1243
01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:33.090
like that because I don't trust myself.
I don't trust my sexually.
No,

1244
01:13:33.091 --> 01:13:37.590
but I like a chimpanzee rage.
You might say something.
I made freaked out.
I might,

1245
01:13:37.591 --> 01:13:40.600
uh,
uh,
he's,
he's gross.
I,

1246
01:13:40.601 --> 01:13:43.830
I've had a conversation with the guy wants before and it was just like,
whoa.

1247
01:13:43.831 --> 01:13:45.960
Like he's just,
he's just gross.

1248
01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:50.180
It's just speaking of chimpanzee rage or do want to continue on and how gross

1249
01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:53.480
that was.
Just going to say it.
There's like certain people you talk to and um,

1250
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:54.900
they're like,
uh,
uh,

1251
01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:59.820
if you ever like been around someone who literally was like a Hollywood

1252
01:13:59.821 --> 01:14:02.160
character,
like in a movie,

1253
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:06.090
we're like literally just like completely fake.

1254
01:14:06.091 --> 01:14:07.920
Like if pulling your pants down to the crack,

1255
01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:11.920
your ass was in there going to do it.
Yeah.
That was this guy.

1256
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.190
And he's just like this,
it was like this,
almost like a,
a,

1257
01:14:15.191 --> 01:14:18.320
an alien that was taking on the form of a human,
you know,

1258
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:23.530
he was so Hollywood.
I mean he had the,
he had like everything you could ask for.

1259
01:14:23.531 --> 01:14:27.880
He had beads,
like wouldn't beat it.
Necklace and you know,
it was Harrison,

1260
01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:32.000
a ponytail.
I wanted to throw him through the universe.

1261
01:14:32.710 --> 01:14:34.060
It was just everything about him.

1262
01:14:34.061 --> 01:14:36.410
And then the fact that I found out that this guy had a hookup,

1263
01:14:36.450 --> 01:14:39.340
<v 4>dealt with the lady.
And then you're friends with the lady?
No,</v>

1264
01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.950
I don't know the lady at all.
No,
no.
The,
the,
the ladies,

1265
01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:44.010
it's just this old broad that we know

1266
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:50.240
Angela Lansbury was older than him.
She's old enough.
She looks,

1267
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:53.430
there's a lot to this story that I'm going to have to get personal if I keep

1268
01:14:53.431 --> 01:14:57.330
going any further.
I don't want it.
Yeah,
that's all right Rick.
He's a good guy.

1269
01:14:57.331 --> 01:15:01.350
I feel terrible.
Something Ricky was on the pocket.
I never think,
I never,

1270
01:15:01.351 --> 01:15:04.920
I've never included his name until right now.
When I told that story,

1271
01:15:04.921 --> 01:15:07.290
he would tell that story.
It's writing.
I just don't want it.

1272
01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:10.200
And he would laugh about how his wife would never let him read that.
Yeah.
I mean,

1273
01:15:10.201 --> 01:15:13.290
I had a great time talk.
That's why it was memorable.
It's like,
wow,

1274
01:15:13.291 --> 01:15:13.981
this guy is cool.

1275
01:15:13.981 --> 01:15:17.160
And he was going to come play poker with us and like do this basketball thing

1276
01:15:17.161 --> 01:15:18.420
and he was going to come,
let's go.

1277
01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.610
I didn't care if we don't do the project together,
but why didn't he call me?

1278
01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:25.530
And his wife's a wonderful lady.
She just,
she's just got her thing,
you know,

1279
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:29.750
everybody's got their shit together.
It works.
I'm not judging some,

1280
01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:34.770
you're talking about reactions to the book,
right?
Brian?

1281
01:15:34.771 --> 01:15:37.670
Brian's girlfriend who didn't like the book,
right?
Um,

1282
01:15:37.710 --> 01:15:39.030
or didn't like the idea of the moon.

1283
01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:42.980
We've had so many really personal responses to the,

1284
01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:46.560
it's so people either,
you know,
they respond to it positively or negatively,

1285
01:15:46.561 --> 01:15:49.590
but it's very personal.
Sexuality is very personal.

1286
01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:54.080
The idea that,
um,
you're fucked up because you're,

1287
01:15:54.081 --> 01:15:55.840
you're attracted to other people.
Right.
That's,

1288
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:58.860
that's very personal too because it's sort of a secret that a lot of people

1289
01:15:58.861 --> 01:16:03.360
harbor around inside them.
Sure,
sure.
Some people,
women have written,

1290
01:16:03.361 --> 01:16:05.150
it was lots of women,
uh,

1291
01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:10.200
to say that they had to stop every 10 pages and masturbate.
Oh,

1292
01:16:10.201 --> 01:16:14.160
what a good girl.
Yeah.
What a good girl.
Yeah.
I did not see that one coming,

1293
01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:17.580
so to speak.
Wow.
I never fantasize that by the way,

1294
01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:21.960
they also masturbate while watching Max and rules while they're eating cheerios.

1295
01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:25.250
It was a freak bitch.
It's every 10 minutes,
no matter what they're doing.

1296
01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:25.990
This is what,

1297
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:29.720
this one in a million that have just liked that period no matter what that,
um,

1298
01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.100
uh,
exactly.
That's,
uh,
it's,
it's such a,

1299
01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:37.320
<v 5>an interesting subject because of that fact because of the fact that our society</v>

1300
01:16:37.321 --> 01:16:40.630
is set up to sort of um,

1301
01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:43.370
create this image that gives us these,

1302
01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:47.990
these positive sort of feelings inside of our brain when we watched them in a

1303
01:16:47.991 --> 01:16:50.930
movie or on a television show or even hear about them in a song,

1304
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:53.120
but they don't necessarily represent reality.

1305
01:16:53.121 --> 01:16:56.630
But our brain is not set up for the media.

1306
01:16:56.631 --> 01:16:59.960
Our brain is not set up for the influence of television or a movie.

1307
01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:04.640
Our brain is set up to imitate successful behavior and we're selling,
we're,

1308
01:17:04.641 --> 01:17:07.310
we're,
we're set up to sort of learn from our environment.

1309
01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:12.820
But we have this new now and it's 60 feet high and the fucking words are perfect

1310
01:17:13.761 --> 01:17:17.480
because a team of writers worked on what Brad Pitt was going to say for like two

1311
01:17:17.481 --> 01:17:18.950
weeks before he actually said it.

1312
01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:24.190
I mean it was like really meticulously done down to the exact comma and then

1313
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:26.030
it's music is playing.

1314
01:17:26.031 --> 01:17:30.890
Why saying the perfect thing and your version of reality all of a sudden has a

1315
01:17:30.891 --> 01:17:33.710
new model and your version is based on bullshit.

1316
01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:38.730
Sandra Bullock's life was not a Sandra Bullock movie.
Right.

1317
01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:42.830
Think about how every Sandra Bullock movie is like this sweet thing and you
know,

1318
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:45.830
monogamy rules and it all works out in the end.
Me and mom,

1319
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:49.730
she was married to Jessie fucking James Guy with tattoos all over his body.

1320
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:52.240
He was banging and everything like a savage.

1321
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:55.700
It's like your friend with the old lady,
your friend.
Sorry.

1322
01:17:57.350 --> 01:18:00.800
He was using Sandra boot company.
No,
I bet he really loved her.

1323
01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:05.180
I bet he's a damaged dude and a bet.
He really loves pussy.
I bet that too.
Yeah.

1324
01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:08.440
I don't think he was using it.
I don't know though.
I don't assume.
I know.

1325
01:18:08.441 --> 01:18:11.780
It's like that's why people hated him because he was like some unknown guy who

1326
01:18:11.781 --> 01:18:15.740
was screwing the soup.
Everybody's baby.
You know,
everybody probably liked him.

1327
01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:19.400
You know,
she probably liked it.
I mean she couldn't,
when you like a guy,

1328
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:22.260
even if he's like a deceptive guy,
like that guy,
he's just,

1329
01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:25.850
there's obviously something about him that she must have liked and what she

1330
01:18:25.851 --> 01:18:29.960
must've enjoyed his company couldn't have all been fake.
I mean,

1331
01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:33.310
you can say it was,
but what is it?
Okay when,

1332
01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:36.680
but someone's inspired around a person,
they act differently or act better.

1333
01:18:36.681 --> 01:18:38.780
Is that fake too?
I mean,
there's a you,

1334
01:18:38.781 --> 01:18:42.780
are you a fake because you're better or you fake because you know you like

1335
01:18:42.781 --> 01:18:47.120
someone so much that you aspire to be kinder around them,
are nicer around them.

1336
01:18:47.121 --> 01:18:49.640
Is that,
I don't know if that's fake and I,
I don't know the dude,

1337
01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:54.380
but I know that her life,
you know,
her movies were all these really beautiful,

1338
01:18:54.381 --> 01:18:57.950
sweet movies that give you a warm feeling that it's all going to work out.

1339
01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:00.890
And then her whole life was,
that life was,
she was,

1340
01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:04.970
he was fucking that crazy girl with their fucking tat was tattooed on her

1341
01:19:04.971 --> 01:19:08.130
forehead.
We talked about it yesterday.
We thought she,

1342
01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:12.320
you thought she had Nazi tattoos,
but there's just no egos.
No,
she did.
No,

1343
01:19:12.321 --> 01:19:13.920
she has WP on her leg

1344
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:18.170
<v 4>right here on her,
her,
uh,
on her throat.
She has the little Nazi symbol and yeah,</v>

1345
01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.900
there was like a lot of people that found photos of it.
Oh really?
Okay.

1346
01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:23.360
That might not be real.
You got to be careful about that shit.

1347
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:24.470
You can't show you cute.

1348
01:19:24.471 --> 01:19:28.340
It's funny that the swastika used to be like a symbol of good luck still is in

1349
01:19:28.341 --> 01:19:33.320
Tibet and Nepal.
They still use it now.
That's a bold,
yeah.
I saw this guy,

1350
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:36.770
uh,
in Bangkok,
first time I was in Bangkok in the late eighties,

1351
01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:40.940
this guy tie guy wanted to open a bar that would attract tourists cause you can

1352
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.620
make more money from tourists obviously.

1353
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:47.600
So he's looking in old life magazines to try to get a motif that foreigners

1354
01:19:47.601 --> 01:19:52.240
would relate to.
And he came across a photos of the Nazis.
Uh,

1355
01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:55.070
he,
he didn't know what was going on.
He didn't know about World War II.

1356
01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:58.340
He was like completely out of touch with us.
But he liked the imagery.

1357
01:19:58.850 --> 01:20:01.340
So he did up his bar and all this Nazi images.

1358
01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:04.420
<v 5>Oh,
not not thinking it was</v>

1359
01:20:04.450 --> 01:20:06.960
<v 4>going to attract the foreigners.
Right.
Cause he was in this foreign</v>

1360
01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.630
<v 0>opening night did not go as planned.</v>

1361
01:20:12.690 --> 01:20:15.990
It's crazy because you can go back far enough and you can rock that.

1362
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.580
Like you could get Gingiss con shit and put it all.

1363
01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:22.200
Nobody would have to do all in with that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1364
01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:26.250
You could go back to like Alexander the Great,
you know,
if you could find like,

1365
01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:28.950
you know some Alexander the great memorabilia,

1366
01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.730
but if you have any Nazi memorabilia in your house,
that's a no,
no,
that's a no,

1367
01:20:32.731 --> 01:20:35.460
no.
You can't have anything.
You can't have a hat,
a gun,

1368
01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:37.290
you can't have anything with an ass ass.

1369
01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:41.550
You can't have anything like it's too quick.
It's too,
you know,

1370
01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:45.300
even though it was 1947 or whatever it was when it ended still too close.

1371
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:49.440
I mean you mentioned chimp rage earlier and it reminded me of something I was

1372
01:20:49.441 --> 01:20:51.810
thinking when I was watching your special,
which by the way,

1373
01:20:51.811 --> 01:20:53.220
I'm sure you don't need me to plug it,

1374
01:20:53.221 --> 01:20:57.240
but anyone who hasn't downloaded that thing should not consider themselves a

1375
01:20:57.241 --> 01:21:01.950
true fan.
Fantastic.
Thank you man.
I'm glad.
It was really,
really good.

1376
01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:06.120
Thank you.
Um,
and,
and then of course I put it up on bittorrent.
Yeah.

1377
01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:10.830
Throw it out there.
It's great.
Our magazine and it shows that Jesse James,

1378
01:21:11.010 --> 01:21:13.950
Mr [inaudible] with the swastika.
Oh,

1379
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:18.090
is that really a swastika in the center of that bird wears it on her neck.
Oh,

1380
01:21:18.091 --> 01:21:22.170
right.
Let's close up.
Oh,
wow.
That's dark.
Ooh,

1381
01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:26.190
that's a really painful place,
right,
to get a tattoo.
Right.
Well,

1382
01:21:26.191 --> 01:21:30.050
she's got one on her forehead,
man.
Yeah.
Other than that,

1383
01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:35.060
just kind of on a dirty way.
You're,
um,

1384
01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:38.250
but my,
my point being that we have these,
uh,
you know,

1385
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:41.150
where I started before this,
the,
we have these,

1386
01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:44.610
a reward system set up for being hunters and gatherers and they're sort of

1387
01:21:44.611 --> 01:21:49.440
hijacked by movies and TV.
And when something comes along,

1388
01:21:49.441 --> 01:21:51.630
like your book where it,
uh,

1389
01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:56.900
pretty much just factually breaks down the history of sexuality.

1390
01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:00.510
And what I thought was really interesting is one of the things about the word

1391
01:22:00.570 --> 01:22:03.210
promiscuous and the origins of the word promiscuous,

1392
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:08.820
it meant mixed and that we look at it as some sort of loose morals and some we

1393
01:22:08.821 --> 01:22:13.821
have attached to this sort of judgment to it and when in fact the idea of

1394
01:22:14.371 --> 01:22:18.780
promiscuity of today fucking strangers really didn't even exist in these

1395
01:22:18.781 --> 01:22:21.270
cultures.
Right.
Everybody knew each other.

1396
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:24.660
That gets us back to where we were saying earlier about numbers they get,

1397
01:22:24.661 --> 01:22:27.420
it kind of does come down to raw numbers.
At a certain point.

1398
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:32.220
You remember Robin Dunbar's number?
Did you get to that one 50 right?
Yeah,

1399
01:22:32.221 --> 01:22:35.160
I'd heard about that before actually.
They talked about it on the podcast,

1400
01:22:35.170 --> 01:22:37.980
but I have a real issue with remembering people's names.
Right.
I can,

1401
01:22:37.981 --> 01:22:42.930
I can recall crazy shit from fights that happened 15 years ago while we're
Brian.

1402
01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:46.980
I have a really good retention of information,
but at a certain point in time,

1403
01:22:46.981 --> 01:22:49.860
like I ran out of room for people's names and I felt it.

1404
01:22:49.861 --> 01:22:54.390
I actually felt it happen right now where it's like,
and people will,

1405
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.050
you'll,

1406
01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:57.540
you'll meet someone you don't remember what their fucking name is and then they

1407
01:22:57.541 --> 01:22:58.540
tell you and then all their,

1408
01:22:58.541 --> 01:23:02.070
their file pops up again like it was on temporary delete and you'll all of a

1409
01:23:02.071 --> 01:23:06.140
sudden you have access.
Oh yeah,
you're Billy's brother.
Okay.
And then all

1410
01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:08.140
<v 5>of his file like fills back in.</v>

1411
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:12.190
And do you like forget people's names as you're hearing them?

1412
01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:15.490
Like at a party or something?
I said to,
unless I'm paying attention,

1413
01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:17.680
I try not to do that because it's rude,
you know?

1414
01:23:17.710 --> 01:23:19.900
Does that weird thing that happens when you,
you know,

1415
01:23:19.901 --> 01:23:22.360
you're at a party and you're meeting like 10 people and it's like,

1416
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:26.290
it's overloaded.
It's really hard to like put them all into a file,
you know,

1417
01:23:26.291 --> 01:23:29.020
almost want to write it down.
Okay.
Bob,
assume you're saying,
okay.
Yeah,

1418
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:32.560
take a picture of your box.
Okay.
Thank you.
There's an APP for that day.

1419
01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.920
Then he'd be like looking at his phone when he came back to talk to you.
Oh yeah,

1420
01:23:35.921 --> 01:23:39.730
yeah,
yeah.
Mom,
pick up where we left off.
Yeah.

1421
01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:43.240
Can I take notes on our conversation?
Just so you,
but you're the NASA guy.
Okay.

1422
01:23:43.630 --> 01:23:46.450
Yeah.
I was saying earlier that when I was watching your show,

1423
01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:51.580
I was thinking about something and maybe you can respond to it like you watching

1424
01:23:51.581 --> 01:23:55.750
you like the way you prowl onstage.
I had this,
I thought,
man,

1425
01:23:55.780 --> 01:24:00.010
that's a comedian who could kick my ass.
And I don't,

1426
01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:03.250
I can't think of any other comedian who I've re,
you know,

1427
01:24:03.251 --> 01:24:07.720
are there tough comedians?
I don't know.
I really,
comedians are Sorta,
you know,

1428
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:11.740
I thought,
um,
and when I first started working for the UFC,
I thought it would,

1429
01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:15.250
I never brought it up on stage and I thought maybe this was like,

1430
01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:18.460
we're really good if people don't know about this.
Like on stage,
I never,

1431
01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:21.700
never on stage have ever talked about martial arts or anything that I've ever

1432
01:24:21.701 --> 01:24:26.580
done.
Like physically,
right.
Until the UFC became so big.
Like in the,

1433
01:24:26.581 --> 01:24:29.170
uh,
the,
the mid two thousands,
after like 2005,

1434
01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:32.680
it was sort of inevitable at that point.
But before then,

1435
01:24:32.681 --> 01:24:36.300
like I would never talk about martial arts on stage it and the humor Da.
Yeah,

1436
01:24:36.301 --> 01:24:40.660
yeah.
Because I looked like a meathead anyway.
You know,
I just,
I,
you know,
I look,

1437
01:24:40.661 --> 01:24:43.570
if I didn't know me and I would guess like what would come out of my mouth,

1438
01:24:43.571 --> 01:24:45.580
I'd be like,
this fucking idiot.
What's he going to talk about?

1439
01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:49.090
Protein or we can talk about,
well how much creatine you take.
Stupid would,

1440
01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:50.980
I would,
I would make fun of myself.

1441
01:24:50.981 --> 01:24:55.981
So it's automatic that I think people make fun of me or that they would discount

1442
01:24:56.171 --> 01:25:00.580
me as a comedian,
you know?
But that's just the way I look.
Like,
you know,

1443
01:25:00.581 --> 01:25:03.580
it's nothing I can do about it.
My interests have always been in martial arts.

1444
01:25:03.581 --> 01:25:04.414
I can't help it.
I mean,

1445
01:25:04.810 --> 01:25:09.670
I'm still completely fascinated and dedicated to the art of standup comedy.

1446
01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:12.190
I love doing it.
It's my favorite thing to do on in life.

1447
01:25:12.490 --> 01:25:14.890
But I like martial arts too.
Like why?

1448
01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:18.490
It's a weird thing we're supposed to like hide that in some way.

1449
01:25:18.491 --> 01:25:20.080
But as a comedian,
I think you've,

1450
01:25:20.081 --> 01:25:23.440
you've transcended it watches what I noticed and it's like,
wow,

1451
01:25:23.441 --> 01:25:27.490
there's something inherently contradictory about,
yeah,
a tough,

1452
01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:31.360
you know,
type a Alpha male comedian.

1453
01:25:32.010 --> 01:25:34.710
It's not funny cause that's a guy,
you know,
that it's,

1454
01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.770
there are two roles in conflict.
Well,
you pull it off and somehow or another,

1455
01:25:38.771 --> 01:25:40.390
it will also like people.
Um,

1456
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:44.260
the beautiful thing about having a podcast like this is the podcast popularity

1457
01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:48.790
came right after the UFC,
his popularity and with the podcast,
essentially,

1458
01:25:48.791 --> 01:25:51.910
there's nowhere to hide.
This is who you are,
right?
When they talk,

1459
01:25:51.911 --> 01:25:54.100
when you're talking for four hours,
or what did we do yesterday,

1460
01:25:54.101 --> 01:25:57.190
four and a half hours with Bert Kreischer,
everybody knows who you are.
That's,

1461
01:25:57.191 --> 01:26:00.250
that's you.
You're that guy.
You're that guy as good or bad.
You know,

1462
01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:03.770
at that point they're hanging out with you.
Yes.
It's not edited.
Right.

1463
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:07.900
Do you have a friend?
Like I have a friend,
my friend John Rollo and John Rawls,

1464
01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:08.391
great guy,

1465
01:26:08.391 --> 01:26:10.610
but he's one of the scariest fucking human beings you've ever seen in your

1466
01:26:10.611 --> 01:26:14.750
fucking life.
He's,
he's built at least about 300 pounds of solid muscle.

1467
01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:16.340
It's ridiculously big guy.

1468
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:21.470
And honest chest has a tattoo of an angel choking a devil unconscious.

1469
01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:24.920
Okay.
And then he's a frightening man.

1470
01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:29.090
His arms or I'm not bullshitting.
There's maybe three.
You've seen John Rollo,

1471
01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.700
but three of my arms,
his arms are probably like three of my arms.

1472
01:26:31.701 --> 01:26:34.250
And he's a Brazilian jujitsu black belt was his big giant dude.

1473
01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:38.660
But everybody who knows him when you're around him,
he's a sweetie.

1474
01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:42.740
He's got like a bunch of cats and he said the gentlest guy you'd ever want to be

1475
01:26:42.741 --> 01:26:46.160
around.
So when you're around them and he's saying funny shit,

1476
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:50.030
you laugh because you know John.
But if you met John at a restaurant,

1477
01:26:50.031 --> 01:26:53.250
he started laughing.
He's like,
is he laughing before he just fucking snaps,

1478
01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:56.060
kills everybody in this place.
You know what I'm saying?

1479
01:26:56.061 --> 01:26:57.350
Like once you get to know him,

1480
01:26:57.351 --> 01:27:01.070
then it doesn't matter that this big giant scary dude,
he's just John,
you know,

1481
01:27:01.071 --> 01:27:01.970
just hanging with John.

1482
01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:06.810
So I think that is allowed me to sneak in because I,
I,

1483
01:27:07.190 --> 01:27:10.370
I did other things because of a fear factor.
UFC stuff.

1484
01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:11.840
People got to know me already,

1485
01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:16.070
so they like accepted a certain amount of the weird,
you know,
but yeah,

1486
01:27:16.071 --> 01:27:17.870
as a comedian you're sort of always thought like,

1487
01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.260
you don't want to go Joe Polish kapow style.
Right.

1488
01:27:20.290 --> 01:27:23.450
Joe Piscopo was like on the cover of muscle and fitness,
fucking flexing.

1489
01:27:23.451 --> 01:27:25.580
And that was like the end.
Really.
Like everybody's like,

1490
01:27:25.581 --> 01:27:28.960
you can't be like a bodybuilder and be funny and like get Outta here.
So,

1491
01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:30.211
<v 6>well,
you know,
I mean,</v>

1492
01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:33.640
it's interesting because maybe one of the reasons I noticed it,
as I said to you,

1493
01:27:33.641 --> 01:27:36.070
I was living,
I had been living in Spain for 20 years,
right.

1494
01:27:36.071 --> 01:27:40.110
So I didn't know anything about fear factor or UFC or none of that stuff is like

1495
01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.490
on my radar.
Right.
I'm in Barcelona,
I don't,

1496
01:27:42.491 --> 01:27:46.570
I don't have and I don't have cable or whatever.
Um,
so yeah,

1497
01:27:46.571 --> 01:27:49.240
it was like seeing it all for the first time.
It was interesting.
Yeah.

1498
01:27:49.570 --> 01:27:53.780
Well you doing in Spain for 20 years growing weed.
That's it.

1499
01:27:53.950 --> 01:27:58.930
Just growing weed in Spain.
I'm joking.
Uh,
uh,
lots of different things.
You know,

1500
01:27:58.931 --> 01:28:03.880
it was teaching some English.
I was a translating editing.
Um,

1501
01:28:03.970 --> 01:28:07.720
I worked as an inhouse translator and editor for the biggest porn company in the

1502
01:28:07.721 --> 01:28:10.840
world for awhile.
They're based in Barcelona.
Yeah.

1503
01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:14.080
I had a Gig as a interpreting from ebonics to English,

1504
01:28:14.081 --> 01:28:18.890
if you can believe that for a film festival.
Yeah.
In term like some lighter job

1505
01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:22.340
<v 5>plain,
like the lady on airplanes.
I speak jive.
Exactly.</v>

1506
01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:27.940
It's exactly,
that's it.
That's a Gig that's on my resume,
man.
Yeah.
Wow.

1507
01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:31.320
That's crazy.
That's a,
that's so fascinating gig.
Yeah.

1508
01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:34.710
<v 6>Well they're the way.
And then what did you have to interpret?
Like people?
Yeah.</v>

1509
01:28:35.190 --> 01:28:39.690
What happened was,
uh,
there's this film festival called in Edit and uh,
it's,

1510
01:28:39.691 --> 01:28:44.360
it's independent films,
right?
So this one year they were doing,
uh,

1511
01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:48.270
focusing on films about the origins of rock and roll,
rock and roll,

1512
01:28:48.271 --> 01:28:52.360
jazz blues in the Delta,
right.
So like old time,
Delta Guitarists,

1513
01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:55.710
Delta Blues Guitars,
and also the origins of hip hop in Brooklyn.

1514
01:28:55.711 --> 01:29:00.711
In the 70s and so they had a team of like 20 Spanish translators who great and

1515
01:29:01.561 --> 01:29:01.980
understood

1516
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.470
<v 4>English very well,
but they couldn't understand these black people.</v>

1517
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:09.930
<v 6>So,
so first they call up this black dude who was friends with,</v>

1518
01:29:09.931 --> 01:29:13.160
with one of the translators and he listened to the stuff and he couldn't

1519
01:29:13.161 --> 01:29:15.770
understand either because he's British.
So,

1520
01:29:15.771 --> 01:29:18.980
so the one day I get this call from my friend Pinky,
she's like,
Chris,

1521
01:29:18.981 --> 01:29:20.360
do you understand black people?

1522
01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:24.420
And I had had a black girlfriend for a while.

1523
01:29:24.421 --> 01:29:27.440
I thought she meant on some conceptual level,
you know,
like so

1524
01:29:29.410 --> 01:29:33.850
it's like,
yeah,
I guess I'm a Shitty Dancer,
but I understand that.

1525
01:29:33.851 --> 01:29:36.290
Did you drink like Colt 45 essential,

1526
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:40.050
wait the process and get into the role and moving join go.
Yeah.
What's up?

1527
01:29:40.670 --> 01:29:42.890
I'm a method translator now.

1528
01:29:42.891 --> 01:29:46.640
So she gave me the DVDs and all I had to do was just watch the DVD and they

1529
01:29:46.641 --> 01:29:49.040
would like,
okay,
in this part,
what's he saying there?
And he's like,
Yo,

1530
01:29:49.041 --> 01:29:53.870
I'm up my crib man.
Like yeah,
we're going back to my apartment.
Oh,
okay,
good.

1531
01:29:53.871 --> 01:29:57.110
And then they do the Spanish.
So I didn't even have to go into Spanish.

1532
01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:02.270
That is hilarious.
That's really funny.
Wow.
Yeah.

1533
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:03.071
I've had lots of,

1534
01:30:03.071 --> 01:30:06.530
did you ever think of just like throwing in some fake translation is to fuck

1535
01:30:06.531 --> 01:30:09.200
with them,
just to be silly and get bored with it?

1536
01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:13.210
<v 4>Yeah.
No,
no.
I was,
I did a good job.
That's hilarious.</v>

1537
01:30:13.330 --> 01:30:17.630
So you were over there for 20 years,
did you,
I mean,
everybody says don't,

1538
01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:21.910
I'm still over there officially.
Oh,
you really,
you just visiting here.

1539
01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:26.560
It's more or less.
I'm,
I'm basically,
I mean,
it sounds so Hollywood,
man.

1540
01:30:26.561 --> 01:30:30.240
I'm here to pitch a TV.
Show that to sound a little [inaudible].
I'm gonna lie.

1541
01:30:30.290 --> 01:30:31.640
Yeah.
I'm going to,

1542
01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.350
I'm going to get some beads and put my hair in a ponytail.

1543
01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:40.750
I'm going for it.
Uh,
what's the TV show about?
Can you say about sexuality,

1544
01:30:41.210 --> 01:30:45.760
sex drive?
Is it like one of those history channel shows?
Well,
I mean,

1545
01:30:45.761 --> 01:30:46.600
we'll see what happens.

1546
01:30:46.601 --> 01:30:51.601
But the idea channel show is I developed a show in Vancouver this summer with

1547
01:30:52.731 --> 01:30:56.400
the friend.
A guy you might know actually,
or at least did you see?
Um,

1548
01:30:56.530 --> 01:31:00.280
I am Bruce Lee.
Yes.
He's the director of that.
Okay.
What's his name?

1549
01:31:00.281 --> 01:31:04.810
Pete Mccormick.
He also did a great film on Muhammad Ali called facing Holly.

1550
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:08.860
Have you seen that?
That saw the all the guys who will ollifont talk about him?

1551
01:31:08.861 --> 01:31:11.850
Exactly.
I heard about it,
but again,
I can't really depresses me.

1552
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:15.280
Watch an old boxer slur depresses the shit out of me.

1553
01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:19.970
I really have a problem with it.
Any,
any old athlete,
that's all got issues.

1554
01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:23.380
It really bothers me.
So I didn't watch it.
It's a great film.

1555
01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:28.390
It's really moving actual beds.
That's very touching because it's,
you know,

1556
01:31:28.391 --> 01:31:31.930
you go into it thinking or I went into it thinking,
okay,
it's about boxing.

1557
01:31:31.931 --> 01:31:36.610
It's about macho tough ass guys.
It's not man.
It's about love.

1558
01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:41.290
It's about charity.
I mean,
Ali,
you still like set up some of the fights,

1559
01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:46.090
like the,
not,
not the main contender fights,
but between the title bouts.

1560
01:31:46.090 --> 01:31:48.100
You know,
where you fight someone for the title,

1561
01:31:48.101 --> 01:31:51.450
but you know the guy gets not going to win.
It's a tuneup match.
Well,
he,

1562
01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:54.940
he scheduled some of those to help dudes out.
Like he heard this one guy,

1563
01:31:55.930 --> 01:31:56.530
I think he's,

1564
01:31:56.530 --> 01:32:01.150
his son had overdosed and his wife committed suicide and he just had this
horror,

1565
01:32:01.151 --> 01:32:05.380
he's gone through this horrible period in his life and Ali would be like,

1566
01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:08.830
get him.
He's,
you know,
line him up,
talked to his people.

1567
01:32:09.150 --> 01:32:12.970
And so he do it to give these guys an infusion to cash.

1568
01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:18.600
And Kenny Norton was like living in his car when he fought Ali wasn't real.
Yeah.

1569
01:32:19.010 --> 01:32:23.280
Yeah.
It's a really good movie,
man.
It's really,
and,
and uh,
Joe Loo,
uh,

1570
01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:27.930
Joe Frazier's,
Joe Louis,
Joe Frazier.
It was like crying at one point.
Wow.

1571
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.800
Talking about Ali.
Wow.
Very interesting pizza.
I said to Pete,

1572
01:32:32.801 --> 01:32:35.410
how did you get,
because you don't hear Pete at all.

1573
01:32:35.410 --> 01:32:39.220
It's just the people being interviewed,
but they're so vulnerable,
man.

1574
01:32:39.250 --> 01:32:41.470
It's really,
it's a beautiful film.
And I said,

1575
01:32:41.471 --> 01:32:45.970
how did you get Joe Frazier to be that open about Ali?
Because he hated Ali,

1576
01:32:46.210 --> 01:32:51.040
you know,
and uh,
and pizza,
you know,
I said to him,
look,
Joe,
you know,
like,

1577
01:32:51.070 --> 01:32:53.830
yeah,
you know,
I know how you feel about the fighting and all that.

1578
01:32:53.831 --> 01:32:58.030
But when you look at Alli now as a man,
just as a man,

1579
01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.610
how do you feel?
What do you think,
you know,

1580
01:33:00.611 --> 01:33:05.560
and that they're not really brought it out of Joe Frazier.
Wow.
Yeah.
It's amazing.

1581
01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:10.510
It must be weird to go and have conversations with someone about a dude that you

1582
01:33:10.511 --> 01:33:13.570
fought this 15 years ago and you're still talking about him,

1583
01:33:13.930 --> 01:33:16.750
and people still want to know about it.
Not even 15 years ago.

1584
01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:18.760
It's really 25 years ago,
whatever it was.

1585
01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:21.880
They thought that was a long fucking time ago.
When,
when did they fight?

1586
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:24.250
They fight in the 70s right?
Yeah.
Well,

1587
01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:27.100
he was fighting from the early sixties I think,

1588
01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:30.070
wasn't he in the Olympics in [inaudible] 62 maybe?

1589
01:33:30.150 --> 01:33:35.050
I think it was 67 to 70 was when they told him all of them.
Yeah.
So,

1590
01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:40.030
yeah.
So,
yeah,
so you're talking about 40 fucking plus years ago.
It's crazy.
Yeah.

1591
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:42.130
And Joe Frazier recently died.
Yeah.

1592
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:46.300
He died within a year of doing that interview.
Wow.
But anyway,

1593
01:33:46.301 --> 01:33:48.400
so I developed the show with,
with,
uh,

1594
01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:53.460
with Pete and the idea of the show is to try to get the same tone of sex at

1595
01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:58.750
dawn.
So it's got some scholarly halfed but it's also fun to,
to,

1596
01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:01.300
you know,
to be there,
like to read it or to be in the show.

1597
01:34:01.301 --> 01:34:05.790
So it's without being juvenile to be playful and,
you know,
an open and,

1598
01:34:06.130 --> 01:34:10.180
but,
uh,
without being BBC professorial to be scholarly.

1599
01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:14.590
So it's like ancient aliens,
but with sex,
you ever see that show?

1600
01:34:14.591 --> 01:34:16.520
I haven't seen that.
Like,

1601
01:34:16.570 --> 01:34:20.670
if aliens squirted the alien scored,
not

1602
01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:25.220
ancient.
You actually turn your microphone on to say that to,

1603
01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:28.360
and at the time of turning in microphone,

1604
01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:32.400
you actually still thought it was a good idea.
Um,
no.
Um,
yeah.

1605
01:34:32.410 --> 01:34:35.970
Ancient aliens is a show.
That's a fascinating show about,
you know,

1606
01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:41.140
the idea of influence of,
uh,
aliens on ancient cultures.
Oh,

1607
01:34:41.170 --> 01:34:42.970
right,
right.
I know most of it,
by the way.

1608
01:34:42.971 --> 01:34:47.620
We should mention it that the guy has that one dude I pass Copans yeah,

1609
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:50.680
yeah.
Unfortunately if you,
uh,

1610
01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:53.530
it was only maybe 40 episodes ago,

1611
01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:57.980
we interviewed him maybe last Phillip Copans and a really nice guy.

1612
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.920
<v 0>Um,
and he,
he uh,
he passed recently.
He's regularly,</v>

1613
01:35:00.921 --> 01:35:05.520
he's an author and he's regularly on,
um,
ancient aliens and unfortunately,

1614
01:35:05.521 --> 01:35:06.710
and he found out he had a,

1615
01:35:06.711 --> 01:35:11.711
a type of very rare type of lung cancer and within one year finding out or a one

1616
01:35:11.991 --> 01:35:16.610
month rather finding out about it,
he was dead.
Wow.
Yeah.
Really scary stuff.

1617
01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:21.040
It was like some kind of bacteria infection or something at first.
Yeah.

1618
01:35:21.370 --> 01:35:25.170
It's apparently pretty rare,
but a really nice guy.
Really unfortunate.

1619
01:35:25.171 --> 01:35:27.920
And the first guy who ever died who do this podcast,

1620
01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:32.150
what's the first one who's done the podcast and off?
Not with us anymore.
Yeah.

1621
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:37.810
Crazy.
Nice guy.
Socks.
It wasn't even 40,
I don't think things are 39 or so.

1622
01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:41.660
<v 5>Oh No.
Oh Shit.
Yeah.
Sorry.</v>

1623
01:35:41.690 --> 01:35:45.410
I was imagining a guy in his seventies or,
yeah,
that would be cool.
Yeah.

1624
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:50.440
But an ancient aliens is a,
it's a really fun show because it's,
you know,
they,

1625
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:54.740
they go the what if route.
Most of the time they get pretty deep.

1626
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:55.710
Like a,

1627
01:35:55.710 --> 01:35:59.720
Giorgio sucralose is one of the main guys and he's a friend of the podcast he's

1628
01:35:59.721 --> 01:36:02.510
been on a few times and he has this fucking be crazy hair.

1629
01:36:02.511 --> 01:36:04.430
I don't know if you've ever seen him.
You wouldn't see them.

1630
01:36:04.431 --> 01:36:08.210
If you're out there in Spain,
hanging out with those sophisticated people that,

1631
01:36:08.211 --> 01:36:11.570
uh,
yeah,
you'll get into this,
this part where it goes,

1632
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:15.650
is it possible?
You know,
that big flood isn't the alien?

1633
01:36:16.530 --> 01:36:17.930
And they'll go deep into the,

1634
01:36:17.931 --> 01:36:21.290
is it possible to see if you're high and you're watching that show?
And he goes,

1635
01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:25.370
is it possible?
You know,
like,
oh my goodness,
where are we going?

1636
01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:28.950
I'm thinking of big foot.
Could be in the and are tall.
Well,

1637
01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:33.200
they're pretty sure that if there ever was a big foot that it's an animal called

1638
01:36:33.201 --> 01:36:38.090
gigantic [inaudible] that did exist.
If you've ever seen the images of it,

1639
01:36:38.091 --> 01:36:42.530
it's pretty fascinating because it was essentially exactly what everybody

1640
01:36:42.531 --> 01:36:47.110
describes.
And describe a Sasquatch and it lived in Asia and uh,

1641
01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:49.670
humans came from Asia.
And we know when we,
when they did the,

1642
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:52.330
one of the ways they found this out was,

1643
01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:56.750
could they did a test in the human genome because a guy who was a Mormon,

1644
01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.700
a devout Mormon,

1645
01:36:58.701 --> 01:37:03.560
was convinced that a DNA testing could prove that the,

1646
01:37:03.561 --> 01:37:05.040
uh,
the Mormon,
uh,
the,

1647
01:37:05.041 --> 01:37:10.041
the book of Mormon was actually in fact correct and that human beings did come

1648
01:37:10.401 --> 01:37:13.190
from Jerusalem and that all these,

1649
01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:15.830
all these American Indians were in the lost tribe of Jesus.

1650
01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:19.490
So they did a DNA test on,
I found,
no,
actually most of them are from Siberia.

1651
01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:22.910
There,
there a lot of what you're getting and you're getting American Indians.

1652
01:37:22.911 --> 01:37:25.970
It's people that came across in the Bering strait.
Sure.
Well,
coincidentally,

1653
01:37:25.971 --> 01:37:30.620
that area of the country is the highest area incidents of bigfoot sightings,

1654
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:35.180
the Pacific northwest,
the upper,
the Alaska,
that whole way down.

1655
01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:38.300
That's the,
the only play.
I'm not the only place in the country,

1656
01:37:38.301 --> 01:37:40.730
but it's like that's where it really started.

1657
01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:43.160
That's where people really started seeing these fucking things.
Right.

1658
01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:45.650
And that's where they would be.
I mean,
it really kinda makes,

1659
01:37:45.651 --> 01:37:48.650
if there really was a,
an undiscovered primate,

1660
01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:51.510
it would be in the rain forest or the Pacific northwest.
Right.

1661
01:37:51.650 --> 01:37:54.980
It's not outside the realm of possibility.
In fact,
even Jane Goodall,

1662
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:56.340
Jane Goodall's convinced,

1663
01:37:56.430 --> 01:38:00.150
<v 0>she actually said she was convinced that there's an undiscovered primate living</v>

1664
01:38:00.151 --> 01:38:02.950
there.
So there's too many people with the same story.
She started slowly.
Yeah,

1665
01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:06.880
I didn't know they have sounds that these things have made,
I dunno,
made me,

1666
01:38:06.881 --> 01:38:08.670
maybe they existed and maybe they died off.

1667
01:38:08.671 --> 01:38:12.360
But if there's a small amount of them,
it's not impossible that they're alive.

1668
01:38:12.690 --> 01:38:15.310
If you stop and think about like how rare it is,
the,

1669
01:38:15.311 --> 01:38:18.660
you see a bear or a mountain lion and then fucking know there's thousands of

1670
01:38:18.661 --> 01:38:21.750
those.
If there was like one area where an animal existed.

1671
01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:25.170
But there's a lot of areas in this country where like it's these,
the only,

1672
01:38:25.171 --> 01:38:27.860
the only place we can find blank.
You know,

1673
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:31.040
it's really hard to find an alligator outside of Florida and you know,
the,

1674
01:38:31.041 --> 01:38:34.440
the south area,
you know,
you don't find alligators too often in Michigan.
Right.

1675
01:38:34.441 --> 01:38:36.990
You know,
that's a,
that's a condensed little area.
Boom.

1676
01:38:36.991 --> 01:38:38.160
There's where all the alligators are.

1677
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:39.750
This is where the climate is perfect for them.

1678
01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:41.400
It's not outside of the realm of possibility.

1679
01:38:41.401 --> 01:38:43.710
There's like a fucking crazy monkey that no one's ever found.

1680
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:48.720
It's most likely not the case.
Most likely people are full of Shit.

1681
01:38:48.721 --> 01:38:50.670
The problem is they're so big,

1682
01:38:50.970 --> 01:38:54.630
they'd be top predators and it would be hard for there to be a sustainable

1683
01:38:54.631 --> 01:38:57.840
population of them in,
in that area.
It's true.
You know?
However,

1684
01:38:57.841 --> 01:39:00.270
we don't know that there,
we don't know that they're carnivores.

1685
01:39:00.330 --> 01:39:03.840
They easily could be plant matter just like elephants are gigantic as well.

1686
01:39:03.841 --> 01:39:07.680
It's still worry about the viable genetic material.
How many of them,

1687
01:39:07.950 --> 01:39:11.280
I mean you think about like deer,
like let's say dear eve,

1688
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:15.690
there's so infrequently you never see them.
Could they continue as a species?

1689
01:39:15.690 --> 01:39:19.910
You know,
we had a less drought from survivor,
man.
What the fuck was that?

1690
01:39:20.570 --> 01:39:23.590
We had less trout from survivor man on,
and he told us a story.
He,

1691
01:39:23.690 --> 01:39:26.180
he's had to bigfoot sightings.
Oh yeah.
What's it,

1692
01:39:26.181 --> 01:39:29.300
what's fascinating about that guy is he's 100% legit.

1693
01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:33.260
He's not full of Shit at all.
And uh,
he didn't actually see it,
but,
uh,

1694
01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:36.770
he was in his tent and he heard something big walking through is in Alaska,

1695
01:39:37.190 --> 01:39:40.610
miles from nowhere.
And it flew in on a plane,
I mean,

1696
01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.300
hours by plane from everywhere,
you know,
and uh,

1697
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:49.040
he heard something bipedal walking through the woods,
something really heavy.

1698
01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:52.640
And then it was like 50 feet from his 10.
It starts going,

1699
01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:54.393
<v 7>Ooh,</v>

1700
01:39:54.670 --> 01:39:58.500
<v 0>it makes us crazy.
Primate noise.
And he struggles to EEG.</v>

1701
01:39:58.610 --> 01:40:01.240
He scrambles to get his camera and then it runs off.

1702
01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:04.360
And so he doesn't know what the fuck it is,
but he knows it was really heavy.

1703
01:40:04.361 --> 01:40:09.040
And it sounded like an ape,
you know,
it's not likely to,

1704
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:12.850
if they haven't found these things.
Footprints.
I don't,
I don't think so.

1705
01:40:12.851 --> 01:40:17.590
I think it was too cold an owl in a tree and some kind of land creature walking

1706
01:40:17.591 --> 01:40:21.730
up to get the owl,
the owl freaks out,
flies away instead of this thing.
And yeah,

1707
01:40:21.731 --> 01:40:25.180
it could be,
but it doesn't sound that loud.
And it doesn't sound like an ape,

1708
01:40:25.530 --> 01:40:29.080
you know,
unless we're there,
it's all,
it's all bullshit.
Who knows?

1709
01:40:29.081 --> 01:40:32.080
He might have had some fucking mushroom that he found under a log and just

1710
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:36.120
trimming the holes off.
I'm not saying that it's,
it's legit,

1711
01:40:36.121 --> 01:40:40.300
but if you see the scientific depiction of a gigantic pith agus pull,

1712
01:40:40.301 --> 01:40:43.390
pull that image of there's,
um,
there's,
there's one online,

1713
01:40:43.391 --> 01:40:47.020
but they have a reproduction of this thing and it lived alongside humans for

1714
01:40:47.021 --> 01:40:50.200
sure the minimum a hundred thousand years ago,

1715
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:54.210
but it could have been alive more than that or sooner than that.
They,

1716
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:59.220
they got photo bones of this thing and like a Chinese medicine shop was the

1717
01:40:59.651 --> 01:41:00.580
first time they found him.

1718
01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:03.730
And like some anthropologists had gotten a hold these bonds,

1719
01:41:03.731 --> 01:41:06.010
like what the fuck is this from?
And they,

1720
01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:09.370
they apparently from there realized that there was a,

1721
01:41:09.371 --> 01:41:13.690
it was a primate tooth and it was a primary tooth that didn't fit with the known

1722
01:41:13.691 --> 01:41:17.610
species.
And so that initiated the search for this animal.
Right.

1723
01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:20.590
But when you see the image of gigantic Pacifica us,
it's,

1724
01:41:20.670 --> 01:41:23.080
it's essentially exactly what a big foot is.

1725
01:41:23.081 --> 01:41:27.430
It's an now where does the aquatic eight fit into all the aquatic ape theory is

1726
01:41:27.431 --> 01:41:30.490
the theory of like that's a gigantic [inaudible],
right?

1727
01:41:30.610 --> 01:41:32.020
I mean that's a real animal.
Okay.

1728
01:41:32.021 --> 01:41:37.021
And that's from how long ago is absolutely a hundred thousand years more

1729
01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:42.100
recently than that.
It gets sketchy.
It,
it's funny,
it looks like an orangutan,

1730
01:41:42.101 --> 01:41:47.101
but I sent him right because it's too heavy to swing from trees and it doesn't

1731
01:41:47.621 --> 01:41:50.080
give a fuck.
You know,

1732
01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:54.400
imagine how strong that thing would be if you stop and think about the fact that

1733
01:41:54.401 --> 01:41:56.490
150 pound champ as,

1734
01:41:56.491 --> 01:41:59.770
as strong as a 500 pound man.

1735
01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:04.900
What is a 2000 pound primate?
What kind of strength is that?
I mean,

1736
01:42:04.901 --> 01:42:08.800
a gorilla can literally rip you apart like tissue paper.
What does,

1737
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:12.460
what can that thing and bloats and ozone and,
yeah,
and it's tough.

1738
01:42:12.490 --> 01:42:16.110
You up it's ass in little pieces.
That's what a gorilla can do.

1739
01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:20.830
Just shred you down into little tampon size pieces and stuff.

1740
01:42:20.831 --> 01:42:24.800
You up his ass,
this thing.
Okay.
Yeah.
It's recently,
um,

1741
01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:29.230
as 100,000 years ago.
That's fact.
But there's,
um,

1742
01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:32.950
there's speculation that they may have lived a much more recent than that.

1743
01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:36.040
There's a lot of different,
you,
you,
you,
I'm sure,
you know,

1744
01:42:36.041 --> 01:42:38.530
there's a lot of different species where they thought it was extinct and they

1745
01:42:38.531 --> 01:42:43.180
found out that,
that there's one coelacanth that crazy fish with the legs.

1746
01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:48.340
It looks like,
it looks like a prehistoric fish.
Weird like extensions to,

1747
01:42:48.341 --> 01:42:52.270
it's like fins pulled one up from in the forties or something.
Yeah.

1748
01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:55.150
And they were like,
oh,
we thought these things were long dead.
But uh,

1749
01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:57.400
it's patently ridiculous when it comes to the ocean.

1750
01:42:57.401 --> 01:43:00.040
There's so little of the ocean that we really have a firm grip on,

1751
01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:02.920
but they found the tooth in,
um,

1752
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:06.700
in 1935 in the apothecary shop.

1753
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:10.930
It was a fossilized bone.
And that's a,
that's the,

1754
01:43:10.931 --> 01:43:12.970
I guess they used them in traditional Chinese medicine.

1755
01:43:13.210 --> 01:43:15.760
So they've been grinding up these fucking bones of this thing forever.

1756
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:19.540
Chinese medicine.
It's hilarious.

1757
01:43:19.541 --> 01:43:24.290
Chinese medicine in the leg or penises bear gallbladders and I mean,

1758
01:43:24.370 --> 01:43:27.830
what is that?
Is that when the shit is that psychological shit,

1759
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:33.310
they're doing area placebo effect and there may be some effect and some things,

1760
01:43:34.151 --> 01:43:38.590
but I mean come on at Tiger Penis isn't gonna make you horny?
Well,
yeah,

1761
01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:40.810
I think it will.
It's um,

1762
01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:45.840
there's so much of that need for faith and belief in fate in the entire Chinese

1763
01:43:46.031 --> 01:43:48.340
culture,
especially in regards to martial arts.

1764
01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:51.680
Like China has been around for,
I mean,

1765
01:43:51.681 --> 01:43:54.360
think about how long Chinese culture that dates back that we understand me

1766
01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:57.150
thousands and thousands of years.
A very sophisticated culture.
Yeah.

1767
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:59.960
They have the most dog shit martial artists in the world.

1768
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:02.750
There are martial arts are almost entirely useless.
Really?
Yeah.

1769
01:44:02.751 --> 01:44:06.290
They have very few martial arts where there's like legitimate techniques that

1770
01:44:06.291 --> 01:44:09.440
would work in a situation against them trained fighter because it hasn't been

1771
01:44:09.441 --> 01:44:13.760
adapted.
They're not good.
They're just like clunky,
like,
like,
like Real Kung Fu.

1772
01:44:13.761 --> 01:44:16.370
Like you're pretending to be like animals and shit like that.

1773
01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:20.050
That is not the way to fight.
It doesn't,
it doesn't work.
You know there's like,

1774
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:24.020
there's like there's established like now because of the ultimate fighting

1775
01:44:24.021 --> 01:44:29.021
championship is very clear parameters of what is and isn't effective against the

1776
01:44:29.181 --> 01:44:31.760
best fighters in the world.
There's just no kung fu in that.

1777
01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:34.580
There's a guy named Roy Nelson,
it says the Kung Foo fighter,

1778
01:44:34.730 --> 01:44:36.110
but really just knocks people out.

1779
01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:38.900
But he's in a lot of Kung fu about fatal blows,

1780
01:44:38.901 --> 01:44:41.510
like ripping your eyes out or taking your,
your throat out.

1781
01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:44.240
Then she doesn't really work.
You can poke people in the eyes.

1782
01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:46.760
Definitely no doubt about it.
He can't really rip someone's throat out.

1783
01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:49.610
You can try.
It's not going to go.
I said,
it's so hard to rip out a throat.

1784
01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:49.971
You know,

1785
01:44:49.971 --> 01:44:53.600
like to think that you're just going to go in there like fucking Billy Jack

1786
01:44:53.601 --> 01:44:56.650
movie or Patrick Swayze at roadhouse.
Right.

1787
01:44:56.770 --> 01:44:58.910
You know that guy's going to be punching in the face while you're holding onto

1788
01:44:58.911 --> 01:45:02.180
his neck.
He keeps not that easy to use crabs on it and I can pull it out.

1789
01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:03.080
Right then.

1790
01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:05.770
The people would be doing that all the time and it'd be like the number one
cost.

1791
01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:10.130
Dad ripped the balls off,
either kick somebody in the balls,
it hurts.

1792
01:45:10.131 --> 01:45:12.390
But if they're filled up with adrenaline,
they're going to still attack you.

1793
01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:15.980
The idea that you're going to debilitate someone by kicking him in the balls if

1794
01:45:15.981 --> 01:45:18.860
he's a pussy,
but it can't survive if someone's trying to kill you.

1795
01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:23.630
I just say you kicked me in the balls I'm debilitated would also never be an

1796
01:45:23.631 --> 01:45:26.390
attacker or similar and would have to care.
Right.
You lost your deck.

1797
01:45:26.391 --> 01:45:29.780
Better chance just tickling the person in with a chance thing that ticklish.

1798
01:45:29.810 --> 01:45:32.570
Yeah man.
A lot of people,
I think probably if you were a,

1799
01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:35.780
if you were trying to tickle them they would would fucking freak the fuck out.

1800
01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:41.510
Or you see particularly set out sir.
No,
he's not.

1801
01:45:41.850 --> 01:45:44.010
You look at this size.
This is the,
um,

1802
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:49.030
the actual size of a gigantic pickets in relationship to him.

1803
01:45:49.061 --> 01:45:52.930
Man.
G Blackie is what they call Blackie is the,

1804
01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:55.750
the actual full scientific name.
Okay,

1805
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:59.930
well it's 1930 the name that's fucking about,
you know,
there's dirty bitches.

1806
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:02.890
You know Quentin Tarantino's going to be making a movie about this.

1807
01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:06.780
Oh no you didn't.
Yeah,
I saw that movie last night.
What'd you think?

1808
01:46:06.781 --> 01:46:08.990
It's very good movie,
man.
I mean it's the,
the,

1809
01:46:08.991 --> 01:46:13.880
the use of the word nigger is so prevalent in that movie.

1810
01:46:13.881 --> 01:46:16.550
It's kind of preposterous at a certain point in time.
You're like,
okay,

1811
01:46:16.551 --> 01:46:20.630
I really like,
did you have to say it this many times?
But the reality has,

1812
01:46:20.631 --> 01:46:23.130
have you thought about it?
Like that's probably how they communicated.

1813
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:27.140
That's what he says.
As authentic as it gets.
But that aside,

1814
01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:31.920
it's a fucking great movie.
Yeah,
it's good.
Some really funny moments.
Yeah.

1815
01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:35.890
He's a bad motherfucker and almost every one of his movie.
Yeah,
it's gigantic.

1816
01:46:35.891 --> 01:46:37.520
I think blocking and then ridiculous.

1817
01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:41.180
You uncreative fuckheads from 1930

1818
01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:45.740
did you read it and don't know if you remember in the book we talk about

1819
01:46:45.741 --> 01:46:49.130
Drapetomania,
which was the disease of black,

1820
01:46:49.710 --> 01:46:54.140
who had the pathological desire not to be slaves anymore,
if that's hilarious.

1821
01:46:54.150 --> 01:46:57.720
Yeah.
It was a medical condition.
They wrote about it in medical journals.
Wow.

1822
01:46:57.750 --> 01:47:01.200
Drapetomania that's hilarious.
Yeah.
You don't want to be free.

1823
01:47:01.201 --> 01:47:04.410
You're suffering from Drapetomania isn't credible.

1824
01:47:04.770 --> 01:47:08.460
You tweeted something today that I wanted to discuss with you.
Um,

1825
01:47:08.610 --> 01:47:12.440
is there such a thing as sex addiction?
Oh,
right.
Yeah.
Right.
That was a,

1826
01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:13.800
was that an article you were tweeting?

1827
01:47:14.010 --> 01:47:19.010
It's an article by Marty Klein who's a sex therapist for 30 some years.

1828
01:47:20.250 --> 01:47:24.210
What does all Marty,
I have to say,
Marty Says No.
Really?
No.
Marty says,

1829
01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:27.480
that's silly.
I could introduce him to some girl that I know.

1830
01:47:27.690 --> 01:47:31.080
He would change his mind.
Immediate.
Yeah,

1831
01:47:31.410 --> 01:47:35.850
but mean there's obviously psychological addictions.
Yeah.
What he's saying is,
is,

1832
01:47:35.851 --> 01:47:38.740
you know,
they're addictive personality types and it's,

1833
01:47:38.741 --> 01:47:42.150
it's not about the gambling or about the,
you know,
whatever it is.

1834
01:47:42.151 --> 01:47:43.410
You're addicted to the cell,

1835
01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.570
the jerking off in front of your computer or whatever.

1836
01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:48.310
It's about a certain personality or,

1837
01:47:48.330 --> 01:47:53.330
or different personality types that are highly susceptible to needing that sort

1838
01:47:53.851 --> 01:47:55.890
of stimulation over and over and over again.

1839
01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:00.790
And it could be anything that they could lock on the playing cards.
Sure,

1840
01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:04.770
yeah.
Yeah.
It's a weird thing with human beings where again,

1841
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:08.460
I think we're going back to the reward system that set us up when we were

1842
01:48:08.461 --> 01:48:10.380
hunters and gatherers for being successful.

1843
01:48:10.590 --> 01:48:14.210
And one of the things that got us be successful as persistence,
right?

1844
01:48:14.250 --> 01:48:18.780
This crazy laser beam persistence opposed to chasing that animal and focusing on

1845
01:48:18.781 --> 01:48:22.170
that animal and,
and being fixated on acquiring that animal.

1846
01:48:22.410 --> 01:48:26.770
But that can be like for aces,
I need fucking four races fucking four.
He says,

1847
01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.550
right?
It's like that same intensity.

1848
01:48:29.551 --> 01:48:34.140
It's sort of found this weird path where it's not being fulfilled by modern

1849
01:48:34.141 --> 01:48:36.900
everyday life of cubicle existence.
You know,

1850
01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:40.770
sitting there and checking your emails and waiting for the fucking clock to

1851
01:48:40.771 --> 01:48:45.480
strike five so he can run away and have your few hours of freedom because we're

1852
01:48:45.481 --> 01:48:46.920
trapped.
And that sort of a lifestyle.

1853
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:51.950
All these reward systems are not being fulfilled and they're sort of manifesting

1854
01:48:52.021 --> 01:48:54.600
themselves in other ways.
How else can we get excitement?
Right?

1855
01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:57.930
We bet the house on Sunday,
but the house,
we got to fucking do something.

1856
01:48:58.170 --> 01:49:02.070
We need to fire this kiln up.
We need to do something to get ourselves excited.

1857
01:49:02.150 --> 01:49:05.080
Yeah.
Yeah.
Edward Abbey,
I think we,

1858
01:49:05.190 --> 01:49:08.060
there's a quote from Edward Abbey and our book where he talks about uh,

1859
01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:13.340
how sexuality is the only part of modern life that remains somewhat on

1860
01:49:14.801 --> 01:49:18.300
domesticated.
You know,
that we're like monkeys in a cage.

1861
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:21.170
Like we just sit there jerking off cause we're,
there's nothing else to do,

1862
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:25.440
you know?
Yeah.
That is something with people.

1863
01:49:25.441 --> 01:49:28.680
Like they'll start their day off by just finding something to jerk off to like

1864
01:49:28.681 --> 01:49:31.410
that's every day.
That's not a small amount of people.

1865
01:49:31.411 --> 01:49:32.400
That's like a lot of people,

1866
01:49:32.850 --> 01:49:37.460
like everyone between every man should 15 and 20 or so.

1867
01:49:38.010 --> 01:49:42.840
And at one point in time,
I mean there's so much access now.

1868
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:47.870
It's like at one point in time it was difficult to find something to masturbate

1869
01:49:47.891 --> 01:49:48.460
too.

1870
01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:53.260
<v 5>But now,
I mean,
if you have a computer,
I mean I have friends that won't,</v>

1871
01:49:53.570 --> 01:49:58.080
they,
they'll have like a computer that doesn't have wifi or the Wifi Lil,

1872
01:49:58.110 --> 01:50:01.180
they'll break it on the computer just so that they make sure that they never go

1873
01:50:01.181 --> 01:50:05.140
online with it.
Like they'll,
you know,
the,
the tape take a chip out.

1874
01:50:05.170 --> 01:50:09.340
I'm not telling you if you have a spot in your house where you can't get Wifi,

1875
01:50:09.370 --> 01:50:12.790
go there and right there because otherwise your fucking computer,

1876
01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:16.840
it's right there.
That's the portal to pussy.
Didn't see it.
Anytime you want,

1877
01:50:16.841 --> 01:50:20.620
you just pressing a couple of and there's a girl blown a guy and like whoa.

1878
01:50:21.010 --> 01:50:25.810
It's like,
it's so prevalent.
It's no one ever thought that was coming.

1879
01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:26.081
You know,

1880
01:50:26.081 --> 01:50:29.170
in the back of the day when I was in high school and you had to get in magazines

1881
01:50:29.171 --> 01:50:32.980
and when VCR tapes came out it was a shocker.

1882
01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:35.050
But now it's on your phone.

1883
01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:35.401
<v 6>Well,</v>

1884
01:50:35.401 --> 01:50:40.401
there's a book called the erotic engine that argues that every advance in

1885
01:50:40.921 --> 01:50:43.120
communication technology,
you know,

1886
01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:47.880
back to the 18 hundreds has come about because of the desire to see and

1887
01:50:47.881 --> 01:50:51.250
broadcast pussy.
It's fascinating.
It's all about the

1888
01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:54.320
<v 5>another weird sorta offshoot of the,</v>

1889
01:50:54.330 --> 01:50:58.330
the constant technology progress,
you know?

1890
01:50:58.610 --> 01:50:59.350
<v 6>Right.
Seems to,</v>

1891
01:50:59.350 --> 01:51:02.810
it's leading us and then that's exactly the model we were talking about earlier.

1892
01:51:02.811 --> 01:51:07.580
It leads us in these steps always closer to what we think is going to give us

1893
01:51:07.581 --> 01:51:09.350
pleasure or satisfaction or something,

1894
01:51:09.351 --> 01:51:13.820
but in fact it may be leading us further and further away from the thumb.

1895
01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:16.260
True happiness.
Yeah.
Because it's so simple.
Well,

1896
01:51:16.290 --> 01:51:21.030
<v 5>the idea is that we are evolving much like society's evolving and we need to</v>

1897
01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:25.530
sort of physically and mentally and emotionally catch up with the amount of

1898
01:51:25.531 --> 01:51:27.180
progress that technology's making.

1899
01:51:27.181 --> 01:51:30.930
It fit into this new paradigm and find happiness within it that is achievable

1900
01:51:30.931 --> 01:51:33.330
and reachable.
And I,
and I think it is,
I think,

1901
01:51:33.331 --> 01:51:37.500
I certainly think that if you give people enough,
I think people inherently need,

1902
01:51:37.530 --> 01:51:41.050
especially men,
difficult tasks and their life they need to work.
Um,

1903
01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:43.950
I think work doesn't mean you know,
digging holes,

1904
01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:47.400
but it means putting your effort to something and finding a result in that.

1905
01:51:47.401 --> 01:51:49.800
And there's some sort of the,
that's how you become a man.

1906
01:51:49.801 --> 01:51:51.060
That's how you become a human.

1907
01:51:51.061 --> 01:51:55.620
That's how you learn how to sort of navigate your way through the world is by

1908
01:51:56.250 --> 01:52:00.330
trials and tribulations of trying to achieve things or to accomplish things or

1909
01:52:00.331 --> 01:52:04.070
to explore things.
Whether it's just your education,
you know,

1910
01:52:04.110 --> 01:52:06.960
delving into education and you'd become more,
you know,

1911
01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:11.610
more introspective because of that and more understanding of yourself and your,

1912
01:52:11.611 --> 01:52:13.890
your sort of fitting in in this strange world that we live in.

1913
01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:17.190
But if you don't have that,
if you don't,
if you don't have pursuits,

1914
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:19.410
like that's where damage people come from.

1915
01:52:19.411 --> 01:52:23.070
That's where a lot of what's fucked up in this world comes from is that people

1916
01:52:23.071 --> 01:52:26.250
that aren't being led in a way that's going to develop them.

1917
01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:31.280
People that aren't being guided in some sort of a multistep process for

1918
01:52:31.741 --> 01:52:33.810
understanding and for,

1919
01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:37.890
for figuring out who you are and figuring out what's the best way to interact

1920
01:52:37.891 --> 01:52:40.560
with people.
What's the most harmonious way to live your life?

1921
01:52:40.561 --> 01:52:44.160
What's the way that makes you and the people that you come in contact with the

1922
01:52:44.161 --> 01:52:46.070
most happy and that's who you are,

1923
01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:50.870
just takes a long time to figure out how to become that person.
And we,

1924
01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:55.640
we live in this weird society now where everything is operating on this crazy

1925
01:52:55.641 --> 01:53:00.641
amount of momentum and you sorta just hop on the escalator and walk with it as

1926
01:53:01.311 --> 01:53:03.290
it's going and that's your life and you,

1927
01:53:03.291 --> 01:53:08.291
you very rarely have a chance to stop and calculate and formulate a game plan.

1928
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:12.560
Yeah,
you're right.
So much of our behavior,
whether it's financial,

1929
01:53:12.561 --> 01:53:15.500
whether it's governmental or whether it's sexual,

1930
01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:20.120
much of it is based on like the silly notions and momentum,

1931
01:53:20.121 --> 01:53:24.500
the momentum of the people that set this whole system up way back don't even

1932
01:53:24.501 --> 01:53:25.334
exist.

1933
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:26.830
<v 4>Yeah.
And I see you again,</v>

1934
01:53:26.831 --> 01:53:31.060
we get back to numbers cause I start to think it's I think less in terms of the

1935
01:53:31.061 --> 01:53:34.900
people who set it up and run it and more in terms of the internal logic of the

1936
01:53:34.901 --> 01:53:39.820
thing itself,
that the society is the organism and we live within the organism,

1937
01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:42.820
right?
Just like so many different bacteria and things live within us.

1938
01:53:42.821 --> 01:53:46.840
And you know,
you,
you think of yourself as an individual as do I,
but you know,

1939
01:53:46.841 --> 01:53:51.460
you've got the DNA from thousands of different organisms all necessary to your

1940
01:53:51.461 --> 01:53:55.900
life.
I,
I start to think we're inside.
It's almost like the,
you know,

1941
01:53:55.901 --> 01:53:58.900
when Romney said corporations are people,
they're not people,

1942
01:53:58.901 --> 01:54:00.640
but they're organisms,
they're alive.

1943
01:54:00.670 --> 01:54:05.200
They've got their own logic and their own needs and they don't give a shit about

1944
01:54:05.201 --> 01:54:08.260
us right there about making profit,

1945
01:54:08.290 --> 01:54:10.990
which requires destruction of natural resources.

1946
01:54:11.230 --> 01:54:15.640
There's nothing within a corporation that gives a damn that it's destroying the

1947
01:54:15.641 --> 01:54:19.480
planet.
Just like there's nothing within a pathogen that gives a damn that it's

1948
01:54:19.481 --> 01:54:20.560
destroying its host,

1949
01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:23.920
<v 5>but it needs us in order to fulfill its destiny.</v>

1950
01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:28.140
It needs our creativity in order to fulfill its destination.
I mean,

1951
01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:31.630
if you looked at technology as a,

1952
01:54:31.631 --> 01:54:33.910
as a life form itself,
you would,

1953
01:54:33.970 --> 01:54:38.970
I mean we don't think of when we think of parasites like the toxoplasma parasite

1954
01:54:39.191 --> 01:54:43.420
or any other sort of parasite that invades,
we think of them in organic terms.

1955
01:54:43.690 --> 01:54:47.860
But if you looked at what technology's doing to people,
it's like,
wow,

1956
01:54:47.861 --> 01:54:51.880
that's very parasitic.
And,
and us to it as well.
There's like this weird,

1957
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:54.320
you could call it symbiosis,
but it's,

1958
01:54:54.321 --> 01:54:58.330
it's also parasitic because it's polluting everything while it's being created

1959
01:54:58.530 --> 01:55:00.250
and it's altering behavior.

1960
01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:04.510
You can make an argument that technology is bringing us closer together and

1961
01:55:04.511 --> 01:55:09.310
technology is bridging boundaries of consciousness and in spreading information

1962
01:55:09.311 --> 01:55:10.001
and an impossible.

1963
01:55:10.001 --> 01:55:12.880
But you can also make an argument that it's separating people from human

1964
01:55:12.881 --> 01:55:16.440
interaction.
Right?
And it's even,
it's like favoring the,

1965
01:55:16.441 --> 01:55:18.720
the ones and Zeros and,
and,
and,

1966
01:55:18.730 --> 01:55:21.630
and numbers over actual humans

1967
01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:23.990
<v 4>sial interactions.
That's,
that's what I'm saying,</v>

1968
01:55:23.991 --> 01:55:28.991
that that the process favors the process is designed to satisfy the needs of the

1969
01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:33.290
macro organism,
not the microorganisms within it.

1970
01:55:33.590 --> 01:55:37.700
So human needs are not important in this process.

1971
01:55:38.210 --> 01:55:41.980
The need of a corporation or what's important,
you know,
so,
uh,

1972
01:55:42.030 --> 01:55:44.040
that's why I think we're,
we're less and less happy.

1973
01:55:44.041 --> 01:55:46.260
That's why I think we're civilized to death because we're,

1974
01:55:46.261 --> 01:55:50.220
we're moving further and further away from the things that make life satisfying.

1975
01:55:50.370 --> 01:55:53.520
I agree with you.
How do you feel about antidepressants?

1976
01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:58.980
I feel that they're like sorta like Drapetomania I think a lot of people are

1977
01:55:59.130 --> 01:56:03.450
quote unquote depressed because they're unhappy,
you know,

1978
01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:08.130
as opposed to organic,
you know,
Serotonin,
you know,
levels that are misaligned.

1979
01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:11.130
I'm talking about people,
I think people are fucking miserable.

1980
01:56:11.131 --> 01:56:15.100
Of course they're miserable,
their lives are meaningless.
They're,
you know,
the,

1981
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:18.240
we mentioned,
you talk about the things that really make people happy.

1982
01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:21.840
Number one on the list is living in a community of people who love you.
Yeah.

1983
01:56:22.050 --> 01:56:24.840
That's the number one thing.
That's what you mentioned earlier,
you know,

1984
01:56:24.841 --> 01:56:29.841
with the lottery winners and saw on and as society becomes ever more fragmented

1985
01:56:30.151 --> 01:56:30.660
and you know,

1986
01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:34.530
more Americans are living alone right now as a percentage of the population than

1987
01:56:34.531 --> 01:56:36.340
ever before in our history.
You know,

1988
01:56:36.450 --> 01:56:41.100
that's demonstrates so many people are annoying.
That'd be alone.
Fucking watch.

1989
01:56:41.101 --> 01:56:44.490
Whatever you want to watch,
eat whatever you want.
Walk around naked.
Gives a fuck.

1990
01:56:44.491 --> 01:56:46.620
Leave me alone of that.
So it's,
you know,

1991
01:56:46.621 --> 01:56:49.410
you were talking about how we get caught on the wheel,
you know,

1992
01:56:49.411 --> 01:56:50.970
and there's no time to get off.

1993
01:56:51.290 --> 01:56:56.290
I that that's like the central insight of my life was when I felt that I felt

1994
01:56:57.121 --> 01:57:00.720
that momentum building and I took a summer off college.

1995
01:57:00.721 --> 01:57:05.310
I hitchhiked to Alaska and uh,
I got,
yeah,
I had,

1996
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:09.960
I did it twice there and back twice.
Jesus Christ from New York to Alaska.

1997
01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:14.520
Holy Shit.
Wow.
What are the odds you picking up a rock and go,
hey man,

1998
01:57:14.521 --> 01:57:16.740
I'm going to Alaska.
And the guy's like,
Holy Shit.
Me Too.

1999
01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:21.630
Hopefully like each other.
We get along.
What's the longest,

2000
01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:25.230
longest ride you went on?
A,
I can't remember.

2001
01:57:25.231 --> 01:57:30.150
Probably when I can remember it.
It was from,

2002
01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:33.270
you know,
you take the ferry up,
the inside passage,

2003
01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:36.570
which is up the coast of Canada.
And then,
um,

2004
01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:40.770
the fairies don't go around a mainland Alaska as the water's just out of
control.

2005
01:57:41.090 --> 01:57:45.120
And there's,
I think it's called the Chugach mountains there.
So you to drive,

2006
01:57:45.121 --> 01:57:50.121
you have to go up the Alcan highway through the Yukon and then go across

2007
01:57:50.131 --> 01:57:51.750
horizontally to Fairbanks.

2008
01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:56.190
I think that's like 1200 kilometers or miles,
I don't even remember.

2009
01:57:56.191 --> 01:57:57.660
But that would be the longest ride.

2010
01:57:57.661 --> 01:58:02.040
A woman picked me and these two other guys up that I'd met and drove us all the

2011
01:58:02.041 --> 01:58:06.630
way.
It was like three days.
Wow.
What a crazy lady.

2012
01:58:06.690 --> 01:58:10.470
Great Lady.
And she was in a VW camper van with two little kids.

2013
01:58:11.930 --> 01:58:16.260
This was,
I think it was the second year.
So it was 84.

2014
01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:21.450
Wow.
How crazy was she?
She was wonderful in a VW camper.
Well,

2015
01:58:21.451 --> 01:58:23.820
she picked me up first,
um,

2016
01:58:23.850 --> 01:58:28.380
because I had been with these two guys and some guy picked us up down in the,

2017
01:58:28.381 --> 01:58:29.041
in the town,

2018
01:58:29.041 --> 01:58:32.750
I think it was Skagway in the town where the ferry docks [inaudible] we're

2019
01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:33.600
trying to hitch out and,

2020
01:58:33.601 --> 01:58:37.260
and some guy picked us up and drove us like 20 miles into the wilderness and

2021
01:58:37.261 --> 01:58:40.980
dropped us off and said,
watch out for the bears.

2022
01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:45.280
And he was just a dick.
So he just dropped you off,
like to be an asshole.

2023
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:49.390
Just drove up.
Yeah.
He was a local guy and he was like,
yeah,
fuck you guys.

2024
01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:53.260
You know,
he was,
it was,
I don't remember,
this was long time ago obviously,

2025
01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:58.300
but he left us in the middle of nowhere and the only cars that came by were

2026
01:58:58.301 --> 01:59:02.350
coming off the ferry.
Right.
Cause there's no like road that went into this town.

2027
01:59:02.710 --> 01:59:07.000
So,
um,
so we were stuck there and,
and so it was like,
all right,

2028
01:59:07.001 --> 01:59:10.690
we set up our tents,
we had food and shit.
We were backpacking in Alaska,

2029
01:59:10.691 --> 01:59:11.890
we were self contained.

2030
01:59:12.430 --> 01:59:15.610
So we camped down next to this river and I had some acid we trip.

2031
01:59:15.611 --> 01:59:19.090
These two guys had never tripped before in their lives.
So you just like,
fuck it,

2032
01:59:19.091 --> 01:59:21.760
we can't get a ride.
Let's trip balls.
Well,
what else are we going to do?

2033
01:59:21.761 --> 01:59:24.580
We got to wait till Wednesday til the next ferry comes in.
Right.

2034
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.620
So were there like three days?
So we stripped out the very interesting,
anyway,

2035
01:59:29.621 --> 01:59:32.020
these guys,
I had a lot of adventures with these guys.

2036
01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:36.520
I went to prison with one of them later that summer.
Jesus Christ man.

2037
01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:40.520
Yeah.
Nutty life.
Yeah.
But anyway,

2038
01:59:40.521 --> 01:59:42.550
so we decided nobody's going to pick up all three of us.

2039
01:59:42.551 --> 01:59:45.450
So they walked up the road and let me get the f the,

2040
01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:50.020
so we went out and waited for the cars and Jim's finally this woman's stops and,

2041
01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:52.480
and I knew my buddies were right up around the corner.

2042
01:59:52.481 --> 01:59:56.300
So as soon as I got in the van I was like,
Oh yeah,
you doing it was good.
Oh Man.

2043
01:59:56.301 --> 01:59:58.120
I've been hanging out with these really cool guys.

2044
01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:01.690
I met them and then we come around the corner.
I was like,
oh there they are.

2045
02:00:01.691 --> 02:00:04.480
And she just sort of looked at me and smiled and pulled over.
Okay.

2046
02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:07.030
So the three of us drove all the way to Fairbanks.

2047
02:00:07.031 --> 02:00:09.790
She sat in the back of the van with our kids,
played with the kids.

2048
02:00:09.790 --> 02:00:14.740
I had all these kids.
Two little kids.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
So crazy.

2049
02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:16.270
She was great.
What a chance.

2050
02:00:16.271 --> 02:00:21.050
She took really wow our kids and she was like,
oh,

2051
02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:25.120
what do you have a van?
Let me get in there.
A lady.

2052
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:30.280
She was not.
Wow.
Well I'm glad it worked out and you guys weren't crazy.

2053
02:00:30.410 --> 02:00:33.940
You didn't wind know dismembering her family in the woods,
man.

2054
02:00:33.941 --> 02:00:36.260
I had my lucky hitchhiking shirt on.

2055
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:40.540
You know that's a bold move to just go out there and hope to get a ride.

2056
02:00:40.590 --> 02:00:44.590
What's the longest you step like stood out there with your thumb out?
A few days.

2057
02:00:44.591 --> 02:00:46.450
I remember outside of white horse,

2058
02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:50.410
this was the year before I was with my friend Mike.

2059
02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:53.770
We're outside of Whitehorse.
We were there like two,
two nights at least.

2060
02:00:53.771 --> 02:00:56.890
We slept by the highway and then weird.
He's,

2061
02:00:57.100 --> 02:00:59.080
I swear this is true to the next day we get up,

2062
02:00:59.130 --> 02:01:00.910
we walked up the highway a little bit,
you know,

2063
02:01:00.911 --> 02:01:02.540
got our tents set up and everything,
you know,

2064
02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:05.800
back in her backpack and a walk up the highway a little bit.

2065
02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:07.360
And this is like Tundra,
right?
There's,

2066
02:01:07.361 --> 02:01:09.670
I don't know if you've been to this part of the world,
Yukon,

2067
02:01:09.671 --> 02:01:14.600
it's just like flat empty.
It's Arctic desert essentially.

2068
02:01:14.601 --> 02:01:14.791
You know,

2069
02:01:14.791 --> 02:01:19.791
there's scrub whatever and woke up a little bit and we find on the side of the

2070
02:01:20.741 --> 02:01:24.820
road of book that had been there for God knows how long the pages were just like

2071
02:01:24.821 --> 02:01:28.360
really tightly curled back from the spine,
you know,
was like a,

2072
02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:30.940
some sort of bizarre shellfish or something.

2073
02:01:30.941 --> 02:01:35.890
And we sort of killed it down and it was a bible.
Whoa.
So we lit,

2074
02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:39.630
we lit it on fire and we started dancing around this Bible right here.

2075
02:01:39.631 --> 02:01:41.450
We're like,
you know,
just nuts,
right?

2076
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:46.700
And this truck comes by this pickup truck and s and at first we were like,

2077
02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.690
you know,
oh they,
you know,
some of them just got here and yeah,
it's God,
right?

2078
02:01:50.690 --> 02:01:53.210
They back up to us and it's these three guys.

2079
02:01:53.211 --> 02:01:58.211
It's like a dude in his 50s from New Mexico or something and he's crazy ass

2080
02:02:01.221 --> 02:02:06.050
nephew who was like 23 and his nephews friend and they were just like,

2081
02:02:06.051 --> 02:02:09.050
yeah,
who like real,
real Bozo dudes.

2082
02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:12.530
Like they were pissed off that everything was more expensive in Canada.

2083
02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:15.740
They didn't understand the money thing,
you know that it was different dollars.

2084
02:02:16.070 --> 02:02:18.770
They were pissed off that the Canadians wouldn't let them bring their guns

2085
02:02:18.771 --> 02:02:21.950
through Canada.
There's all this stuff.
They picked us up anyway,

2086
02:02:21.951 --> 02:02:22.761
put us in the back,

2087
02:02:22.761 --> 02:02:27.440
stopped when we crossed back into Alaska and they got out and kiss the ground to

2088
02:02:27.441 --> 02:02:31.280
be back in America.
So they picked us up when we burned the Bible.

2089
02:02:31.450 --> 02:02:33.880
<v 0>Wow.
He channeled them.</v>

2090
02:02:34.450 --> 02:02:39.450
I guess he channeled like one of the best examples of weirdness in America.

2091
02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:45.110
Like this super patriotic retards.
Exactly.
That's fascinating.

2092
02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:48.880
Toting.
Yeah.
That was your vehicle to get over.
They got us out.

2093
02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:53.050
What a strange lifestyle it is to just fucking hitchhike play places and not

2094
02:02:53.110 --> 02:02:56.410
exactly know who's going to take you or what's going to happen.

2095
02:02:56.411 --> 02:02:59.170
And I like hunting,
gathering,
you know,
not really.

2096
02:02:59.171 --> 02:03:02.920
It's kind of like putting yourself in a metal box with a psycho.
You don't,

2097
02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:07.780
you know,
you can take a wild guess and you could be okay.
You know,
you might,

2098
02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:10.540
I met some Psychos,
a lot of Psychos,

2099
02:03:10.541 --> 02:03:14.890
a lot of like homosexual guys and a lot of Jesus freaks.

2100
02:03:15.010 --> 02:03:15.761
Like what happened?

2101
02:03:15.761 --> 02:03:20.761
What's the craziest thing that happened while I checking homosexuals first and

2102
02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:24.720
was getting life coach?
Well that the homeless,

2103
02:03:24.930 --> 02:03:26.350
I got to say that homosexuals

2104
02:03:26.410 --> 02:03:31.210
<v 4>were were fine.
They were,
they were,
you know,
they were lonely,</v>

2105
02:03:31.211 --> 02:03:34.840
they were lonely guys and they were hoping and they were hoping and I guess a

2106
02:03:34.841 --> 02:03:39.430
lot of dudes that,
you know,
there's like a sort of a system,
you know,
but like,

2107
02:03:39.431 --> 02:03:40.540
Hey,
I'm not gay,
you know?

2108
02:03:40.541 --> 02:03:44.460
And then at that time my best friend was gay and I'm certainly comfortable.

2109
02:03:44.610 --> 02:03:45.443
Right.

2110
02:03:45.670 --> 02:03:47.700
<v 0>Did you bring your best friend over to blown for the ride?
Yeah,</v>

2111
02:03:47.970 --> 02:03:50.970
that'd be what I'd move.
Actually,
he came to Alaska later that summer,

2112
02:03:50.971 --> 02:03:53.730
but he flew up.
He was,
he was a professor in the school.

2113
02:03:53.850 --> 02:03:56.400
We shouldn't have to prostitute himself either,
just for a ride.
I mean,

2114
02:03:56.401 --> 02:03:58.740
either going to give him a ride or not blow the pilot,

2115
02:03:59.580 --> 02:04:03.420
get a flight out of it anyway,
just to ride.
Really.
It's not,
but I'll tell you,

2116
02:04:03.421 --> 02:04:05.890
one of the more memorable hitchhiking things was I was

2117
02:04:06.010 --> 02:04:11.010
<v 4>coming back and I was coming from Montreal down to New York.</v>

2118
02:04:11.590 --> 02:04:14.140
I had friends I wanted to see in New York,
so I was coming down that,

2119
02:04:14.590 --> 02:04:18.220
that highway that goes down through the Adirondack mountains,
you know,

2120
02:04:18.490 --> 02:04:21.250
very desolate,
kinda empty country.

2121
02:04:22.090 --> 02:04:26.490
And I always had a knife in my right boot.
Um,

2122
02:04:26.650 --> 02:04:30.130
when I was hitchhiking,
just like you say,
things can get really weird.

2123
02:04:30.131 --> 02:04:31.240
And I figured,
well,
you know,

2124
02:04:31.241 --> 02:04:35.610
at least I've got a knife and like stop the fucking car.
Right,
right.
Um,

2125
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:39.060
but it's under my jeans and I had these army boots and I always had it in the

2126
02:04:39.061 --> 02:04:42.750
boot under my jeans.
So I'm,
I'm out there and,
uh,

2127
02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:44.820
this guy pulls over for me and he's like,

2128
02:04:44.821 --> 02:04:49.200
crew cut in military know ex military looking dude,
you know,
a real fit,
tattoos,

2129
02:04:49.201 --> 02:04:53.550
the whole thing.
And he's like,
uh,
yeah,
so where are you from?
What he'd done?
And,

2130
02:04:53.551 --> 02:04:56.970
and uh,
and,
and within two minutes of the conversation,
he says,

2131
02:04:56.971 --> 02:05:01.380
so you like knives?
And he sort of says it in that like he's not asking,

2132
02:05:01.381 --> 02:05:06.060
he's noting and I said,
yeah,
yeah,
I like,
and I was,

2133
02:05:06.061 --> 02:05:08.850
I guess.
And he said,
yeah,
I noticed you've got one under your boot.

2134
02:05:08.851 --> 02:05:13.800
They're on the right.
And I was like,
oh Jeez.
And I'm sitting in the car,

2135
02:05:13.801 --> 02:05:16.860
how's he noticed I've got a knife in my boot,
like on the side of the car?

2136
02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:21.240
He said,
yeah,
I noticed when I picked you up.
He said,
I like nice too.

2137
02:05:21.241 --> 02:05:25.710
And he reaches into his belt buckle and goes and pulls out a knife that was in

2138
02:05:25.711 --> 02:05:28.920
his belt buckle and now that knife is like right in front of my face.

2139
02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:33.000
And I'm like,
fuck man,
this could be really bad,
you know,

2140
02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:37.170
and I'm looking at it and I said,
this is really nice knife.
He said,
yeah.

2141
02:05:37.230 --> 02:05:41.520
And like,
like he let me take the knife and hold it and like,
oh yeah.
Wow,

2142
02:05:41.550 --> 02:05:43.620
that's cool.
That's in your buckle,
Huh?
Like yeah,

2143
02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:47.370
and I've got another one here and he pulls out another night.
By now I'm like,

2144
02:05:47.371 --> 02:05:49.280
he's not going to kill me.
He's just showing me is nice.

2145
02:05:49.710 --> 02:05:53.280
The guy was a prison guard at Attica.
Whoa.

2146
02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:55.050
He drove me all the way to New York.

2147
02:05:55.051 --> 02:05:58.560
He was a prison guard and the thing was like,
he's a trained,

2148
02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:01.830
he's trained to notice shit like a knife under your right.
Right.

2149
02:06:01.870 --> 02:06:02.740
They'll see the bulge.

2150
02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:05.970
That made such an impression on me because at that point I,

2151
02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:10.500
I stopped carrying a knife first of all because like,

2152
02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:14.130
because those dudes are pros and I'm an amateur.

2153
02:06:14.670 --> 02:06:18.900
Last thing I want to do is escalate the situation and it just really made this

2154
02:06:18.990 --> 02:06:22.020
like,
you know,
I think I'm getting away with something and now there are people,

2155
02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:25.440
people who know what to look for,
they're always one step ahead of you.

2156
02:06:26.490 --> 02:06:27.810
It's tough like getting into,

2157
02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:30.860
I don't know if you've ever been interrogated by police.
It's,

2158
02:06:31.290 --> 02:06:34.970
it's hard because they,
they've done it a thousand times.
Yeah.

2159
02:06:36.230 --> 02:06:39.690
Yeah.
I've got a question.
Wants,
does that interrogated?
Yeah,
same thing.

2160
02:06:39.930 --> 02:06:43.410
I got a question once cause I knew a dude who knew a dude who killed somebody.

2161
02:06:44.190 --> 02:06:46.920
It was a weird conversation because I had a conversation on the phone with them

2162
02:06:46.921 --> 02:06:48.630
and then they,
the cops wanted to ask me.

2163
02:06:48.631 --> 02:06:51.720
But what I knew because they were listening to his phone calls,
I was like,

2164
02:06:51.721 --> 02:06:54.780
that was kinda interesting too.
I was like Whoa.
I think tapped his fucking phone.

2165
02:06:54.810 --> 02:06:57.090
That's Kinda crazy.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2166
02:06:57.180 --> 02:07:01.680
Luckily I didn't know shit but it was a weird sort of a situation like drink

2167
02:07:01.770 --> 02:07:05.640
what is,
is it legal to know the guy might've killed somebody.

2168
02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:08.910
It's supposed to go right to the cops with that.

2169
02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:11.930
Like if you don't know whether or not someone's full of shit or not,
right.

2170
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.120
What are you supposed to do there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think you're safe.

2171
02:07:15.390 --> 02:07:18.030
But that insight that you get caught up in this momentum.

2172
02:07:18.031 --> 02:07:21.690
What happened that that year in Alaska that first year was I,

2173
02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:27.140
my entire life plan changed cause I was like on the track to go to Grad school

2174
02:07:27.391 --> 02:07:28.170
right away.
Go to,

2175
02:07:28.170 --> 02:07:31.290
I knew a guy who was at Oxford who had me all set up to go to Oxford,

2176
02:07:31.291 --> 02:07:35.040
do a phd in literature,
which is what I was studying at that point.
And you know,

2177
02:07:35.050 --> 02:07:37.870
just go right in and be a professor at teaching literature,
you know,

2178
02:07:37.871 --> 02:07:42.250
some college by the time I was 30 with tenure and all set up and you know,

2179
02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:47.110
and I went up to Alaska and I met all these people who blew my mind too,

2180
02:07:47.111 --> 02:07:52.111
were really kind and generous and smart and deep people who weren't

2181
02:07:53.501 --> 02:07:57.670
intellectuals,
right,
who had no idea who needs your was or whatever.

2182
02:07:58.090 --> 02:08:01.210
And my friends back in,
you know,

2183
02:08:01.211 --> 02:08:04.720
my sort of high Iq friends would have scoffed at these people,

2184
02:08:04.721 --> 02:08:08.830
but in fact they were happier.
They had a better life than my miserable,

2185
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:10.420
arrogant professor friends.

2186
02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:14.560
And it really made me think about where I was going in life.
And I said,
okay,

2187
02:08:14.561 --> 02:08:19.180
so here's what I'm going to do until I'm 30 I'm not going to get on that wheel.

2188
02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:21.460
I'm not going to go to Grad school.
I'm not going to get married.

2189
02:08:21.461 --> 02:08:24.730
I'm not going to have a career.
I'm just going to float around the world.

2190
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:30.010
Do Crazy Shit.
Meet crazy people.
Think about what I want to do with my life.

2191
02:08:30.130 --> 02:08:33.060
But don't start till after 32.

2192
02:08:33.061 --> 02:08:37.990
Give yourself an actual number just to say at least till 30.
Like no commitment.

2193
02:08:37.991 --> 02:08:41.050
Your commitment is to not make a commitment.
And so your third,

2194
02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:45.200
<v 0>there's those money.
There's a lot of shows that are on the air.
Uh,
lately.
Uh,</v>

2195
02:08:45.201 --> 02:08:48.400
about Alaska.
There's a right,
the subsistence shows,

2196
02:08:48.730 --> 02:08:52.120
whether it's subsistence shows his families just survive in Alaska and then they

2197
02:08:52.121 --> 02:08:56.230
show how many different villages,
um,
rely completely on nature.
Right.

2198
02:08:56.260 --> 02:08:57.760
I'm obsessed with these shows.

2199
02:08:57.761 --> 02:09:02.761
It's so fascinating to me that there so compelling this chase of food,

2200
02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:06.020
you know,
whether it's,
they're growing some food there,

2201
02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:08.340
they're collecting salmon out of the river there.

2202
02:09:08.350 --> 02:09:12.370
They're shooting animals and cutting them up and freezing them and they're just,

2203
02:09:12.610 --> 02:09:15.280
everyone just goes nuts for four months.

2204
02:09:15.610 --> 02:09:20.080
Stockpiles all the food and then weights and then the whole thing freezes for

2205
02:09:20.081 --> 02:09:24.430
eight months.
And it's really weird.
A lot of backgammon.
Yeah.

2206
02:09:24.431 --> 02:09:25.540
I don't know what the fuck they do,

2207
02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:30.250
but essentially they barely shower and cleaned themselves for eight months.

2208
02:09:30.610 --> 02:09:32.920
They were talking about clothes about like during the winter,

2209
02:09:32.921 --> 02:09:37.210
like you barely wash her clothes cause you can't,
things just freeze instantly.

2210
02:09:37.210 --> 02:09:40.510
It's 40 below zero.
How do you keep clothes wet?
You know,
what do you do?

2211
02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:43.030
You go out and put them out because they hang their clothes sort of outside to

2212
02:09:43.031 --> 02:09:47.890
dry.
Good luck with that step outside.
It's frozen instantly.

2213
02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:52.570
There's a guy who lives in Alaska and he's a Q maker and uh,

2214
02:09:52.590 --> 02:09:54.760
he was on the phone with a friend of his and uh,

2215
02:09:54.761 --> 02:09:59.350
he took a bucket of hot water and it was so cold that he took a bucket of on the

2216
02:09:59.351 --> 02:10:01.720
phone with him.
He said,
well,
I'm watching,
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna do this for you.

2217
02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:03.580
I'll throw the water.
This is how cold it is.

2218
02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:07.240
He throws the hot water up in the air before it hits the ground.
It's frozen.

2219
02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:10.840
It was 90,
below zero or something.
Fucking crazy.

2220
02:10:11.630 --> 02:10:15.590
<v 4>See if I,
if I have to be subsistence,
I don't want to do it there.</v>

2221
02:10:16.170 --> 02:10:21.150
<v 0>Woo.
But it's so glorious.
Like when you see these people that are,
you know,</v>

2222
02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:24.780
hunting Caribou or a hunting black bear and you see the landscape that they're

2223
02:10:24.781 --> 02:10:27.990
traveling on and how few people there are one of them.

2224
02:10:27.991 --> 02:10:31.290
Was this a family that's related to the singer jewel?

2225
02:10:31.530 --> 02:10:36.140
Do you know the singer jewel?
It,
her family's Iceland?
No.
Well,

2226
02:10:36.141 --> 02:10:37.550
our family,
um,
I think,

2227
02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:42.820
I think the family is originally from like Sweden or some shit.

2228
02:10:43.341 --> 02:10:45.950
And then when Hitler was storming Europe,

2229
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:50.600
they decided to move to Alaska and start this subsistence living and singer

2230
02:10:50.601 --> 02:10:55.550
jewel comes from this family.
Oh Shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And um,
I'm pretty sure,

2231
02:10:55.610 --> 02:10:57.650
I hope it's not bullshit.
Wow.
But uh,
to,

2232
02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:02.680
to watch the show with this family's like living on the same piece of land that

2233
02:11:02.721 --> 02:11:07.490
their grandfather got in like the 1940s.
It's amazing stuff.

2234
02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:11.180
Really,
really interesting stuff.
You know,
they're just out there.

2235
02:11:11.181 --> 02:11:15.860
They have cattle and then the entire year is a collection run.

2236
02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:20.450
It's just run around,
collect,
hey,
run around and collect animals,

2237
02:11:20.451 --> 02:11:23.240
freeze them,
collect fish.
And they're,

2238
02:11:23.250 --> 02:11:24.890
they have nights where they don't have anything to eat.

2239
02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:27.710
And then they have to get up in the morning and go trap rabbits.
And you know,

2240
02:11:27.711 --> 02:11:31.610
it's like,
whoa.
Like that is a nutty fucking wait to live man.

2241
02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:37.040
But yeah.
Meanwhile,
how much different is it than someone living check to check,

2242
02:11:37.070 --> 02:11:37.581
you know,

2243
02:11:37.581 --> 02:11:41.420
and being on the subway with a bunch of other crazy assholes or watching someone

2244
02:11:41.421 --> 02:11:43.870
get pushed in front of the car,
you know,

2245
02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:48.400
the weirdness that we have to deal with in modern society.
Yeah.
Well the,

2246
02:11:48.401 --> 02:11:51.650
the fact is the stress level's much lower.
I suppose.

2247
02:11:51.651 --> 02:11:56.030
Skate we were talking about earlier,
one of his big points he makes about stress,

2248
02:11:56.031 --> 02:12:00.920
he wrote a book called why zebras don't get ulcers,
which is a pretty good book.

2249
02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:05.270
Um,
but he makes this big distinction between chronic stress and acute stress.

2250
02:12:05.271 --> 02:12:09.980
Right.
And we're evolved to deal with acute stress.
Like,
you know,
sleep,
not,

2251
02:12:10.070 --> 02:12:12.080
not eating one night,
you know,
there's no food.

2252
02:12:12.081 --> 02:12:13.670
So you go out the next day and you deal with that.

2253
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:16.820
What we're not evolved to deal with is chronic stress.
You know,

2254
02:12:16.821 --> 02:12:21.260
sitting in traffic every day,
you know,
waking up to an alarm clock every morning,

2255
02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:26.060
you know,
the,
all of this on the subway every day or whatever it is,
you know,

2256
02:12:26.061 --> 02:12:29.660
that's,
we're not evolved to deal with that.
That's what wipes the sound.

2257
02:12:29.661 --> 02:12:33.490
It makes us crazy cancer and all kinds of other shit.
The,
um,

2258
02:12:33.530 --> 02:12:37.580
the kind of stress that we deal with on a regular basis of the stress of not

2259
02:12:37.581 --> 02:12:38.540
wanting to do something,

2260
02:12:38.541 --> 02:12:42.720
but having to do it all day and being not satisfying whatsoever.
Right.

2261
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:46.010
The process,
what you were talking about earlier,
the process of gathering food,

2262
02:12:46.011 --> 02:12:48.920
creating food,
growing food,
um,
and,
and,

2263
02:12:49.190 --> 02:12:53.810
and catching fish or whatever is very satisfying.
Right?
It's like,
it feels great.

2264
02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:57.650
Well,
that's what we do for vacation,
right?
It's like,
that's how they live.

2265
02:12:57.651 --> 02:13:00.560
We go fishing,
we go hunting,
you know,
go hiking in the mountains.

2266
02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:04.430
That's what they're doing day to day.
Yeah,
of course they're fucking happy.

2267
02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:08.740
You know,
there were these people on Darwin's boat.
Do you know about the,

2268
02:13:08.741 --> 02:13:13.730
I think I talked about,
we talked to one in sex at dawn.
Um,
uh,
it was Jimmy,

2269
02:13:13.731 --> 02:13:17.300
Jimmy York,
and there were three adolescent,

2270
02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:20.180
a few gins,
Indians that,

2271
02:13:20.210 --> 02:13:23.840
that the captain of the Beagle had picked up on an earlier voyage.

2272
02:13:23.841 --> 02:13:25.090
These kids and they,

2273
02:13:25.180 --> 02:13:29.810
he took them back to England so they could be educated in England and see the

2274
02:13:29.811 --> 02:13:32.250
glory of the English life and proper

2275
02:13:32.250 --> 02:13:37.230
<v 4>living properly and all that.
And then on the,
on the,
the voyage Darwin was on,</v>

2276
02:13:37.231 --> 02:13:42.060
they were taking them back to Tierra del Fuego where they were going to teach

2277
02:13:42.061 --> 02:13:45.870
their people like how to come out of the woods and live properly and all that.

2278
02:13:46.410 --> 02:13:50.190
And so Darwin knew these people really well and by the time they got there,

2279
02:13:50.191 --> 02:13:53.030
they built them a cabin.
They made a garden,

2280
02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:55.350
they got them all set up and they left them there and said,
okay,

2281
02:13:55.351 --> 02:13:56.580
we'll be back in three months.

2282
02:13:56.581 --> 02:13:58.860
They took off and they were mapping the coast of South America.

2283
02:13:58.861 --> 02:14:02.130
They came back three months later,
the cabin was abandoned,

2284
02:14:02.131 --> 02:14:04.950
the garden was completely grown over and nobody was there.

2285
02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:07.740
So they went looking for them,
put out word,
they wanted to see them.

2286
02:14:07.741 --> 02:14:11.130
And finally one of them came back and went out on the boat to have dinner with

2287
02:14:11.131 --> 02:14:16.050
Darwin and the captain and they were like,
what's,
you know what happened?
Wait,

2288
02:14:16.051 --> 02:14:20.160
will you wait?
What did you do?
What's going on?
And he's like,
man,
he's like,

2289
02:14:20.161 --> 02:14:23.550
he said,
why should I farm?
There are plenty birdies.
Plenty.

2290
02:14:23.551 --> 02:14:27.570
Fishies it's like forget that farming shit.
You know,

2291
02:14:27.571 --> 02:14:29.290
like all everything we taught you,

2292
02:14:29.291 --> 02:14:32.400
you abandon it in a couple of months to go back and live in the mountains.

2293
02:14:32.401 --> 02:14:35.950
You know,
something that looks miserable to the British.
Right.

2294
02:14:36.150 --> 02:14:38.880
But for the people who had experienced both sides,
they were like,

2295
02:14:38.881 --> 02:14:43.560
fuck that man wearing these silly uncomfortable shoes and clothes and digging in

2296
02:14:43.561 --> 02:14:46.760
the dirt.
There are plenty of fish and birds and stuff to eat.
Yeah.

2297
02:14:46.770 --> 02:14:51.360
When you see farmers you don't think like happy good time singing around the

2298
02:14:51.361 --> 02:14:54.760
campfire,
stoic existence,
right.

2299
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:59.730
Rising in the morning and milking like washing the plows and it looks like
death.

2300
02:14:59.910 --> 02:15:02.890
Whereas like hunting and gathering is kind of fun.
Yeah.

2301
02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:06.720
It's inherently enjoyable.
But why?
Because that's how we evolve.

2302
02:15:07.650 --> 02:15:10.710
Gardening is fun.
Gardening is you got to find like there's a,

2303
02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.910
there's like a middle ground between gardening and being a farmer and there's

2304
02:15:14.911 --> 02:15:17.880
something about having domesticated animals that's pretty nice too.

2305
02:15:17.940 --> 02:15:21.570
Short chickens and you know,
they have eggs every morning and the super fresh.

2306
02:15:21.571 --> 02:15:23.550
And if you've never had like fresh eggs,

2307
02:15:23.770 --> 02:15:26.370
the really is a difference in the way they taste like an egg that comes right

2308
02:15:26.371 --> 02:15:29.490
out of a chicken.
You eat it that day.
They,
that's a,
it's very delicious.

2309
02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:32.640
If you could have chickens,
that'd be any,
kill those bitches and eat them too.

2310
02:15:32.641 --> 02:15:34.440
If the shit hits the fan until you what?

2311
02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:39.450
[inaudible] my wife was raised in Mozambique and she used to go out in the

2312
02:15:39.450 --> 02:15:43.460
summers to her grandmother's farm,
which is like rural Mozambique is rural,
right.

2313
02:15:43.870 --> 02:15:47.430
And they had to,
they had a dog that was eaten by a tiger and shit,
you know,

2314
02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:49.940
seriously row.
So,

2315
02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:55.160
so one day Cassie and I are in Amsterdamse beautiful spring day by a canal and

2316
02:15:55.591 --> 02:15:58.180
these ducks are paddling by,
it's just like,
you know,

2317
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:59.850
it's a for me or painting or something.

2318
02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:04.080
And Cassie's looking at the ducks really intently.
And I said,

2319
02:16:04.350 --> 02:16:06.630
what are you thinking?
She said,
oh,

2320
02:16:06.631 --> 02:16:10.350
I was just thinking how great it would be to grab that duck in the front and

2321
02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:15.300
break its neck and gut it and pluck it and stuff it with garlic and peppers and

2322
02:16:15.301 --> 02:16:19.050
you know,
like she had this whole thing like the way her grandmother used to do,

2323
02:16:19.051 --> 02:16:22.830
you know,
tell ya if the income she's,
she's in charge of food.

2324
02:16:23.970 --> 02:16:28.870
No problem.
It's funny how people eat meat,
but yet look at that in a very,
uh,

2325
02:16:29.550 --> 02:16:30.383
you know,

2326
02:16:30.430 --> 02:16:33.180
<v 5>as being a distasteful thing to think as being,</v>

2327
02:16:34.220 --> 02:16:38.240
<v 4>yeah,
I mean I,
I'm ashamed,
but it's true.
It would be hard for me to kill.</v>

2328
02:16:38.890 --> 02:16:41.170
<v 5>Do you think that these ideas,</v>

2329
02:16:41.260 --> 02:16:46.060
have you ever considered that this is a part of what it is,

2330
02:16:46.061 --> 02:16:48.550
sort of the natural progression from the,
the,

2331
02:16:48.551 --> 02:16:52.530
the ape from the ape that lives in the forest to being this sort of an

2332
02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:57.010
enlightened aware thing with massive access to information that somewhere along

2333
02:16:57.011 --> 02:17:00.940
the line we must separate ourselves from the hunter gatherer instincts and

2334
02:17:00.941 --> 02:17:01.721
reward systems.

2335
02:17:01.721 --> 02:17:06.721
And one of the ways to do that is with antidepressants and supermarkets and that

2336
02:17:06.731 --> 02:17:11.230
like is a slow push away and that we have to fulfill these weird needs and other

2337
02:17:11.231 --> 02:17:14.560
ways and that sort of facilitates the great machine.
Okay.

2338
02:17:14.710 --> 02:17:15.570
<v 4>Yeah.
I mean,
I,</v>

2339
02:17:15.571 --> 02:17:19.840
I think it is essentially a struggle between the interests of the machine and

2340
02:17:19.841 --> 02:17:22.720
the interest of the organisms that live within it.

2341
02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:27.340
And so I what I'm hoping I'll,
although I'm not that hopeful,

2342
02:17:27.341 --> 02:17:31.210
but I'm,
I'm hoping that at some point our intelligence,

2343
02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:32.553
uh,

2344
02:17:32.590 --> 02:17:37.540
allows us to consciously choose

2345
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:42.230
our own interests over the interests of the machine.
Right?
I mean,

2346
02:17:42.231 --> 02:17:45.410
it's what you were talking about earlier,
developing,
uh,

2347
02:17:45.411 --> 02:17:48.020
sources of energy that don't destroy the planet.
You know,

2348
02:17:48.021 --> 02:17:52.640
developing ways to interact that is respectful of our individuality and,
and,

2349
02:17:52.900 --> 02:17:54.950
you know,
developing,
um,

2350
02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:59.780
sexual mores that allow people to get pleasure in their lives.
I mean,

2351
02:17:59.781 --> 02:18:04.040
I was talking to a friend the other night who's gone through a crisis and,
um,

2352
02:18:04.750 --> 02:18:05.320
<v 2>okay.</v>

2353
02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:08.090
<v 4>He said,
you know,
it was,
it was a Christmas Eve,
right?</v>

2354
02:18:08.091 --> 02:18:11.890
So everyone's with their families.
All his friends were sorta on out of touch.
He,

2355
02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:14.890
he really didn't have anybody to hang out with and he was going through a really

2356
02:18:14.891 --> 02:18:16.720
hard time with a family member and stuff.

2357
02:18:17.020 --> 02:18:21.610
He ended up in a strip club paying a woman $300 to hold him.

2358
02:18:23.130 --> 02:18:25.980
Well,
right.
That's the kind of world we're in.

2359
02:18:26.460 --> 02:18:26.690
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2360
02:18:26.690 --> 02:18:31.090
<v 4>You know,
it's people are touched,
starved babies or touch star.</v>

2361
02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:34.010
A lot of my will tell you it's not even about the massage,

2362
02:18:34.011 --> 02:18:35.870
it's about being touched.
Right?

2363
02:18:36.050 --> 02:18:39.190
So I think at some point I'm,

2364
02:18:39.710 --> 02:18:43.460
we have to recognize like,
wait a minute,
this is going in one direction.

2365
02:18:43.490 --> 02:18:47.090
But the things that actually make us happy are not out there.

2366
02:18:47.091 --> 02:18:48.380
They're not in that direction.

2367
02:18:48.770 --> 02:18:52.910
And the only way we can slow it down or stop it or even change direction,

2368
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:57.590
I think is learning to have far fewer people on the planet.

2369
02:18:58.130 --> 02:18:59.630
Because the more people there are,

2370
02:18:59.650 --> 02:19:02.690
the more that wheel gets fueled and spins faster and faster.

2371
02:19:02.691 --> 02:19:05.600
And the only way to slow it down is far fewer people,

2372
02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:07.220
especially in other countries.

2373
02:19:07.250 --> 02:19:10.820
I mean the United States is probably the best country in the world,

2374
02:19:10.821 --> 02:19:14.420
so we can keep our numbers very high.
So keep having as many kids as you like,

2375
02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:17.030
but [inaudible] you Mexican immigrants.
Yeah.

2376
02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:18.390
<v 5>Um,
that's a weird,</v>

2377
02:19:18.670 --> 02:19:21.930
it's a weird thing to say to people that people get very defensive when you talk

2378
02:19:21.931 --> 02:19:24.240
about reducing the number of people on the planet.

2379
02:19:24.390 --> 02:19:27.500
<v 4>I'm not saying to kill anybody,
but there's no other way to do it.</v>

2380
02:19:27.730 --> 02:19:30.230
They can't live if they can't live someone's,
we're all done.

2381
02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:32.630
We're all going to die.
Let him die.
You know,
attrition.

2382
02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:34.700
We can let it go with attrition,
but w what,

2383
02:19:34.850 --> 02:19:37.820
<v 5>what's going on with health and nutrition and science and Madison,</v>

2384
02:19:37.821 --> 02:19:40.910
it's like prolonging lifespans and stretching people out.

2385
02:19:40.911 --> 02:19:44.330
Like that's an interesting,
what if it becomes infinite?
I mean there,
there's,

2386
02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:47.420
there's talk it especially if you're in the Kurzweil camp setting,

2387
02:19:47.421 --> 02:19:49.280
I'd be able to extend lifespan.

2388
02:19:49.310 --> 02:19:52.460
Like Aubrey de Grey believes that within the next hundred years are going to be

2389
02:19:52.461 --> 02:19:54.020
able to be a thousand years old.

2390
02:19:54.580 --> 02:19:58.440
<v 4>You have a C.
I think a lot of that thinking is based on faulty assumptions.</v>

2391
02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:00.810
Maybe not him in particular,

2392
02:20:00.811 --> 02:20:04.470
but there's a section in sex at dawn where we talk about the longevity lie,

2393
02:20:04.860 --> 02:20:08.580
you know,
which is that most people think that human beings in prehistory,

2394
02:20:08.581 --> 02:20:12.690
these ancestors we've been talking about only,
you know,
live to 35 or so.

2395
02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:16.110
Somebody is 30 was an old person.
Well Noah was 600.

2396
02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:22.700
He was an exception.
We know he was exceptional.
Um,

2397
02:20:22.740 --> 02:20:26.590
so,
so a lot of people are saying,
well,
hey,
we've doubled the human lifespan.

2398
02:20:26.670 --> 02:20:31.350
Why can't we continued it?
But it hasn't doubled.
Human lifespan is 60,

2399
02:20:31.351 --> 02:20:34.890
70,
75 years.
Even in the wild.

2400
02:20:35.290 --> 02:20:38.640
I rarely 75 years,
but it,
you know,

2401
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:43.230
we're not going to,
there's no evidence that the human lifespan has doubled ever.

2402
02:20:43.470 --> 02:20:46.530
So this thinking that we can just keep,
you know,

2403
02:20:47.010 --> 02:20:50.610
increasing it isn't going to work.
What are you sending me man?

2404
02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:55.440
Sending me texts?
It was the lamp was fairly,
oh,

2405
02:20:57.720 --> 02:21:00.630
I thought you were trying to tell me something and a secret message.
Yeah,
me too.

2406
02:21:00.631 --> 02:21:03.000
Like,
get rid of this guest.
How

2407
02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.700
<v 5>dare you.
This is fascinating stuff,
man.
Um,</v>

2408
02:21:05.701 --> 02:21:10.290
do you think it is also possible that,
as you know,

2409
02:21:10.291 --> 02:21:12.240
I would not like to go back to being a monkey?

2410
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:16.230
I would not like to go back to picking cow patties up and looking for bugs to

2411
02:21:16.231 --> 02:21:16.950
eat.
Right.

2412
02:21:16.950 --> 02:21:20.310
We have progressed to the point where we are now living in a civilized,

2413
02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:23.580
civilized society,
which I enjoy.
I enjoy the Internet.

2414
02:21:23.790 --> 02:21:28.140
I enjoy television and restaurants.
I enjoy cars.
I enjoy going to the movies.

2415
02:21:28.141 --> 02:21:32.700
I enjoy a lot of the aspects I so I don't necessarily buy the idea that no one

2416
02:21:32.701 --> 02:21:36.270
is happy and that's impossible to be happy in this environment.

2417
02:21:36.570 --> 02:21:40.200
Is it possible that it's just simply a matter of catch up and that we all must

2418
02:21:40.201 --> 02:21:42.540
sort of morph and move on with the times?

2419
02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:47.750
Just as we have in going from being monkeys with no houses to people with

2420
02:21:47.761 --> 02:21:49.950
houses,
two guys with cars,
right.

2421
02:21:49.950 --> 02:21:54.560
I mean that this is just a natural part of the progression of the universe and

2422
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:57.880
then the idea of hanging onto the past,

2423
02:21:57.881 --> 02:22:01.730
this nostalgia for the simpler times,
it's really kind of silly.
Right?

2424
02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:05.980
And that even our notions about sexuality or notions of,
uh,

2425
02:22:06.030 --> 02:22:07.890
communication and privacy,

2426
02:22:08.190 --> 02:22:11.820
all those are sort of ancient and they're,
they're really,

2427
02:22:11.821 --> 02:22:14.520
there are only applicable to a world where the internet doesn't exist.

2428
02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:19.080
And as that this internet gets stronger and stronger and more and more
pervasive,

2429
02:22:19.081 --> 02:22:20.190
which is obviously doing,

2430
02:22:20.610 --> 02:22:24.540
it's going to eventually get to some point where it's ridiculous to think that

2431
02:22:24.541 --> 02:22:26.760
you could ever like the people in the taiga.

2432
02:22:27.580 --> 02:22:32.150
<v 4>I hear you man.
But,
but that argument's very similar to saying,
um,</v>

2433
02:22:32.740 --> 02:22:36.490
look,
you know,
the,
the sort of holistic,
the food you get at whole foods,

2434
02:22:36.491 --> 02:22:39.040
people can't afford that.
And a lot of it's bullshit anyway.

2435
02:22:39.041 --> 02:22:42.400
Even if it's labeled organic or whatever free range,
it's still the DA,
Da,
Da,
da.

2436
02:22:42.610 --> 02:22:46.270
So,
you know,
we should all just deal with it and eat it Mcdonald's,

2437
02:22:46.271 --> 02:22:47.710
because that's where we're going.

2438
02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:51.430
Maybe there's a practical truth to that,

2439
02:22:51.640 --> 02:22:54.280
but the problem is it just like the body,

2440
02:22:54.281 --> 02:22:58.320
if you don't give the body the exercise patterns,
the sleep,
the,

2441
02:22:58.390 --> 02:23:01.720
the nutritional content and so on,
the fiber and all that,

2442
02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:06.840
it evolved to want whatever you think about whatever.

2443
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:11.800
However your your identity or your sense of life has adapted,

2444
02:23:12.190 --> 02:23:15.220
your body still won't respond to it correctly.
Right.

2445
02:23:15.221 --> 02:23:18.450
You'll still get sick and die from it.
So there's a level I,
you know,

2446
02:23:18.460 --> 02:23:22.330
I have a friend who's a cardiologist who says to me,
I don't feel stress.
Right?

2447
02:23:22.720 --> 02:23:24.550
I don't feel it.
I was like,
dude,
you feel it.

2448
02:23:24.580 --> 02:23:27.760
Even if you don't think you feel that,
you still feel it and you're,
you're,

2449
02:23:27.761 --> 02:23:30.310
I mean,
and I'm arguing about stress with a cardiologist,

2450
02:23:30.311 --> 02:23:34.870
which isn't a good thing to do,
but he's,
you know,
we asked too,
he's human.

2451
02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:39.460
That's the point.
You know,
I think even traffic is tress.
Exactly.

2452
02:23:39.490 --> 02:23:42.340
Well and sticking a catheter up somebodies,
you know,

2453
02:23:42.341 --> 02:23:46.030
artery to fuck around with their heart,
it's gotta be stressful,
you know,

2454
02:23:46.860 --> 02:23:50.550
<v 5>intensity and that intensity is stressful.
You know,
it's like people,</v>

2455
02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:54.330
even great things.
The idea of stress is always sort of,

2456
02:23:54.370 --> 02:23:58.320
it has a negative connotation,
but it's intensity.

2457
02:23:58.350 --> 02:24:01.710
It's like whether anything you,
if you're playing a video game with stressful,

2458
02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:04.630
I mean,
it's your,
your system is being taxed.
You know,

2459
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:07.380
you're looking at all these graphics,
you're moving around.
That is trust fall.

2460
02:24:07.381 --> 02:24:11.490
It's not that negative.
Right.
You know,
you're red lining shit,
you know?

2461
02:24:11.610 --> 02:24:16.020
<v 4>Yeah.
Your system is not necessarily set up.
So I mean,
to answer your question,</v>

2462
02:24:16.021 --> 02:24:20.040
I think that's a legitimate argument for sure and in a legitimate critique of

2463
02:24:20.041 --> 02:24:21.030
all this sort of thinking.

2464
02:24:21.031 --> 02:24:24.690
But I do think that there's a part of the human organism that,

2465
02:24:24.750 --> 02:24:28.530
that can't adapt anywhere near as fast as society's changing.

2466
02:24:28.531 --> 02:24:33.330
So it'll always be stuck in the pleistocene and the only way to deal with it has

2467
02:24:33.331 --> 02:24:38.100
to understand what that environment was like and try to adapt your life in

2468
02:24:38.101 --> 02:24:42.950
important ways to bring it into,
into sync with that way of life.
I completely

2469
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:43.221
<v 5>agree.</v>

2470
02:24:43.221 --> 02:24:47.210
And I don't mean to suggest in any way that people shouldn't sort of manage

2471
02:24:47.211 --> 02:24:51.980
their consciousness in a more valuable way or in a more,
a more applicable way.

2472
02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:54.640
You know what I'm saying is that I,

2473
02:24:54.740 --> 02:24:57.260
when I look at the progression of the,

2474
02:24:57.261 --> 02:25:01.730
the ape like creatures that we must have been at one point in time to what we

2475
02:25:01.731 --> 02:25:05.390
are today.
I mean,
what is it going to be like a thousand years from now,

2476
02:25:05.391 --> 02:25:07.790
a hundred thousand years,
for a million years from now,

2477
02:25:07.791 --> 02:25:10.280
we're obviously going to be something completely different.

2478
02:25:10.530 --> 02:25:14.600
We're going to be moot if we exist in the same physical form.

2479
02:25:14.810 --> 02:25:16.310
It's going to be very odd.
It's gonna.

2480
02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:18.350
It's going to be something that's going to happen.

2481
02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:23.620
And this really seems to be like a matter of trying to enjoy this thing that

2482
02:25:23.951 --> 02:25:26.710
you're trapped in this,
this dimension and you're trapped in.

2483
02:25:26.860 --> 02:25:30.280
And one of the ways inherently that's the,

2484
02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:34.930
I think it's very important is to appreciate the physical.
And because the,

2485
02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:38.260
especially with,
um,
people,
I don't want to say intellectuals,

2486
02:25:38.261 --> 02:25:39.540
but people that fancy themselves,

2487
02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:42.050
intellectuals more than true intellectuals cause a true intellectual,

2488
02:25:42.051 --> 02:25:44.790
we'll probably check taking into account all the different variables and,

2489
02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:49.150
and understand that the body is of your meat vehicle has to be tended to in the

2490
02:25:49.151 --> 02:25:51.550
proper way in order for you to get the right feelings from it.

2491
02:25:51.690 --> 02:25:54.130
And it part of your negative feelings with your mind.

2492
02:25:54.131 --> 02:25:57.460
It's got to be connected to this thing that's carrying you around.
Right?
Um,

2493
02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:00.790
but I think that concentrating on that,

2494
02:26:00.791 --> 02:26:05.590
it's thought as being a base thing,
like a not important a,
uh,
you know,

2495
02:26:05.591 --> 02:26:10.090
it's out just so rudimentary.
It's so unnecessary.
It's so,

2496
02:26:10.370 --> 02:26:13.600
so a bish you know,
we don't really need to concentrate on that,

2497
02:26:13.601 --> 02:26:17.350
but we really do sexually as far as the,

2498
02:26:17.351 --> 02:26:21.160
the stress that you get from everyday life of input.

2499
02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:24.790
I'm a big believer in the sensory deprivation tank.

2500
02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:28.300
We have one in my basement and uh,
I've,
I've been using them for years.

2501
02:26:28.301 --> 02:26:32.170
And one of the best things about the sensory deprivation tank is that it offers

2502
02:26:32.171 --> 02:26:36.140
you this environment where nothing's coming at you and like literally nothing,

2503
02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:38.110
no sensory input at all.

2504
02:26:38.260 --> 02:26:42.420
And it's so hard to achieve that anywhere else in the world.
Well,

2505
02:26:42.430 --> 02:26:45.190
when you're in that tank,
there's just nothing.

2506
02:26:45.310 --> 02:26:48.460
You're floating through space and you,
you,
nothing's coming at you.

2507
02:26:48.461 --> 02:26:49.900
And it's such a recharge,

2508
02:26:50.260 --> 02:26:53.410
so much better for me than sitting in front of the television for an hour or

2509
02:26:53.411 --> 02:26:56.470
sitting in a couch,
which you have the nice things to do to relax.

2510
02:26:56.471 --> 02:26:59.140
It's nice to sit back and just veg out for a little bit.

2511
02:26:59.141 --> 02:27:04.060
But that environment is something that not enough people experience the

2512
02:27:04.061 --> 02:27:07.510
environment of the isolation tank and John Lilly?
No,
no.

2513
02:27:07.511 --> 02:27:10.960
He was gone before I found out about it all.
I think he died,

2514
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.380
I don't know when he died actually,
but

2515
02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:17.740
<v 4>late seventies maybe.
Yeah,
I friends family knew him.
Oh yeah.</v>

2516
02:27:18.190 --> 02:27:21.770
Fascinating dude.
Yeah.
Stan,
you should meet Stanley sometimes.

2517
02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:26.640
Stanley knew everybody.
Stanley was this,
my professor in Grad School and uh,

2518
02:27:27.130 --> 02:27:32.130
we had breakfast together one day when I first started and a w and then later I

2519
02:27:32.951 --> 02:27:35.860
got a note saying,
you know,
Dr Kripner would like to meet you,
you know,

2520
02:27:35.861 --> 02:27:39.340
come to his office,
whatever.
I go talk to him and he's just sweet old guy.

2521
02:27:39.820 --> 02:27:44.370
And he says,
listen,
you know,
your life sounds pretty a on an anchor.

2522
02:27:44.371 --> 02:27:46.360
Do you know you've got a lot of freedom in your life.

2523
02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:49.870
I'm going to Brazil in two months.
Would you like to go with me?

2524
02:27:50.020 --> 02:27:51.360
All expenses paid.
You know,

2525
02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:54.430
the people who are inviting me to Brazil will pay for my assistant to go,

2526
02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:56.800
whatever.
It's like,
fuck yeah,
let's go.

2527
02:27:57.130 --> 02:27:59.140
So I went to Brazil with Stanley and then how long?

2528
02:27:59.710 --> 02:28:02.000
That was like 10 days or something.
Wow.

2529
02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:07.280
And Out Stanley is one of the world's most renowned experts in things like

2530
02:28:07.931 --> 02:28:12.110
telepathy on altered states of consciousness and shamanism,

2531
02:28:12.140 --> 02:28:14.840
dream interpretation,
all this kind of Freaky d.
What's his first name?

2532
02:28:15.250 --> 02:28:19.740
Stanley Kripner.
K.
R.
I.
P.
P.
N.
E.
R.
Two.
Let's get them.

2533
02:28:19.980 --> 02:28:23.680
Can we get them?
Oh,
he's super cool.
No,
you can gal.
I'll have him come down yet.

2534
02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:25.490
He's 80.
He just turned 80.

2535
02:28:25.491 --> 02:28:29.320
We were at his birthday party in Berkeley a couple of weeks ago.
Wow.
Uh,

2536
02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:32.660
Daniel Ellsberg was there.
Stan Groff.
I mean,

2537
02:28:32.661 --> 02:28:36.740
Stanley tripped with Timothy leary.
He knew,
he knew Alan Watts.

2538
02:28:36.741 --> 02:28:37.610
You know this whole,

2539
02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:42.650
like intellectual 60 seventies hippy intellectual scene.

2540
02:28:42.651 --> 02:28:43.940
Stanley was the young guy.

2541
02:28:43.941 --> 02:28:47.720
He was the like in house psychologist for the grateful dead for years.

2542
02:28:47.721 --> 02:28:51.620
Hung out with on an inhouse psychologist.
He was just,
he was,

2543
02:28:51.621 --> 02:28:52.371
you know what he was,

2544
02:28:52.371 --> 02:28:55.700
he was what you were talking about earlier where like the prominent people just

2545
02:28:55.701 --> 02:28:57.200
have a smart guy hang around.

2546
02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:00.770
That's what Stanley was the smart guy who's smart with the grateful dead.

2547
02:29:00.860 --> 02:29:03.860
That's a,
that's a brilliant move.
Yeah.
Have a dude like that around with you.

2548
02:29:03.990 --> 02:29:06.320
Yeah.
When you went to those,
Brian,

2549
02:29:07.250 --> 02:29:10.650
we need to get a super smart dude come around with us.
Joey Diaz

2550
02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:15.350
<v 5>for you.
Joey Diaz represents the oracle.</v>

2551
02:29:16.010 --> 02:29:19.730
He's the impossible knowledge that can never be achieved.

2552
02:29:19.830 --> 02:29:23.160
<v 4>Is it about that be a daddy today?
I think that's an easy today.
Tonight.</v>

2553
02:29:23.161 --> 02:29:26.430
Tonight I'm thinking to induce.
Wow.
He tweeted something today about like,

2554
02:29:26.431 --> 02:29:31.020
this is his last day of having no responsibilities.
There's wow.

2555
02:29:31.260 --> 02:29:34.500
Crazy.
So,
um,
this,
this book

2556
02:29:34.620 --> 02:29:38.340
<v 5>and the,
the information that you,
you,
you put out from it,</v>

2557
02:29:38.730 --> 02:29:41.200
how has it been received?
Have you,
um,

2558
02:29:41.250 --> 02:29:44.280
I mean it's obviously a very successful book,
but have,

2559
02:29:44.281 --> 02:29:47.710
what kind of criticism have you,
uh,
had to encounter with,

2560
02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:50.720
<v 4>it's been interesting that the,
um,</v>

2561
02:29:51.740 --> 02:29:54.920
I would say the response has been 95% positive,

2562
02:29:55.610 --> 02:29:59.510
which is not at all what we expected.
We were expecting 50,
50 at best.

2563
02:30:00.270 --> 02:30:04.870
Um,
the negative criticism has been,
yeah,

2564
02:30:04.910 --> 02:30:06.860
I'm going to sound like an asshole saying this,

2565
02:30:06.861 --> 02:30:09.200
but I think most of it has been pretty emotional.

2566
02:30:09.380 --> 02:30:13.970
It hasn't been a arguing the intellectual points made in the book.

2567
02:30:13.971 --> 02:30:18.870
It's been just sort of freaking out.
Um,
like one of the first reviews was,

2568
02:30:18.890 --> 02:30:23.300
uh,
by,
uh,
an economist named Megan mcardle,
one of the first negative reviews.

2569
02:30:23.810 --> 02:30:28.140
Uh,
she reviewed it and her blog and she just said,
like,
she just,
she,

2570
02:30:28.280 --> 02:30:31.040
first of all it said it was written really poorly and blah,
blah,
blah.

2571
02:30:31.041 --> 02:30:34.550
But then she said,
um,
human beings are not like,
Bonobos,

2572
02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:36.110
you know how I know this?

2573
02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:40.700
And then in bold because we're not like Benobos that was her argument.

2574
02:30:40.940 --> 02:30:41.960
That's a silly argument.

2575
02:30:42.350 --> 02:30:45.580
That's a chick who's worried that her pussy is not that valuable.
Yeah.

2576
02:30:46.220 --> 02:30:50.420
She had just recently been married.
Actually someone told me later,
yeah,

2577
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:53.030
probably was like totally clinging to the idea

2578
02:30:53.150 --> 02:30:54.440
<v 5>monogamy,
but you know,</v>

2579
02:30:54.441 --> 02:30:58.880
you're not discounting the idea of a happy monogamous life in that book at all.

2580
02:30:58.910 --> 02:31:03.260
What you're doing is just talking about the real history of human beings.

2581
02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:05.810
And,
um,
I didn't find it.
I was,

2582
02:31:06.020 --> 02:31:09.170
I thought it was going because I had heard the resistance about it.

2583
02:31:09.171 --> 02:31:12.740
I thought it was going to be much more controversial than it was.
But it,
I mean,

2584
02:31:12.741 --> 02:31:14.120
not,
not really much more,

2585
02:31:14.121 --> 02:31:17.810
but I thought it was possible based on the reactions that I had heard from

2586
02:31:17.811 --> 02:31:19.070
people.
But I thought it was,

2587
02:31:19.470 --> 02:31:22.830
<v 4>you know,
pretty factual.
Well,
and we're not arguing,</v>

2588
02:31:22.831 --> 02:31:26.310
and this is a point I have to make an in interviews all the time and we're not

2589
02:31:26.311 --> 02:31:29.280
arguing that there's anything wrong with monogamy.

2590
02:31:29.850 --> 02:31:33.180
Just like we're not arguing that there's anything wrong with vegetarianism,

2591
02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:34.050
right?

2592
02:31:34.050 --> 02:31:38.130
You can choose to be a vegetarian and it can be smart and healthy and ethical

2593
02:31:38.131 --> 02:31:42.780
and you know,
very good decision,
but don't expect it to come naturally to you.

2594
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:46.200
Just because you've chosen to be a vegetarian doesn't mean bacon suddenly

2595
02:31:46.210 --> 02:31:48.910
doesn't smell good anymore.
Right?
So,
you know,

2596
02:31:48.930 --> 02:31:52.140
understand you're going to have challenges if you take that path.

2597
02:31:52.141 --> 02:31:53.100
It's an uphill path.

2598
02:31:53.101 --> 02:31:56.550
And the reason it's an uphill path is because your ancestors lived like this,

2599
02:31:56.580 --> 02:31:57.413
you know?

2600
02:31:57.450 --> 02:32:02.070
So to me there's no advice implicit in that and we,

2601
02:32:02.071 --> 02:32:05.690
we got a lot of pressure actually from publishers to make it,
uh,

2602
02:32:06.060 --> 02:32:09.930
like a self help kind of book real.
Oh yeah.
They were really into that.

2603
02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:12.870
Well that's something we were talking about before we started recording about

2604
02:32:12.871 --> 02:32:15.750
dealing with people and dealing with publishers.

2605
02:32:16.740 --> 02:32:20.460
Anybody who wants to sort of like direct your vision,
right.
Of what,
you know,

2606
02:32:20.461 --> 02:32:22.650
ultimately your book is your art.
I mean this is your,

2607
02:32:22.651 --> 02:32:26.140
your take on your work on this particular subject.
But yeah,

2608
02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:28.110
someone will come along and say,
you know what,

2609
02:32:28.111 --> 02:32:30.570
it'd be more entertaining if you decided to make it a game show.

2610
02:32:31.730 --> 02:32:36.360
It's sex at dawn,
the game show.
If someone approached us recently,

2611
02:32:36.361 --> 02:32:40.470
you wanted to make,
uh,
an illustrated kids version.
Whoa,
Jack.
Yeah.

2612
02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:43.670
That's a channel that I want to leave origins out of that.
How do you,

2613
02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:48.180
how do you do cartoon orgies?
Like Sponge Bob Square pants type dudes?

2614
02:32:48.690 --> 02:32:52.710
What do you,
sorry.
No,
please.
I was just gonna say other reactions,

2615
02:32:52.711 --> 02:32:56.400
like one woman,
uh,

2616
02:32:56.430 --> 02:33:01.430
didn't believe Kasota really exists that my publisher and I can spire to make up

2617
02:33:02.251 --> 02:33:07.251
a female co author to obscure the male privileged Phallocentric,

2618
02:33:08.070 --> 02:33:11.820
you know,
perspective.
Oh,
that's funny.
So that's Q,

2619
02:33:11.940 --> 02:33:14.150
that sort of thing.
Um,

2620
02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:18.180
we haven't gotten any response at all from like the Christian.
Right.
You know,

2621
02:33:18.181 --> 02:33:22.230
who I was hoping we'd get really offended and freak out and loud voices,

2622
02:33:22.231 --> 02:33:23.910
but there hasn't been a peep out of them.

2623
02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:28.770
There's a bit of intellectual bigotry involved in anything.

2624
02:33:29.100 --> 02:33:30.930
Anything masculine like a,

2625
02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:35.960
anything that is a masculine trait or a masculine masculine wants or needs or

2626
02:33:37.890 --> 02:33:41.880
behavior patterns.
It's almost a rife for criticism.

2627
02:33:41.881 --> 02:33:45.790
Like no right away.
Like automatically intellectually dismissed,
you know,

2628
02:33:46.050 --> 02:33:49.620
whether it's aggression or sexual needs or anything like that.

2629
02:33:49.650 --> 02:33:53.870
Automatically intellectually dismissed.
You know,
Neil Strauss for the name?
Uh,

2630
02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:57.860
he was,
he,
he wrote a book called the game.
Oh yes.
Okay.
That's right.
I got bar.

2631
02:33:57.861 --> 02:34:01.950
It is thing.
I interviewed him on my podcast and I said to him like,
you,

2632
02:34:01.951 --> 02:34:04.440
what do you say to people who say you're just teaching losers?

2633
02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:07.860
How to manipulate women,
you know?
And he was like,
yeah,
interesting.
You know,

2634
02:34:07.861 --> 02:34:11.760
how much time do women spend learning how to manipulate men?
Right?

2635
02:34:11.940 --> 02:34:14.460
But I some do but some don't.
You know,
some,

2636
02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:17.350
some pride themselves and just being real.
But yeah.

2637
02:34:17.351 --> 02:34:22.351
But the point is women are much better at at dealing with relationship,

2638
02:34:22.541 --> 02:34:25.960
let's say relationship skills,
right?
You've got the cosmetics industry,

2639
02:34:25.961 --> 02:34:27.640
you've got all this cosmetic surgery,

2640
02:34:27.641 --> 02:34:30.100
you've got to get of the hairstyles and the fashion.

2641
02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:32.650
That's all about attracting male attention.
Right,
right.

2642
02:34:32.651 --> 02:34:33.640
And rolling male attention.

2643
02:34:33.641 --> 02:34:36.740
I'm not saying women are using it to hurt men necessarily,

2644
02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:41.760
but I'm saying there is a huge industry around helping women deal with men and

2645
02:34:42.641 --> 02:34:46.480
he was saying like the first time you start talking about helping men deal with

2646
02:34:46.481 --> 02:34:48.850
women,
it gets dismissed.
And the way you were saying

2647
02:34:48.900 --> 02:34:53.820
<v 5>it's true,
but in my opinion what he's doing is like horse shit.</v>

2648
02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:55.410
Yeah.
It's a temporary fix.

2649
02:34:55.460 --> 02:34:58.520
Like really what you need to do is be a bad motherfucker.

2650
02:34:58.710 --> 02:35:03.420
Be figure out a way to be a real man,
you know,
be a real man.
I always say,

2651
02:35:03.450 --> 02:35:05.760
and this is a corny way of saying it,

2652
02:35:05.761 --> 02:35:09.870
but it really works be the hero in your own story.

2653
02:35:09.900 --> 02:35:12.570
If you were living a movie and you're,
you're the,
the,

2654
02:35:12.571 --> 02:35:16.380
the guy that everybody admires and he woke up and this is his situation,

2655
02:35:16.381 --> 02:35:17.280
how would he handle it?

2656
02:35:17.310 --> 02:35:21.060
How would you handle each individual moment that you encounter in your life?

2657
02:35:21.300 --> 02:35:24.230
Well,
if you're the guy that you would look up to,
how would you deal with it?

2658
02:35:24.250 --> 02:35:27.930
Just did.
There you go.
That's what I do.
That shit.
Yeah,

2659
02:35:27.931 --> 02:35:31.530
but see not everyone can do that.
You say that,
but I'm not sure if that's true.

2660
02:35:31.980 --> 02:35:35.940
I think that limiting sort of thinking is very dangerous because who are you?

2661
02:35:35.941 --> 02:35:36.571
Who am I?

2662
02:35:36.571 --> 02:35:39.510
Am I the type of person that can do it or am I the type of person that fails?

2663
02:35:39.690 --> 02:35:42.570
And is there a difference between the two and is the difference between the two

2664
02:35:42.571 --> 02:35:47.100
focus and intensity belief?
What is it?
Is it genetics?
Is it circumstantial?

2665
02:35:47.310 --> 02:35:50.460
What is it?
I'm not exactly sure.
So to say that not everybody can do that.

2666
02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:53.280
I think everybody can do it.
I think everybody could do their own.

2667
02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:55.860
<v 4>But don't you think it's a mix of all those things?
Yes.</v>

2668
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:58.610
And some of those things are out of our control.
You know?
I mean,
I,

2669
02:35:58.611 --> 02:36:02.180
I feel very privileged.
I grew up,
I had unconditional love from my parents.

2670
02:36:02.510 --> 02:36:05.570
They had enough money that I knew if I ever really got into trouble,

2671
02:36:05.571 --> 02:36:08.120
they could bail me out and they would,
they'd sell their house,

2672
02:36:08.121 --> 02:36:10.010
they'd do whatever to come save me,
you know,

2673
02:36:10.011 --> 02:36:14.180
when I overdosed or wrecked a motorcycle and Thailand or some stupid shit.

2674
02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:19.100
So I felt free to do things that I think a lot of kids don't feel,
you know,
hey,

2675
02:36:19.340 --> 02:36:21.140
one of your parents is dead.
There's no money.
You're,

2676
02:36:21.740 --> 02:36:24.860
you don't have the chance to say,
Hey,
fuck it,
I'm going to Hitchhike to Alaska.

2677
02:36:25.580 --> 02:36:29.780
And I wrote a,
an essay in psychology today while ago.
I was reminded,

2678
02:36:29.781 --> 02:36:33.410
remember when the Sikhs got shot recently in Wisconsin or wherever it was.

2679
02:36:33.860 --> 02:36:37.460
And I was thinking about the first time I'd ever met a Sikh.
It was,

2680
02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:40.100
I'd been working in New York and the diamond district,

2681
02:36:40.101 --> 02:36:42.470
which is a whole crazy period of my life.

2682
02:36:42.471 --> 02:36:46.940
But I quit that job and flew to Nutaliay one way ticket to new Dell.

2683
02:36:47.020 --> 02:36:48.650
I wanted to go see the world,
right.

2684
02:36:49.070 --> 02:36:54.070
So I had about $15,000 in cash in my money belt because someone had told me that

2685
02:36:56.451 --> 02:36:58.160
you got a better exchange on cash,

2686
02:36:58.161 --> 02:37:01.880
hundred dollar bills then you did with traveler's checks.
So I had all this cash,

2687
02:37:01.881 --> 02:37:06.320
right?
I was going to go travel until the cash ran out.
I figured two,
three years,

2688
02:37:06.380 --> 02:37:10.810
it was my plan.
So I land in New Delhi and I go,
I get this,

2689
02:37:10.811 --> 02:37:15.811
a little room and old Deli near the train station and night I would sleep with

2690
02:37:16.311 --> 02:37:18.820
my money belt under the pillow because someone had told him like,

2691
02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:21.980
the locks on the doors are ridiculous.
And somebody told me like,
watch out.

2692
02:37:21.981 --> 02:37:23.990
People come in at night.
You gotta be really careful.

2693
02:37:24.530 --> 02:37:28.310
So I hid my money belt under,
under my pillow and uh,

2694
02:37:28.620 --> 02:37:32.650
I got this ticket to go to cashmere.
Very early trained.

2695
02:37:32.651 --> 02:37:37.070
It was like a 40 hour train or something to cashmere and it left at 6:00 AM or

2696
02:37:37.071 --> 02:37:40.910
something.
So the night before I packed up my backpack,
got everything ready.

2697
02:37:40.911 --> 02:37:44.210
So in the morning all I did do is wake up,
brush my teeth and go,
right.
So I did,

2698
02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:48.060
I'm sitting in the train station waiting,
having a Chai.
It's,
you know,

2699
02:37:48.110 --> 02:37:50.900
almost five 30 or something.
The Sun's coming up,

2700
02:37:50.901 --> 02:37:55.901
it's already really hot and this bead of sweat rolls down my spine and I go to

2701
02:37:56.180 --> 02:37:58.500
touch it.
Where's my money belt?

2702
02:37:59.510 --> 02:38:01.760
I left it under the pillow.
Oh,

2703
02:38:02.610 --> 02:38:07.040
this is like five days into my adventure.

2704
02:38:07.041 --> 02:38:10.910
Chris is going to go see the world,
you know intrepid traveler,
dude,

2705
02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:16.080
all my money is in this fucking guest house near the trains.

2706
02:38:16.090 --> 02:38:19.820
So I run with my backpack and run back to this thing.
Go Up,
there's the seek.

2707
02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:22.930
The owner is awake by this point and he's like,
what are you doing?

2708
02:38:23.050 --> 02:38:25.580
Oh do I just ran past them up to the door,
banging on the door.

2709
02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:28.250
People inside speaking Hindi.
They won't open the door.

2710
02:38:28.670 --> 02:38:31.390
I don't know what the fuck.
I go down to the front desk and he's like,
well,
hey,

2711
02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:36.500
what's happening with you?
I said,
I left something in my room.
He said,

2712
02:38:36.501 --> 02:38:41.360
what did you leave?
I said,
some papers,
I need some,
some papers.
I left there.

2713
02:38:41.361 --> 02:38:45.810
He said,
what kind of papers and my Indian accent.
So,
um,

2714
02:38:46.590 --> 02:38:51.510
I,
and I felt like my passport.
All right,
look my passport.
He said,

2715
02:38:51.650 --> 02:38:54.350
oh my God,
you left your passport in the room.
Anything else?

2716
02:38:55.730 --> 02:39:00.650
And he's looking at me like there's this look like he's not unfriendly,
this guy,

2717
02:39:01.130 --> 02:39:05.530
but he's not stupid.
And he's looking at me a lot in a way that,

2718
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:08.160
and I feel like I'm being tested in a way.
Yes.

2719
02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:14.240
And when I've come to those moments in life,
which I have several times,

2720
02:39:14.930 --> 02:39:19.460
my instinct is just tell the fucking truth.
Right?
Just naked,
you know,
like naked.

2721
02:39:19.461 --> 02:39:20.700
Don't try to play,
you know,

2722
02:39:20.710 --> 02:39:23.560
it's like what I was saying about the knife and the boot.
It's like,
Eh,

2723
02:39:23.570 --> 02:39:28.310
you're better off undefended in a way.
And I said,

2724
02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:32.720
I left all my money there.
He said,
all your money,
how much money?

2725
02:39:33.980 --> 02:39:36.230
I said about $15,000

2726
02:39:37.820 --> 02:39:42.820
$15,000 so you have a $15,000 he reaches under the table,

2727
02:39:43.470 --> 02:39:47.840
hands me my money,
but oh my God,
I look at it and I don't count the money,

2728
02:39:47.841 --> 02:39:52.700
but there's a stack of hundreds in it.
Did you give him one eye?
He said,
well,

2729
02:39:52.701 --> 02:39:55.760
while I'm looking at it,
he said,
the boy who cleans your room found this.

2730
02:39:56.120 --> 02:40:00.980
He makes about $7 in a month.
Kidneys.

2731
02:40:01.010 --> 02:40:04.610
A new job.
Yeah.
So I took a couple of hundreds out and I handed them to him.

2732
02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:08.930
I said,
please give them to him,
to the boy and to thank you.
And he said,
no,
no,
no,

2733
02:40:08.931 --> 02:40:13.420
you'll offend him.
You can't do that.
Wow.
So I said,
well,
what can I do?
He said,
uh,

2734
02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:15.570
you know,
give me,
I don't know what it was.
Five,

2735
02:40:15.571 --> 02:40:20.520
10 bucks or something and I'll have a party to honor him among all of the

2736
02:40:20.521 --> 02:40:24.360
employees.
Wow.
He says,
no,
you go get your train and be careful.

2737
02:40:24.361 --> 02:40:27.960
Be careful with your money.
And so I think back on that guy.

2738
02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:33.580
I think that guy saved my life because I look at myself now as bad.

2739
02:40:33.750 --> 02:40:36.600
I'm this adventurous guy.
I went all over the world,
I've done this,

2740
02:40:36.601 --> 02:40:39.120
I've done that.
And I always came out of it.
Okay.
And I've done,

2741
02:40:39.810 --> 02:40:42.960
that guy could have put me on a completely different track where I'd be calling

2742
02:40:42.961 --> 02:40:47.850
my parents,
you know,
collect a week after leaving the country to get,
uh,

2743
02:40:47.910 --> 02:40:50.640
you know,
borrow money for a flight back to their basement.

2744
02:40:51.060 --> 02:40:52.350
That would have been a different life.

2745
02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:56.220
So I guess what I'm saying to you is not everyone's lucky.

2746
02:40:57.410 --> 02:41:00.950
<v 5>Yes and no,
because I say you're just basing your,</v>

2747
02:41:01.820 --> 02:41:05.300
the whole chain of events on what would have happened if you didn't have that

2748
02:41:05.301 --> 02:41:08.960
money.
If you lost that money,
you could have gone on an equal adventure,

2749
02:41:08.961 --> 02:41:10.070
if not greater.

2750
02:41:10.071 --> 02:41:13.040
It could have been more spiritually fulfilling because people actually helped

2751
02:41:13.041 --> 02:41:15.470
you and you realize money's not important.
You know,

2752
02:41:15.471 --> 02:41:18.710
I can barter with my work and who knows?
And you know,

2753
02:41:18.711 --> 02:41:23.030
your version of why you were willing to take chances in your life is based on a

2754
02:41:23.031 --> 02:41:27.380
version of having a safety net.
My version is the total opposite.

2755
02:41:27.381 --> 02:41:30.110
I don't even know my father and my mother had me when she was young.

2756
02:41:30.111 --> 02:41:33.920
She worked all the time.
No one was ever home.
And I was,
I was raised by wolves.

2757
02:41:33.950 --> 02:41:38.950
So I essentially figured my own path or life and rejected the normal notions of

2758
02:41:39.741 --> 02:41:42.770
what you should and shouldn't do because I saw these people were miserable and I

2759
02:41:42.771 --> 02:41:43.790
didn't want to be like them.

2760
02:41:44.130 --> 02:41:49.130
And so I think that water seeks its own level and I think that curiosity and a a

2761
02:41:49.221 --> 02:41:50.280
person and you know,

2762
02:41:50.300 --> 02:41:55.230
a desire to see things and experience things,
it sort of a,

2763
02:41:55.231 --> 02:41:59.860
it's a part of being a human and it's whether or not that's nurtured and if,

2764
02:41:59.970 --> 02:42:03.380
whether it's nurtured because you're ignored and you develop on your own or

2765
02:42:03.381 --> 02:42:06.500
there it's nurture because you're loved and you're given the freedom to take

2766
02:42:06.501 --> 02:42:09.260
chances.
I think either or.

2767
02:42:09.290 --> 02:42:12.830
It's like pursuit is what,
it's what's fascinating,

2768
02:42:12.831 --> 02:42:16.760
whether it's your life's pursuit or mine or anyone else's where they find an

2769
02:42:16.761 --> 02:42:19.720
interest and they study it or they,
they,
they chase it,
they,

2770
02:42:19.721 --> 02:42:22.410
they have an idea and they follow it.
You know,

2771
02:42:22.490 --> 02:42:27.350
I think that what's most important in your story was that fucking cool guy.

2772
02:42:27.530 --> 02:42:30.260
And that you can do that too.
And that we can all,

2773
02:42:30.290 --> 02:42:35.290
we can all have these acts of kindness that sort of decades later you're still

2774
02:42:36.171 --> 02:42:36.860
describing.

2775
02:42:36.860 --> 02:42:41.840
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,
you know,
I,
I completely agree with what you're saying.</v>

2776
02:42:41.900 --> 02:42:45.980
And in my life I think it's important to have a sense of gratitude because it

2777
02:42:45.981 --> 02:42:49.310
keeps my feet on the ground and to keep reminding myself like,

2778
02:42:49.850 --> 02:42:52.880
you've been pretty fucking lucky and you didn't do anything to deserve it.

2779
02:42:52.881 --> 02:42:57.320
You just were,
you know,
and so when bad shit comes,
don't forget about that.

2780
02:42:57.740 --> 02:43:01.010
Don't start feeling bad for yourself cause oh,
not something bad happened.
Well,

2781
02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:05.470
you know,
fuck you.
You,
you,
you know,
you're bad.
Account is very,
uh,
yeah.

2782
02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:09.200
It's very weak.
Yeah.
Deal with it.
Yeah.
I mean just stop whining,

2783
02:43:09.370 --> 02:43:10.210
living where you live,
live

2784
02:43:10.210 --> 02:43:14.380
<v 5>being Canadian,
you know,
just living in America,
living,
you know,
living in a,</v>

2785
02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:17.710
a first world country,
living in a country that has fresh water,
you know,

2786
02:43:17.711 --> 02:43:20.530
living in a place where you know,
you don't have to worry about these uh,

2787
02:43:21.100 --> 02:43:25.300
armed gangs going through your town and shooting everybody for no reason and no

2788
02:43:25.301 --> 02:43:28.990
one even covering it in the news because there is no fucking news that's a big

2789
02:43:28.991 --> 02:43:32.620
part of the world,
you know,
always said that the apocalypse is here.
It's just,

2790
02:43:32.621 --> 02:43:35.020
it just moves real slow and it's not everywhere.

2791
02:43:35.050 --> 02:43:38.530
It hit spots and if you were in Liberia right now,

2792
02:43:38.531 --> 02:43:40.060
you would think it's the apocalypse.

2793
02:43:40.061 --> 02:43:42.130
He would think you're living in Mad Max Times,

2794
02:43:42.730 --> 02:43:46.960
dirt roads and ramping crimes and $1 prostitutes and it's just chaos,

2795
02:43:47.170 --> 02:43:48.670
murder and cannibalism.

2796
02:43:48.820 --> 02:43:52.840
You would think that you are in the apocalypse because for them than it is.
Yeah.

2797
02:43:54.110 --> 02:43:56.850
Yeah.
I your your ideas compelling that you know,

2798
02:43:56.910 --> 02:44:00.200
there's too many people and I really wonder how that's going to be worked out

2799
02:44:00.201 --> 02:44:03.340
because that's the one I feel like we can work out a lot of social things

2800
02:44:03.341 --> 02:44:07.090
because I feel like young people have access to information in a way that really

2801
02:44:07.091 --> 02:44:09.040
was never possible for any generation prior.

2802
02:44:09.041 --> 02:44:13.330
So I think if there's ever a time where the momentum is going to be at least

2803
02:44:13.331 --> 02:44:16.570
slowed,
altered or stopped,
now's that time.

2804
02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:19.100
<v 4>I got to say I,
you know,</v>

2805
02:44:19.101 --> 02:44:24.101
I felt really hopeless about Western society until the last four or five years.

2806
02:44:25.431 --> 02:44:30.431
And there's a glimmer of feeling like people really want change,

2807
02:44:32.290 --> 02:44:32.911
you know?
And,

2808
02:44:32.911 --> 02:44:37.911
and I think before now wanting change that badly depended upon things going so

2809
02:44:39.621 --> 02:44:41.600
far into the shit hole that,
you know,

2810
02:44:41.601 --> 02:44:44.630
it's like revolutionary civil war kind of craziness,
right?

2811
02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:47.870
And now things are like tolerable materially.

2812
02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:50.830
But I think there is what you were saying,
there's,

2813
02:44:50.831 --> 02:44:53.750
there's something happening in the consciousness of young people.

2814
02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:57.170
I mean you look at what's happened with acceptance of same sex marriage for

2815
02:44:57.171 --> 02:45:01.820
example.
It's like a steamroller.
And 10 years ago,
it was nothing.
It was,
you know,

2816
02:45:02.090 --> 02:45:05.750
it was,
it's like things are catching flame really quickly now.
Yeah.

2817
02:45:05.751 --> 02:45:10.000
You're ridiculed.
If you have an issue with same sex marriage now.
Exactly.

2818
02:45:10.460 --> 02:45:13.910
There's no argument for it.
And that's happened in 10 years.
You know,

2819
02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:18.260
I look at Dan savage,
you know,
Dan savage,
the sex,
he's a friend of mine.
And,

2820
02:45:18.261 --> 02:45:22.790
and because he basically is responsible for the success of our book.
Right.

2821
02:45:22.791 --> 02:45:27.010
I mean,
that's what did everything launched it?
What,

2822
02:45:27.150 --> 02:45:32.120
do you have a book?
Oh,
he's got lots of books.
Yeah,
he's got
his famous one.

2823
02:45:32.690 --> 02:45:36.760
I could get confused.
Well,
I mean,
he's a,
he's a sexy device.
Columnists.

2824
02:45:36.940 --> 02:45:39.830
You're not in there.
There's the Michael,
I guess that was a right wing.

2825
02:45:39.860 --> 02:45:44.360
Crazy enough.
Yeah.
This is Dan savage,
who's Dan's.
Have you probably heard about,

2826
02:45:44.390 --> 02:45:48.900
um,
what he did to Rick Santorum?
What,
you know,
you don't know about this.

2827
02:45:49.470 --> 02:45:53.000
Alright.
So Rick Santorum said,
so this is like seven years ago or something,

2828
02:45:53.001 --> 02:45:55.790
and terms says something about how,
uh,
you know,

2829
02:45:55.791 --> 02:45:58.460
if if we allow homosexual marriage,
and next thing you know,

2830
02:45:58.461 --> 02:46:02.840
men will be marrying dogs and you know,
trees and little shit.
So Dan savage,

2831
02:46:02.841 --> 02:46:07.670
who has a nationally syndicated sex advice column called savage love,

2832
02:46:07.850 --> 02:46:09.980
it's the most red sex column in the country.

2833
02:46:09.981 --> 02:46:13.120
It's in the village voice in the La weekly and it's like in the bay,
you know,

2834
02:46:13.130 --> 02:46:18.050
every alternative,
you know,
and online the onion,
he started with the onion.
Um,

2835
02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:23.360
he's,
he says,
okay,
we've got to like find a definition for Santorum.

2836
02:46:23.390 --> 02:46:24.830
What,
what is Santorum?

2837
02:46:24.831 --> 02:46:29.420
So he asked his readers to send in crazy definitions for Santorum and then he

2838
02:46:29.421 --> 02:46:30.860
had a few people could vote.

2839
02:46:30.861 --> 02:46:35.861
And the one that one was Santorum that sometimes that frothy mix of Lube and

2840
02:46:39.801 --> 02:46:44.801
fecal matter that sometimes results from anal sex and he sets up a webpage and

2841
02:46:45.591 --> 02:46:49.460
then has his readers bomb the webpage.
So if you Google it right now,

2842
02:46:49.461 --> 02:46:52.980
Google Santorum,
that's what you're going to get.
So this guy,

2843
02:46:52.981 --> 02:46:57.200
his political career was done,
done.
It was like the most brilliant,
you know,

2844
02:46:57.290 --> 02:46:59.270
information terrorism ever.

2845
02:46:59.430 --> 02:47:04.420
Well Santorum's career was done more because he was found to be a lie.
He's,

2846
02:47:04.730 --> 02:47:08.260
he's,
yeah,
he's not,
he's an anti gay guy.
And um,

2847
02:47:08.300 --> 02:47:12.740
he also lied about his marathon running time.
Oh No,
no,
that was,
yeah,

2848
02:47:12.741 --> 02:47:17.730
it was Rick Santorum.
I,
no,
no,
not Paul Ryan.
Paul Ryan.
Yeah.

2849
02:47:18.260 --> 02:47:22.760
Yeah.
Santorum was just crazy.
Anti gay marriage guy.
But I don't think Auntie Don,

2850
02:47:23.210 --> 02:47:25.580
if he,
if you know,
there's just this,
there's this,

2851
02:47:25.581 --> 02:47:28.920
there's a faction of retards that are still alive in this country that,
you know,

2852
02:47:29.020 --> 02:47:32.050
will cling to these like simplest of values.
You know,

2853
02:47:32.060 --> 02:47:35.990
they think some of the [inaudible] a man.
Ooh Man.

2854
02:47:36.420 --> 02:47:39.850
I was like,
like marriage.
Marriage is ridiculous theory.

2855
02:47:39.851 --> 02:47:42.160
It even for men and women,
it's all stupid.
You know,

2856
02:47:42.170 --> 02:47:46.110
why not let gay people do that stupid shit too.
That's what he says.
Yeah.
Well,

2857
02:47:46.111 --> 02:47:46.790
why the hell did I,

2858
02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:51.790
did I raise him those in referenced savage savage was Dan Savage due dates.

2859
02:47:52.221 --> 02:47:53.054
Winnie Cooper,

2860
02:47:55.550 --> 02:47:58.880
he's married to a guy named Terry and they have a kid.
Oh,
they'll,
why?

2861
02:47:58.881 --> 02:48:01.740
He was responsible for the,
the book success,

2862
02:48:02.210 --> 02:48:06.920
that he just really pushed it.
And he,
he,
uh,
he read it and loved it.
And then he,

2863
02:48:07.020 --> 02:48:10.610
like in his column,
read by millions of people,
he,
he basically said,

2864
02:48:10.730 --> 02:48:13.820
buy this book,
you know?
Yeah.
Well you were talking about,
um,

2865
02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:17.320
the acceptance of gay marriage.
Oh,
that's the point.
Right.

2866
02:48:17.330 --> 02:48:21.830
So my point is that 10 years ago Dan was a radical,

2867
02:48:21.890 --> 02:48:24.250
he was way out in the fringes.
Right.
You know,

2868
02:48:24.290 --> 02:48:28.010
he was writing this gay sex advice column,
the cracked everybody up.
Um,

2869
02:48:28.370 --> 02:48:29.750
but now he's mainstream.

2870
02:48:30.260 --> 02:48:33.860
Like he's on the cold bear rapport five times or something.
You know,
he's,

2871
02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:38.690
he had a profile in the New York Times.
Dan hasn't changed at all.

2872
02:48:38.750 --> 02:48:40.130
He hasn't changed the language.

2873
02:48:40.131 --> 02:48:43.370
He uses the things he talks about the political positions he takes.

2874
02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:47.540
The stream has changed.
Yeah.
I think,
yeah,

2875
02:48:47.541 --> 02:48:49.640
I attribute that to the same thing.

2876
02:48:50.300 --> 02:48:52.610
The information that people have access to now,

2877
02:48:53.180 --> 02:48:58.180
they can't just be as flavored by the ignorance of their local area as a the use

2878
02:48:59.311 --> 02:49:03.050
to be in the 50 60 seventies eighties nineties whatever when to thousands came

2879
02:49:03.051 --> 02:49:06.080
along and people just had a completely new perspective and we have to really

2880
02:49:06.081 --> 02:49:07.950
take into account that that's a decade.
Yeah.

2881
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:10.530
<v 5>I mean we're dealing with two decades of Internet influence.</v>

2882
02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:13.680
Maybe a little bit more but not really.
That's pretty much it.

2883
02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:18.540
You go to like 92 93 that's about the first evidence of the internet interaction

2884
02:49:18.541 --> 02:49:19.374
with our culture.

2885
02:49:19.470 --> 02:49:24.150
You've got mail and it goes from that to what we've got now and we're seeing

2886
02:49:24.151 --> 02:49:29.040
like real changes look cal Colorado and Washington state and making marijuana

2887
02:49:29.041 --> 02:49:33.330
legal and what the fuck is going to happen from there and I think the,

2888
02:49:33.331 --> 02:49:37.740
the federal government eventually is going to crumble under the crippling weight

2889
02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:40.980
of the ridiculous way they run the system.
Unbelievable.

2890
02:49:41.110 --> 02:49:42.840
It's so fucked up that people,

2891
02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:45.450
even people that are doing it a certain point in time,
I'm going to be like,

2892
02:49:45.451 --> 02:49:49.080
we were being ridiculous.
Like the information is all out there now.

2893
02:49:49.230 --> 02:49:52.560
You can't keep running it like this and pretending that we're a democracy and

2894
02:49:52.561 --> 02:49:55.470
pretending where representative government all about freedom,

2895
02:49:55.471 --> 02:49:59.300
but this is fucking crazy corporate chaos and it's got,

2896
02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:03.270
it's got to settle down and then,
and by the way,
everyone's not happy.

2897
02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:06.030
Like you're making billions and you're still fucking miserable as shit,
right?

2898
02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:10.770
This,
this method of control and financial,
the acquisition of financial wealth,

2899
02:50:10.771 --> 02:50:13.230
it's not satisfying for anybody,
you know,
and it,

2900
02:50:13.290 --> 02:50:18.270
it's certainly not the best way to,
to have a harmonious nation,

2901
02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:20.790
you know?
And I think that's possible.

2902
02:50:20.791 --> 02:50:24.150
I think if it's possible to have a great town and it's possible to have a great

2903
02:50:24.151 --> 02:50:26.250
neighborhood,
if it's possible,
had a great block and a,

2904
02:50:26.270 --> 02:50:28.260
a great group of people that you hang with,

2905
02:50:28.410 --> 02:50:31.440
then it's possible to expand that out further and further.
If,

2906
02:50:31.650 --> 02:50:36.650
if everyone had a great community and all those great communities combined and

2907
02:50:37.801 --> 02:50:41.220
all treated each other as equals and as,
as,
as,

2908
02:50:41.370 --> 02:50:44.550
as fellow citizens and this,
this experiment called life.

2909
02:50:44.730 --> 02:50:47.610
If everyone had that same exact,
if that same idea,

2910
02:50:47.850 --> 02:50:50.900
then a great neighborhood could be the whole world.
I mean it's,

2911
02:50:50.910 --> 02:50:55.200
it doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility.
If it exists in the micro,

2912
02:50:55.530 --> 02:50:59.550
why can't it exist to the macro?
Well,
it's,
it seems like it should be able to,

2913
02:50:59.730 --> 02:51:03.120
and the only thing that seems to hold it back is communication and information.

2914
02:51:03.150 --> 02:51:06.030
So there's the language issue,
there's the cultural issue,

2915
02:51:06.240 --> 02:51:09.930
but there's the access to each other that's changing and it's changing.

2916
02:51:09.931 --> 02:51:14.910
It's such a crazy pace that I'm,
I'm much more hopeful than a I've ever been.

2917
02:51:15.300 --> 02:51:17.550
When I was younger,
when I was younger,
I looked at him like,

2918
02:51:17.551 --> 02:51:21.120
this is a fucking nuclear war waiting to happen.
This is craziness.

2919
02:51:21.121 --> 02:51:22.200
It's all gonna fall apart.

2920
02:51:22.530 --> 02:51:27.530
But now I think that people understand the world in a way that's unprecedented.

2921
02:51:29.630 --> 02:51:31.840
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
And I think you're right,
it's,</v>

2922
02:51:31.841 --> 02:51:35.000
it's probably entirely due to the Internet.
Like right now I'm,

2923
02:51:35.090 --> 02:51:40.090
I'm working with some people to set up a website for the exploration of ethical

2924
02:51:42.621 --> 02:51:45.080
non-monogamy.
Right?
So it's,

2925
02:51:45.320 --> 02:51:48.710
it's like it'll have a dating site component to it,

2926
02:51:48.860 --> 02:51:51.860
but it's also just about a community for me,
a community,

2927
02:51:52.190 --> 02:51:55.910
and we were trying to do is have it be it an online community that will also

2928
02:51:55.911 --> 02:51:59.120
have regional meetings where you can meet people face to face,

2929
02:51:59.450 --> 02:52:03.920
but that it will be set up along the principles of,
of Bonobo.
True.

2930
02:52:04.310 --> 02:52:08.290
So females will be respected and you know,
valued.

2931
02:52:08.291 --> 02:52:10.530
And there won't be any like hassling of women,

2932
02:52:10.810 --> 02:52:15.100
especially women who are openly nonmonogamous,
which attracts some attention.

2933
02:52:15.640 --> 02:52:18.760
Um,
but also like,
yeah,
a lot of,
uh,

2934
02:52:19.210 --> 02:52:23.920
portion of the profits,
if there ever any profits would go to Bonobo,

2935
02:52:23.980 --> 02:52:26.320
uh,
sanctuaries and Congo.
And

2936
02:52:26.450 --> 02:52:31.450
<v 5>so you run like a dating site based on Bonobo monkeys where people get to act</v>

2937
02:52:31.701 --> 02:52:35.480
like monkeys,
apes,
apes,
sorry.
Yeah.
Among chips.
Hales

2938
02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:40.040
monkeys.
A better word.
Yeah,
sure.
You know?
Okay.

2939
02:52:40.220 --> 02:52:42.200
The only thing that they don't do is the mother doesn't fuck up

2940
02:52:42.250 --> 02:52:46.510
<v 4>the sun.
That's it.
But that's probably the most important relationship.</v>

2941
02:52:46.610 --> 02:52:49.670
<v 5>It's fascinating though that the mother doesn't fuck the sun because that exists</v>

2942
02:52:49.671 --> 02:52:52.370
in humans.
So we talk about Benobos being freaks.

2943
02:52:52.550 --> 02:52:54.050
The one thing that they don't do,

2944
02:52:54.290 --> 02:52:56.150
that shit's happening all over the south right now.

2945
02:52:56.710 --> 02:52:59.900
Mom's fucking their kids for sure too.
We gotta get Outta here.

2946
02:52:59.901 --> 02:53:02.930
We're running at it.
Three hours in,
we turn into a pumpkin and I say,
man,

2947
02:53:03.110 --> 02:53:06.290
that was a really fun conversation and your book is amazing.

2948
02:53:06.291 --> 02:53:08.960
I'm really enjoying it.
It's called sex at dawn.

2949
02:53:09.140 --> 02:53:12.770
The author is Dr for Krista Ryan.
Say again.

2950
02:53:13.010 --> 02:53:17.480
Dr. Christopher Ryan.
And you can,
um,
you can get this on Amazon,
on kindle.

2951
02:53:17.481 --> 02:53:19.640
I have it on a nook.
You can a,

2952
02:53:19.641 --> 02:53:23.540
you can buy the actual physical book if you one of those fucking holdouts to a

2953
02:53:23.541 --> 02:53:28.280
dark day when needed paper.
Do you read books or do you use a,
like a kindle?

2954
02:53:28.340 --> 02:53:32.150
Both.
Both.
Yeah.
Kendall's are the shit man.
Those,
those.
Um,

2955
02:53:32.180 --> 02:53:33.460
and if you get whispered,
do you have a,

2956
02:53:33.470 --> 02:53:37.550
you have the version of it on whisper sync on Amazon where it's read by someone,

2957
02:53:37.790 --> 02:53:41.300
don't you?
It doesn't exist.
What do you mean?
Do you know what whisper sync is?

2958
02:53:41.480 --> 02:53:43.210
Whisper sync is a,
um,
uh,

2959
02:53:43.230 --> 02:53:48.230
an Amazon has of the kindle fire and that he have audible has a application for

2960
02:53:49.881 --> 02:53:52.520
it where you read it as a book and then when you get into your car,

2961
02:53:52.521 --> 02:53:54.850
it's syncs up to your smartphone.
And a,
uh,

2962
02:53:55.040 --> 02:54:00.040
actor reads it as an audio book companion picks up right where you left off.

2963
02:54:00.810 --> 02:54:04.640
It's brilliant.
But anyway,
the book is sex at dawn and it's,
uh,

2964
02:54:04.760 --> 02:54:08.930

2966
