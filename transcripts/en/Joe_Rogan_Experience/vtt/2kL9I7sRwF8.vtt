<v Speaker 2>have when I talked to people about </v>
<v Speaker 2>asteroid impacts.</v>

86
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 2>burned off until it was just went out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it like lasted for awhile.</v>

87
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 2>We were looking for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's it called?</v>

<v Speaker 2>but it's not bad.</v>

94
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:30.031
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely better than the city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you really want to go out there like</v>

95

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

100
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.060

<v Speaker 2>The line down the middle sometimes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that's the thick line.</v>

108
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 2>The reason why you can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because it has berries in it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're weird little animals,</v>

111
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 2>but they don't attack people,</v>

<v Speaker 2>If they have an opportunity,</v>

115
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 2>we have some sort of a fucking truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

122
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.130
<v Speaker 2>That's an animal that's been eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that might be a mountain lion,</v>

123
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be a bobcat.</v>

124
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.130
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that that female Canadian </v>

125
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.471
<v Speaker 2>singer apparently where she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real problem is they have a,</v>

126
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 2>they have a real lack of things for them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to eat.</v>

127
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.800
<v Speaker 2>And so the coyote started approaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

128
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 2>the coyotes there will even take off a </v>
<v Speaker 2>moose.</v>

129
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a pack or by himself as a pack.</v>

130
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 2>They just attack the legs until it can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>go anywhere.</v>

131
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.410
<v Speaker 2>You just keep chasing it and biting its </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs.</v>

132
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.560
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

133
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Some of them get kicked in the head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed while they're doing it.</v>

134
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:11.041
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just take chances because there's </v>

135
00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:11.041
<v Speaker 2>no food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sell food.</v>

136
00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 2>So they found this chick walking by </v>
<v Speaker 2>herself.</v>

137
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a horrible way to die,</v>

138
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they,</v>

139
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 2>you asshole first.</v>

140
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.530
<v Speaker 2>So he was still alive as a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's still alive.</v>

141
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 2>The turner apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't kill you first.</v>

142
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.070
<v Speaker 2>They have no interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about eating.</v>

143
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Go start chewing you apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they got her,</v>

144
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 2>she was still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>torn apart.</v>

145
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.280
<v Speaker 2>And then they took her to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She died I think where they found her </v>

146
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.280
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

147
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.480
<v Speaker 2>pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was just fucked up like half her </v>

<v Speaker 2>Ask for.</v>

150
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.270
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do to animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kill you by eating you asshole </v>

151
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.750
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

152
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 2>That's what coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>

153
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Wolves do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start at your asshole.</v>

154
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Horrible reason for real the most?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

155
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 2>For Real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they start at your asshole.</v>

156
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible way to die.</v>

157
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a hiking in these vibram five </v>
<v Speaker 2>fingers shoes.</v>

158
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 2>The coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're minimalist shoes.</v>

159
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.770
<v Speaker 2>There's like almost no padding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just some tread like heavy </v>

160
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 2>socks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

161
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 2>there's tread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's very little hurt.</v>

162
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 2>You get those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

163
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.110
<v Speaker 2>what's the thing on your heel when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurts?</v>

164
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

165
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm feel the rocks on the rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just toughening up my feet.</v>

166
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 2>So it's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's making my feet stronger.</v>

167
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 2>The way it's been described to me is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your foot,</v>

168
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 2>when you're in a regular shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your foot is in a cast.</v>

169
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.130
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

170
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 2>just like how if you ever had a broken </v>
<v Speaker 2>arm,</v>

171
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.030
<v Speaker 2>you get that castle farm has atrophied </v>
<v Speaker 2>or your legs actually.</v>

172
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

173
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 2>You have the same thing with your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your foot is walking around in this cast</v>

174
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:55.181
<v Speaker 2>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't exercise all the strong </v>

175
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:57.620
<v Speaker 2>strong muscle groups in your toes and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these things,</v>

176
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:03.100
<v Speaker 2>they actually lost a class action </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawsuit I think because a bunch of </v>

177
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.451
<v Speaker 2>people took them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They started running and doing a bunch </v>

178
00:07:07.451 --> 00:07:07.451
<v Speaker 2>of shit and they got hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

179
00:07:07.451 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 2>So much assumption out here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't believe I do.</v>

180
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>

181
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.390
<v Speaker 2>this is not important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

182
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

183
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm class action because people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting hurt trying to run on fucking </v>

184
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 2>boulders and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

185
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:29.801
<v Speaker 2>because they lost the lawsuit because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were suing them because they said</v>

186
00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:34.901
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made a unwarranted claims or </v>

187
00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 2>something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's killing us.</v>

188
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.660
<v Speaker 2>E-Cigarettes really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were like safer than </v>

189
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:40.660
<v Speaker 2>smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the FDA's like,</v>

190
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you think that?</v>

191
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Obviously like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

192
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.880
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just go obviously the medical </v>

193
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:47.880
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to like test it.</v>

194
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have years and years of </v>

195
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.950
<v Speaker 2>cancer behind prove.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>

196
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.670
<v Speaker 2>they could easily be causing some new </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of cancer.</v>

197
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows?</v>

198
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it also be way safer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just like you got to prove that's </v>

199
00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:58.910
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So um,</v>

200
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.940
<v Speaker 2>with these shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the things that people who </v>

201
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.871
<v Speaker 2>are big proponents of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like this Guy Mark [inaudible] who </v>

202
00:08:07.871 --> 00:08:08.240
<v Speaker 2>is the author of the primal blueprint.</v>

203
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.240
<v Speaker 2>He's a really well respected endurance </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete and then went on to become like </v>

204
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.710
<v Speaker 2>coach and does a lot of online stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 2>writes books about diet and exercise.</v>

205
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.910
<v Speaker 2>He says you gotta take it slow because </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially your foot is just not used </v>

206
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.811
<v Speaker 2>to really working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's used to being protected by your </v>

207
00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:30.560
<v Speaker 2>toe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basing out for balance,</v>

208
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.740
<v Speaker 2>especially with these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things that your toes are all </v>

209
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.891
<v Speaker 2>individually moving and essentially it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just providing you a little bit of a </v>

210
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:42.230
<v Speaker 2>thick layer underneath to keep you from </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting cut.</v>

211
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your foot does all the work.</v>

212
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.290
<v Speaker 2>I've met these people in Cambodia that </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a on this island,</v>

213
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.670
<v Speaker 2>this is a parasite that lives there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

214
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.470
<v Speaker 2>they just get it and you see this worm </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside your leg and shit.</v>

215
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

216
00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you got to go to the hospital and </v>

217
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:00.320
<v Speaker 2>take it out.</v>

218
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:00.320
<v Speaker 2>But like a or maybe drink some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget how they got rid of it,</v>

219
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 2>but it's just like everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to happen to me.</v>

220
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:02.900
<v Speaker 2>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

221
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.120

<v Speaker 2>you just need a little bit of scratch as</v>

222
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:07.790
<v Speaker 2>you're walking nearby them and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

223
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.420
<v Speaker 2>we're in a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

224
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:11.430

<v Speaker 2>like moving.</v>

225
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can fucking wrath of Khan.</v>

226
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.610
<v Speaker 2>I had this guy on my podcast recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Robert Sapolsky and he's an expert </v>

227
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.300
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

<v Speaker 2>A lot of things.</v>

229
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:25.170

<v Speaker 2>is this,</v>

230
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:28.760
<v Speaker 2>a parasite called toxoplasma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the Brazilian one,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it in the world.</v>

239
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fifty percent.</v>

240
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.570
<v Speaker 2>And nobody in Poland?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one.</v>

241
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.300
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

242
00:09:55.490 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm just stereotyping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy how it works,</v>

243
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:05.001
<v Speaker 2>how it infects the cat and the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>place where it can reproduce this in a </v>

244
00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:09.441
<v Speaker 2>cat's digestive tract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how it forced itself to </v>

245
00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:09.441
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

246
00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:13.621
<v Speaker 2>By tricking a rat into going near a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kills the rats.</v>

247
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Fear of cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See Again?</v>

248
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 2>You see the little hairs here and there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

249
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:23.100
<v Speaker 2>That's an animal that's killing animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most likely that's a kylie,</v>

250
00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:24.770
<v Speaker 2>but that's pretty big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

251
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.610
<v Speaker 2>that's some big shit there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bears out here.</v>

252
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not out here,</v>

253
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:33.201
<v Speaker 2>but not too far away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa Barbara has bears are the rattle </v>

254
00:10:33.201 --> 00:10:33.201
<v Speaker 2>snakes here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got To be that right?</v>

255
00:10:33.201 --> 00:10:34.580
<v Speaker 2>I ran over one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

256
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

257
00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 2>with my dogs a couple years back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was a waterfall.</v>

258
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

259
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.500
<v Speaker 2>where I thought it was a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a big stick across the ground and</v>

260
00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:45.720
<v Speaker 2>as I was jumping over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dog's already passed it.</v>

261
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:51.020
<v Speaker 2>I realized in the Air I was jumping over</v>
<v Speaker 2>off of that huge dude,</v>

262
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.710
<v Speaker 2>but they're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

263
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.570
<v Speaker 2>anybody just look and try to stay there </v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you could know.</v>

264
00:10:57.571 --> 00:11:02.150
<v Speaker 2>I put the dogs away because that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I had pit bulls and they'd go after</v>

265
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.120
<v Speaker 2>three times by rattlesnakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

266
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:10.340
<v Speaker 2>I just have to take them to the doctor </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's super expensive to get </v>

267
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.940
<v Speaker 2>antivenom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn huge pain.</v>

268
00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:13.140
<v Speaker 2>The Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

269
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where were we?</v>

270
00:11:16.771 --> 00:11:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toxoplasma.</v>

271
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It affects the rats,</v>

272
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.160
<v Speaker 2>convinces the rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That cat's.</v>

273
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Not only does it take away the fear of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cats,</v>

274
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:31.110
<v Speaker 2>but it rewires their sexual reward </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and makes them attracted to cat </v>

275
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.620
<v Speaker 2>piss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

276
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 2>They get hard ons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

277
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Since that's like if there was nobody to</v>
<v Speaker 2>reproducing.</v>

278
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.930
<v Speaker 2>If there was some disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like no,</v>

279
00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:38.110
<v Speaker 2>fat checks are pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

280
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.540
<v Speaker 2>And then you would just have to go for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

281
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.550
<v Speaker 2>We just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you heard of this new tick?</v>

282
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 2>There's a new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new tick,</v>

283
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.370
<v Speaker 2>a disease for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer is no,</v>

284
00:11:47.371 --> 00:11:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I have not heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

285
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.770
<v Speaker 2>it gives you a meat allergy and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>spreading through Texas,</v>

286
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:57.950
<v Speaker 2>so it's called the lone star tick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're allergic to meat after you've </v>

287
00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:57.950
<v Speaker 2>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>

288
00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:58.870
<v Speaker 2>And then what does that do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

289
00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:02.110
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a chemical called Alpha Gal.</v>

290
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like a alpha go lactamase or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and forget how to say it,</v>

291
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.900
<v Speaker 2>but this stuff is in this tick bite and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it gets into your system it makes </v>

292
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:17.320
<v Speaker 2>you literally allergic to meat.</v>

293
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 2>And so people who were like rabid </v>
<v Speaker 2>carnivores,</v>

294
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.860
<v Speaker 2>radiolab did an art or a podcast about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

295
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 2>And the podcast is called Alpha Alphago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alphago,</v>

296
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Alpha Gal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gal like a girl.</v>

297
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it makes religion to meet.</v>

298
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.960
<v Speaker 2>So to what end?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What purpose?</v>

299
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 2>There's no purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

300
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.240
<v Speaker 2>it's like lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a side effect of getting bit by a </v>

301
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.250
<v Speaker 2>tick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's Cunty bugs a ton of our bullshit.</v>

302
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.150
<v Speaker 2>Too many men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they teamed up.</v>

303
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started thinking about it when people </v>

304
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.020
<v Speaker 2>said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you be like 12,</v>

305
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 2>12 year olds?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck up 12,</v>

306
00:12:57.041 --> 00:12:57.740

<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

307
00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.950
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe 100 percent.</v>

308
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.170
<v Speaker 2>What if they're organized?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

309
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:02.950
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a chance.</v>

310
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.250
<v Speaker 2>If they all come at you at once and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't care about getting beat up.</v>

311
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody cares about getting beat up.</v>

312
00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:10.000
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about non humans now.</v>

313
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Well wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you start training them at a </v>

314
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:15.270

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fuck them up.</v>

315
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:19.180
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first one's going to get kicked </v>

316
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.261
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A person's going to get kicked hard for </v>

317
00:13:22.261 --> 00:13:23.851

<v Speaker 2>You don't take those guys,</v>

325
00:13:37.411 --> 00:13:38.280
<v Speaker 2>but if it's a trained army of 12 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>olds,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They eat a lot of berries.</v>

332
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had to,</v>

333
00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

334
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had a fight,</v>

335
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.060
<v Speaker 2>a 500 pound hulking man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd be fucked.</v>

336
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Who'd be fucked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd be fucked.</v>

337
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.490
<v Speaker 2>We didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have a chance.</v>

338
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:08.580
<v Speaker 2>What about 12 like Duncan trussell's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you take that a little bit bigger </v>

339
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.661
<v Speaker 2>than his current form?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Current Florence absolutely wouldn't </v>

340
00:14:12.661 --> 00:14:12.661
<v Speaker 2>have a chance.</v>

341
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:19.240
<v Speaker 2>One of them in front of me at some point</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all you have to do is hit that one </v>

342
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.850
<v Speaker 2>and the other ones are gonna panic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I never said about the Bruce </v>

343
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Lee movies when they would come out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the time.</v>

344
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe sometimes two at a time,</v>

345
00:14:25.841 --> 00:14:29.710
<v Speaker 2>but never in the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was just like wagon grab them,</v>

346
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:34.740
<v Speaker 2>just grab them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with Duncan as he wouldn't </v>

347
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:34.740
<v Speaker 2>be able to really do any damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he got close,</v>

348
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.210
<v Speaker 2>he could punch your square in the jaw </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'd laugh it off like via Berakah.</v>

349
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>

350
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all you got?</v>

351
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:46.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you had to deal with like three </v>

352
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:46.740
<v Speaker 2>burke crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

353
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably going to get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

354
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.410

<v Speaker 2>most likely you'd have to.</v>

355
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.160
<v Speaker 2>You have to really make sure you connect</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard on that first guy.</v>

356
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.040

359
00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:08.780
<v Speaker 2>for everybody else to let them know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

385
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.370

<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>

387

<v Speaker 2>When it was raining a lot,</v>

390
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:26.380
<v Speaker 2>this would turn into a river and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like during the middle of the spring </v>

391
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:31.480
<v Speaker 2>hopes the middle of the spring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a pretty thick with water down </v>

392
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:31.480
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

393
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Speaker 2>It would go all the way up to that high </v>
<v Speaker 2>spot over there.</v>

394
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:38.590
<v Speaker 2>We're over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was just like see those rocks a </v>

395
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.190
<v Speaker 2>little bit higher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe two or three feet above where</v>

396
00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:44.030
<v Speaker 2>the water was pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was just when all the water was</v>

397
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:46.280
<v Speaker 2>coming down from the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all comes down here,</v>

398
00:16:46.281 --> 00:16:46.760
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

399
00:16:46.761 --> 00:16:49.520
<v Speaker 2>It was the runoff from the snow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then followed by the heavy rains that we</v>

400
00:16:49.521 --> 00:16:52.610
<v Speaker 2>had for days and days.</v>

<v Speaker 2>flooded.</v>

403
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

404
00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Where people like a complaining about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Hollywood because all they say is we </v>

405

406
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.880
<v Speaker 2>rain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it happens two years later and </v>

407
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:06.880
<v Speaker 2>like enough with this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three days in a row,</v>

408
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.310
<v Speaker 2>people are going to move to this room.</v>

<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one feels the Goddamn a drought in </v>

410
00:17:12.311 --> 00:17:12.311
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood.</v>

411
00:17:12.311 --> 00:17:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>

413
00:17:18.011 --> 00:17:19.820
<v Speaker 2>the water on the waters road here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's no corn suddenly.</v>

414
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:20.690
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

415
00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:26.080

<v Speaker 2>I feel like people need some kind of </v>

416
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.400
<v Speaker 2>weather in order to really appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the good,</v>

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.890
<v Speaker 2>the good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you need some rain.</v>

418
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Like that was like growing up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>east coast.</v>

419
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.480
<v Speaker 2>It snowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when summertime came around,</v>

424
00:17:48.591 --> 00:17:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Everyone feels it together and then when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's finally gets warmed,</v>

425
00:17:51.481 --> 00:17:52.260
<v Speaker 2>the whole cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

426
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:52.980

<v Speaker 2>You guys,</v>

427
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:54.000
<v Speaker 2>we survived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of us,</v>

428
00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:55.830
<v Speaker 2>not all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>let's enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go out.</v>

430
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.190

431
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.760
<v Speaker 2>In a over where I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's three seasons that have for </v>

432
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:05.880
<v Speaker 2>winter,</v>

<v Speaker 2>family with what's wrong with </v>

<v Speaker 3>It's traveling,</v>

545
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:55.060
<v Speaker 3>but there's just like floating forest </v>
<v Speaker 3>where these trees grow out of this.</v>

546
00:22:55.061 --> 00:23:00.061
<v Speaker 3>Like just this water and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like lily pads everywhere so it just </v>

547
00:23:00.061 --> 00:23:01.750
<v Speaker 3>looks like grass and trees coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're on a boat through it.</v>

548
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty great.</v>

549
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:08.870
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then we get off the boat and get </v>

550
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.870
<v Speaker 3>onto the dock and this fucking Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 3>guard.</v>

551
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:09.190
<v Speaker 3>They're the worst.</v>

552
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:14.190
<v Speaker 3>Travelers are the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just dumped a cigarette and you're </v>

553
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.190
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Nobody's here man.</v>

555
00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.130
<v Speaker 3>There's no street sweeping here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in the fucking woods.</v>

556
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Did you say something to them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

557
00:23:19.511 --> 00:23:21.580
<v Speaker 3>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

558
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:23.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't want conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also it's like,</v>

559
00:23:23.441 --> 00:23:26.360
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to learn?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chinese travelers are the worst that.</v>

560
00:23:26.361 --> 00:23:28.690
<v Speaker 3>That's why the Great Barrier Reef was </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead really?</v>

561
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:33.810
<v Speaker 3>Because he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please don't put on sunscreen and </v>

562
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:33.810
<v Speaker 3>Chinese people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

563
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:34.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna put on all the sunscreen </v>
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>

<v Speaker 3>No kidding.</v>

565
00:23:35.381 --> 00:23:40.381
<v Speaker 3>So they say don't put on sunscreen in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the area of the great barrier while </v>

566
00:23:40.381 --> 00:23:40.381
<v Speaker 3>you're scuba diving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

567
00:23:40.381 --> 00:23:44.641
<v Speaker 3>you're covered in a wetsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like you don't really need just a </v>

568
00:23:44.641 --> 00:23:44.980
<v Speaker 3>little on your neck and Parul on like 45</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes before.</v>

<v Speaker 4>percent debt or something,</v>

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just showing up and I would do </v>

647
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:59.550
<v Speaker 2>gigs and I get out of there like with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Diaz,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours for hours to one with the car and </v>

654
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:14.300
<v Speaker 2>he says to not yell or whatever last </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

655
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:18.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the first time I'd been there in </v>

656
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:18.780
<v Speaker 2>a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to go there all the time,</v>

657
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:19.800
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me it was like more than a decade.</v>

658
00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.710
<v Speaker 2>More than inside a cornice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long were you gone for?</v>

659
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:23.820
<v Speaker 2>Seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven years.</v>

660
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

661
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.300
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

662
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Seven long ass years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I had really great sets,</v>

663
00:27:32.911 --> 00:27:36.930
<v Speaker 2>really did good specials and bats </v>
<v Speaker 2>specials when I was gone,</v>

664
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.660
<v Speaker 2>but the bad special that I did wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>

665
00:27:39.661 --> 00:27:41.550
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't real good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was 2012.</v>

666
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Ramped me up for the 2014 one which was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about because in space,</v>

667
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:50.400
<v Speaker 2>which was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that ramp me up for triggered,</v>

668
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:55.520
<v Speaker 2>which is probably my best one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think this new one is going to be </v>

669
00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.071
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are talking about your newstuff </v>

670
00:27:58.071 --> 00:27:58.071
<v Speaker 2>the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen her.</v>

671
00:27:58.071 --> 00:27:58.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

672
00:27:58.381 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 2>the door I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

673
00:27:59.221 --> 00:28:01.710
<v Speaker 2>it's like on another level now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like,</v>

674
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:07.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like rockstars will like 25 as </v>

675
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.190
<v Speaker 2>their prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

676
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

677
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not slacking off.</v>

678
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we get to this point where we're</v>

679
00:28:12.331 --> 00:28:17.331
<v Speaker 2>dedicated to something and we get good </v>
<v Speaker 2>at it or we get successful at it at </v>

680
00:28:17.331 --> 00:28:20.340
<v Speaker 2>least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once you get some adulation you</v>

681
00:28:20.341 --> 00:28:22.110
<v Speaker 2>sort of relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I kinda got it.</v>

682
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.540
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm doing now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now let me fucking go.</v>

683
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's gonna make me think about </v>

684
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.131
<v Speaker 2>quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I do a bad set that needs </v>

685
00:28:31.131 --> 00:28:31.131
<v Speaker 2>improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now my,</v>

686
00:28:31.131 --> 00:28:33.720
<v Speaker 2>my opinion is totally different now it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>all about,</v>

687
00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:38.721
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that the only way I'm really </v>

688
00:28:38.721 --> 00:28:41.661
<v Speaker 2>happy is if my is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if everything in my life is going </v>

689
00:28:41.661 --> 00:28:41.661
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I bomb,</v>

690
00:28:41.661 --> 00:28:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I am not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

691
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.730
<v Speaker 2>So how do I fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

692
00:28:44.731 --> 00:28:46.960
<v Speaker 2>I have to fucking work more at my stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

693
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I have to just whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote down on my computer and on my</v>

694
00:28:52.411 --> 00:28:57.240
<v Speaker 2>phone a schedule that I have to adhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>to every week and one of them is I write</v>

695
00:28:57.241 --> 00:28:59.150
<v Speaker 2>five hours every week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a week ago.</v>

696
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.400
<v Speaker 2>It's attainable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't go crazy like seinfeld where </v>

697
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.981
<v Speaker 2>it's like eight hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm not gonna hit that and </v>

698
00:29:06.981 --> 00:29:07.500
<v Speaker 2>then I'll fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they tell people not to try to quit</v>

699
00:29:07.501 --> 00:29:09.540
<v Speaker 2>smoking their first year because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

700
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:10.830
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way harder.</v>

701
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.380
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to feel that and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to.</v>

702
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.510
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna make it think like fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go back to everything.</v>

703
00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:16.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like don't even try that.</v>

704
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.470
<v Speaker 2>So that's where I think make attainable </v>
<v Speaker 2>goals.</v>

705
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

706
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.270
<v Speaker 2>I also set attainable goals for like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fitness too,</v>

707
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.310
<v Speaker 2>like the amount of times a week I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>yoga,</v>

708
00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:28.290
<v Speaker 2>the amount of times a week I run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think all those,</v>

709
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.240
<v Speaker 2>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

710
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:34.350
<v Speaker 2>they build on each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the momentum of them and it makes </v>

711
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.011
<v Speaker 2>the stand up better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also like just thinking about </v>

712
00:29:37.011 --> 00:29:37.011
<v Speaker 2>the standup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like thinking about the set,</v>

713
00:29:37.011 --> 00:29:38.460
<v Speaker 2>trying to make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to like,</v>

714
00:29:38.461 --> 00:29:41.290
<v Speaker 2>how much of this is bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of this is ego?</v>

715
00:29:41.291 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 2>How much of this is just,</v>

716
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.080
<v Speaker 4>I haven't looked at it enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to get it better.</v>

717
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:49.260
<v Speaker 4>How much of this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only came out of this one way and I </v>

718
00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:49.260
<v Speaker 4>stuck with that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't I come at it another way?</v>

719
00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing that a lot now.</v>

720
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.410
<v Speaker 4>That's how I see a tail doing that where</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

721
00:29:53.411 --> 00:29:55.180
<v Speaker 4>let me change one word around now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Back now,</v>

722
00:29:55.181 --> 00:29:56.920
<v Speaker 4>back again when it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

723
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.270
<v Speaker 4>just because I've been doing doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>make it right.</v>

724
00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never know dude.</v>

725
00:29:59.351 --> 00:30:04.351
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll be excited and you'll switch it </v>

726
00:30:04.351 --> 00:30:08.880
<v Speaker 4>and it'll be way better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you don't know until you until you </v>

727
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:08.880
<v Speaker 4>like get out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to do it.</v>

728
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.230
<v Speaker 4>I always thought that's what hell Bobby </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lee back for a long time was that he was</v>

729
00:30:11.231 --> 00:30:13.180
<v Speaker 4>always like showcase for pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it was like,</v>

730
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.230
<v Speaker 4>this is the best it is right now.</v>

731
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to fucking go one time and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a great comic,</v>

732
00:30:16.721 --> 00:30:20.830
<v Speaker 4>but like he's not going to risk one time</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to differently or try new shit.</v>

733
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to bobby about it.</v>

734
00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:26.310
<v Speaker 4>I think bobby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just never did a special.</v>

735
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:31.340
<v Speaker 4>And if he did a special he'd be forced </v>
<v Speaker 4>to write new stuff and I think his new </v>

736
00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.670
<v Speaker 4>stuff would really ultimately be way </v>
<v Speaker 4>better than the stuff he's doing.</v>

737
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.410
<v Speaker 4>Not the stuff he's doing isn't really </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

738
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:35.640
<v Speaker 4>It really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's really funny.</v>

739
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.880
<v Speaker 4>But I think bobby has ladies are more </v>
<v Speaker 4>developed comic genius potential and </v>

740
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.230
<v Speaker 4>he's just a little nervous about putting</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff out there.</v>

741
00:30:43.231 --> 00:30:45.360
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

742
00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:46.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

743
00:30:46.081 --> 00:30:51.081
<v Speaker 4>I just been paying more attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been trying to pay a lot of </v>

744
00:30:51.081 --> 00:30:51.270
<v Speaker 4>attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just put your phone through it.</v>

745
00:30:51.271 --> 00:30:56.271
<v Speaker 4>When you drive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think about when you listen to the </v>

746
00:30:56.271 --> 00:30:58.241
<v Speaker 4>recordings all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sometimes I'm listening to music </v>

747
00:30:58.241 --> 00:30:58.241
<v Speaker 4>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

748
00:30:58.241 --> 00:30:58.950
<v Speaker 4>I should be doing work.</v>

749
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:04.310
<v Speaker 4>I should be doing work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's dissect this fucking set and I </v>

750
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.980
<v Speaker 4>don't want to and I don't want to listen</v>
<v Speaker 4>to podcasts.</v>

751
00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:09.570
<v Speaker 4>Listen to your podcast or Duncan or </v>
<v Speaker 4>burgers or something like that,</v>

752
00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.340
<v Speaker 4>or Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll,</v>

753
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.140
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll go over my head again.</v>

754
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.370
<v Speaker 4>I'll figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

755
00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:19.460
<v Speaker 4>figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yoshi said to me was who?</v>

756
00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.590
<v Speaker 4>Who's The guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jets?</v>

757
00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:26.740
<v Speaker 4>Small five to Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go in the old bomb squad.</v>

758
00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.860
<v Speaker 4>He was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

759
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:31.910
<v Speaker 4>When he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I started and he was like,</v>

760
00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:36.250
<v Speaker 4>I thought it had succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

761
00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.450
<v Speaker 4>talking about what you though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he goes,</v>

762
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:40.280
<v Speaker 4>here's what you gotta do you gotta think</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it all the time.</v>

763
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:42.470
<v Speaker 4>Like I think about digital all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll get better.</v>

764
00:31:42.471 --> 00:31:42.920
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

765
00:31:42.921 --> 00:31:44.300
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I already got something for that.</v>

766
00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a real problem.</v>

767
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.960
<v Speaker 4>You have to have to figure out like how </v>
<v Speaker 4>much energy you put into other stuff </v>

768
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:56.610
<v Speaker 4>from me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's archery or used to be pool </v>

769
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:57.820
<v Speaker 4>pool was the worst because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really do archery eight hours a day.</v>

770
00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.820
<v Speaker 4>You'll get too tired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can play pool eight hours day </v>

771
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:02.820
<v Speaker 4>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's got a stretcher back.</v>

772
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:07.651
<v Speaker 4>Once in a while you just get more and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more cycle about it and then it becomes </v>

773
00:32:07.651 --> 00:32:07.651
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

774
00:32:07.651 --> 00:32:12.570
<v Speaker 4>how much of this is benefiting me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it benefiting me spending all this </v>

775
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:16.201
<v Speaker 4>time tweaking about balls going into </v>
<v Speaker 4>holes or is it like a big distraction </v>

776
00:32:16.201 --> 00:32:20.970
<v Speaker 4>because I don't want to put that same </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of time into writing or into </v>

777
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:24.990
<v Speaker 4>think about standing mean honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a diminishing point of returns </v>

778
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:24.990
<v Speaker 4>at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

779
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.240
<v Speaker 4>but a thumb of anything else you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about is time.</v>

780
00:32:27.241 --> 00:32:29.340
<v Speaker 4>You're not spending thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

781
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.530
<v Speaker 4>Now there might be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we said,</v>

782
00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.410
<v Speaker 4>nothing more than like 34 hours a week </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be successful,</v>

783
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.200
<v Speaker 4>so taking away that time is okay above </v>
<v Speaker 4>34.</v>

784
00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:39.680
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

785
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:43.640
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you also want recreation,</v>

786
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.190
<v Speaker 4>recreation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>work your mind out a little bit.</v>

787
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

788
00:32:46.581 --> 00:32:51.581
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm going to reload this or say </v>

789
00:32:51.581 --> 00:32:51.581
<v Speaker 4>that I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even like video games.</v>

790
00:32:51.581 --> 00:32:56.291
<v Speaker 4>I think if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as you don't get crazy with </v>

791
00:32:56.291 --> 00:32:58.721
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're probably fun and </v>

792
00:32:58.721 --> 00:33:00.431
<v Speaker 4>beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is if you start like </v>

793
00:33:00.431 --> 00:33:00.800
<v Speaker 4>super getting into Jujitsu the way you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are in a comedy,</v>

794
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.100
<v Speaker 4>you're comedy's going to take second </v>
<v Speaker 4>position.</v>

795
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:08.710
<v Speaker 4>Scada York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when she won that award for whatever </v>

796
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.710
<v Speaker 4>dancer in the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you work the singer,</v>

797
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.050
<v Speaker 4>she did acting once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>half the awards.</v>

798
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:13.300
<v Speaker 4>Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

799
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.130
<v Speaker 4>And then the will you can do that more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she was,</v>

800
00:33:16.131 --> 00:33:17.810
<v Speaker 4>she said she felt like cheating on </v>
<v Speaker 4>music.</v>

801
00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.580
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful bjork.</v>

802
00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:22.190
<v Speaker 4>I saw her house in Iceland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

803
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.220
<v Speaker 4>I saw a beat up a photographer and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>video.</v>

804
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:30.580
<v Speaker 4>Someone was found around taking pictures</v>
<v Speaker 4>of her and she started beating around </v>

805
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:30.580
<v Speaker 4>York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

806
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:33.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Giving them a new bowls punches.</v>

807
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:35.240
<v Speaker 4>Some lady was like totally disrespecting</v>
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>

808
00:33:35.241 --> 00:33:40.241
<v Speaker 4>She was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like had a camera like interface and </v>

809
00:33:40.241 --> 00:33:42.640
<v Speaker 4>she's filming her and I guess words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the exact scenario,</v>

810
00:33:42.641 --> 00:33:44.090
<v Speaker 4>but they had words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>

811
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:47.820
<v Speaker 4>A Bjork Bjork what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>After that on her,</v>

812
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:49.910

<v Speaker 4>Let me pull up that video.</v>

813
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.340
<v Speaker 4>Which Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull up that video.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't really totally remember the </v>

815
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:59.261

<v Speaker 4>has no fighting experience?</v>

824
00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:22.560
<v Speaker 4>Vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Angelina Jolie's got crazy on her side </v>

825
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:22.560
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Bob Thorton's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She kept around.</v>

831
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:33.920
<v Speaker 4>How do you survive that as a career </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's full on publicly crazy.</v>

832
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:36.350
<v Speaker 4>She's so gangster that's full on out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

833
00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.810
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to fight that girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd be like fighting a wild cat.</v>

834
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.440
<v Speaker 4>She bite you for sure.</v>

836
00:34:43.371 --> 00:34:45.950
<v Speaker 4>you're getting bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's probably gonna fuck you up.</v>

837
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.950
<v Speaker 4>You're going to realize you took her </v>
<v Speaker 4>lightly as you're going unconscious,</v>

838
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:55.470
<v Speaker 4>so I see where I went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mashing your head off the side of a </v>

839
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:55.470
<v Speaker 4>sync.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like would attack.</v>

840
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:59.300
<v Speaker 4>She's fucking move like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

841
00:34:59.301 --> 00:35:01.270
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see that coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She would attack.</v>

842
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.190
<v Speaker 4>You ever see I let them in the remake of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that vampire movie.</v>

843
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:09.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want that girl jumped on that </v>

844
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:09.580
<v Speaker 4>guy under the bridge.</v>

845
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.460
<v Speaker 4>That's what Angelina Jolie would attach </v>
<v Speaker 4>to you.</v>

846
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.250
<v Speaker 4>That's a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forgot that movie.</v>

847
00:35:13.251 --> 00:35:16.520
<v Speaker 4>I saw the original one too and I thought</v>
<v Speaker 4>this movie is amazing.</v>

848
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.040
<v Speaker 4>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they're gonna fuck up the remake.</v>

849
00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:19.670
<v Speaker 4>And they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't.</v>

850
00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.560
<v Speaker 4>They didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't fuck it up at all.</v>

851
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:22.620
<v Speaker 4>Like low budget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

852
00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just nailed it.</v>

853
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:25.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was really great.</v>

854
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:27.170
<v Speaker 4>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even the remake was great.</v>

855
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:28.090
<v Speaker 4>Upside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did it.</v>

856
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.310
<v Speaker 4>They did it as sort of a new story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the same thing and you know what?</v>

857
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:35.660
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to do a remake that it has </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be undeniable.</v>

858
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:40.870
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it was good that it was </v>

859
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.870
<v Speaker 4>undeniable and everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty fucking good.</v>

860
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:43.640
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever see two movies are actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrifying.</v>

861
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.980
<v Speaker 4>A kid vampire and the old man who was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like loved her too because he's been </v>

862
00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:50.820
<v Speaker 4>with it for whatever years.</v>

863
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.570
<v Speaker 4>Something about a kid vampire just </v>
<v Speaker 4>scares the fuck out of us.</v>

864
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.720
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be amongst us.</v>

865
00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.560
<v Speaker 4>A fucking kid vampire little like four </v>
<v Speaker 4>foot tall thing run at you crazy.</v>

866
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm not allowed to hit back party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

867
00:36:04.171 --> 00:36:05.950
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I go this?</v>

868
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.070
<v Speaker 4>And you can't even do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway.</v>

869
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.200
<v Speaker 4>Superhuman power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

870
00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:12.660
<v Speaker 4>Even that little girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she could fuck those dudes up.</v>

871
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.410
<v Speaker 4>There was no chance of ever losing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>had no chance.</v>

872
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:19.700
<v Speaker 4>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fan Pirates are like on a totally </v>

873
00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:19.700
<v Speaker 4>different level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not humans.</v>

874
00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:19.700
<v Speaker 4>Who's that girl?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actor.</v>

875
00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 4>She's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's very good.</v>

876
00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.690
<v Speaker 4>Like what I see a vampire is not like </v>
<v Speaker 4>superman though.</v>

877
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:29.730
<v Speaker 4>Know exactly what are they not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can take to the heart.</v>

878
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:34.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you got to get a stake in their </v>

879
00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:34.820
<v Speaker 4>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

880
00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:34.820
<v Speaker 4>so it's not that you couldn't be at that</v>
<v Speaker 4>point were not done.</v>

881
00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 4>He's going to kick your ass somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>

882
00:36:35.791 --> 00:36:38.310
<v Speaker 4>Becoming a vampire makes you way </v>
<v Speaker 4>stronger.</v>

883
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.770
<v Speaker 4>Do they heal like wolverine?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they get hurt,</v>

884
00:36:40.771 --> 00:36:45.771
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think until the state goes into the </v>

885
00:36:45.771 --> 00:36:45.771
<v Speaker 4>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't really hurt him.</v>

886
00:36:45.771 --> 00:36:48.180
<v Speaker 4>He should wear heart plates of steel up </v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

887
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:49.550
<v Speaker 4>Like Wolverine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

888
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.260
<v Speaker 4>But then they started changing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They started changing that,</v>

889
00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.510
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like some of the later movies to like,</v>

890
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.960
<v Speaker 4>what was that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thirty days of night you guys die.</v>

891
00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:03.430
<v Speaker 4>I think daily is like sunlight to kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>them with like silver or something.</v>

892
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:07.260
<v Speaker 4>Some of them they make up new rules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can kill them with silver,</v>

893
00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

894
00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.220
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a wearable that could do that </v>

895
00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:13.220
<v Speaker 4>in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just got to like,</v>

896
00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:13.220
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was wrong with those people thought</v>

897
00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.520
<v Speaker 4>it's actually this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got bullets with garlic in it.</v>

898
00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.230
<v Speaker 4>You're going to kill them.</v>

899
00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.100
<v Speaker 4>Like black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that.</v>

900
00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:20.130
<v Speaker 4>Like garlic would kill them and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they had would tip bullets.</v>

901
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:22.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can use machine guns on them.</v>

902
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:27.810
<v Speaker 4>Blade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the comic book Superhero Blade had these</v>

903
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:32.840
<v Speaker 4>teak wood knives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had wooden knives and he would hunt </v>

904
00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.790
<v Speaker 4>vampires.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's stabbed them to death and they were</v>

905
00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:38.400
<v Speaker 4>just had to have a wood knife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we got this super hard wood.</v>

906
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:39.690
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

907
00:37:39.691 --> 00:37:44.370
<v Speaker 4>That was good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea of vampires,</v>

908
00:37:44.371 --> 00:37:49.371
<v Speaker 4>I think it's haunted people forever </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I think it's what people are </v>

909
00:37:49.371 --> 00:37:51.930
<v Speaker 4>capable of at their very worst.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Drinking people's blood in human,</v>

910
00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:57.110
<v Speaker 4>just being inhuman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You heard about some of the shit that </v>

911
00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.740
<v Speaker 4>went down in Liberia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What were during the civil war?</v>

912
00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:03.920
<v Speaker 4>They were capturing children from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from neighboring tribes would eat their </v>

913
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.890
<v Speaker 4>flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would eat their heart.</v>

914
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:10.280
<v Speaker 4>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was one of the vice pieces on </v>

915
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:10.920
<v Speaker 4>Liberia where he talks about and </v>
<v Speaker 4>describes how he would do it,</v>

916
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:16.130
<v Speaker 4>how he would go to a neighboring tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>captured one of their children and eat </v>

917
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:16.620
<v Speaker 4>his heart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

921
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.850
<v Speaker 4>they're done with that now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of power.</v>

922
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

928
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:38.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

929
00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:40.660
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know about until the vice </v>
<v Speaker 3>series.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You just kept going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if we're having a brain fart.</v>

1051
00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to check himself in.</v>

1052
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh well dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buddy,</v>

1053
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:40.560
<v Speaker 3>Brendan Schaub had an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His friends really had to take the pills</v>

1054
00:43:40.561 --> 00:43:45.561
<v Speaker 3>from him who's taking them every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>several times a day for like months and </v>

1055
00:43:45.561 --> 00:43:46.620
<v Speaker 3>his friends came over to south side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Dude,</v>

1056
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.190
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1057
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.650
<v Speaker 3>no more of these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said he,</v>

1058
00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:52.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had to kick it and it was hard.</v>

1059
00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:58.730
<v Speaker 3>But he's a disciplined athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a strong minded dude.</v>

1060
00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could kick it,</v>

1061
00:44:00.331 --> 00:44:05.331
<v Speaker 3>but maybe if you're like a week of </v>
<v Speaker 3>willed person that's more inclined to </v>

1062
00:44:05.331 --> 00:44:07.530
<v Speaker 3>give into things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you know,</v>

1063
00:44:07.531 --> 00:44:09.840
<v Speaker 3>maybe we gave you or maybe if you have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical imbalance,</v>

1064
00:44:09.841 --> 00:44:12.300
<v Speaker 3>it makes you look really super.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd come off it.</v>

1065
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:13.410
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1066
00:44:13.411 --> 00:44:15.510
<v Speaker 3>here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to come off it real slow.</v>

1067
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:20.890
<v Speaker 3>See I was on 100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me think if I'm right and 50 </v>

1068
00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:24.210
<v Speaker 3>milligrams of the Superman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

1069
00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:29.240
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what we found that through </v>

1070
00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:29.240
<v Speaker 3>experimentation and then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you coming off it,</v>

1071
00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 3>quarter 1:25</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a week everyday for a week</v>

1072
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:37.700
<v Speaker 4>and then always monitor yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you start thinking about suicide at </v>

1073
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:37.700
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to call me immediately.</v>

1074
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.840
<v Speaker 4>Go back on a regular dose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>

1075
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.520
<v Speaker 4>they tell you to like really like be </v>
<v Speaker 4>careful,</v>

1076
00:44:41.521 --> 00:44:43.800
<v Speaker 4>but not everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they go,</v>

1077
00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:44.640
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm done with that.</v>

1078
00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:46.170
<v Speaker 4>That was my last position I want to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>back to write,</v>

1079
00:44:46.171 --> 00:44:48.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I think the better example might be</v>

1080
00:44:48.691 --> 00:44:52.680
<v Speaker 4>the pain pill thing because it's painful</v>
<v Speaker 4>for them to stop.</v>

1081
00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:54.120
<v Speaker 4>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1082
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:56.090
<v Speaker 4>they ate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1083
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.290
<v Speaker 4>I think they're all crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's everything has.</v>

1084
00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:01.140
<v Speaker 4>It's this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything has its own crazy.</v>

1085
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:01.620
<v Speaker 4>Hang on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hang on,</v>

1086
00:45:01.621 --> 00:45:03.410
<v Speaker 4>let me look over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's math?</v>

1087
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.560
<v Speaker 4>I want to say where this cliff cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean everything has its own crazy.</v>

1088
00:45:07.561 --> 00:45:09.700
<v Speaker 4>But think those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1089
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:13.500
<v Speaker 4>pain pills from just the experiences of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that I've talked to,</v>

1090
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:17.460
<v Speaker 4>not firsthand stuff obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they seem to grip you so hard.</v>

1091
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.420
<v Speaker 4>People just can't shake them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of fighters,</v>

1092
00:45:21.421 --> 00:45:23.040
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of fighters get hurt,</v>

1093
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:29.600
<v Speaker 4>have surgery from all the and then take </v>
<v Speaker 4>a few pain pills and then all of a </v>

1094
00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.680
<v Speaker 4>sudden they got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1095
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:35.780
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're a person who maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a problem in the past and he took a </v>

1096
00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:39.660
<v Speaker 4>break and you were clean and sober,</v>
<v Speaker 4>living the mma life and then suddenly,</v>

1097
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:44.710
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you hurt your back or </v>

1098
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.710
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He needed the painkillers.</v>

1099
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.710
<v Speaker 4>It just took them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry,</v>

1100
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:45.400
<v Speaker 4>I'll get off of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

1101
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:46.290
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1102
00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:51.120
<v Speaker 4>you're challenging people with these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things in a way that I don't necessarily</v>

1103
00:45:51.121 --> 00:45:56.121
<v Speaker 4>know if it's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're challenging them with chemical </v>

1104
00:45:56.121 --> 00:45:56.910
<v Speaker 4>addictions to trust for it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You handle yourself.</v>

1105
00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.500
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1106
00:45:58.501 --> 00:46:01.140
<v Speaker 4>I definitely think you should have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right to do whatever you want,</v>

1107
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:06.350
<v Speaker 4>but I'm thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it messes with your brain </v>

1108
00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:06.350
<v Speaker 4>chemistry though.</v>

1109
00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:06.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like asking a drunk person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you okay to drive?</v>

1110
00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:08.580
<v Speaker 4>And it's like they have the worst </v>
<v Speaker 4>judgment right now.</v>

1111
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:09.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll ask them.</v>

1112
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:15.290
<v Speaker 4>You're taking someone and putting him on</v>
<v Speaker 4>a chemical fucking addiction to </v>

1113
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:15.290
<v Speaker 4>something and then say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1114
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:16.710
<v Speaker 4>but use your regular mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1115
00:46:16.711 --> 00:46:19.410
<v Speaker 4>You're putting them on a crazy cocktail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying,</v>

1116
00:46:19.411 --> 00:46:20.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got pain here.</v>

1117
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:25.610
<v Speaker 4>Have some opiates all day and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>just going to be like in a heroin fog </v>

1118
00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:29.610
<v Speaker 4>and then maybe you'll get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll settle into that heroin fog.</v>

1119
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:32.580
<v Speaker 4>I know a dude has got a fucked up back </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know when he's on.</v>

1120
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:33.660
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>life and the variety we get,</v>

1147
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:53.020
<v Speaker 3>we just get really used to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if it didn't exist,</v>

1148
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:58.500
<v Speaker 3>it's like the whole world was the desert</v>
<v Speaker 3>sand dunes and you got to see something </v>

1149
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:03.301
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be stunned by the amount of </v>

1150
00:48:03.301 --> 00:48:03.820
<v Speaker 3>radiant energy it gives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1151
00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.680

1152
00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:09.680
<v Speaker 3>of a sudden they brought you into like a</v>

<v Speaker 3>Can I touch it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1155
00:48:13.451 --> 00:48:15.590
<v Speaker 3>It's alive around me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1159
00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:29.800
<v Speaker 3>I tried to give as many orthodox Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend to do mushrooms and he was like,</v>

1160
00:48:29.801 --> 00:48:31.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't think God wants me to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>for you to talk to him.</v>

1163
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:36.610
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kept saying,</v>

1164
00:48:36.611 --> 00:48:37.990
<v Speaker 3>you got to pick it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why else would he put it here?</v>

1165
00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.570
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of putting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't manmade.</v>

1166
00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.010
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually a very strong argument.</v>

1167
00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh God made it stupid thing on the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>side of the glass.</v>

1168
00:48:45.281 --> 00:48:46.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're bitten someone in prison.</v>

1169
00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.090
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pick up the phone.</v>

1170
00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:49.330
<v Speaker 3>Talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick up the phone.</v>

1171
00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:53.830
<v Speaker 3>You might be right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

1172
00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Write that down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody texted it to you.</v>

1173
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:59.230
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For real though,</v>

1174
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:04.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the only people that disagree </v>

1175
00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:06.250
<v Speaker 3>with that or people that don't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms or haven't done it.</v>

1176
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Neil said that he took them.</v>

1177
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:12.820
<v Speaker 3>We did them in banff last year and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>said he loves to go to Amsterdam,</v>

1178
00:49:12.821 --> 00:49:15.970
<v Speaker 3>and he took like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think like 10 grams,</v>

1179
00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:19.780
<v Speaker 3>10 grams or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's way too much.</v>

1180
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:21.250
<v Speaker 3>And then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like it was too much for me.</v>

1181
00:49:21.251 --> 00:49:22.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know no one should do that much.</v>

1182
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1183
00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.240
<v Speaker 3>Not the real people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like nobody knew.</v>

1184
00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:33.900
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet those crazy psycho night type </v>

1185
00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:37.320
<v Speaker 3>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't handle 10 grounds to three </v>

1186
00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.370
<v Speaker 3>eighths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1187
00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:41.620
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot for almost a quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three quarters of a quarter.</v>

1188
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:42.570
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1189
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:50.470
<v Speaker 3>You did ask him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He never talked about that.</v>

1190
00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.820
<v Speaker 3>Did what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you think about that?</v>

1191
00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:56.590
<v Speaker 3>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How different,</v>

1192
00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.790
<v Speaker 3>how different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how same.</v>

1193
00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.260
<v Speaker 3>It's very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's um,</v>

1194
00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:03.230
<v Speaker 3>I didn't take a large dose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1195
00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:08.260
<v Speaker 3>I took enough to enjoy it was really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean in real terms?</v>

1196
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:10.210
<v Speaker 3>What a tab or something or drop or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1197
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a piece of an altoid I'm not.</v>

1198
00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.790
<v Speaker 3>It was in a candy form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1199
00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:23.640
<v Speaker 3>what I got out of it was that all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things,</v>

1200
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:27.380
<v Speaker 3>whether it's is a great time to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this when we're on the full,</v>

1201
00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:34.010
<v Speaker 3>all of these things are somehow related </v>
<v Speaker 3>with things.</v>

1202
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:36.830
<v Speaker 3>All of these psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even pot,</v>

1203
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:42.020
<v Speaker 3>even edible pod mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lsd,</v>

1204
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:47.500
<v Speaker 3>all of them are taking to you like </v>
<v Speaker 3>separate apartment rooms in God's </v>

1205
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:53.150
<v Speaker 3>gigantic apartment building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll take you to different places.</v>

1206
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:56.780
<v Speaker 3>Like dmd takes you to a different room.</v>

1207
00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Mushrooms have a different party show </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1208
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.570
<v Speaker 3>but it's all in the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same realm.</v>

1209
00:51:02.571 --> 00:51:04.910
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere go somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on in this house with my.</v>

1210
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:07.750
<v Speaker 3>It's not here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1211
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:13.630
<v Speaker 3>and acid is definitely almost like what </v>
<v Speaker 3>acid makes you feel like is that it </v>

1212
00:51:14.091 --> 00:51:18.170
<v Speaker 3>wants to sort of change what here is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1213
00:51:19.170 --> 00:51:20.300
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you say?</v>

1214
00:51:20.301 --> 00:51:25.301
<v Speaker 3>I know I think I have a pretty objective</v>
<v Speaker 3>view of how I see reality.</v>

1215
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:27.620
<v Speaker 3>And then acid goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

1216
00:51:27.621 --> 00:51:29.450
<v Speaker 3>you don't know shit because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1217
00:51:29.451 --> 00:51:34.451
<v Speaker 3>There's something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could change it to something totally </v>

1218
00:51:34.451 --> 00:51:36.410
<v Speaker 3>different forever and you'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what happens.</v>

1219
00:51:36.411 --> 00:51:38.900
<v Speaker 3>It gets this place of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess from fusses over,</v>

1220
00:51:38.901 --> 00:51:40.640
<v Speaker 3>so you missed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still catch up.</v>

1221
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Go Pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

1222
00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:47.290
<v Speaker 3>but I've gotten to the place where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1223
00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:50.330
<v Speaker 3>like you see the truth a lot on </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms.</v>

1224
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.700
<v Speaker 3>Acid is a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1225
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1226
00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:57.210
<v Speaker 3>I felt like it was pretty introspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1227
00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:00.020
<v Speaker 3>But it was also calming and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting way,</v>

1228
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.720
<v Speaker 3>like per perspective enhancing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>calming,</v>

1229
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:09.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that where you're like </v>

1230
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:09.280
<v Speaker 3>everything's gonna be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1231
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.690
<v Speaker 3>But you see it since it was the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>time I did probably go into that with </v>

1232
00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:17.201
<v Speaker 3>some preconceived notions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never know because I'm Larry Hagman </v>

1233
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.200
<v Speaker 3>with some notions from bell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's think I did.</v>

1234
00:52:21.201 --> 00:52:25.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Larry Hagman from Dallas before he died.</v>

1235
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:30.400
<v Speaker 3>Really just doing all these interviews </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was talking about like important </v>

1236
00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.070
<v Speaker 3>lessons in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what the context was,</v>

1237
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:36.400
<v Speaker 3>but he said that he took Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really Larry Hagman and that Lsd took </v>

1238
00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:40.660
<v Speaker 3>away his fear of dying and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget that.</v>

1239
00:52:40.661 --> 00:52:45.661
<v Speaker 3>Like he looks so peaceful when he said </v>
<v Speaker 3>that to the lady who was interviewing </v>

1240
00:52:45.661 --> 00:52:46.640
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a lady that's bold,</v>

1241
00:52:46.641 --> 00:52:48.260
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking networker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've not even been a lady,</v>

1242
00:52:48.261 --> 00:52:50.180
<v Speaker 3>might have been a dude and I've turned </v>
<v Speaker 3>them into the lady.</v>

1243
00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:55.820
<v Speaker 3>Why draw your own conclusions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1244
00:52:56.330 --> 00:53:01.330
<v Speaker 3>I think his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his statements on it about it made him </v>

1245
00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:05.711
<v Speaker 3>not afraid of death and appreciating </v>
<v Speaker 3>like what life is and how life keeps </v>

1246
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:07.430
<v Speaker 3>moving.</v>

1247
00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Making any sort of efforts to make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>legal.</v>

1248
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:17.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you've got to tread carefully </v>

1249
00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:18.110
<v Speaker 3>with all this stuff because you get one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these jeff sessions types,</v>

1250
00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:23.111
<v Speaker 3>characters kits in an office and starts </v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslim buckling down on muscle and the </v>

1251
00:53:24.591 --> 00:53:25.380
<v Speaker 3>laws around,</v>

1252
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.520
<v Speaker 4>they don't want state rights to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

1253
00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 4>You know the elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Elephant Rock in front of a lion.</v>

1254
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:39.590
<v Speaker 4>Right over here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's try to look like an elephant </v>

1255
00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:40.970
<v Speaker 4>standing in front of a lion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That rock formation rock,</v>

1256
00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:43.230
<v Speaker 4>the one that looks like a nose and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>down from down from there,</v>

1257
00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:48.290
<v Speaker 4>it looks like an elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas the elephant thing with the </v>

1258
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.960
<v Speaker 4>trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1259
00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.950
<v Speaker 4>you don't see it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait.</v>

1260
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:52.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1261
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.590
<v Speaker 4>I do see that trunk there and the like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sheer something else shuts out.</v>

1262
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:55.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1263
00:53:55.921 --> 00:53:56.860
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

1264
00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:58.620
<v Speaker 4>And where's the lion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But right behind,</v>

1265
00:53:58.621 --> 00:54:00.120
<v Speaker 4>right behind it about to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1266
00:54:00.121 --> 00:54:00.960
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1267
00:54:00.961 --> 00:54:02.010
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what I'm saying,</v>

1268
00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:07.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it almost looks like somebody carved </v>

1269
00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:07.100
<v Speaker 4>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me like a rabbit,</v>

1270
00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.380
<v Speaker 4>so I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's still,</v>

1271
00:54:10.381 --> 00:54:13.230
<v Speaker 4>no matter what it definitely attacking </v>
<v Speaker 4>the elephant or next to him.</v>

1272
00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:15.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something's going on.</v>

1273
00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:17.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just thought that.</v>

1274
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:20.340
<v Speaker 4>What in God's name were we just talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about?</v>

1275
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.150
<v Speaker 4>We are so high right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vampire movies now.</v>

1276
00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:27.970
<v Speaker 4>We did that a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That Hawk too.</v>

1277
00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:29.430
<v Speaker 4>Did you grow up with any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wilderness?</v>

1278

<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of woods right across </v>
<v Speaker 4>the street from my house.</v>

1283
00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:43.230

1329
00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:43.970
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're like barely establishing </v>

1330
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:47.040
<v Speaker 4>tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tribes have states that are competing </v>

1331
00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.620
<v Speaker 4>with other states still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1332
00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.430
<v Speaker 4>we should probably break off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1333
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:53.680
<v Speaker 4>Some states have break off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're doing it in Europe.</v>

1334
00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:57.040
<v Speaker 4>They kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are we still together?</v>

1335
00:56:57.041 --> 00:56:58.810
<v Speaker 4>Let's just get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys go on your way.</v>

1336
00:56:58.811 --> 00:57:00.700
<v Speaker 4>We'll go on ours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all too confusing,</v>

1337
00:57:00.701 --> 00:57:03.400
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't understand the military.</v>

1338
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:06.190
<v Speaker 4>You could have like open border </v>
<v Speaker 4>crossings between the mall or something.</v>

1339
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:08.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't understand how.</v>

1340
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:10.870
<v Speaker 4>How would that work if people just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we pulled the military,</v>

1341
00:57:10.871 --> 00:57:15.871
<v Speaker 4>is the military the military work </v>
<v Speaker 4>because then we getting invaded too </v>

1342
00:57:15.871 --> 00:57:15.871
<v Speaker 4>fast?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1343
00:57:15.871 --> 00:57:16.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so because we still have </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same amount of people.</v>

1344
00:57:16.031 --> 00:57:18.910
<v Speaker 4>It's still the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the military becomes weak.</v>

1345
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:24.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to figure out like how does it </v>

1346
00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:25.261
<v Speaker 4>get paid and how does it make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just protecting us and not under </v>

1347
00:57:25.261 --> 00:57:29.371
<v Speaker 4>the will of anybody that has some </v>
<v Speaker 4>various intentions now that there's no </v>

1348
00:57:29.371 --> 00:57:31.240
<v Speaker 4>states are now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no power.</v>

1349
00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:34.630
<v Speaker 4>There's no power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to be like the country of</v>

1350
00:57:34.631 --> 00:57:39.631
<v Speaker 4>California man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess maybe when it was back to where </v>

1351
00:57:39.631 --> 00:57:39.631
<v Speaker 4>it was in the beginning were the states </v>
<v Speaker 4>really felt like,</v>

1352
00:57:39.631 --> 00:57:41.260
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Virginia and then in America,</v>

1353
00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.340
<v Speaker 4>well let's just be real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1354
00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:47.400
<v Speaker 4>States are bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same reason why countries are </v>

1355
00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.100
<v Speaker 4>bullshit so far to high or smart parts </v>
<v Speaker 4>of Kentucky.</v>

1356
00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:51.960
<v Speaker 4>What happened in World War One and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened in World War Two states invaded</v>

1357
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:53.200
<v Speaker 4>states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>

1358
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:56.020
<v Speaker 4>It's like us being invaded by Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>

1359
00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.670
<v Speaker 4>We would lose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1360
00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:00.400
<v Speaker 4>It would probably have a lot of guns </v>
<v Speaker 4>were with people here.</v>

1361
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:04.240
<v Speaker 4>You really think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what it's like if Germany</v>

1362
00:58:04.241 --> 00:58:05.910
<v Speaker 4>invades Poland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1363
00:58:05.911 --> 00:58:06.330
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1364
00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.960
<v Speaker 4>Now they're both in the EU.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1365
00:58:07.961 --> 00:58:09.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like right next to each other.</v>

1366
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:13.660
<v Speaker 4>How far away is Germany to Poland?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1367
00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:15.970
<v Speaker 4>how long does it take to drive Germany </v>
<v Speaker 4>to Poland?</v>

1368
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:19.810
<v Speaker 4>If you had to guess drive inside a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Inside a day.</v>

1369
00:58:19.811 --> 00:58:20.970
<v Speaker 4>Product that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1370
00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet about that day war with Colorado.</v>

1371
00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:26.740
<v Speaker 4>Vancouver to Colorado in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had to,</v>

1372
00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:29.450
<v Speaker 4>if you took adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't get to.</v>

1373
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:32.800
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't get to Montana from there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>From here in a day.</v>

1374
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:34.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1375
00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:37.630
<v Speaker 4>We did Vancouver to La took us like 27 </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

1376
00:58:37.631 --> 00:58:38.980
<v Speaker 4>We have three people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just kept switching,</v>

1377
00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:42.670
<v Speaker 4>only stopped for gas and it took like </v>
<v Speaker 4>27.</v>

1378
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 4>So move that line like over some and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then where's that?</v>

1379
00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.270
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1380
00:58:48.271 --> 00:58:53.271
<v Speaker 4>I think if you could just stay awake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can go pretty far for people </v>

1381
00:58:53.441 --> 00:58:55.600
<v Speaker 4>splitting it in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1382
00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.640
<v Speaker 4>If you could just stay awake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go pretty far in a day,</v>

1383
00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:01.990
<v Speaker 4>but the point is that's the people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd be at war with fucking bananas.</v>

1384
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:05.320
<v Speaker 4>That's what these people went to war </v>
<v Speaker 4>with other states.</v>

1385
00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:07.420
<v Speaker 4>Let's don't call it a state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't call it a country.</v>

1386
00:59:07.421 --> 00:59:10.120
<v Speaker 4>It's just people on that side went to </v>
<v Speaker 4>war with people on that side.</v>

1387
00:59:10.121 --> 00:59:11.940
<v Speaker 4>There was as close as Nevada.</v>

1388
00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:18.280
<v Speaker 4>Nevada is only four hours away driving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's close as Colorado at least.</v>

1389
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:22.200
<v Speaker 4>Aren't you going to war with Colorado?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We might win</v>

1390
00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:22.750
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>began to stumble.</v>

1508
01:03:56.730 --> 01:04:01.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1633
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:52.540

<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these places around here,</v>

1661
01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:05.890

1666
01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:19.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again it goes right up the thing to </v>

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:19.380
<v Speaker 3>pay and gets lit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some dictated.</v>

1668
01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:24.090
<v Speaker 3>Throws a cigarette out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a fire start on the back wall of </v>

1669
01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:27.421
<v Speaker 3>pink.like</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the parking lot from my bathroom </v>

1670
01:10:27.421 --> 01:10:30.301
<v Speaker 3>window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see it just a little bit and it </v>

1671
01:10:30.301 --> 01:10:30.301
<v Speaker 3>climbed up that wall within like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

1672
01:10:30.301 --> 01:10:33.760
<v Speaker 3>It was all fucking gone and over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Jesus Christ</v>

1673
01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.180
<v Speaker 1>haven't placed wouldn't be really.</v>

1674
01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if we get to a point that never </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened anymore.</v>

1675
01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:54.220
<v Speaker 3>People just stop robbing people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>beating people up and shed.</v>

1676
01:10:55.210 --> 01:11:00.140
<v Speaker 3>Unless it's a prearranged fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine how much better the world of God</v>

1677
01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.210
<v Speaker 3>if just people stopped robbing each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

1678
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:06.370
<v Speaker 3>Just like just fucking happier stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have my stuff.</v>

1679
01:11:06.970 --> 01:11:09.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be pretty good at.</v>

1680
01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.810
<v Speaker 3>That never was an issue if trump was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1681
01:11:10.811 --> 01:11:15.811
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the rest of the stuff that you guys </v>

1682
01:11:15.811 --> 01:11:15.811
<v Speaker 3>take before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's way worse than think,</v>

1683
01:11:15.811 --> 01:11:18.380
<v Speaker 3>but I think I know more Roberts at all </v>
<v Speaker 3>if like people as cannibalism.</v>

1684
01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1685
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:25.170
<v Speaker 3>You think there is that in America?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In America?</v>

1686
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:28.050
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere in the world for sure.</v>

1687
01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.350
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be neighborhoods where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're pretty safe.</v>

1688
01:11:31.351 --> 01:11:33.760
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was an island in Indonesia.</v>

1689
01:11:33.761 --> 01:11:37.030
<v Speaker 3>I were as of 1999.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were headhunting woo.</v>

1690
01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:42.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would stop for awhile and then like </v>

1691
01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:42.670
<v Speaker 3>another country would come in there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1692
01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:47.361
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys go back to head hunting and </v>

1693
01:11:47.361 --> 01:11:48.621
<v Speaker 3>they were just would for like 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's something really dark about a </v>

1694
01:11:48.621 --> 01:11:48.621
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chase snapped your head.</v>

1695
01:11:48.621 --> 01:11:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>

1696
01:11:49.021 --> 01:11:51.180
<v Speaker 3>if you drink the blood fucking what are </v>
<v Speaker 3>their names?</v>

1697
01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:53.970
<v Speaker 3>I forget now of your enemy that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting you.</v>

1698
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.950
<v Speaker 3>It's just super powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy.</v>

1699
01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.040
<v Speaker 3>But only if they're fighting you </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheeses.</v>

1700
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:07.400
<v Speaker 3>Good workout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1701
01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:08.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1702
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.870
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1703
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:12.710
<v Speaker 3>We don't breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1704
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:15.690
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to see what people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking shows about the whole time?</v>

1705
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:19.440
<v Speaker 3>That's a beautiful thing about what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Diaz brothers can do.</v>

1706
01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:21.440
<v Speaker 3>Talk and fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1707
01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:23.610
<v Speaker 3>I hate when they shut them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get so mad at that.</v>

1708
01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:25.530
<v Speaker 3>Like this has nothing to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules.</v>

1709
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:26.730
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let them talk.</v>

1710
01:12:26.731 --> 01:12:28.890
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to do with the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is a fucking Dick shot?</v>

1711
01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:29.700
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1712
01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:32.040
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he's running and talking,</v>

1713
01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:32.430
<v Speaker 3>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1714
01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:37.431
<v Speaker 3>shut your fucking mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wonder if that's written </v>

1715
01:12:37.431 --> 01:12:37.431
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they should say anything.</v>

1716
01:12:37.431 --> 01:12:37.431
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because then it's like,</v>

1717
01:12:37.431 --> 01:12:42.411
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get picked to be involved in the </v>

1718
01:12:42.411 --> 01:12:42.411
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

1719
01:12:42.411 --> 01:12:43.470
<v Speaker 3>Especially when a lot of fighters enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

1720
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Dennis Johnson or Michael Johnson Rather</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dennis Johnson.</v>

1721
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:53.520
<v Speaker 3>Michael Johnson could only talk trash </v>
<v Speaker 3>with their hands.</v>

1722
01:12:53.521 --> 01:12:54.960
<v Speaker 3>That's the new rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

1723
01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:59.670
<v Speaker 3>So I don't think you should do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think if you want to do it,</v>

1724
01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:00.870
<v Speaker 3>it's your right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1725
01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:04.270

<v Speaker 3>The worst.</v>

1728
01:13:06.301 --> 01:13:09.660

<v Speaker 3>This is a good question.</v>

1729
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:12.450
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them do that and they wait for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this applause that never comes.</v>

1730
01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:13.870
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>randy.</v>

1736
01:13:26.791 --> 01:13:27.480

<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't be.</v>

1737
01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.370
<v Speaker 3>But do you think that a lot of guys are </v>

01:13:35.821 --> 01:13:37.300
<v Speaker 3>don't know how to do it right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1742
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Well I could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Poker players did that a lot where they </v>

1743
01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:42.500
<v Speaker 3>started like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1744
01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:42.500
<v Speaker 3>if you're flamboyant will get on more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get more sponsorships.</v>

1745
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:45.030
<v Speaker 3>But you've seen people faking it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

1746
01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:50.780
<v Speaker 3>And also part of what's exciting about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy like conor is that there's only one </v>

1747
01:13:51.421 --> 01:13:55.720
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of other people that are</v>

1748
01:13:55.721 --> 01:14:00.150
<v Speaker 3>allowed mouth and funny and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it back and forth with each other.</v>

1749
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:05.870
<v Speaker 3>He's not the Unicorn that's just kicking</v>
<v Speaker 3>my ass.</v>

1750
01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forty five pounds and it adds up after </v>

1751
01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:12.620
<v Speaker 3>awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1752
01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does</v>

1753
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:18.870
<v Speaker 2>he know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like it'd be too much white </v>

1754
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.970
<v Speaker 2>noise because there was 10 conners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1755
01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be annoying.</v>

1756
01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:20.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1757
01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:21.610
<v Speaker 2>leave him alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1758
01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.520
<v Speaker 2>If somebody really want to diminish </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1759
01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:26.800
<v Speaker 2>so just make a bunch of other dudes </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk.</v>

1760
01:14:26.801 --> 01:14:31.801
<v Speaker 2>Exactly like nullify them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the number one Irish fighter.</v>

1761
01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of Ireland's on my side have a </v>

1762
01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:40.000
<v Speaker 2>massive troll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fixed fights.</v>

1763
01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Got With Gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that video of him faking </v>

1764
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:45.040
<v Speaker 2>getting punched for the mayweather fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>with conor?</v>

1765
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.000
<v Speaker 2>Did they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks terrible.</v>

1766
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.050
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just like.</v>

1767
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:49.540
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as bad as I'm doing it,</v>

1768
01:14:49.541 --> 01:14:52.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's one step above what were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't know boxing.</v>

1769
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Look at his fights that you had a hidden</v>
<v Speaker 2>camera.</v>

1770
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have him fucking connor,</v>

1771
01:14:56.190 --> 01:15:01.190
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that video of him sparring with </v>

1772
01:15:01.190 --> 01:15:01.190
<v Speaker 2>that professional boxer.</v>

1773
01:15:01.190 --> 01:15:01.750
<v Speaker 2>It's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows how to punch.</v>

1774
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:03.280
<v Speaker 2>He was blocking it like with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

1775
01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>

1776
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:07.840
<v Speaker 2>He was just moving around with the guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>are really good boxer.</v>

1777
01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.080
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to find his range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to be unorthodox and think I</v>

1778
01:15:11.081 --> 01:15:13.210
<v Speaker 2>was a very skillful boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot his name.</v>

1779
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you could remember his name for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the outro.</v>

1780
01:15:15.671 --> 01:15:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Find that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whose name is your bucket list of tears.</v>

1781
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:19.710
<v Speaker 2>No tears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's it mind?</v>

1782
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:20.770
<v Speaker 2>You're going to put it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1783
01:15:20.771 --> 01:15:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I want to put it up to the special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Confuse the shit out of me.</v>

1784

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1785
01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1786
01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:28.060
<v Speaker 2>We got it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it together.</v>

1787
01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:29.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm so high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot the timing.</v>

1788
01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.630
<v Speaker 2>What was I saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

1789
01:15:31.631 --> 01:15:36.631
<v Speaker 2>Look up that fighter's name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was a skilled fighter that regard </v>

1790
01:15:36.631 --> 01:15:36.631
<v Speaker 2>with condom was boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very good.</v>

1791
01:15:36.631 --> 01:15:37.120
<v Speaker 2>He's very good.</v>

1792
01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:40.180
<v Speaker 2>Like you could see beautiful crisp </v>
<v Speaker 2>motions.</v>

1793
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:45.220
<v Speaker 2>He's a solid professional boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a really high level and uh,</v>

1794
01:15:45.221 --> 01:15:45.780
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1795
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:50.790
<v Speaker 2>definitely got the better of conor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that like conner </v>

1796
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:53.740
<v Speaker 2>wasn't working on specific things or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't working that much on boxing.</v>

1797
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:54.870
<v Speaker 2>When did this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1798
01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.200
<v Speaker 2>what was he really trying to concentrate</v>
<v Speaker 2>on?</v>

1799
01:15:56.230 --> 01:15:56.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1800
01:15:56.681 --> 01:15:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're just trying to work on </v>
<v Speaker 2>ranch where you're like,</v>

1801
01:15:58.410 --> 01:16:03.410
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just get close to you and say he </v>

1802
01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:03.410
<v Speaker 2>could be trying to work on a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1803
01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:03.410
<v Speaker 2>He could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks stupid bad though.</v>

1804
01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:04.420
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

1805
01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:07.750
<v Speaker 2>He could be trying to take as minimal </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of damage as possible.</v>

1806
01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Not commit himself very much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but see what it's like to move around </v>

1807
01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.320
<v Speaker 2>and spar with a guy who's a worldclass </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxer.</v>

1808
01:16:14.530 --> 01:16:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Like they had hidden camera footage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you like on your back and you're like,</v>

1809
01:16:17.111 --> 01:16:18.640
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was working off my back for that whole</v>

1810
01:16:18.641 --> 01:16:19.150
<v Speaker 2>two months.</v>

1811
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most Jujitsu guys I think are super </v>

1812
01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:24.300
<v Speaker 2>aware of that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of guys,</v>

1813
01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.390
<v Speaker 2>but it would be the similar to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he's like,</v>

1814
01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.260
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you think is bad.</v>

1815
01:16:26.261 --> 01:16:28.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not bad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get in that position.</v>

1816
01:16:28.210 --> 01:16:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can get a picture of John </v>

1817
01:16:33.210 --> 01:16:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Jacques getting stuck inside control </v>
<v Speaker 2>every day with one of his blue belts.</v>

1818
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:36.610
<v Speaker 2>He lets you do it so that he gets you in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a position and was like,</v>

1819
01:16:36.611 --> 01:16:38.110
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to sweep you now.</v>

1820
01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:44.790
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know you're on your back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like you can take pictures of it </v>

1821
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.790
<v Speaker 2>right there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1822
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:45.990
<v Speaker 2>that guy was getting the better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Jack.</v>

1823
01:16:45.991 --> 01:16:47.380
<v Speaker 2>He had been inside control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd be like,</v>

1824
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:51.250
<v Speaker 2>John Jack instead of four second clip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just played that.</v>

1825
01:16:51.251 --> 01:16:56.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really know what you're </v>

1826
01:16:56.251 --> 01:16:56.251
<v Speaker 2>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1827
01:16:56.251 --> 01:16:56.251
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at a guy who's a super </v>
<v Speaker 2>high level box or that guy looks,</v>

1828
01:16:56.251 --> 01:16:56.530
<v Speaker 2>he looks sweet.</v>

1829
01:16:56.770 --> 01:16:59.350
<v Speaker 2>I like what he's doing and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely getting the better.</v>

1830
01:16:59.370 --> 01:17:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Connor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't look good on connor's part,</v>

1831
01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:02.890
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what connor was working on.</v>

1832
01:17:02.891 --> 01:17:05.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he was maybe be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

1834
01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:08.830
<v Speaker 2>What do you know whether he's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>injuries,</v>

1835
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:12.230
<v Speaker 2>why is he just boxing is going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>an MMA fight.</v>

1836

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1839
01:17:17.150 --> 01:17:18.230

<v Speaker 2>a good point.</v>

1840
01:17:18.231 --> 01:17:21.200
<v Speaker 2>It could have been fucking years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is he preparing for know?</v>

1841
01:17:21.230 --> 01:17:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Was he preparing to throw kicks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was he working on his range in the </v>

1842
01:17:26.230 --> 01:17:26.540
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That merriweather,</v>

<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say no way more than I don't know </v>

1844
01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:31.810
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I said no way.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Whether.</v>

1846

1847
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:40.811
<v Speaker 2>fight probably tend to maybe even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would be crazy to bet on a guy with </v>

1848
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:44.870
<v Speaker 2>zero professionals that are done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost rude to boxing to say he has</v>

1849
01:17:44.871 --> 01:17:49.610
<v Speaker 2>a chance almost man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's taken on literally the greatest</v>

1850
01:17:49.611 --> 01:17:51.700
<v Speaker 2>defensive boxer ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That wasn't a bad kid.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1878
01:18:56.191 --> 01:19:01.191
<v Speaker 2>At least troubled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were there any kids though that we're </v>

1879
01:19:01.191 --> 01:19:01.340
<v Speaker 2>not troubled?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1880
01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:06.380
<v Speaker 2>did your kids get in trouble?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they don't like once a year they </v>

1881
01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:08.010
<v Speaker 2>don't get in trouble and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their kids,</v>

1882
01:19:08.011 --> 01:19:10.110
<v Speaker 2>they do stupid things so they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

1883
01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:15.290
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't even say stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say they do careless things </v>

1884
01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:17.390
<v Speaker 2>sometimes because they don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1885
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
<v Speaker 2>real troubles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their little hole.</v>

1886
01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean your big one to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1887
01:19:23.370 --> 01:19:26.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know many comics who weren't in </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble a lot.</v>

1888
01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:31.520
<v Speaker 2>I feel like people are learning every </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation how to be nicer to their </v>

1889
01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:36.471
<v Speaker 2>family members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every generation they're getting better </v>

1890
01:19:36.471 --> 01:19:39.531
<v Speaker 2>at it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a buddy when I grew up with in </v>

1891
01:19:39.531 --> 01:19:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Boston and his dad was super strict and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad would fucking hit him and scream at </v>

1892
01:19:44.281 --> 01:19:47.920
<v Speaker 2>him and shit and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dad was crazy and you know,</v>

1893
01:19:47.970 --> 01:19:51.810
<v Speaker 2>he had had enough of it by the time we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were in highschool and it's,</v>

1894
01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to see shit like that enough </v>

1895
01:19:58.050 --> 01:19:58.050
<v Speaker 2>of is like malvern off if you had </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

1896
01:19:58.050 --> 01:19:59.280
<v Speaker 2>His Dad hitting him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1897
01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we hit them back or you just get the </v>

1898
01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:05.460
<v Speaker 2>fuck off my back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he gets close to that.</v>

1899
01:20:05.461 --> 01:20:08.490
<v Speaker 2>But I think what my point is I in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad's generation</v>

1900
01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:11.100
<v Speaker 3>and that's what everybody did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They beat the shit out of their kids and</v>

1901
01:20:11.101 --> 01:20:14.290
<v Speaker 3>then his generation before that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they beat the shit out of their kids and</v>

1902
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:19.400
<v Speaker 3>I think like people today are figuring </v>
<v Speaker 3>out how to be nicer to each other.</v>

1903
01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.040
<v Speaker 3>Like every day we're getting better at </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1904
01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:25.590
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really believe that man.</v>

1905
01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.430
<v Speaker 3>I really believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1906
01:20:27.431 --> 01:20:28.980
<v Speaker 3>I really believe that people are getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

1907
01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:30.420
<v Speaker 3>Have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1908
01:20:30.421 --> 01:20:33.240
<v Speaker 3>how are you just being nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if some of this like,</v>

1909
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:39.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the division that's happening now </v>

1910
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.690
<v Speaker 3>between liberal and conservative and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like left and right and stuff where it's</v>

1911
01:20:39.691 --> 01:20:41.940
<v Speaker 3>make people sort of appreciate sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>with me,</v>

1912
01:20:41.941 --> 01:20:42.870
<v Speaker 3>it helps where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1913
01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:45.060
<v Speaker 3>we'll give him a lot of freedoms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's still got som,</v>

1914
01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:49.110
<v Speaker 3>like walking into a fucking forest like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that nature.</v>

1915
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:51.060
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1916
01:20:51.061 --> 01:20:52.860
<v Speaker 3>So with that you get the thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like look,</v>

1917
01:20:52.861 --> 01:20:54.510
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let's be kind to each other,</v>

1918
01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:56.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or No?</v>

1919
01:20:57.270 --> 01:21:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that people.</v>

1920
01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:06.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a been dwell on this more</v>
<v Speaker 3>than any other thought in the last few </v>

1921
01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:08.120
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that people are all red lined.</v>

1922
01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.250
<v Speaker 3>What does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all taxed out like as far as the</v>

1923
01:21:11.251 --> 01:21:15.630
<v Speaker 3>amount of stress they go through without</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical exercise.</v>

1924
01:21:16.170 --> 01:21:21.170
<v Speaker 3>The amount of angst and anxiety they go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through without resolution will be </v>

1925
01:21:21.170 --> 01:21:22.920
<v Speaker 3>aware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Work life just seems to stay in the same</v>

1926
01:21:22.921 --> 01:21:27.921
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many people that find </v>

1927
01:21:27.921 --> 01:21:27.921
<v Speaker 3>themselves in these traps.</v>

1928
01:21:28.890 --> 01:21:33.890
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking about it more and </v>
<v Speaker 3>more over the last few years and what </v>

1929
01:21:35.101 --> 01:21:37.250
<v Speaker 3>happens to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1930
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:40.970
<v Speaker 3>it's just nothing comes good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1931
01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:44.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what does that do with niceness?</v>

1932
01:21:45.170 --> 01:21:50.170
<v Speaker 3>I think that just trying to look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to look at what's the.</v>

1933
01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.950
<v Speaker 3>What are the good interactions that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever have with people?</v>

1934
01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:56.730
<v Speaker 3>How much of them are initiated by you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much of her initiated by a situation</v>

1935
01:21:56.731 --> 01:21:59.160
<v Speaker 3>that maybe could have gone sideways if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were a defensive.</v>

1936
01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:01.850
<v Speaker 3>We were just high and low labs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1937
01:22:01.851 --> 01:22:03.940
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've all felt good.</v>

1938
01:22:03.941 --> 01:22:08.941
<v Speaker 3>There's so much standoffishness here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you look at people and they look </v>

1939
01:22:08.941 --> 01:22:09.270
<v Speaker 3>down like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like almost like try to intimidate you.</v>

1940
01:22:09.271 --> 01:22:10.740
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for what?</v>

1941
01:22:11.210 --> 01:22:16.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was like I just saw a </v>

1942
01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:16.210
<v Speaker 3>friendliness before and then it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still,</v>

1943
01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:18.690
<v Speaker 3>there's a difference here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's like this meanness if there.</v>

1944
01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:24.050
<v Speaker 3>Well there's some for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also an overpopulation </v>

1945
01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:24.050
<v Speaker 3>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1946
01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:27.000
<v Speaker 3>they did some kind of crazy study on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>radiolab podcast.</v>

1947
01:22:27.001 --> 01:22:32.001
<v Speaker 3>Again for it you'll have plugged boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talked about how there's this direct </v>

1948
01:22:32.001 --> 01:22:35.670
<v Speaker 3>correlation between how fast people were</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking,</v>

1949
01:22:35.671 --> 01:22:40.671
<v Speaker 3>like how many steps they take like per </v>
<v Speaker 3>minute on average versus the population </v>

1950
01:22:41.281 --> 01:22:45.630
<v Speaker 3>in that city and how many syllables they</v>
<v Speaker 3>say in a certain amount of time,</v>

1951
01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:49.510
<v Speaker 3>how quickly they talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are really like.</v>

1952
01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:54.710
<v Speaker 3>Because you have no time to actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>formulate words because I wasn't going </v>

1953
01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:56.910
<v Speaker 3>to rupture because so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you talk faster probably Dave Smith.</v>

1954
01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:59.750
<v Speaker 3>It get in quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

1955
01:22:59.790 --> 01:23:02.100
<v Speaker 3>you can't just lay back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1956
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:03.900
<v Speaker 3>So you have to like rush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1957
01:23:04.210 --> 01:23:06.150
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a big family.</v>

1958
01:23:06.151 --> 01:23:08.650
<v Speaker 3>You've got to rush to get that chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1959
01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:09.790
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating,</v>

1960
01:23:09.791 --> 01:23:10.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1961
01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:15.550
<v Speaker 3>So they sounded like small towns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slower walking,</v>

1962
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.870
<v Speaker 3>slower talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could tell by setting up cameras</v>

1963
01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:22.840
<v Speaker 3>in two locations on a busy street how </v>
<v Speaker 3>fast people walked.</v>

1964
01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:24.940
<v Speaker 3>You could tell the exact population of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the city.</v>

1965
01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1966
01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1967
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:30.160
<v Speaker 3>I think you can walk fast in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They really do.</v>

<v Speaker 4>on what the,</v>

2052
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:06.270
<v Speaker 4>the giant positive is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that get to </v>

2055
01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:16.331
<v Speaker 4>looking to be outraged and looking to </v>
