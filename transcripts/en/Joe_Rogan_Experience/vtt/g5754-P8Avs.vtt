00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Henry rollins was on the podcast before</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.950
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>You have very specific style of wearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the headphones with like one to the side</v>

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>and Henry rollins does the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wearing your headphones.</v>

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim Norton style.</v>

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that you guys had had some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of an altercation.</v>

8
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Well how would you this recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a couple months ago,</v>

9
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>two months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't say anything.</v>

10
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Someone else told me online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

11
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.010
<v Speaker 1>I thought it had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still mad about it.</v>

12
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

13
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>It was minor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was it a minor cold fucking online</v>

14
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They blow everything out of proportion.</v>

15
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>We've talked since then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like him a lot.</v>

16
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>We've interviewed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's great.</v>

17
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>

18
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>We were talking comedy one time and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget what he was talking about with</v>

19
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Richard Pryor on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a little like,</v>

20
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:45.804
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't remember.</v>

21
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

22
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I vaguely remember it.</v>

23
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to pretend that you didn't</v>

24
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>know Richard Pryor and you're like maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest Richard Pryor fans of</v>

25
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

26
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.680
<v Speaker 1>I love him and it was a silly thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to,</v>

27
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>like for what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no valor in knowing Richard</v>

28
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Pryor on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on purpose.</v>

29
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird thing that people do</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they pretend that knowing things</v>

30
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>makes them better than you because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know things.</v>

31
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

32
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Like knowing something is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

33
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>you know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all it is.</v>

34
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.660
<v Speaker 1>And we also get caught up in where Colin</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a brilliant joke about how people,</v>

35
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>if you learn something from a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are embarrassed to go.</v>

36
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I learned that from TV or I learned it</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a movie.</v>

37
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.760
<v Speaker 1>So they try to act like they read it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's smarter because you're reading</v>

38
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.893
<v Speaker 1>hated him.</v>

39
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 1>You for that great point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you do people feel smarter if they</v>

40
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>read something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

41
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

42
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>My daughter was just telling me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>today that she,</v>

43
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she learned something from an animated</v>

44
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>movie and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she said fest,</v>

45
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>the weirdest way to learn things ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

46
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really not.</v>

47
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

48
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>it's just a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.400
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can learn things from</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

50
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.250
<v Speaker 1>It won't be any different learning from</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

51
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>And then if you hear somebody say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's just ways that we think are</v>

52
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just so much smarter if I read</v>

53
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 1>something and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just hearing it on the TV,</v>

54
00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking dope repeating what I</v>

55
00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 1>heard again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I have a friend who will get upset</v>

56
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>if people say they read a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they actually listened to the audio</v>

57
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

58
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.593
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well did you read it or did you listen</v>

60
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>to the audio book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

61
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like leave the guy alone.</v>

62
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I think listening to it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way more productive.</v>

64
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Like you can get it done while you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing stuff like driving your car at the</v>

65
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>gym or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you see my focus has gotten so</v>

66
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:26.440
<v Speaker 1>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like can you sit down and actually just.</v>

67
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.570
<v Speaker 1>I read a book and then all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

68
00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:31.630
<v Speaker 1>I doing totally addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't fucking read a book anymore that</v>

69
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My focus is not there.</v>

70
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>I read at night before I go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I like to do.</v>

71
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 1>I like to read and when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I start like having a hard time</v>

72
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 1>paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when it's time to crash.</v>

73
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>How long can you read for like a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

74
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good for a couple hours.</v>

75
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm usually good for no more than say</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

76
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>well if I sat down during the day I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could read for about three hours,</v>

77
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>but at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night I'm good for about two.</v>

78
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>You have that kind of focus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what I'm reading.</v>

79
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:59.910
<v Speaker 1>If it's really interesting you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm to do it.</v>

80
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading now.</v>

81
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about a book called American</v>

82
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Serengeti.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about,</v>

83
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>

84
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife used to be on the American</v>

85
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>planes like before in the Pleistocene</v>
<v Speaker 1>era,</v>

86
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:15.890
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

87
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the Ice Age,</v>

88
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understood none of those words except</v>

89
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>for like the American you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first part I got and the rest of it</v>

90
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:24.604
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

91
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>there's this guy that I'm having on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>potty.</v>

92
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>He was supposed to be here last month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had rescheduled to next month,</v>

93
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:33.811
<v Speaker 1>but he's a wildlife historian or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological is and I guess it would be.</v>

94
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure which one he would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his name is Dan Flores,</v>

95
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote this amazing book about</v>
<v Speaker 1>coyotes,</v>

96
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 1>but the history of the coyote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote another book about the</v>

97
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:46.591
<v Speaker 1>history of extinct wildlife in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American southwest or the American West,</v>

98
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 1>and at one point in time we had all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of crazy shit.</v>

99
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>We had cheetahs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was cheetahs,</v>

100
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 1>there was lions that were bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 1>African lions.</v>

101
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 1>There was a thing called a short face</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear,</v>

102
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking enormous bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bigger than a polar bear.</v>

103
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.210
<v Speaker 1>We had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why like,</v>

104
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen an antelope like</v>
<v Speaker 1>American antelope,</v>

105
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>like a pronghorn antelope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what those are?</v>

106
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I've seen antelope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the only system.</v>

107
00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>I said that's an antelope line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While they're this weird animal that</v>

108
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 1>lives in Colorado and Wyoming and New</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico and a lot of different places,</v>

109
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange animal because it runs</v>
<v Speaker 1>way faster than anything.</v>

110
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 1>They can kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it right there and the reason</v>

111
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.400
<v Speaker 1>being is because this animal evolved way</v>
<v Speaker 1>way back hundreds of thousands of years</v>

112
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 1>ago when there were cheated here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were really fast things that would</v>

113
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>chase it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those fucking things are lightning</v>

114
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can out run a cheetah.</v>

115
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Well they can do their best they can to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get you to work.</v>

116
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whereas like a deer has no shot like</v>

117
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 1>a white tail deer is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a child is going after white tail</v>

118
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheetahs going to get it.</v>

119
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the video and have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a fruit.</v>

120
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I go online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to watch happy animal videos like</v>

121
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>baby elephants cuddling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went on a fucking baby elephant,</v>

122
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 1>like youtube loop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just watching people cuddling with baby</v>

123
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:02.770
<v Speaker 1>elephants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're awesome.</v>

124
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I hold a pencil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

125
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 1>They're really fucking smart man.</v>

126
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 1>They're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really just really smart.</v>

127
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 1>But they can remember individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>elephants from like decades ago,</v>

128
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 1>like they can be separated from their</v>
<v Speaker 1>family and not see their family for 20</v>

129
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:18.190
<v Speaker 1>years and then they reintroduce him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see the two of them to get</v>

130
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:20.940
<v Speaker 1>together again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking heartbreaking because you</v>

131
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 1>like what makes you think about like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>elephants that are in zoos and the</v>

132
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>officers who were in the circus you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like.</v>

133
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are these things like?</v>

134
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

135
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>they're not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong.</v>

136
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some animals that are like dear</v>

137
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they have a very limited cognitive</v>

138
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>cognitive function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their brain doesn't work that good.</v>

139
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 1>It's just real simple because anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to eat me?</v>

140
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:44.410
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the grass?</v>

141
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Let me get the grass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything looking at me?</v>

142
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the grant one of two thoughts</v>

143
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 1>and then the time to fuck once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time to fuck.</v>

144
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is why they have antlers to fight</v>

145
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 1>off all the other men and fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the antlers fall off and then</v>

146
00:05:56.531 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>they're back to normal shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

147
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 2>people think we're unique getting like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Porsche's and Lamborghini.</v>

148
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just fucking nicer antlers.</v>

149
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they have weapons.</v>

150
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fight each other to death.</v>

151
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.200
<v Speaker 2>They kill each other all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>

152
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked.</v>

153
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 2>That's what those things are for those</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant antlers differ stabbing.</v>

154
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 2>They just slam into each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had buddy each other and they</v>

155
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 2>occasionally catch one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slip it and they broadside and go right</v>

156
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:19.720
<v Speaker 2>to the fucking lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of times they'll just kinda</v>

157
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.660
<v Speaker 2>back off like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

158
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:23.350
<v Speaker 2>he's got bigger antlers and he smashed</v>
<v Speaker 2>me a little bit and I'll,</v>

159
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun to watch one atom of male</v>

160
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 2>animal baclofen another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so much like human beings.</v>

161
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times it's just posturing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to show you.</v>

162
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 2>That could rip your head off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

163
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:33.910
<v Speaker 2>You'll beat it like hippos.</v>

164
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.930
<v Speaker 2>Bite each other a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then one's like,</v>

165
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it leaves.</v>

166
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 2>I was elk hunting once I saw these two l</v>
<v Speaker 2>duke it out.</v>

167
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.630
<v Speaker 2>These two huge animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were about a thousand pounds in</v>

168
00:06:43.631 --> 00:06:45.260
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slamming heads into each other,</v>

169
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.820
<v Speaker 2>which is running towards these other</v>
<v Speaker 2>bang and headbutting and smashing</v>

170
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 2>antlers together and they were so big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are like enormous elk.</v>

171
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Both of them were around somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>around a thousand pounds and just the</v>

172
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.430
<v Speaker 2>force that they generate with their</v>
<v Speaker 2>heads colliding with these antlers.</v>

173
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 2>All of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just for Pussy.</v>

174
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

175
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't think people are so</v>

176
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 2>bad to do what we do because it really</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an animal that were chimps and we're</v>

177
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:11.450
<v Speaker 2>one step beyond and we just don't do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way anymore,</v>

178
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's always us fighting to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>to mate.</v>

179
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get laid.</v>

180
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.480
<v Speaker 2>We do with gold lamborghinis.</v>

181
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Fucking beautiful watches and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

182
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Or even shows a strength is guys that do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

183
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just brutal guys were big and can fuck</v>

184
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 2>you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they get hot girls.</v>

185
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then just people at the gym just</v>

186
00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:29.920
<v Speaker 2>wearing little clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flexing.</v>

187
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>picking up weights.</v>

188
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.770
<v Speaker 2>It's humiliating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

189
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:38.771
<v Speaker 2>It's like we have a weird sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>connection to these ancient animals that</v>

190
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 2>needed to do that in order to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the women were attracted to the</v>

191
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:45.390
<v Speaker 2>strong genes to stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

192
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.250
<v Speaker 2>not nearly as important anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird in the gym too,</v>

193
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 2>because I dressed like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I obviously,</v>

194
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean I can't wear a tank top and would</v>
<v Speaker 2>look silly,</v>

195
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.610
<v Speaker 2>so I wear like sweatpants and like an</v>
<v Speaker 2>old rotten hoodie.</v>

196
00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 2>I really look like a bum in the gym can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that I can't compete,</v>

197
00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 2>so I'm almost going totally the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

198
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Like people wonder like what kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape I might be in.</v>

199
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.350
<v Speaker 2>I know I can't compete on a level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking good in a gym.</v>

200
00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm never going to get laid in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gym.</v>

201
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 2>We'll never know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never picked up a girl in the gym.</v>

202
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dated a person who trained me.</v>

203
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she knew me.</v>

204
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:17.560
<v Speaker 2>It was a personality thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was never like a.</v>

205
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.010
<v Speaker 2>It was never like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

206
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:20.710
<v Speaker 2>this guy is cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fuck him.</v>

207
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Like it's never worked that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

208
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.383
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>

209
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.161
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

210
00:08:24.161 --> 00:08:24.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

211
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I just kinda wanted it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd become friends with them and then</v>

212
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden we're fucking like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year later and like,</v>

213
00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:30.014
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how'd that happen?</v>

214
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Just sneak your way in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

215
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.590
<v Speaker 2>I just put personality my way into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

216
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.740
<v Speaker 2>and the one girl who I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

217
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.010
<v Speaker 2>she's still a really good friend of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mine.</v>

218
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 2>We dated for maybe two months and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think she's in a different place in life</v>

219
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:46.610
<v Speaker 2>and kind of wanted kids and I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Perv I,</v>

220
00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 2>I just can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know that,</v>

221
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.770
<v Speaker 2>but I was so attracted to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so few.</v>

222
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a bit about her and one of my in</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and please be offended.</v>

223
00:08:57.061 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 2>I did a bit about following a girl up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the steps and looking at her badge in</v>

224
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:03.150
<v Speaker 2>the back of her pants because it was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>

225
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell it was about her.</v>

226
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told her after we had dated and she</v>

227
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:09.850
<v Speaker 2>loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She thought it was really fun and he</v>

228
00:09:09.851 --> 00:09:10.441
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

229
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 2>that's the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was really a fun person.</v>

230
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.291
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

231
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 2>I lost it her for so long and then we</v>
<v Speaker 2>wound up dating,</v>

232
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 2>but I knew her for like a year before we</v>
<v Speaker 2>dated.</v>

233
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.510
<v Speaker 2>When you lust for someone for that long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally when you finally get there,</v>

234
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:26.690
<v Speaker 2>it's such a nerve wracking experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like trying to hold back the Jews.</v>

235
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

236
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you can't believe it's happening</v>

237
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:31.900
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like finally I like to come fast though.</v>

239
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.650
<v Speaker 2>I do because sometimes I'll lose my rod</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if I come fast I won.</v>

240
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Then I can compliment them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See because of the experience.</v>

241
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:42.870
<v Speaker 2>Like if you lose your heart on your like</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

242
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:43.940
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this state or whatever,</v>

243

<v Speaker 2>I'm fucked up.</v>

244
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.070

<v Speaker 2>you did great.</v>

245
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for me to let someone else</v>

246
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 2>make me feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's really hard to just let</v>

247
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:56.160
<v Speaker 2>someone pleasure me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>

248
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

249
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.890
<v Speaker 2>I admire people who can like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so solo with that stuff.</v>

250
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very different role.</v>

251
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.170
<v Speaker 2>What do you think that's from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just compulsion and jacking off and just</v>

252
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.060
<v Speaker 2>being just jacking off so much know</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

253
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:11.980
<v Speaker 2>let me hit care of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

254
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.873
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

255
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Don't bother with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

256
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll throw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll throw it out that way.</v>

257
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when someone's trying to help you</v>

258
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:17.221
<v Speaker 2>fix something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

259
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:18.810
<v Speaker 2>like I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda like that.</v>

260
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 2>But with her it was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just,</v>

261
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.170
<v Speaker 2>we didn't date long too long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

262
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to waste people's time and</v>

263
00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I know that I'm not in baby having mode</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe soon.</v>

264
00:10:29.131 --> 00:10:30.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't mind if I like something,</v>

265
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.930
<v Speaker 2>but I think so I kind of want a</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

266
00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:35.580
<v Speaker 2>I've been saying that for like the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>few months,</v>

267
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:39.210
<v Speaker 2>10 years I've been saying that since I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was middling</v>

268
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.910
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want somebody now like because it's</v>

269
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.840
<v Speaker 2>boring by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thought about sex,</v>

270
00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 2>getting laid.</v>

271
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Is it fairly easy if you have money or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have some kind of personality you</v>

272
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:52.230
<v Speaker 2>can get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you kind of want someone like to get</v>

273
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:56.060
<v Speaker 2>on a plane with or to watch TV with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the shit you missed.</v>

274
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Somebody whose opinion you like someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hang out with?</v>

275
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:00.643
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A friend.</v>

276
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets weird.</v>

277
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:04.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you want sexual too though.</v>

278
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.480
<v Speaker 2>My openers were typically women and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang out with them and I've never fucked</v>

279
00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:11.400
<v Speaker 2>any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never even been an option.</v>

280
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.371
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

281
00:11:12.371 --> 00:11:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Kelsey Cook was my lead and she was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend and we would watch tv like an</v>

282
00:11:15.721 --> 00:11:17.780
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an old couple but just.</v>

283
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.820
<v Speaker 2>But a nonphysical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just took an old.</v>

284
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm like an old queen with my fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>lady friend and I.</v>

285
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.160
<v Speaker 2>So I want that like a friend that I hang</v>
<v Speaker 2>out with,</v>

286
00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:28.170
<v Speaker 2>but someone who I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

287
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to date a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think because it's just,</v>

288
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

289
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

290
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.630
<v Speaker 2>I would say that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's just the odds of it</v>

291
00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:40.500
<v Speaker 2>working are so small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it could work like Tom Seger and</v>

292
00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Christina possessed schemes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

293
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.840
<v Speaker 2>It works and they're both really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually one of them is not funny.</v>

294
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like usually the woman's funding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy sucks or the opposite and then</v>

295
00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:52.980
<v Speaker 2>they sort of glom off each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when one gets resentful of the other</v>

296
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.400
<v Speaker 2>career goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

297
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.040
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the case.</v>

298
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.830
<v Speaker 2>Often that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Often there's always like one</v>

299
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.500
<v Speaker 2>breakthrough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one has something going on and the other</v>

300
00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:03.710
<v Speaker 2>one gets bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

301
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.720
<v Speaker 2>And they feel bad getting better and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the other one who presents them</v>

302
00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:09.070
<v Speaker 2>like we're supposed to be partners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>

303
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.280
<v Speaker 2>that's a hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

304
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.600
<v Speaker 2>that fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do it.</v>

305
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.050
<v Speaker 2>The only way I could do it is if it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like.</v>

306
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.030
<v Speaker 2>I guess it would have to be one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like you were talking about with</v>

307
00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:21.850
<v Speaker 2>your friend where you were friends with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them for a long time,</v>

308
00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.390
<v Speaker 2>but you're friends with her for a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you were both looking for</v>

309
00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:26.021
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

310
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:26.611
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

311
00:12:26.611 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This actually kind of works.</v>

312
00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:30.430
<v Speaker 2>We know each other really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like once.</v>

313
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.740
<v Speaker 2>See that's the one of the things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting intimate with someone.</v>

314
00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people get intimate with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

315
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.330
<v Speaker 2>You barely know them and sometimes it</v>
<v Speaker 2>works out great,</v>

316
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.140
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes you're just opening up a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking bag of worms.</v>

317
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you realize,</v>

318
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.810
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy and you want to blame me</v>

319
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:49.620
<v Speaker 2>for your entire fucked up life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I realized?</v>

320
00:12:49.621 --> 00:12:52.330
<v Speaker 2>They're crazy when they're fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting in my house with a suitcase</v>

321
00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:55.270
<v Speaker 2>because I've flown them in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I should get to know them first.</v>

322
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 2>I've put a lot of people on planes</v>
<v Speaker 2>before and luggage and I'm like,</v>

323
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.330
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck them.</v>

324
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.990
<v Speaker 2>But it's like I probably shouldn't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're not unstable first.</v>

325
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Completely crazy.</v>

326
00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:10.900
<v Speaker 2>And then you're in your house and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleeping and they're hovering over you.</v>

327
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.790
<v Speaker 2>Frightened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go thinking about putting that pillow</v>

328
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:15.090
<v Speaker 2>over your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a couple of you down.</v>

329
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.470
<v Speaker 2>I've had a couple where I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally,</v>

330
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't sleep because it was just</v>

331
00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:21.760
<v Speaker 2>like I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know the person well enough and</v>

332
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:24.190
<v Speaker 2>like I didn't want to have sex because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just takes it to another level,</v>

333
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.140
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the price you pay when you're,</v>

334
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.990
<v Speaker 2>you pervert or what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just promiscuous.</v>

335
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Just taking a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny in this,</v>

336
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped saying,</v>

337
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.510
<v Speaker 2>I still say it out of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought to myself,</v>

338
00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.340
<v Speaker 2>am I a pervert?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I always think perversely,</v>

339
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm like not kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda like victims.</v>

340
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like,</v>

341
00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 2>like drunk chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like at one point in my career I did,</v>

342
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.240
<v Speaker 2>but I remember I was on the road and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I this girl massage me and she was so</v>

343
00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:51.550
<v Speaker 2>fucking sexy and she stuck her hand in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mouth,</v>

344
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:54.520
<v Speaker 2>which I never thought I would like I'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>never had anybody just talk her hand in</v>

345
00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:55.960
<v Speaker 2>her mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was a little dominant.</v>

346
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.230
<v Speaker 2>Then the first time she massaged me I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was naked and she like pushed my dick</v>

347
00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:01.870
<v Speaker 2>out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was a disgusting item and it was</v>

348
00:14:01.871 --> 00:14:05.650
<v Speaker 2>so hot that she did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we didn't hook up.</v>

349
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:10.860
<v Speaker 2>She just moved by Dick</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I told you that was one of the</v>

350
00:14:12.191 --> 00:14:14.110
<v Speaker 2>sexiest thing and I didn't see her for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

351
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.700
<v Speaker 2>And then we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr again,</v>

352
00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:18.220
<v Speaker 2>she understood that like dominance and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinda liked her feet a little bit but</v>

353
00:14:18.221 --> 00:14:19.500
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing inappropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>

354
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:20.343
<v Speaker 2>Kinda liked her feet.</v>

355
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was barefoot and I was just trying</v>

356
00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:24.580
<v Speaker 2>to check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was subtly dominant but she</v>

357
00:14:24.581 --> 00:14:27.580
<v Speaker 2>wasn't jerking me off or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she stuck her hand in my mouth.</v>

358
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.410
<v Speaker 2>It was out of my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it started.</v>

359
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.390
<v Speaker 2>The hand in the mouth was like the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

360
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was after the Dick thing a</v>

361
00:14:33.121 --> 00:14:34.570
<v Speaker 2>while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she just read me like,</v>

362
00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:36.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people couldn't read you like a real,</v>

363
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.260
<v Speaker 2>a woman that you liked can fucking read</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

364
00:14:38.261 --> 00:14:41.500
<v Speaker 2>And they just get it and it's intuitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't have to go do this.</v>

365
00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:44.170
<v Speaker 2>They just kind of do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird.</v>

366
00:14:44.171 --> 00:14:47.080
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing to do though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never ever occurred to me.</v>

367
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.840
<v Speaker 2>You never saw it never occurred to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once she did it,</v>

368
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:50.990
<v Speaker 2>you thought it was really hot because</v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

369
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.730
<v Speaker 2>her hands were clean little massage oil.</v>

370
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 2>But I mean she was just like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always wondered,</v>

371
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I honestly don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might've been coco coconut or</v>

372
00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.580
<v Speaker 2>might've been a scentless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

373
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.580
<v Speaker 2>it was more of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

374
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.200
<v Speaker 2>like the dis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the partying.</v>

375
00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:06.940
<v Speaker 2>I think I just kind of kissed her finger</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she just stuck her hand and um,</v>

376
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.420
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wound up hanging out with her.</v>

377
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:13.421
<v Speaker 2>She came to one of my shows and she came</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a friend on the early show and then</v>

378
00:15:13.491 --> 00:15:18.260
<v Speaker 2>she came back on the late show at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end by herself and she came to my hotel</v>

379
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.430
<v Speaker 2>and she was so drunk and we were fooling</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and I didn't realize how drunk</v>

380
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:23.890
<v Speaker 2>she was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went down on her for a second.</v>

381
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's fucked up.</v>

382
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how you realize that this is</v>

383
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:29.160
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be a part of this.</v>

384
00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:30.600
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have sex with her.</v>

385
00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just too fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she wanted me to fuck her in the</v>

386
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.450
<v Speaker 2>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She put her ass up in the air so he</v>

387
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.620
<v Speaker 2>fucked me in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

388
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.220
<v Speaker 2>And when someone is that drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to go like you're too fucked</v>

389
00:15:40.221 --> 00:15:42.260
<v Speaker 2>up because you were sober 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

390
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:43.760
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't drink at all and it'll happen</v>

391
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.930
<v Speaker 2>since you were like 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

392
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I quit when I was young,</v>

393
00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:51.131
<v Speaker 2>so it's a to me and it never turned me</v>
<v Speaker 2>onto to get someone who's sloppy,</v>

394
00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:56.030
<v Speaker 2>like I don't know what you really want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do and it's just,</v>

395
00:15:56.031 --> 00:15:58.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to chance you coming out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it and feeling like I did something</v>

396
00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.020
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

397
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.220
<v Speaker 2>And plus she was loaded and she had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had actually driven to the hotel.</v>

398
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.180
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

399
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.110
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was a.</v>

400
00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:06.651
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

401
00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:08.930
<v Speaker 2>let's just hang out and thank God she</v>
<v Speaker 2>got sick.</v>

402
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I was the only time I've ever been</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy to have a girl fucking puke</v>

403
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.460
<v Speaker 2>because she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so fucked up.</v>

404
00:16:13.461 --> 00:16:13.761
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

405
00:16:13.761 --> 00:16:15.890
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's apologizing because he pooky.</v>

406
00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:16.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>

407
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.590
<v Speaker 2>And she let me call her and over she let</v>
<v Speaker 2>me get her on the sheet.</v>

408
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.600
<v Speaker 2>I had to talk about her taking her car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she let me get her an uber home and</v>

409
00:16:26.421 --> 00:16:28.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that worked out okay.</v>

410
00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:30.440
<v Speaker 2>But that should get back to her after</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

411
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the last time I was in town.</v>

412
00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:34.250
<v Speaker 2>We still talked after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

413
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.000
<v Speaker 2>but I'm so happy I didn't fuck her</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I wouldn't have felt.</v>

414
00:16:38.001 --> 00:16:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I never felt I don't feel good about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like somebody who it means too</v>

415
00:16:41.661 --> 00:16:44.290
<v Speaker 2>much to them either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like somebody who's like looking at you</v>

416
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:44.691
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

417
00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:46.280
<v Speaker 2>I care for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I don't care.</v>

418
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that the case with her?</v>

419
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.341
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

420
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:50.330
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was just too drunk.</v>

421
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.820
<v Speaker 2>But I've had that where I think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes like,</v>

422
00:16:52.821 --> 00:16:54.590
<v Speaker 2>you know how guys will lie to fuck women</v>
<v Speaker 2>will say like,</v>

423
00:16:54.591 --> 00:16:55.690
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love you when we don't.</v>

424
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:57.920
<v Speaker 2>They'll lie and they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want sex.</v>

425
00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:02.060
<v Speaker 2>But they really want love after it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I sense that someone is doing</v>

426
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:04.070
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still feel like I'm a liar.</v>

427
00:17:04.071 --> 00:17:07.670
<v Speaker 2>If I pretend I don't know what she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing so I won't do it.</v>

428
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a sensitive guy.</v>

429
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.710
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to avoid the bad feels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

430
00:17:12.711 --> 00:17:14.510
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to be a creep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not even.</v>

431
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think I'm doing anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

432
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:16.311
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

433
00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:18.380
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to fuck someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's so drunk that she's going to</v>

434
00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:19.400
<v Speaker 2>vomit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

435
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.160
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's almost like I'm not a good guy</v>

436
00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:24.440
<v Speaker 2>for not fucking her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but someone is fucked up if they do.</v>

437
00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:25.101
<v Speaker 2>It's like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

438
00:17:25.101 --> 00:17:27.290
<v Speaker 2>she's like that loaded and you stick it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in her ass.</v>

439
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Come on dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know she,</v>

440
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.880
<v Speaker 2>I think she would do it sober.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

441
00:17:31.881 --> 00:17:33.270
<v Speaker 2>then I would be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

442
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:34.310
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

443
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:35.121
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

444
00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:37.370
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find like I don't like the older I</v>

445
00:17:37.371 --> 00:17:41.000
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less I like anyone who's not right</v>

446
00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:43.650

<v Speaker 2>That's also</v>

450
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.700
<v Speaker 1>like as you get older you realize like</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of confrontation,</v>

451
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.210
<v Speaker 1>any kind of negative feeling that stuff</v>

<v Speaker 1>clings to you for however long you</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose to hang onto it and any sort of</v>

453
00:18:02.851 --> 00:18:04.860
<v Speaker 1>negative interaction that you have in</v>
<v Speaker 1>another person.</v>

454
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.290
<v Speaker 1>This is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just bad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I tell people that all the time when</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when people start flame wars with</v>

<v Speaker 1>don't get invested in this because even</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you win,</v>

460
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:22.260
<v Speaker 1>even if you make this person feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

461
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:23.850
<v Speaker 1>like you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>

462
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.830
<v Speaker 1>This is going to claim to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it before.</v>

463
00:18:25.831 --> 00:18:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I know the feeling that the insulting</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and the main thing and the</v>

464
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:34.860
<v Speaker 1>negative feelings thing and any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird confrontation that you have with</v>

465
00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:38.850
<v Speaker 1>human beings where one person walks away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from it feeling terrible,</v>

466
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.290
<v Speaker 1>like those things clean.</v>

467
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.180
<v Speaker 1>They hang onto you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

468
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.140
<v Speaker 1>and it's most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily like my job is I have</v>

469
00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:48.060
<v Speaker 1>ego like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it says something.</v>

470
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Someone said it was Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as Comedians,</v>

471
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I think just to respond because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to doing it alive room,</v>

472
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.540
<v Speaker 1>but after a while I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

473
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.370
<v Speaker 1>What is the satisfaction eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>

474
00:18:56.371 --> 00:18:58.370
<v Speaker 1>even if you win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gives a WHO gives a fuck?</v>

475
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Heres wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a guy feel worse than he was</v>

476
00:19:00.781 --> 00:19:02.760
<v Speaker 1>trying to make me feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

477
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.820
<v Speaker 1>that's not why I got into the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think ended up business to spread joy,</v>

478
00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:06.421
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

479
00:19:06.421 --> 00:19:08.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here to make people feel shitty.</v>

480
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the best part about a show is</v>

481
00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:15.270
<v Speaker 1>when you're killing and the best part</v>
<v Speaker 1>about killing is a whole room full of</v>

482
00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:16.540
<v Speaker 1>people feel great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

483
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's laughing hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it when you look out and</v>

484
00:19:20.111 --> 00:19:21.910
<v Speaker 1>someone's face and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

485
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:22.860
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're crying,</v>

486
00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:25.800
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a positive feeling and when you</v>

487
00:19:25.801 --> 00:19:28.470
<v Speaker 1>get into a neg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of a negative situation with</v>

488
00:19:28.471 --> 00:19:32.160
<v Speaker 1>someone that's just as simple as a girl</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending she just wants sex,</v>

489
00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:35.220
<v Speaker 1>but she really wants to love and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she's leaving she feels bummed out</v>

490
00:19:35.221 --> 00:19:38.550
<v Speaker 1>and then you feel bummed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you get a tax from her,</v>

491
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.880
<v Speaker 1>like was that all that it was to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

492
00:19:40.881 --> 00:19:45.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh God no fucking gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that all those negative things,</v>

493
00:19:45.961 --> 00:19:47.130
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you get older,</v>

494
00:19:47.131 --> 00:19:50.520
<v Speaker 1>you realize you've sort of data chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sort of add up all the ones that</v>

495
00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:51.540
<v Speaker 1>you've had in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go up,</v>

496
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I know what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see this common.</v>

497
00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you learned to back off.</v>

498
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Let's just be friends I don't want.</v>

499
00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.910
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times if someone comes over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I might fuck around with it a</v>

500
00:19:59.911 --> 00:20:02.010
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to put my Dick in</v>

501
00:20:02.011 --> 00:20:04.740
<v Speaker 1>someone until I've hung with it at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>once or twice.</v>

502
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.360
<v Speaker 1>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This way,</v>

503
00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:08.700
<v Speaker 1>if we fooled around a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they walk away and they don't feel good,</v>

504
00:20:08.701 --> 00:20:09.660
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we didn't fuck.</v>

505
00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to be somebody Mr.</v>

506
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

507
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been before and that feels shitty</v>

508
00:20:14.251 --> 00:20:15.660
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never feel good about it.</v>

509
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny that there's like stages</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things you could do?</v>

510
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Like you hug someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean anything.</v>

511
00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:23.010
<v Speaker 1>You could hug a coworker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could hug a friend and I'll hug you.</v>

512
00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:23.860
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

513
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.550
<v Speaker 1>But then there's like hugging and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kissing.</v>

514
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you took it to another level.</v>

515
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Now you touched lips.</v>

516
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Wuh holding hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could hold hands with a friend.</v>

517
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Say It's good to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to see.</v>

518
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.160
<v Speaker 1>You could shake hands with someone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just a business transaction.</v>

519
00:20:38.161 --> 00:20:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Hello Bob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello Mike.</v>

520
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.310
<v Speaker 1>No problem there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

521
00:20:41.311 --> 00:20:43.500
<v Speaker 1>but when you stick your dick inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

522
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things get weird.</v>

523
00:20:45.121 --> 00:20:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets a little more connected and it</v>

524
00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:50.170
<v Speaker 1>feels more connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They certainly feel more connected to</v>

525
00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:50.831
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

526
00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:53.770
<v Speaker 1>And if I do the first shitty reason I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know it and I don't feel good about it.</v>

527
00:20:53.771 --> 00:20:54.570
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

528
00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.080
<v Speaker 1>when you put your Dick in their ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

529
00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.080
<v Speaker 1>this just got crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

530
00:20:59.081 --> 00:20:59.930
<v Speaker 1>this has got great.</v>

531
00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.260
<v Speaker 1>He just took it to the wild place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

532
00:21:05.261 --> 00:21:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't fucked anyone in the ass so</v>

533
00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:12.160
<v Speaker 1>long dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of years years I've just,</v>

534
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just running out of steam,</v>

535
00:21:14.771 --> 00:21:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I guess as I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking petering out.</v>

536
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like you're being more</v>

537
00:21:20.441 --> 00:21:23.210
<v Speaker 1>considerate as you get older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting and I agree with you.</v>

538
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Your perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're a pervert,</v>

539
00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.590
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you're a bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

540
00:21:26.591 --> 00:21:29.680
<v Speaker 1>I think what you were saying was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are not a negative person.</v>

541
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.050
<v Speaker 1>You're not a creep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a mean person,</v>

542
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

543
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think pervert is a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hilarious.</v>

544
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:37.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you start talking about feet</v>

545
00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:39.670
<v Speaker 1>or all the weird shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that girl putting her hand in your</v>

546
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:40.510
<v Speaker 1>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pervert.</v>

547
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a bad part,</v>

548
00:21:41.671 --> 00:21:43.930
<v Speaker 1>like it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make me feel bad.</v>

549
00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think of you in a negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>way at all.</v>

550
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.800
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a positive thing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're honest about what turns you on</v>

551
00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.520
<v Speaker 1>what you get excited by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

552
00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:53.980
<v Speaker 1>And it helped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Google is my friend and my enemy,</v>

553
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:55.420
<v Speaker 1>like when I'm dating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

554
00:21:55.421 --> 00:21:59.170
<v Speaker 1>I really have had a many girls google me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just,</v>

555
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.440
<v Speaker 1>that's all she wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never good.</v>

556
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Like if they don't know me beforehand</v>
<v Speaker 1>finished</v>

557
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.640
<v Speaker 1>because they google stuff and they find</v>
<v Speaker 1>it or not,</v>

558
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.440
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a good.</v>

559
00:22:11.441 --> 00:22:13.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a trooper there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got a party,</v>

560
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:17.320
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you got a great girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she meets me not knowing anything and</v>

561
00:22:17.321 --> 00:22:19.170
<v Speaker 1>googles and then reads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can read and goes,</v>

562
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's even better than.</v>

563
00:22:20.411 --> 00:22:22.360
<v Speaker 1>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's phenomenal.</v>

564
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.210
<v Speaker 1>But that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rare.</v>

565
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.773
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

566
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

567
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.170
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't happen very often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it seems like though they would</v>

568
00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:31.450
<v Speaker 1>find you though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a spectrum of human</v>

569
00:22:31.451 --> 00:22:32.170
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

570
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they would find you like,</v>

571
00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:36.100
<v Speaker 1>well this is what I'm looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

572
00:22:36.101 --> 00:22:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I do get that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she,</v>

573
00:22:37.471 --> 00:22:38.390
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

574
00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very narrowed corridor of people,</v>

575
00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.870
<v Speaker 1>but the ones who do really show up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their gear package.</v>

576
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Well we say narrow corridor or a people</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

577
00:22:51.851 --> 00:22:55.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean I kind of feel like that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way with everybody really.</v>

578
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Like when it comes down to like who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's attracted to you and likes you.</v>

579
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Generally it is kind of a narrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>corridor of people,</v>

580
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.980
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time you don't find that</v>
<v Speaker 1>corridor,</v>

581
00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at least with a guy like you,</v>

582
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.110
<v Speaker 1>a girl can google you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

583
00:23:09.111 --> 00:23:11.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some regular guy,</v>

584
00:23:11.201 --> 00:23:14.170
<v Speaker 1>like what are the odds that she's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know his sexual proclivities and all</v>

585
00:23:14.171 --> 00:23:16.620
<v Speaker 1>the weird shit he's into and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

586
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.420
<v Speaker 1>how open he has been about his</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships on the radio.</v>

587
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Pretty pretty hard to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

588
00:23:22.361 --> 00:23:24.630
<v Speaker 1>so you know that thoreau quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was bringing this,</v>

589
00:23:24.631 --> 00:23:25.930
<v Speaker 1>I bring it up too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know folks,</v>

590
00:23:25.931 --> 00:23:28.570
<v Speaker 1>people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most men live lives of quiet</v>

591
00:23:28.571 --> 00:23:29.404
<v Speaker 1>desperation.</v>

592
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.930
<v Speaker 1>That's a great quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yet is.</v>

593
00:23:31.931 --> 00:23:34.780
<v Speaker 1>I listened to that quote all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read that quote all the time.</v>

594
00:23:34.781 --> 00:23:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I think of that quote all the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think it's one of those things</v>

595
00:23:37.721 --> 00:23:41.430
<v Speaker 1>that we just do and we don't address and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>

596
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you work in the public</v>
<v Speaker 1>sector or you work in business rather,</v>

<v Speaker 1>someone who they're not.</v>

602

<v Speaker 1>well that's not really good.</v>

636
00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:41.420
<v Speaker 1>If you're working in an environment with</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Manipulative.</v>

641
00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:54.440
<v Speaker 1>At least think I flipped back though</v>
<v Speaker 1>column Loreal.</v>

642
00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why he resigned.</v>

643
00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.250
<v Speaker 1>but what's this guy's articles say,</v>

646
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.840
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no fucking connection.</v>

648
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Delano?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless that's a race.</v>

649
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Unless women are a fucking race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy that someone would think</v>

650
00:26:16.671 --> 00:26:18.330
<v Speaker 1>that it's okay to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This guy's punching back though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind kinda liked that.</v>

652
00:26:20.301 --> 00:26:22.310

<v Speaker 1>apologizing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

656
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just a God damn joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

657
00:26:35.101 --> 00:26:39.860
<v Speaker 1>why is everybody so sensitive today and</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it that they're so sensitive or is it</v>

658
00:26:39.861 --> 00:26:44.550
<v Speaker 1>that they're super ready to jump down</v>
<v Speaker 1>other throats because they sensed that</v>

659
00:26:44.551 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 1>this is a very hostile environment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you tell jokes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

664
00:26:54.601 --> 00:26:55.620
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's fair,</v>

<v Speaker 1>with children.</v>

689
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.270
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's every episode.</v>

690
00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Pacing client.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

691
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:59.280
<v Speaker 1>A day without a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's quiet family to come on every</v>

692
00:27:59.281 --> 00:28:02.340
<v Speaker 1>episode of of honeymooners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So same thing.</v>

693
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.100
<v Speaker 1>That was the war to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alice was threatening,</v>

694
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:06.900
<v Speaker 1>beating her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know with his fist,</v>

695
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:14.180
<v Speaker 1>punching her into interstellar space and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so great with that though is</v>

696
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.960
<v Speaker 1>there's literally people would criticize</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

697
00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:19.830
<v Speaker 1>but she was the first feminist on tv</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she won every exchange.</v>

698
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.350
<v Speaker 1>She was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was always right.</v>

699
00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:25.760
<v Speaker 1>He was just a big dumb fat cell and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was already fucking up,</v>

700
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:30.180
<v Speaker 1>always get mad and he would always get</v>
<v Speaker 1>mad and she would all the writing and</v>

701
00:28:30.181 --> 00:28:32.490
<v Speaker 1>that the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

702
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.001
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

703
00:28:33.001 --> 00:28:36.150
<v Speaker 1>there'll be emasculating line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had some of the best lines.</v>

704
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my salary to leak out your</v>
<v Speaker 1>salary.</v>

705
00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't drip out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

706
00:28:41.191 --> 00:28:45.330
<v Speaker 1>what a fucking great line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your salary couldn't drip out a great</v>

707
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:46.650
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How humiliating.</v>

708
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.720
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One other thing about that show that was</v>

709
00:28:48.721 --> 00:28:50.440
<v Speaker 1>so great about the honeymooners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that was the last.</v>

710
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:52.410
<v Speaker 1>A lot of previous sitcoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

711
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a groundbreaking new thing at</v>

712
00:28:55.441 --> 00:28:57.010
<v Speaker 1>the time that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was on the Ca,</v>

713
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I think cavalcade it was called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something like the,</v>

714
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.840
<v Speaker 1>there's like an old y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last ones were like,</v>

715
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.420
<v Speaker 1>some of them are 15 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes.</v>

716
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:04.950
<v Speaker 1>They were part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a sketch show.</v>

717
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.620
<v Speaker 1>The honeymooners was a sketch in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>overall show.</v>

718
00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.150
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like dice when he started.</v>

719
00:29:09.151 --> 00:29:11.480
<v Speaker 1>He was just dice as a character and</v>
<v Speaker 1>clay's act.</v>

720
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.080
<v Speaker 1>That's what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

721
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:17.970
<v Speaker 1>It just became this thing which didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do well and they uh,</v>

722
00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.800
<v Speaker 1>came back years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

723
00:29:19.801 --> 00:29:21.840
<v Speaker 1>So honey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can never do that shit today</v>

724
00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.930
<v Speaker 1>where you can do all in the family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do.</v>

725
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.730
<v Speaker 1>There was a million movies that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do.</v>

726
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.160
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try watching like older movies.</v>

727
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.410
<v Speaker 1>What was it that we looked at recently</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we were lucky.</v>

728
00:29:31.411 --> 00:29:34.670
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you could do that today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a an old movie that was a</v>

729
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.410
<v Speaker 1>really fucking funny movie from like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

730
00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:39.990
<v Speaker 1>I remember which one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It won't kill a mockingbird.</v>

731
00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.510
<v Speaker 1>That guy's a bad guesser that</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

732
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.050
<v Speaker 1>You probably couldn't do that one</v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

733
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like one of those.</v>

734
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.061
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

735
00:29:46.061 --> 00:29:49.570
<v Speaker 1>it was national lampoon's vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My good Lord.</v>

736
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.840
<v Speaker 1>I watch national lampoon's vacation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like there's no fucking way</v>

737
00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:54.840
<v Speaker 1>you could do that movie today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you would get to.</v>

738
00:29:54.841 --> 00:29:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this sexist,</v>

739
00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.040
<v Speaker 1>misogynist Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everything.</v>

740
00:30:00.041 --> 00:30:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you.</v>

741
00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humor has to be.</v>

742
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.380
<v Speaker 1>It has to pass like these rigid filters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

743
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not as simple as say something</v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate,</v>

744
00:30:10.991 --> 00:30:14.440
<v Speaker 1>but that's still funny that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily mean like one of my favorite</v>

745
00:30:14.441 --> 00:30:18.280
<v Speaker 1>comics and I think a great one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest of all time is Roseanne Barr.</v>

746
00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I really put her as very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put her as one of the most important</v>

747
00:30:21.641 --> 00:30:24.340
<v Speaker 1>comics of all time because I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would Roseanne did,</v>

748
00:30:24.341 --> 00:30:29.341
<v Speaker 1>was she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had that powerful fuck you comedy as</v>

749
00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:32.890
<v Speaker 1>a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was really one of the first ever</v>

750
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.730
<v Speaker 1>because women were more sedate in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they were really good comics</v>

751
00:30:36.731 --> 00:30:40.150
<v Speaker 1>like Joan rivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was a different sort of style of</v>

752
00:30:40.151 --> 00:30:40.900
<v Speaker 1>delivery.</v>

753
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:45.460
<v Speaker 1>But Roseanne came out like a hardcore</v>
<v Speaker 1>man club comic,</v>

754
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was shitting on her husband for</v>

755
00:30:48.161 --> 00:30:53.161
<v Speaker 1>being a fucking loser or be at fat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just hard and slamming and I</v>

756
00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:57.300
<v Speaker 1>didn't take offense as a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hear those jokes and go,</v>

757
00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.640
<v Speaker 1>you can't believe she shitting unmet</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't believe she's shitting on man.</v>

758
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.630
<v Speaker 1>It was just funny to stop this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just success.</v>

759
00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.270
<v Speaker 1>And it was so this guy saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

760
00:31:07.271 --> 00:31:10.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peace and quiet like I'm sorry if you're</v>

761
00:31:10.031 --> 00:31:13.150
<v Speaker 1>not a yappy cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that joke shouldn't offend you.</v>

762
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a person who's a great</v>

763
00:31:15.071 --> 00:31:17.320
<v Speaker 1>conversationalist and you also happen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a vagina,</v>

764
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.680
<v Speaker 1>that shouldn't bother you even in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>slightest and it probably doesn't.</v>

765
00:31:20.681 --> 00:31:21.351
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

766
00:31:21.351 --> 00:31:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I know that should bother me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to be shitty about it.</v>

767
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think people care that</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

768
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I think they just liked to to attack</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

769
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking about and that's</v>

770
00:31:28.691 --> 00:31:31.660
<v Speaker 1>why fuck you to that guy who wrote that</v>
<v Speaker 1>article and especially fuck you.</v>

771
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Because he called him a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

772
00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:36.630
<v Speaker 1>He did that on purpose because he knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was going to be clickbait is going to</v>

773
00:31:36.631 --> 00:31:39.880
<v Speaker 1>get people to go to that article and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to get people more excited</v>

774
00:31:39.881 --> 00:31:42.730
<v Speaker 1>about it without even reading it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they need is the article.</v>

775
00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Most people are so fucking busy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have time to read the whole</v>

776
00:31:46.661 --> 00:31:48.820
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so quick to pull the trigger.</v>

777
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.320
<v Speaker 1>All they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All they need is the title.</v>

778
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.520
<v Speaker 1>What's the title?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

779
00:31:51.521 --> 00:31:53.170
<v Speaker 1>that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck him.</v>

780

<v Speaker 1>let's shame him.</v>

782

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever interview Jon Ronson?</v>

783
00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.940
<v Speaker 1>He's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have John.</v>

785
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting guy about shame and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

786
00:32:02.751 --> 00:32:03.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always feel it.</v>

787
00:32:03.941 --> 00:32:06.250
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of understand that if there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a weird.</v>

788
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:07.223
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good.</v>

789
00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's afraid of people fight so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't feel ashamed and have to back</v>

790
00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:14.650
<v Speaker 1>off limit the fucking amazingly powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing like you know,</v>

791
00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:18.130
<v Speaker 1>the reason guys shoot or go on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting spree at work is because</v>

792
00:32:18.131 --> 00:32:20.500
<v Speaker 1>they've been shamed because they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been fired or because their wife is</v>

793
00:32:20.501 --> 00:32:24.430
<v Speaker 1>sleep with somebody else and the Shaman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst fucking thing.</v>

794
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shame is a new thing that people are</v>

795
00:32:27.221 --> 00:32:28.650
<v Speaker 1>going after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

796
00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:33.660
<v Speaker 1>like fat shaming and slut shaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are like completely new ideas in</v>

797
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.360
<v Speaker 1>American culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

798
00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:38.740
<v Speaker 1>There was no slut shaming when we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

799
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.060
<v Speaker 1>He never even fucking heard of it as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>

800
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Now we a call a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a slut and that was it.</v>

801
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:43.671
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say like,</v>

802
00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:45.170
<v Speaker 1>well girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll be able to be slots to and they</v>

803
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:47.550
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be shamed or fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like,</v>

804
00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.250
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you fucking fat,</v>

805
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.610
<v Speaker 1>but if you're sitting next to me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking up more space than you</v>

806
00:32:52.611 --> 00:32:54.850
<v Speaker 1>should on a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have a problem with it because</v>

807
00:32:54.851 --> 00:32:56.540
<v Speaker 1>you're making a decision that's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>me up.</v>

808
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally left people that live in a</v>

809
00:32:58.731 --> 00:33:00.710
<v Speaker 1>house and have to be created out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for them.</v>

810
00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you sit on the toilet</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>

811
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:04.280
<v Speaker 1>knock yourself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't bother me.</v>

812
00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:06.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to shame those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you know,</v>

813
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:07.970
<v Speaker 1>if you're sitting next to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

814
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.280
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

815
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.153
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

816
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:13.640
<v Speaker 1>it's look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being fat is a shameful thing.</v>

817
00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.270
<v Speaker 1>It just is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It brings people shame.</v>

818
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:18.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why there's humor in it.</v>

819
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:20.720
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A fat guy takes off his shirt and he</v>

820
00:33:20.721 --> 00:33:22.700
<v Speaker 1>doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious because like,</v>

821
00:33:22.701 --> 00:33:24.770
<v Speaker 1>that guy doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's shameless.</v>

822
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

823
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:26.841
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

824
00:33:26.841 --> 00:33:29.000
<v Speaker 1>a guy with a big gut and he's rubbing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Buddha.</v>

825
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:30.770
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it's funny,</v>

826
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this guy shameless,</v>

827
00:33:32.211 --> 00:33:35.090
<v Speaker 1>he looks disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you or I would look at that and</v>

828
00:33:35.091 --> 00:33:35.571
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

829
00:33:35.571 --> 00:33:36.920
<v Speaker 1>that was me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be so sad.</v>

830
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.560
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we admire him because he doesn't</v>

831
00:33:39.561 --> 00:33:41.710
<v Speaker 1>give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the fact that he's like,</v>

832
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:45.740
<v Speaker 1>he literally either he doesn't give a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck where he solar shamed devotees loan</v>

833
00:33:45.741 --> 00:33:47.780
<v Speaker 1>to learn how to own it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I get to accommodate both.</v>

834
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Some people probably so fucked up by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

835
00:33:49.971 --> 00:33:51.530
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll wear it.</v>

836
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.650
<v Speaker 1>And other people just don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are so many weak,</v>

837
00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:59.300
<v Speaker 1>weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weak men out there that go after people</v>

838
00:33:59.301 --> 00:34:00.140
<v Speaker 1>for jokes.</v>

839
00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy who made the guy call him</v>
<v Speaker 1>moriarty's on his name that made that</v>

840
00:34:04.671 --> 00:34:06.350
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having him on the podcast.</v>

841
00:34:06.351 --> 00:34:07.820
<v Speaker 1>I reached out to him last night after</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

842
00:34:07.821 --> 00:34:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so crazy.</v>

843
00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.930
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at all his tweets and all</v>

844
00:34:11.931 --> 00:34:13.340
<v Speaker 1>the people that were piling on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

845
00:34:13.341 --> 00:34:15.890
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck are you guys talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

846
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.350
<v Speaker 1>This is so mild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so silly.</v>

847
00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peace and quiet.</v>

848
00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

849
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.880
<v Speaker 1>That's all takes all it takes for you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be disappointed with him.</v>

850
00:34:25.881 --> 00:34:26.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many people,</v>

851
00:34:26.961 --> 00:34:29.570
<v Speaker 1>people that he worked with piled on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was kind of funny?</v>

852
00:34:29.571 --> 00:34:30.404
<v Speaker 1>What was the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>

853
00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what it was.</v>

854
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.760
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never heard about it until last night</v>

855
00:34:34.761 --> 00:34:38.750
<v Speaker 1>somebody tweeted to me that thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he tweeted that at me that did you</v>

856
00:34:38.751 --> 00:34:40.820
<v Speaker 1>know that it was racist to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

857
00:34:40.821 --> 00:34:41.880
<v Speaker 1>to make a joke about women.</v>

858
00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:43.430
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

859
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.590
<v Speaker 1>And then I looked into and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

860
00:34:45.591 --> 00:34:48.290
<v Speaker 1>this is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a Dick that guy was to put that</v>

861
00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:49.840
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he thought it was racist or</v>

862
00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.410
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could he possibly.</v>

863
00:34:51.411 --> 00:34:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so simple.</v>

864
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:54.650
<v Speaker 1>It's such a simple joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

865
00:34:54.651 --> 00:34:58.070
<v Speaker 1>there's no room for error there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A day without a woman Hashtag a day</v>

866
00:34:58.071 --> 00:35:00.800
<v Speaker 1>without a woman and then a peace and</v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet.</v>

867
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.900
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see racist there.</v>

868
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:05.480
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>

869
00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Anti human monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want people to feel pain for almost</v>

870
00:35:08.811 --> 00:35:12.500
<v Speaker 1>no reason whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they will go out of their way and use</v>

871
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.060
<v Speaker 1>any tactic they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they.</v>

872
00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:19.100
<v Speaker 1>If they see that it's in their eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's legit and it's somehow or another</v>

873
00:35:19.101 --> 00:35:23.750
<v Speaker 1>warranted and it just that goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtue signaling because somebody's weak</v>

874
00:35:23.751 --> 00:35:26.600
<v Speaker 1>men out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that virtue signal they'd like to attack</v>

875
00:35:26.601 --> 00:35:30.080
<v Speaker 1>other men for anything that shows that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're better than that man.</v>

876
00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.930
<v Speaker 1>So you can get a little pat on the back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little cyber pat orange.</v>

877
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good people have been doing it lately</v>

878
00:35:36.621 --> 00:35:37.740
<v Speaker 1>politically too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

879
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how people feel Dr Pollack</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

880
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's like the obsessive tweeting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing over and over.</v>

881
00:35:42.771 --> 00:35:43.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like they just want people to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

882
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:44.521
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>

883
00:35:44.521 --> 00:35:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's it shut up.</v>

884
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:47.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

885
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well fuck.</v>

886
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:51.050
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have and I just,</v>

887
00:35:51.051 --> 00:35:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I took it out because I tripped on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>punchline.</v>

888
00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a trump bit and I was listening</v>

889
00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:56.970
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>

890
00:35:56.971 --> 00:35:59.850
<v Speaker 1>One of the final words was no way to fix</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because I'm just a dope and I</v>

891
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.370
<v Speaker 1>literally was about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbed a pussy and I said,</v>

892
00:36:02.371 --> 00:36:07.371
<v Speaker 1>drag her pussy voice over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to because I said it earlier in</v>

893
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:08.640
<v Speaker 1>the thing and I try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

894
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.593
<v Speaker 1>just take it out.</v>

895
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

896
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.650
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a swan enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

897
00:36:13.651 --> 00:36:14.700
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

898
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.290
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could do this better,</v>

899
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:21.470
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not just saying something cheesy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cheesy and fucking know over the</v>

900
00:36:21.571 --> 00:36:23.540
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when I'm doing a bit like</v>

901
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.770
<v Speaker 1>about something that's real current</v>
<v Speaker 1>events like that,</v>

902
00:36:25.771 --> 00:36:29.580
<v Speaker 1>like I am onstage literally searching</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the words as I'm saying them.</v>

903
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm hoping that a new word will</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out or a new angle come out or a</v>

904
00:36:33.511 --> 00:36:35.760
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new perception.</v>

905
00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll be able to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see an angle of it that I didn't see</v>

906
00:36:39.991 --> 00:36:41.700
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

907
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:46.470
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you got to realize also the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bits only have humor in them because</v>

908
00:36:46.471 --> 00:36:48.960
<v Speaker 1>their current.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to hit people immediately and</v>

909
00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:49.950
<v Speaker 1>they all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

910
00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:53.040
<v Speaker 1>that guy can't believe he did that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to start calling,</v>

911
00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:54.640
<v Speaker 1>remember what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

912
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:55.470
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>

913
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Unless it's fucking genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there are some.</v>

914
00:36:59.101 --> 00:37:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Remember Wednesday you could pull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull out,</v>

915
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:06.860
<v Speaker 1>but it has it all like I feel like every</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit or every idea and doesn't even</v>

916
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.510
<v Speaker 1>necessarily just with jokes but in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject that could talk about like they</v>

917
00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:15.690
<v Speaker 1>had these subjects have energy to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when a subject doesn't have the</v>

918
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:17.940
<v Speaker 1>energy to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't and you could try to</v>

919
00:37:17.941 --> 00:37:21.150
<v Speaker 1>juice it up and jazz it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember there was a guy to put</v>

920
00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:22.660
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good way to put it</v>

921
00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.910
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes I have never been able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put the words on why does all the</v>

922
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.840
<v Speaker 1>sudden something like it's no longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>topical.</v>

923
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.330
<v Speaker 1>That's a great way to phrase it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have energy around it.</v>

924
00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Like in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of on everybody's mind,</v>

925
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

926
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Like last night yesterday we're doing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and we got to the subject of</v>

927
00:37:37.981 --> 00:37:42.981
<v Speaker 1>Brexit and leaving Britain and I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel the energy in the podcast drain</v>

928
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.750
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't really give a fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the subject anymore and it's kind</v>

929
00:37:45.751 --> 00:37:49.050
<v Speaker 1>of a tired subject and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just been beaten down so many</v>

930
00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:51.930
<v Speaker 1>times and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed like there was no energy in</v>

931
00:37:51.931 --> 00:37:52.140
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

932
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.540
<v Speaker 1>It just seemed like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

933
00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:55.530
<v Speaker 1>maybe if I lived in England it would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

934
00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if I was over there experiencing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pros and cons of Brexit,</v>

935
00:37:58.441 --> 00:38:01.070
<v Speaker 1>but to me it was like ideas have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

936
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.430
<v Speaker 1>But we were talking about artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

937
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.940
<v Speaker 1>the potential of artificial intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking over the human race.</v>

938
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.880
<v Speaker 1>And that charges me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one gives me like,</v>

939
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:10.860
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this subject has energy to it.</v>

940
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:12.510
<v Speaker 1>This is a subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

941
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.190
<v Speaker 1>there's things that have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>

942
00:38:14.191 --> 00:38:15.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

943
00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.080
<v Speaker 1>something to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

944
00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:19.320
<v Speaker 1>an overall mass to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

945
00:38:19.321 --> 00:38:21.660
<v Speaker 1>the word I'm gonna use should make</v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to smack my face,</v>

946
00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.030
<v Speaker 1>but some board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things have explorer ability.</v>

947
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm a complete saying,</v>

948
00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I acknowledged good word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like the Brexit,</v>

949
00:38:29.251 --> 00:38:32.580
<v Speaker 1>you kind of explore and it's done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like artificial intelligence,</v>

950
00:38:32.581 --> 00:38:34.680
<v Speaker 1>you could always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel like you're walking into</v>

951
00:38:34.681 --> 00:38:35.890
<v Speaker 1>a room that's already been searched.</v>

952
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of times you walk into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>room and say,</v>

953
00:38:37.521 --> 00:38:39.250
<v Speaker 2>I've looked in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've opened every door.</v>

954
00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 2>There's really nothing new in here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's boring and the audience feels it.</v>

955
00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

956
00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:46.290
<v Speaker 2>But artificial intelligence is always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

957
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.430
<v Speaker 2>I like dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you like cats?</v>

958
00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:50.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like cats.</v>

959
00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only so many times that someone</v>

960
00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:53.860
<v Speaker 2>can say that until you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

961
00:38:53.861 --> 00:38:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

962
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about either one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

963
00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 2>People have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been riding the idea like immediate</v>

964
00:38:59.411 --> 00:39:02.530
<v Speaker 2>pussies since 1990,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's time to step forward.</v>

965
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.320
<v Speaker 2>I've always been immediate pussy fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

966
00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the bat lips,</v>

967
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.740
<v Speaker 2>back wings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand why people</v>

968
00:39:08.741 --> 00:39:10.570
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they wrap around your Dick.</v>

969
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is like an extra gripper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

970
00:39:12.491 --> 00:39:13.390
<v Speaker 2>I liked that a lot too.</v>

971
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just chatting him saying I didn't</v>

972
00:39:16.151 --> 00:39:17.920
<v Speaker 2>say it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no I am and you know,</v>

973
00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to this woman who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining to me how women watching porn</v>

974
00:39:22.391 --> 00:39:26.890
<v Speaker 2>gives him a fucked up self image because</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of those women have Lavia surgery.</v>

975
00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I hate those labioplasty doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate them.</v>

976
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.070
<v Speaker 2>The worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so crazy that you would remove</v>

977
00:39:33.071 --> 00:39:36.280
<v Speaker 2>pussy skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like because they don't want their pussy</v>

978
00:39:36.281 --> 00:39:37.860
<v Speaker 2>to look like ragged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want,</v>

979
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:40.290
<v Speaker 2>don't want it to be like hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no pussies.</v>

980
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Never too big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like literally you say my pussy is too</v>

981
00:39:42.521 --> 00:39:43.300
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

982
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Because sometimes when I'm putting my</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoe on</v>

983
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:51.220
<v Speaker 2>then it's maybe too big</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you trip over while you're jumping</v>

984
00:39:51.221 --> 00:39:54.900
<v Speaker 2>rope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it gets done by the leather rope,</v>

985
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:59.070
<v Speaker 2>if it dangles wasp legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Constant big.</v>

986
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:04.030
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate that too.</v>

987
00:40:04.031 --> 00:40:05.280
<v Speaker 2>It drives me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I love.</v>

988
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.600
<v Speaker 2>That's why I talk about it because hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun to joke about,</v>

989
00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:09.250
<v Speaker 2>but like winning always will email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

990
00:40:09.251 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Speaker 2>I love that you liked that because I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been so I'm like,</v>

991
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.560
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know why it would be a bad</v>

992
00:40:14.561 --> 00:40:14.980
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

993
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.130
<v Speaker 2>I've never understood why it's a bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing because some guys don't like it</v>

994
00:40:18.131 --> 00:40:19.420
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some guys like that neat little mean</v>

995
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Anthony's talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like always go like,</v>

996
00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:23.740
<v Speaker 2>I like a tight little package.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't answer the fucking meat and</v>

997
00:40:23.741 --> 00:40:25.930
<v Speaker 2>potatoes guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants him naked and a tight little</v>

998
00:40:25.931 --> 00:40:28.600
<v Speaker 2>package and that's how he really likes</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

999
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Anthony might lead them a little young</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1000
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he might like,</v>

1001
00:40:32.141 --> 00:40:33.190
<v Speaker 2>it needs for other reasons.</v>

1002
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:37.600
<v Speaker 2>He might like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fresh out of the box.</v>

1003
00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:39.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also enjoys green bananas.</v>

1004
00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.600
<v Speaker 2>He likes to pick the coconuts off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tree.</v>

1005
00:40:46.601 --> 00:40:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Really does it over with a machete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1006
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:55.240
<v Speaker 2>but it was so funny to talk to a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 2>was so opposite me in like that,</v>

1007
00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's.</v>

1008
00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:59.940
<v Speaker 2>I almost wish I was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a simpler thing on that</v>

1009
00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.260
<v Speaker 2>simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just an easier thing to find than</v>

1010
00:41:02.261 --> 00:41:07.240
<v Speaker 2>to have these weird little quirks bummed</v>
<v Speaker 2>out if a girl's pussy is nice and tight</v>

1011
00:41:07.241 --> 00:41:10.470
<v Speaker 2>and trimmed up and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because usually by that point that's</v>

1012
00:41:10.471 --> 00:41:13.060
<v Speaker 2>something that our personality I like or</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about her scent that I</v>

1013
00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:14.020
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always,</v>

1014
00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to buy an apartment,</v>

1015
00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:17.320
<v Speaker 2>you pick your back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1016
00:41:17.321 --> 00:41:18.940
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be in a good location.</v>

1017
00:41:18.941 --> 00:41:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to have a doorman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to talk about doors.</v>

1018
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.820
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get two of those three</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1019
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.240
<v Speaker 2>That's how it is when you get dating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what if you were dating a girl and</v>

1020
00:41:25.241 --> 00:41:28.880
<v Speaker 2>she looked like she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got like good bone structures,</v>

1021
00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.720
<v Speaker 2>stick almost like eastern European.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got big hands.</v>

1022
00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:32.351
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1023
00:41:32.351 --> 00:41:35.510
<v Speaker 2>this girl's got have immediate pussy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get down there and you see scars.</v>

1024
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.760
<v Speaker 2>It's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got a trimmed up.</v>

1025
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you'd see them.</v>

1026
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:41.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1027
00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:44.450
<v Speaker 2>I think they do a good job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if a woman ever.</v>

1028
00:41:44.451 --> 00:41:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had it.</v>

1029
00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at like a jeweler.</v>

1030
00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Some articles like bud from the Improv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Budd Friedman,</v>

1031
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:56.980
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking fucker.</v>

1032
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Those monocles for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what was the deal with</v>

1033
00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:00.261
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1034
00:42:00.261 --> 00:42:03.140
<v Speaker 2>They would need it at one point in</v>
<v Speaker 2>history I guess and people just think it</v>

1035
00:42:03.141 --> 00:42:05.480
<v Speaker 2>looks smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's just for reading?</v>

1036
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:07.550
<v Speaker 2>Like when people needed to read things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1037
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Like why would you want to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>something to hold it in your eye?</v>

1038
00:42:09.921 --> 00:42:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Like one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing like that?</v>

1039
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:16.160
<v Speaker 2>I really don't know the thinking of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks really uncomfortable and I</v>

1040
00:42:16.161 --> 00:42:17.900
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to know the history of the</v>

1041
00:42:17.901 --> 00:42:19.100
<v Speaker 2>monocle now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

1042
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Budd Friedman used to put that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing in his eye and go on stage every</v>

1043
00:42:23.721 --> 00:42:27.170
<v Speaker 2>time we did an evening at the Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he thought it was a good thing to</v>

1044
00:42:27.171 --> 00:42:30.140
<v Speaker 2>have a Monaco in his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably after a while it's like a</v>

1045
00:42:30.141 --> 00:42:31.930
<v Speaker 2>muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that little thing in your cheek and</v>

1046
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.080
<v Speaker 2>just go like I probably just holds it</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1047
00:42:34.081 --> 00:42:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Like naturally it's like when you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>contacts or leading glasses.</v>

1048
00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:41.990
<v Speaker 2>I had like $25 reading glasses and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't fucking.</v>

1049
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:43.160
<v Speaker 2>I got to go back to glasses.</v>

1050
00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.990
<v Speaker 2>It stinks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>40th eight.</v>

1051
00:42:44.991 --> 00:42:45.771
<v Speaker 2>My eyes are going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1052
00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:47.120
<v Speaker 2>my eyes are fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My eyes.</v>

1053
00:42:47.121 --> 00:42:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Are you near or far?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you read near like I see you crystal</v>

1054
00:42:50.181 --> 00:42:52.850
<v Speaker 2>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I Read I put these fuckers on other</v>

1055
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:53.920
<v Speaker 2>prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1056
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I got to go to a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just went and I went to look at the</v>

1057
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:01.910
<v Speaker 2>charts and found out what it was and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I got to do because I bought</v>

1058
00:43:01.911 --> 00:43:04.940
<v Speaker 2>like literally a $25 pair of downstairs</v>
<v Speaker 2>at cvs and it didn't work.</v>

1059
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:05.931
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fine,</v>

1060
00:43:05.931 --> 00:43:09.420
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they're good enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I look up and it's like my face</v>

1061
00:43:09.421 --> 00:43:10.280
<v Speaker 2>is in gauze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1062
00:43:10.281 --> 00:43:12.830
<v Speaker 2>I gotTa fucking rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pull them off.</v>

1063
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:14.990
<v Speaker 2>They're probably fuck with your eyes if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

1064
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Did not the correct way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't want to make my eyes</v>

1065
00:43:17.871 --> 00:43:22.580
<v Speaker 2>worse because I had lasik back I guess I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know 10 years ago,</v>

1066
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.220
<v Speaker 2>but that's starting to not work anymore</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

1067
00:43:25.221 --> 00:43:26.480
<v Speaker 2>you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got lasik.</v>

1068
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Was it for nearsightedness or</v>
<v Speaker 2>farsightedness?</v>

1069
00:43:28.581 --> 00:43:30.590
<v Speaker 2>I can't see far away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So near sighted.</v>

1070
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.230
<v Speaker 2>Far sighted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't see far away.</v>

1071
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:35.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that how it works on the near side</v>

1072
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:39.590
<v Speaker 2>because I couldn't see far away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now it's the reading like farther</v>

1073
00:43:39.591 --> 00:43:41.800
<v Speaker 2>and farther away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>

1074
00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:44.690
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who's an ophthalmologist</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said that it's just one of the</v>

1075
00:43:44.691 --> 00:43:46.940
<v Speaker 2>things that happens as you get older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your eyes just don't.</v>

1076
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:48.980
<v Speaker 2>They don't focus the same way as they</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to.</v>

1077
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.660
<v Speaker 2>I did Dr. Tami,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to live.</v>

1078
00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:53.510
<v Speaker 2>My ent guy did my sinus surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1079
00:43:53.511 --> 00:43:55.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human body is designed to live 40</v>

1080
00:43:55.311 --> 00:43:57.710
<v Speaker 2>something years and everything else is</v>
<v Speaker 2>just science and medicine.</v>

1081
00:43:57.711 --> 00:43:59.390
<v Speaker 2>So we break down and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

1082
00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:01.690
<v Speaker 2>That's why your eyes go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why cancer is happy.</v>

1083
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:05.210
<v Speaker 2>And he was just saying that these are</v>
<v Speaker 2>all part of just natural.</v>

1084
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:06.270
<v Speaker 2>You know you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're born,</v>

1085
00:44:06.271 --> 00:44:09.800
<v Speaker 2>you're not designed to live 80 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>

1086
00:44:09.801 --> 00:44:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I know where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the last 20 or supposed to suck.</v>

1087
00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1088
00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Or they're terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1089
00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Supposed to get to the point where when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on your death bed,</v>

1090
00:44:15.771 --> 00:44:16.730
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally,</v>

1091
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait for this to happen over</v>

1092
00:44:18.681 --> 00:44:20.090
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been thinking about that a lot</v>

1094
00:44:22.071 --> 00:44:23.660
<v Speaker 2>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I really resist the idea of it.</v>

1095
00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you enjoy life?</v>

1096
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much more now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Much more than much more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much happier?</v>

1098
00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Much happier because of when Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1099
00:44:33.061 --> 00:44:34.900
<v Speaker 2>in the last couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1100
00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:35.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1101

<v Speaker 2>Sam Roberts show together,</v>

1102
00:44:38.191 --> 00:44:40.180
<v Speaker 2>which has been a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a physic,</v>

1103
00:44:40.181 --> 00:44:43.110
<v Speaker 2>you're starting a new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so whenever you get to reset,</v>

1104
00:44:43.111 --> 00:44:43.621
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

00:44:43.621 --> 00:44:44.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing a new thing now.</v>

1106
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.040
<v Speaker 2>It feels bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like you guys are having a</v>

<v Speaker 2>have in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like with the fucking shut up,</v>

1114
00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Like things are really good and when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall into feeling bad I know it's just</v>

1115
00:45:02.791 --> 00:45:04.920
<v Speaker 2>because I'm addicted to feeling bad and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bullshit.</v>

1116
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have such a fucking great job when</v>

1117
00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:11.100
<v Speaker 2>you talk to a person who has a regular</v>
<v Speaker 2>job and they complain about their job,</v>

1118
00:45:11.101 --> 00:45:14.550
<v Speaker 2>but then you think about like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>complaints that you have would be in a</v>

1119
00:45:14.551 --> 00:45:16.000
<v Speaker 2>comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like God damn it.</v>

1120
00:45:16.001 --> 00:45:17.070
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so minimal.</v>

1121
00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.640
<v Speaker 2>I had a complaint about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>waiting for me and they just wouldn't</v>

<v Speaker 2>about it online.</v>

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:45.720
<v Speaker 2>they don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1136

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.720
<v Speaker 2>of okay,</v>

1141
00:45:57.721 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a bad problem to have in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in life.</v>

1142
00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:03.630
<v Speaker 2>It's so minor in comparison to most</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that people go through.</v>

1143
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:05.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you really stop and think about how</v>

1144
00:46:05.911 --> 00:46:08.310
<v Speaker 2>many people work jobs that they fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate.</v>

1145
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably 80 percent of the police.</v>

1146
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.380
<v Speaker 2>The people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's probably close to 80.</v>

1147
00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Well you said the office before things</v>
<v Speaker 2>went through women and googling.</v>

1148
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:18.630

<v Speaker 2>if you're an accountant,</v>

1149
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:22.330
<v Speaker 2>you can walk in as an accountant and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's gotta be 12 people,</v>

1153
00:46:29.341 --> 00:46:33.330
<v Speaker 2>like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One guy like interview human resources</v>

<v Speaker 2>You tell me if this is not something</v>

1156
00:46:39.091 --> 00:46:40.390
<v Speaker 2>that you said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1157
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Someone stuck their feet in my mouth</v>
<v Speaker 2>last night and they were clean but</v>

1158
00:46:44.641 --> 00:46:45.450
<v Speaker 2>stinky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1159
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:48.300
<v Speaker 2>that was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I jerked off under my shirt.</v>

1160
00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:51.360
<v Speaker 2>It's not what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said she put them on my face and they</v>

1161
00:46:51.361 --> 00:46:54.170
<v Speaker 2>will clean but stinky none of them now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't suck them out.</v>

1162
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:55.900
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1163
00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:59.820
<v Speaker 2>our job is we get to discuss anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so much fun to just vomit it</v>

1164
00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:02.190
<v Speaker 2>and people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like it because they relate to</v>

1165
00:47:02.191 --> 00:47:03.330
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a.</v>

1166
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:06.840
<v Speaker 2>It could be a lot worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it had a lot.</v>

<v Speaker 2>whatever reason.</v>

1179
00:47:29.141 --> 00:47:32.110
<v Speaker 2>That's just the way they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do it live.</v>

<v Speaker 2>someone now who is really helping out</v>

1202
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.240
<v Speaker 2>like I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to run it through like the</v>

<v Speaker 2>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say if you wanted to have somebody</v>

<v Speaker 2>Do you have to run it through anybody?</v>

1205
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:32.900
<v Speaker 2>We keep the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's a little nervous.</v>

1208
00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Here's the one to get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.990
<v Speaker 2>I guess he likes to check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we need to.</v>

1211
00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does,</v>

1212
00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:48.490
<v Speaker 2>like I wanted Francis and God knew I</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking love in God.</v>

1213
00:48:48.491 --> 00:48:50.830
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one of my favorite people and they</v>

1214
00:48:50.831 --> 00:48:52.990
<v Speaker 2>pitched him for our radio show in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>

1215
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.180
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk to them even though it's</v>

1216
00:48:55.181 --> 00:48:56.950
<v Speaker 2>gonna be hard because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he speaks English.</v>

1217
00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:58.111
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1218
00:48:58.111 --> 00:49:01.420
<v Speaker 2>we actually did the UFC podcast at</v>
<v Speaker 2>different day just so we could have him</v>

1219
00:49:01.421 --> 00:49:02.890
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was great.</v>

1220
00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.680
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the fun part.</v>

1221
00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:05.960
<v Speaker 2>You can get people you want to talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1222
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:07.260
<v Speaker 2>How bad is his English?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1223
00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I've only talked to him post fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews.</v>

1224
00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.960
<v Speaker 2>He did not bring an interpreter with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1225
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:13.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could we did fade or twice years ago.</v>

1226
00:49:13.511 --> 00:49:14.940
<v Speaker 2>And that was rough going through a</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>

1227
00:49:14.941 --> 00:49:15.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patrice was,</v>

1228
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.820
<v Speaker 2>and it was really a fun interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1229
00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:20.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1230
00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.430
<v Speaker 2>that's not worth it now going through an</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpreter because you also don't know</v>

1231
00:49:24.431 --> 00:49:26.170
<v Speaker 2>whether or not with they're interpreting</v>
<v Speaker 2>accurately.</v>

1232
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:29.350
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had people say that I'm like,</v>

1233
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.820
<v Speaker 2>I'll interview someone after a fight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then someone who actually speaks the</v>

1234
00:49:33.821 --> 00:49:36.070
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll say that interpreter fucked up</v>

1235
00:49:36.071 --> 00:49:36.940
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

1236
00:49:36.941 --> 00:49:37.780
<v Speaker 2>they got it all wrong.</v>

1237
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens.</v>

1238
00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess so.</v>

1239
00:49:40.991 --> 00:49:43.140
<v Speaker 2>So we didn't want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't even bring.</v>

1240
00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:45.130
<v Speaker 2>He just brought someone with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was nice.</v>

1241
00:49:45.131 --> 00:49:46.590
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was kind of fun.</v>

1242
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.340
<v Speaker 2>That guy's fucking scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's scary,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

1258
00:50:18.371 --> 00:50:20.560
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy is pushing the envelope.</v>

1259
00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:22.690
<v Speaker 2>There's something about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's because he did time</v>

1260
00:50:22.691 --> 00:50:24.270
<v Speaker 2>in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's just something about that.</v>

1261
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Just those guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1262
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:27.950
<v Speaker 2>I've seen such worst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worst part of life.</v>

1263
00:50:27.951 --> 00:50:30.270
<v Speaker 2>This is just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can only guess what the.</v>

1264
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 2>But it seems like there's a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentality when you go to jail and come</v>

1265
00:50:32.601 --> 00:50:33.990
<v Speaker 2>out with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did Derek do time for.</v>

1266
00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a three and a half year.</v>

1267
00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:39.560
<v Speaker 2>We talked to them about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if we got into why he</v>

1268
00:50:39.561 --> 00:50:41.180
<v Speaker 2>was in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might've been a parole violation for</v>

1269
00:50:41.181 --> 00:50:42.620
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just going down like a road.</v>

1270
00:50:42.621 --> 00:50:43.830
<v Speaker 2>I think three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1271
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:45.590
<v Speaker 2>I believe he did three and a half years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1272
00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.320
<v Speaker 2>it's a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an interesting guy.</v>

1273
00:50:48.321 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 2>He's getting a lot better man on a kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what he was saying in the beginning</v>

1274
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:52.760
<v Speaker 2>of his career.</v>

1275
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.060
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of a brawler and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around the time when he fought</v>

1276
00:50:56.061 --> 00:50:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Roy Nelson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I notice he's putting these combinations</v>

1277
00:50:58.671 --> 00:51:02.150
<v Speaker 2>together and he's got crazy endurance</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I saw an interview with him</v>

1278
00:51:02.151 --> 00:51:04.460
<v Speaker 2>where he's talking about the strength</v>
<v Speaker 2>and conditioning workouts he's doing</v>

1279
00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:05.500
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He realized like,</v>

1280
00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:07.760
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to have a gas tank keys.</v>

1281
00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:09.590
<v Speaker 2>He could put it on these dudes that hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and hurt him.</v>

1282
00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Then he'd run out of gas and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>realize,</v>

1283
00:51:11.541 --> 00:51:13.640
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a gas tank and now that he has</v>

1284
00:51:13.641 --> 00:51:16.220
<v Speaker 2>that gas tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing these incredible</v>

1285
00:51:16.221 --> 00:51:19.100
<v Speaker 2>performances for them because most guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>can keep you going through around if</v>

1286
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:20.690
<v Speaker 2>they know that you might run out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy,</v>

1287
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:22.700
<v Speaker 2>they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least they can keep you away for</v>

1288
00:51:22.701 --> 00:51:24.350
<v Speaker 2>enough time to fucking capitalize on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1289
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Travis Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was surprised that he lost that fight</v>

1290
00:51:27.051 --> 00:51:28.040
<v Speaker 2>because he was doing really well.</v>

1291
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Travis had him hurt.</v>

1292
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.100
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anybody hold their</v>

1293
00:51:31.101 --> 00:51:33.270
<v Speaker 2>stomach and like Derrick Lewis got</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicked in the stomach.</v>

1294
00:51:33.271 --> 00:51:34.660
<v Speaker 2>It was very funny condition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had to shit,</v>

1295
00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:37.280
<v Speaker 2>but he got kicked and he actually turned</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ran two.</v>

1296
00:51:37.281 --> 00:51:40.460
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anybody actually display</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1297
00:51:40.461 --> 00:51:41.810
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get hit there again.</v>

1298
00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.400
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1299
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:46.100
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it map brownstone and a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>of times he,</v>

1300
00:51:46.101 --> 00:51:46.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talked to.</v>

1301
00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:52.130
<v Speaker 2>There was also a</v>
<v Speaker 2>drago pete sell fought nate quarry.</v>

1302
00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:57.530
<v Speaker 2>Is that who it was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>

1303
00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:00.170
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott Smith.</v>

1304
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Scott.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1305
00:52:01.521 --> 00:52:06.521
<v Speaker 2>Scott hands of steel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smith and Drago hurt him to the body and</v>

1306
00:52:07.371 --> 00:52:10.550
<v Speaker 2>he moved in for the kill and Scott</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked him out with one punch.</v>

1307
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:12.890
<v Speaker 2>He came.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came rushing in because Scott like</v>

1308
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:15.950
<v Speaker 2>grab his body and then as drago is</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving in,</v>

1309
00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:19.280
<v Speaker 2>Scott knocked him out with one punch and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then like literally filled the ground</v>

1310
00:52:19.281 --> 00:52:20.450
<v Speaker 2>himself in agony.</v>

1311
00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Holding aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like one of those rich Franklin</v>

1312
00:52:23.091 --> 00:52:25.530
<v Speaker 2>ladelle things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally at the rounders entity.</v>

1313
00:52:25.531 --> 00:52:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Well I think he broke his arm and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have won the fight.</v>

1314
00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.230
<v Speaker 2>You got to look back on that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why didn't I just avoid that fucking?</v>

1315
00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I was doing so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1316
00:52:31.611 --> 00:52:33.830
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck just had that crazy style.</v>

1317
00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.680
<v Speaker 2>His style was always kamikaze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was killer be killed.</v>

1318
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:40.370
<v Speaker 2>Just such a banana style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fun to watch,</v>

1319
00:52:40.371 --> 00:52:42.430
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would never teach a fighter that</v>

1320
00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would never teach a guy to fight</v>

1321
00:52:44.511 --> 00:52:46.030
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would teach a guy to fight and</v>

1322
00:52:46.031 --> 00:52:47.360
<v Speaker 2>mighty mouse style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd never.</v>

1323
00:52:47.361 --> 00:52:48.260
<v Speaker 2>You'd never said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1324
00:52:48.261 --> 00:52:50.540
<v Speaker 2>fight like Chuck Odell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather watch chuck fight.</v>

1325
00:52:50.541 --> 00:52:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Even though you know you by the masses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the guy is just a perfect,</v>

1326
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:54.543
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>

1327
00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like watching somebody throw</v>

1328
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:59.570
<v Speaker 2>giant fists and fucking knocked people</v>
<v Speaker 2>out because that's what I want to be</v>

1329
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.900
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

1330
00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:03.200
<v Speaker 2>If I could be a guy in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably better off to be mighty</v>

1331
00:53:03.201 --> 00:53:05.120
<v Speaker 2>mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's probably a more responsible fellow.</v>

1332
00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably a more polite fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He probably,</v>

1333
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:09.020
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do I want to be?</v>

1334
00:53:09.021 --> 00:53:11.390
<v Speaker 2>I would rather be Lidl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the guy that walks in and he's</v>

1335
00:53:11.391 --> 00:53:14.590
<v Speaker 2>looking to fuck somebody or knock</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody out and that's just a funny on</v>

1336
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.700
<v Speaker 2>his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mohawk fucking animal.</v>

1337
00:53:17.130 --> 00:53:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Look in his eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at him and you know what he</v>

1338
00:53:20.421 --> 00:53:22.370
<v Speaker 2>does for a living?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mighty mouse might be an accountant.</v>

1339
00:53:22.371 --> 00:53:23.870
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what he does for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but chuck,</v>

<v Speaker 2>ago in Dana brought him into the Improv</v>

1346
00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:44.970
<v Speaker 2>I played with them a little bit because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we knew each other casually,</v>

1347
00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:45.930
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>

1351
00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Some people will have a bad reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't want a bad reaction.</v>

1352
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:57.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was the.</v>

<v Speaker 2>If.</v>

1372
00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Is that a friendly dog?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's dog is that?</v>

1373
00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.190
<v Speaker 2>I want to take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1374
00:54:38.191 --> 00:54:41.520
<v Speaker 2>I listened to so many guys that do</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu and I want to do it so badly.</v>

1375
00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Want to do it because my cardio is so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Matt took me down to [inaudible] and</v>

1376
00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:46.620
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walked in,</v>

1377
00:54:46.621 --> 00:54:47.850
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the atmosphere,</v>

1378
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:49.400
<v Speaker 2>but I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1379
00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm too tired and I know it sounds like</v>

1380
00:54:51.391 --> 00:54:52.710
<v Speaker 2>such a pussy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

1381
00:54:52.711 --> 00:54:55.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't have apnea and I don't sleep and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking exhausted all the time.</v>

1382
00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:58.410
<v Speaker 2>But you just start doing it and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>get better.</v>

1383
00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make my all but I will</v>

1384
00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:00.450
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1385
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:01.650
<v Speaker 1>you're on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1386
00:55:01.651 --> 00:55:04.540
<v Speaker 1>a certain level in the beginning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's level is different.</v>

1387
00:55:04.541 --> 00:55:07.480
<v Speaker 1>If you came in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were like a world class gymnast and</v>

1388
00:55:07.481 --> 00:55:08.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were really good at wrestling in</v>

1389
00:55:08.831 --> 00:55:10.300
<v Speaker 1>high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be at a higher level when you</v>

1390
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:13.570
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody starts somewhere,</v>

1391
00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:15.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just keep getting better.</v>

1392
00:55:15.041 --> 00:55:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean bordain started at 58.</v>

1393
00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:17.991
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

1394
00:55:17.991 --> 00:55:20.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny I asked him because I know he</v>

1395
00:55:20.001 --> 00:55:21.680
<v Speaker 2>started like late and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like,</v>

1396
00:55:21.681 --> 00:55:23.570
<v Speaker 2>you fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's addicted to it,</v>

1397
00:55:23.571 --> 00:55:26.150
<v Speaker 2>so it makes me kind of want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a weird guy,</v>

1398
00:55:26.151 --> 00:55:26.984
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1399
00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Never would have thought that when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>first met heroin addiction.</v>

1400
00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will the heroin addiction I think is</v>

1401
00:55:32.311 --> 00:55:35.400
<v Speaker 1>indicative of the same thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading him to Jitsu addiction.</v>

1402
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just a crazy impulsive guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not in a bad way.</v>

1403
00:55:40.021 --> 00:55:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not insulting way because that</v>

1404
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:46.320
<v Speaker 1>crazy impulsive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also doubles up as passion.</v>

1405
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way the guy loves food,</v>

1406
00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:51.600
<v Speaker 1>the way that guy loves culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the guy loves music,</v>

1407
00:55:51.601 --> 00:55:53.910
<v Speaker 1>the way the guy loves anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1408
00:55:53.911 --> 00:55:58.230
<v Speaker 1>when he and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did this episode of his show a few</v>

1409
00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:00.780
<v Speaker 1>months ago and we went pheasant hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we talked to Jitsu.</v>

1410
00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:02.640
<v Speaker 1>He fucking loves it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>

1411
00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were down in the dirt,</v>

1412
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:08.430
<v Speaker 1>like on the ground in Montana and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going over positions,</v>

1413
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:10.950
<v Speaker 1>like I was explaining certain parts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1414
00:56:10.951 --> 00:56:13.830
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of times when guys are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Darcy get stalled up here,</v>

1415
00:56:13.831 --> 00:56:17.160
<v Speaker 1>but here's another option and we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going over stuff and like he was fucking</v>

1416
00:56:17.161 --> 00:56:19.170
<v Speaker 1>soaking it in man that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1417
00:56:19.171 --> 00:56:22.770
<v Speaker 1>there's guys that are like kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Jujitsu and then there's guys that I</v>

1418
00:56:22.771 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 1>started talking to my like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1419
00:56:24.011 --> 00:56:25.240
<v Speaker 1>this guy is balls deep.</v>

1420
00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.580
<v Speaker 1>He's all in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's another reason I want to</v>

1421
00:56:27.581 --> 00:56:30.520
<v Speaker 1>take it because I a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for self defense reasons and</v>

1422
00:56:30.521 --> 00:56:33.010
<v Speaker 1>because I talk about it with I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience it.</v>

1423
00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:36.640
<v Speaker 1>And there's also so many great people I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that I could ask questions to.</v>

1424
00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like almost like when you know all</v>

1425
00:56:38.621 --> 00:56:41.020
<v Speaker 1>these people who are great at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Matt Serra,</v>

1426
00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:42.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't give that guy the respect</v>

1427
00:56:42.911 --> 00:56:45.040
<v Speaker 1>he deserves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people remember.</v>

1428
00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:49.190
<v Speaker 1>But at one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt was one of the Best Brazilian</v>

1429
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu competitors in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1430
00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:53.380
<v Speaker 1>he beat John Jacques Machado by</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision,</v>

1431
00:56:53.381 --> 00:56:55.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was by decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he beat John when John Jacques was</v>

1432
00:56:55.841 --> 00:57:00.040
<v Speaker 1>in his prime when John Jack had one Abu</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dhabi and John Jack is submitting</v>

1433
00:57:00.041 --> 00:57:03.310
<v Speaker 1>everybody submitted soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I submitted like some of the best guys</v>

1434
00:57:03.311 --> 00:57:04.660
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1435
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Matt Serra was a fucking beast man.</v>

1436
00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:09.700
<v Speaker 1>He was one of those first black belts in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

1437
00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

1438
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:15.910
<v Speaker 1>he was super respected as the Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitor before he ever got into the</v>

1439
00:57:15.911 --> 00:57:17.540
<v Speaker 1>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1440
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:18.880
<v Speaker 1>the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

1441
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:22.720
<v Speaker 1>in some ways it's kind of cursed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he has heavy hands.</v>

1442
00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:25.100
<v Speaker 1>He hits really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Matt Wind Up,</v>

1443
00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:26.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocking a lot of guys out,</v>

1444
00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:28.060
<v Speaker 1>knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GSP,</v>

1445
00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:32.040
<v Speaker 1>knocked out frank trigg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maths Jujitsu was better than like</v>

1446
00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:34.990
<v Speaker 1>99 percent of the people that have ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>competed in mma.</v>

1447
00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:39.640
<v Speaker 1>He loves it so much fun to will you talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>to him and he talks about he has to roll</v>

1448
00:57:39.641 --> 00:57:41.620
<v Speaker 1>in that like he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he loves it so much.</v>

1449
00:57:41.621 --> 00:57:43.720
<v Speaker 1>It makes you want to do it well for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

1450
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:45.340
<v Speaker 1>He's strangling people every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1451
00:57:45.341 --> 00:57:46.960
<v Speaker 1>that would be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not the nail,</v>

1452
00:57:46.961 --> 00:57:47.940
<v Speaker 1>he's the fucking hammered.</v>

1453
00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.450
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would probably be in a much different</v>

1454
00:57:49.451 --> 00:57:51.100
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably have a much different feeling</v>

1455
00:57:51.101 --> 00:57:54.190
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be definitely it would at first,</v>

1456
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's just one of those things where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>

1457
00:57:56.201 --> 00:57:58.660
<v Speaker 1>the moment you get your first tap out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be so addicted.</v>

1458
00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:00.040
<v Speaker 1>It's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1459
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.420
<v Speaker 1>But you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you immediately start.</v>

1460
00:58:01.421 --> 00:58:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1461
00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a fucking complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I tendinitis and like I</v>

1462
00:58:05.561 --> 00:58:07.510
<v Speaker 1>couldn't work out for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could only do legs and,</v>

1463
00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.000
<v Speaker 1>and cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had this terrible was wrong with</v>

1464
00:58:10.001 --> 00:58:10.401
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1465
00:58:10.401 --> 00:58:12.350
<v Speaker 1>I had tendonitis and it was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally I can't,</v>

1466
00:58:12.351 --> 00:58:14.800
<v Speaker 1>I think if I'm doing pull ups or doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kettlebells wrong.</v>

1467
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1468
00:58:16.691 --> 00:58:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>

1469
00:58:17.561 --> 00:58:20.270
<v Speaker 1>my arm was in such pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do anything with my arms for</v>

1470
00:58:20.271 --> 00:58:21.940
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was when I lost all that weight.</v>

1471
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:23.080
<v Speaker 1>I was fucked up.</v>

1472
00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to get fat again.</v>

1473
00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:26.950
<v Speaker 1>And I went on this whole 30 diet and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1474
00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:29.020
<v Speaker 1>I stuck to it for like eight months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a,</v>

1475
00:58:29.021 --> 00:58:30.610
<v Speaker 1>what's a whole $30?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good.</v>

1476
00:58:30.611 --> 00:58:32.240
<v Speaker 1>It was like you don't feel like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating unhealthy.</v>

1477
00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:36.490
<v Speaker 1>A lot of egg whites and common sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>with carbs and you get a baked potato</v>

1478
00:58:36.491 --> 00:58:37.370
<v Speaker 1>and some fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they.</v>

1479
00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.640
<v Speaker 1>They didn't say don't eat this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

1480
00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:41.110
<v Speaker 1>It was just very strict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain nuts,</v>

1481
00:58:41.111 --> 00:58:45.310
<v Speaker 1>no beans on this shit and I dropped a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ton of late and I was doing all cardio</v>

1482
00:58:45.311 --> 00:58:48.470
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just afraid of reinjuring my</v>
<v Speaker 1>alarm and not being able to work out</v>

1483
00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:51.190
<v Speaker 1>like you can't think like that if your</v>
<v Speaker 1>arm's not hurt your arms on hurt.</v>

1484
00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:52.900
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that happens when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get injured,</v>

1485
00:58:52.901 --> 00:58:54.820
<v Speaker 1>you think you start thinking of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body's like a race car.</v>

1486
00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Like you blow a tire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1487
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.050
<v Speaker 1>oh well I'll go get that tire fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1488
00:58:58.051 --> 00:59:02.110
<v Speaker 1>like I've had A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had quite a few surgeries and a</v>

1489
00:59:02.111 --> 00:59:04.080
<v Speaker 1>bunch of injuries that I didn't have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get surgery on it.</v>

1490
00:59:04.081 --> 00:59:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I just had to let them heal up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you just do.</v>

1491
00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.750
<v Speaker 1>It's so fun that you just sort of have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different way of looking at your body.</v>

1492
00:59:10.751 --> 00:59:15.751
<v Speaker 1>You start thinking of your body is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a utensil or a tool instead of just as</v>

1493
00:59:16.061 --> 00:59:18.160
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you think of it as your body as</v>

1494
00:59:18.161 --> 00:59:20.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like if I break something,</v>

1495
00:59:20.081 --> 00:59:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I heard something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1496
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I got to fix this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think of as like,</v>

1497
00:59:23.331 --> 00:59:26.570
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this again because if I get</v>

1498
00:59:26.571 --> 00:59:30.230
<v Speaker 1>more tendinitis on this elbow then my</v>
<v Speaker 1>elbow will always be in pain.</v>

1499
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:31.513
<v Speaker 1>I don't think like that.</v>

1500
00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:32.960
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I fix this thing?</v>

1501
00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Where do I got to go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's the doctor?</v>

1502
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Luckily I worked for the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll talk to Dr Davidson and I'll</v>

1503
00:59:38.631 --> 00:59:39.350
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1504
00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:40.860
<v Speaker 1>what can we do about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1505
00:59:40.861 --> 00:59:42.470
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you recommend?</v>

1506
00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:43.360
<v Speaker 1>And he'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1507
00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:46.970
<v Speaker 1>he and he's on the cutting edge and</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

1508
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:51.350
<v Speaker 1>he's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm part of this team that has started</v>

1509
00:59:51.351 --> 00:59:56.300
<v Speaker 1>injecting stem cells into disks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this radical new procedure</v>

1510
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:59.660
<v Speaker 1>where they've been using stem cells to</v>
<v Speaker 1>regenerate tissue for a long time and</v>

1511
00:59:59.661 --> 01:00:02.210
<v Speaker 1>stem cells work amazing by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on tendinitis.</v>

1512
01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Really fuck yet heals it up like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

1513
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I did cortisol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I know is not recommended.</v>

1514
01:00:07.551 --> 01:00:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I did it once and someone told me just</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it once and you're okay,</v>

1515
01:00:11.031 --> 01:00:13.070
<v Speaker 1>but don't keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it once and it actually really</v>

1516
01:00:13.071 --> 01:00:14.330
<v Speaker 1>helped and I didn't do anything.</v>

1517
01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>It actually fixed me a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1518
01:00:15.721 --> 01:00:16.371
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1519
01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>it certainly will help take away some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain,</v>

1520
01:00:18.141 --> 01:00:21.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's dangerous because it masks that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain and then a lot of times guys like</v>

1521
01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:24.740
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they injure themselves badly because</v>

1522
01:00:24.741 --> 01:00:26.450
<v Speaker 1>they don't feel that pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Bas rutten,</v>

1523
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:30.350
<v Speaker 1>bas rutten chewed his fucking needs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces because he got cortisone shots</v>

1524
01:00:30.351 --> 01:00:31.880
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were already damaged and just</v>

1525
01:00:31.881 --> 01:00:33.920
<v Speaker 1>push through it like an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1526
01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>But my point is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're able to do now is they can</v>

1527
01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>shoot these stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take fetal stem cells,</v>

1528
01:00:40.761 --> 01:00:43.190
<v Speaker 1>they get from a woman's placenta after</v>
<v Speaker 1>she gives birth,</v>

1529
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.220
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd take like a woman who gives birth</v>

1530
01:00:46.221 --> 01:00:48.740
<v Speaker 1>by Sicilian section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take out the placenta,</v>

1531
01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:52.850
<v Speaker 1>the extract stem cells from this</v>
<v Speaker 1>placenta and then inject them directly</v>

1532
01:00:52.851 --> 01:00:54.710
<v Speaker 1>and injuries you fucking heel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1533
01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.380
<v Speaker 1>it regenerates tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regenerates Meniscus,</v>

1534
01:00:57.590 --> 01:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>regenerates.</v>

1535
01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:01.640
<v Speaker 1>All these different types of tissue can</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically form anything that's injured,</v>

1536
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:03.230
<v Speaker 1>soft tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle,</v>

1537
01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:04.580
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any tendons,</v>

1538
01:01:04.790 --> 01:01:06.500
<v Speaker 1>anything that's injured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can regenerate,</v>

1539
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:10.400
<v Speaker 1>but they're now doing it on discs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy because when you have</v>

1540
01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.730
<v Speaker 1>disc degeneration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is your body through poor</v>

1541
01:01:13.731 --> 01:01:15.140
<v Speaker 1>posture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>

1542
01:01:15.141 --> 01:01:16.130
<v Speaker 1>abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma,</v>

1543
01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>whatever your disks get compressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still wind up pushing on your</v>

1544
01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:23.930
<v Speaker 1>nerves and they usually do what's called</v>
<v Speaker 1>a disectomy will they come in and they</v>

1545
01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:27.380
<v Speaker 1>cut a piece of the disc away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually it gets worse and some people</v>

1546
01:01:27.381 --> 01:01:30.240
<v Speaker 1>either have to get that disc removed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they,</v>

1547
01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:33.820
<v Speaker 1>they get it replaced with an artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>one like Eddie Bravo got it replaced</v>

1548
01:01:33.821 --> 01:01:37.190
<v Speaker 1>with an artificial one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they will actually fuse the bone</v>

1549
01:01:37.191 --> 01:01:39.040
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very problematic.</v>

1550
01:01:39.041 --> 01:01:41.780
<v Speaker 1>It puts stress on the upper and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower portion of the disc.</v>

1551
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Now what they're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it started injecting stem cells directly</v>

1552
01:01:45.651 --> 01:01:48.920
<v Speaker 1>into the disc and the disc will</v>
<v Speaker 1>regenerate and pump up.</v>

1553
01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.590
<v Speaker 1>So you'll be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in theory,</v>

1554
01:01:51.591 --> 01:01:54.650
<v Speaker 1>at least get your disks back to where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were when you were 18.</v>

1555
01:01:54.830 --> 01:01:55.663
<v Speaker 1>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1556
01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little injection of stem cells into</v>

1557
01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.380
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not hurting him now,</v>

1558
01:02:00.381 --> 01:02:01.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1559
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:02.870
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I noticed that when I do certain</v>

1560
01:02:02.871 --> 01:02:05.120
<v Speaker 1>things like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like I feel like all that</v>

1561
01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:05.990
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1562
01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:08.210
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the beginning of it and I know</v>

1563
01:02:08.211 --> 01:02:10.820
<v Speaker 1>what we're going to lift weights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

1564
01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:11.990
<v Speaker 1>but not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1565
01:02:11.991 --> 01:02:14.720
<v Speaker 1>But I mean you don't have to do a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just lift weights and you know,</v>

1566
01:02:14.721 --> 01:02:17.600
<v Speaker 1>progressively build it up and listened</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it,</v>

1567
01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you feel put some ice on</v>

1568
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.250
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bill,</v>

1569
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.580
<v Speaker 2>late weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it seems,</v>

1570
01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.090
<v Speaker 2>it seems counterintuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that a lot of</v>

1571
01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:28.960
<v Speaker 2>people have found is that even Olympic</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting,</v>

1572
01:02:28.961 --> 01:02:33.060
<v Speaker 2>like heavy power lifting cleans and</v>
<v Speaker 2>squats and dead lifts and things along</v>

1573
01:02:33.061 --> 01:02:37.350
<v Speaker 2>those lines actually helps joint pain</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it strengthens up all that</v>

1574
01:02:37.351 --> 01:02:40.200
<v Speaker 2>tissue and strengthens up all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stabilizing muscles.</v>

1575
01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Strengthens up all the ligaments and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tendons.</v>

1576
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:43.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do lyft,</v>

1577
01:02:43.441 --> 01:02:45.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't do much.</v>

1578
01:02:45.121 --> 01:02:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I get to tuckered out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can talk her down like training with</v>

1579
01:02:48.421 --> 01:02:50.250
<v Speaker 2>the fucking spit on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always like,</v>

1580
01:02:50.251 --> 01:02:51.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll walk in,</v>

1581
01:02:51.371 --> 01:02:52.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll let her know what kind of shape I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1582
01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:54.690
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm really honest about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I feel okay,</v>

1583
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:57.180
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm having my days where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling like stoned,</v>

1584
01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.440
<v Speaker 2>who just got to deal with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1585
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:59.350
<v Speaker 2>I push through.</v>

1586
01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1587
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Me and you and I should do a show where</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take you to the fucking gym every day</v>

1588
01:03:03.241 --> 01:03:06.810
<v Speaker 2>and we just get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to caffeine and I would try</v>

1589
01:03:06.811 --> 01:03:08.090
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1590
01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:12.000
<v Speaker 2>One of these caveman coffees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fuckers have 270 milligrams of</v>

1591
01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:15.150
<v Speaker 2>caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you two of these bitches and</v>

1592
01:03:15.151 --> 01:03:15.984
<v Speaker 2>then some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1593
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:20.010
<v Speaker 2>some Alpha brain and some shroom tech</v>
<v Speaker 2>sport and just going there like a</v>

1594
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn wildman and being some hot pink</v>
<v Speaker 2>satin shorts.</v>

1595
01:03:23.041 --> 01:03:25.680
<v Speaker 2>And let me look that scrunchy socks like</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a.</v>

1596
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:29.460
<v Speaker 2>What was that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a maniac.</v>

1597
01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:32.610
<v Speaker 2>All a dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dance,</v>

1598
01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:36.810
<v Speaker 2>dance fast dance class that I always</v>
<v Speaker 2>hated.</v>

1599
01:03:36.811 --> 01:03:39.990
<v Speaker 2>That part I saw that goes in and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes.</v>

1600
01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.240
<v Speaker 2>My fucking hated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That part bothers you?</v>

1601
01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.133
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hated it.</v>

1602
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:45.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why there's certain things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like certain songs with a,</v>

1603
01:03:45.961 --> 01:03:46.794
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1604
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.910
<v Speaker 2>with a clap in it.</v>

1605
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Like on the big Bette Davis Eyes Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that</v>

1606
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.130
<v Speaker 2>she's got bad days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I hate with a guy that,</v>

1607
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.591
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1608
01:03:57.591 --> 01:03:58.000
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1609
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.490
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was so eighties.</v>

1610
01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:03.600
<v Speaker 2>The fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the handclaps in songs drove me crazy.</v>

1611
01:04:03.601 --> 01:04:04.590
<v Speaker 2>I hated that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1612
01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:08.490
<v Speaker 2>It is funny how songs like you can tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're from a time,</v>

1613
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there,</v>

1614
01:04:09.781 --> 01:04:11.640
<v Speaker 2>there's a sound to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd go,</v>

1615
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's from that time.</v>

1616
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Especially like 60 to 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that weird.</v>

1617
01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the weird sound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's what Phil Spector started</v>

1618
01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:23.670
<v Speaker 2>or these other things that like when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been listening to del Shannon's</v>

1619
01:04:23.671 --> 01:04:26.500
<v Speaker 2>runaway a lot and there's just a sound</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there,</v>

1620
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:30.180
<v Speaker 2>but I don't let that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you just like everyone who that</v>

1621
01:04:30.181 --> 01:04:34.410
<v Speaker 2>song meant something to as a teenager is</v>
<v Speaker 2>old or dead were songs give me weird</v>

1622
01:04:34.411 --> 01:04:36.090
<v Speaker 2>feelings man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to the sixties and the</v>

1623
01:04:36.091 --> 01:04:40.950
<v Speaker 2>fifties and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like creepily voyeuristic and</v>

1624
01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.500
<v Speaker 2>frightened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I really get weird listening to</v>

1625
01:04:43.501 --> 01:04:46.950
<v Speaker 2>those old songs because the connection</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had,</v>

1626
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.330
<v Speaker 2>they are in history.</v>

1627
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:49.163
<v Speaker 2>It's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dead.</v>

1628
01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:50.790
<v Speaker 2>It really freaks me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1629
01:04:50.791 --> 01:04:54.240
<v Speaker 2>it's also one of the first times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you really go back to it,</v>

1630
01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:58.010
<v Speaker 2>but I get creeped out when I listened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>early 19 hundreds music too,</v>

1631
01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.470
<v Speaker 2>because that's the original music that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was recorded essentially.</v>

1632
01:05:01.471 --> 01:05:03.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the first.</v>

1633
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:06.030
<v Speaker 2>We talked about this once before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when was the first record?</v>

1634
01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:08.000
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it was the late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1635
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:11.370
<v Speaker 2>it was like the 17 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first time they came up with one of</v>

1636
01:05:11.371 --> 01:05:12.810
<v Speaker 2>those big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1637
01:05:12.811 --> 01:05:16.710
<v Speaker 2>those big tubes with like the needle on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and that that was where the sound</v>

1638
01:05:16.711 --> 01:05:21.160
<v Speaker 2>came from was that giant thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not people in fucking in Brooklyn</v>

1639
01:05:21.161 --> 01:05:23.050
<v Speaker 2>or buying them because they think it</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes them look really cool.</v>

1640
01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Williamsburg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting those things and listening to</v>

1641
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:28.660
<v Speaker 2>old vinyl on it sounds like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put final.</v>

1642
01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:32.950
<v Speaker 2>What is this then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The records first.</v>

1643
01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.033
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1644
01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cylinder.</v>

1645
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:36.520
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1646
01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just crazy that when you think</v>

1647
01:05:39.881 --> 01:05:42.460
<v Speaker 2>about human history that people recorded</v>
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>

1648
01:05:42.461 --> 01:05:46.000
<v Speaker 2>they just had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could only write things down until,</v>

1649
01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more than 150 years ago or</v>

1650
01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:50.140
<v Speaker 2>150 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it was.</v>

1651
01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:52.670
<v Speaker 2>It is weird when you look like when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're listening to you.</v>

1652
01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:53.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I follow.</v>

1653
01:05:53.351 --> 01:05:54.730
<v Speaker 2>You want to hear something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1654
01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Tom Petty and you just download it like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a walk into a club,</v>

1655
01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that people couldn't record</v>

1656
01:05:59.921 --> 01:06:01.660
<v Speaker 2>it at one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you literally had to just say none</v>

1657
01:06:01.661 --> 01:06:02.520
<v Speaker 2>of that song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1658
01:06:02.810 --> 01:06:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

1659
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:06.790
<v Speaker 2>and tell somebody how to play it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to hear it and then they had to</v>

1660
01:06:06.791 --> 01:06:09.310
<v Speaker 2>play it the way you play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it got passed down.</v>

1661
01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:12.500
<v Speaker 2>The worst is when someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tell someone like,</v>

1662
01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that song,</v>

1663
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:14.583
<v Speaker 2>and then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1664
01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:15.610
<v Speaker 2>it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1665
01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:17.440
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been diag.</v>

1666
01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Sam fairies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sammy.</v>

1667
01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Where his sanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't know what the fuck you're</v>

1668
01:06:21.431 --> 01:06:23.890
<v Speaker 2>telling me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you play the song and they go,</v>

1669
01:06:23.891 --> 01:06:24.890
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that song.</v>

1670
01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't,</v>

1671
01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.280
<v Speaker 2>you didn't sound anything like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>song.</v>

1672
01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.730
<v Speaker 2>I was trying my best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1673
01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.480
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was not completely unfamiliar</v>

1674
01:06:31.481 --> 01:06:34.960
<v Speaker 2>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are making love to change.</v>

1675
01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that one,</v>

1676
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.180
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you would.</v>

1677
01:06:40.181 --> 01:06:42.970
<v Speaker 2>If you heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably would like really weird</v>

1678
01:06:42.971 --> 01:06:44.950
<v Speaker 2>sapping music sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I get really.</v>

1679
01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:48.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm a weird emotional wreck with stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1680
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cry a weird shit.</v>

1681
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm like sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cried at Logan.</v>

1682
01:06:52.301 --> 01:06:53.760
<v Speaker 2>I like to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1683
01:06:53.761 --> 01:06:55.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to find movies.</v>

1684
01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:59.050
<v Speaker 2>It makes me feel like connected to</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like,</v>

1685
01:06:59.051 --> 01:07:00.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a jungle fever.</v>

1686
01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:04.270
<v Speaker 2>Frank Vincent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to hug him.</v>

1687
01:07:04.271 --> 01:07:06.140
<v Speaker 2>I get it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I to it.</v>

1688
01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:09.060
<v Speaker 2>That makes me feel like I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>disconnected from human interactions or</v>

1689
01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:13.110
<v Speaker 2>do you feel sometimes like you are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit but not.</v>

1690
01:07:13.111 --> 01:07:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Not to a point where I think I'm unique</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just sometimes a little bit like</v>

1691
01:07:16.661 --> 01:07:19.900
<v Speaker 2>it's always one tick off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would argue with a woman in a</v>

1692
01:07:19.901 --> 01:07:24.070
<v Speaker 2>relationship and I could say barbaric</v>
<v Speaker 2>things because I felt like I was arguing</v>

1693
01:07:24.071 --> 01:07:26.020
<v Speaker 2>through a window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was not real life.</v>

1694
01:07:26.021 --> 01:07:28.240
<v Speaker 2>It was a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was a movie performance,</v>

1695
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:32.290
<v Speaker 2>but then I watched a Sanka commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh you hugged the puppy and I'm crying</v>

1696
01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.770
<v Speaker 2>and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like one click off from where you</v>

1697
01:07:35.771 --> 01:07:37.220
<v Speaker 2>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1698
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:40.870
<v Speaker 2>I can remember Bill Burr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking of a lot because bill</v>

1699
01:07:40.871 --> 01:07:44.680
<v Speaker 2>bill told me that he doesn't call names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he won't call his wife a bitch.</v>

1700
01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.260
<v Speaker 2>He just doesn't do it because he saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>that growing up and he was as angry as</v>

1701
01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:51.130
<v Speaker 2>can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't name call and to thinking</v>

1702
01:07:51.131 --> 01:07:51.900
<v Speaker 2>about that a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1703
01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:55.460
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done that with every person I</v>
<v Speaker 2>dated and it's so fucked up cause yeah,</v>

1704
01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:56.800
<v Speaker 2>it just happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll say,</v>

1705
01:07:56.801 --> 01:07:59.050
<v Speaker 2>shut up here and I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking of like,</v>

1706
01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:01.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just kind of made me feel like a</v>

1707
01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:03.400
<v Speaker 2>shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Shitty.</v>

1708
01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:05.920
<v Speaker 2>It is shitty and it's too easy to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially,</v>

1709
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:09.280
<v Speaker 2>there's a real issue when you do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know the person's going to</v>

1710
01:08:09.281 --> 01:08:11.140
<v Speaker 2>take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1711
01:08:11.410 --> 01:08:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Like it's one thing if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1712
01:08:12.641 --> 01:08:13.940
<v Speaker 2>you're a continent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is done.</v>

1713
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.590
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucking,</v>

1714
01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 2>you left my house</v>

1715
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.240
<v Speaker 1>on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Fuck my brother.</v>

1716
01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:20.110
<v Speaker 1>It's all absolutely after I jerk off to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the memories on that.</v>

1717
01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:26.900
<v Speaker 1>But there's one thing if you say</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to someone knowing that you're</v>

1718
01:08:26.901 --> 01:08:29.510
<v Speaker 1>going to make up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like knowing that you can get away with</v>

1719
01:08:29.511 --> 01:08:30.000
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1720
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.850
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people do that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>

1721
01:08:31.851 --> 01:08:34.340
<v Speaker 1>They get real mean and nasty to each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other because they know the person's</v>

1722
01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:35.930
<v Speaker 1>trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're married and you</v>

1723
01:08:35.931 --> 01:08:36.450
<v Speaker 1>have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1724
01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:37.040
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1725
01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 1>That can get real squirrely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>

1726
01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:40.820
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that happen with people and</v>

1727
01:08:40.821 --> 01:08:41.660
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool man,</v>

1728
01:08:41.661 --> 01:08:44.360
<v Speaker 1>you got to not do that to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me not want to get married.</v>

1729
01:08:44.361 --> 01:08:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Can I talked to so many guys who don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get their dick sucked anymore and they</v>

1730
01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.520
<v Speaker 1>don't get this or that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

1731
01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be a fuck fest if you're</v>

1732
01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:52.040
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1733
01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.050
<v Speaker 1>You know the kid things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dialogue,</v>

1734
01:08:53.410 --> 01:08:56.180
<v Speaker 1>but that's my fear is I married</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>

1735
01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:57.560
<v Speaker 1>A real fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1736
01:08:57.561 --> 01:08:59.300
<v Speaker 1>All these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden I know I'm going to</v>

1737
01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:00.860
<v Speaker 1>cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be good.</v>

1738
01:09:01.190 --> 01:09:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a the the idea of marriage and this</v>

1739
01:09:05.421 --> 01:09:08.270
<v Speaker 1>is coming from a happily married guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking stupid.</v>

1740
01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why,</v>

1741
01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:14.240
<v Speaker 1>because it's a contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're your people change on a day to</v>

1742
01:09:14.241 --> 01:09:16.220
<v Speaker 1>day basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They change throughout the day.</v>

1743
01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:21.140
<v Speaker 1>They change based on the song they hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they change based on the conversation</v>

1744
01:09:21.141 --> 01:09:24.470
<v Speaker 1>they have with their girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They change based on a book they read.</v>

1745
01:09:24.471 --> 01:09:28.520
<v Speaker 1>People fucking change and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in this constant stage of growing</v>

1746
01:09:28.521 --> 01:09:31.250
<v Speaker 1>and developing and when you commit to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like you say,</v>

1747
01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:32.360
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my girlfriend,</v>

1748
01:09:32.361 --> 01:09:33.590
<v Speaker 1>this is my husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my wife,</v>

1749
01:09:33.591 --> 01:09:35.540
<v Speaker 1>this is my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my companion.</v>

1750
01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:40.580
<v Speaker 1>When you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one thing to do it and to really</v>

1751
01:09:40.581 --> 01:09:43.850
<v Speaker 1>be all in and really enjoy that person's</v>
<v Speaker 1>company and want to be with them a lot.</v>

1752
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:48.970
<v Speaker 1>So nothing to involve the government to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get legal paperwork signed and all that</v>

1753
01:09:49.341 --> 01:09:51.910
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was willing to do it simply because,</v>

1754
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:52.641
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1755
01:09:52.641 --> 01:09:55.220
<v Speaker 1>because my wife's awesome and I love her</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's a great person,</v>

1756
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:57.830
<v Speaker 1>but also because I have children and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1757
01:09:57.831 --> 01:10:00.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that having children is a way bigger</v>

1758
01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:03.650
<v Speaker 1>commitment than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because now there's a human life</v>

1759
01:10:03.651 --> 01:10:08.651
<v Speaker 1>that depends on you and all my phobias</v>
<v Speaker 1>about government interaction and laws</v>

1760
01:10:08.841 --> 01:10:11.360
<v Speaker 1>and legal paperwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is coming from a guy who has</v>

1761
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:16.040
<v Speaker 1>several close friends whose lives have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been fucking ruined by divorce,</v>

1762
01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:20.000
<v Speaker 1>where they've had to pay exorbitant</v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of money.</v>

1763
01:10:20.001 --> 01:10:21.920
<v Speaker 1>It wrecks their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It caused them stress.</v>

1764
01:10:21.921 --> 01:10:24.590
<v Speaker 1>They've aged 10 years in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen guys like that.</v>

1765
01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:28.120
<v Speaker 1>I seen a bunch of guys like that who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been devastated by divorce and and</v>

1766
01:10:28.121 --> 01:10:30.110
<v Speaker 1>then then devastated by the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife.</v>

1767
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Hiring the most evil vicious lawyers to</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack them and go after them and try to</v>

1768
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:38.690
<v Speaker 1>squeeze as much money out as possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>and drag it into the dirt.</v>

1769
01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Especially when a man and woman who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>married and the man makes all the money,</v>

1770
01:10:43.641 --> 01:10:47.120
<v Speaker 1>the man has to pay for the woman's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyer and that's where things get</v>

1771
01:10:47.121 --> 01:10:49.290
<v Speaker 1>fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1772
01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Because then there's no cost to her to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do anything.</v>

1773
01:10:51.411 --> 01:10:54.380
<v Speaker 1>She can file a motion after motion</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing this dummy is paying for it.</v>

1774
01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's draining the money.</v>

1775
01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:59.930
<v Speaker 1>She's draining his money and I had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good friend of mine deal with this.</v>

1776
01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:03.540
<v Speaker 1>He went through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was more than a year and a half of of</v>

1777
01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:07.490
<v Speaker 1>deliberate where he lost hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of dollars in legal fees and</v>

1778
01:11:07.491 --> 01:11:09.200
<v Speaker 1>the whole time his wife was doing it on</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

1779
01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:11.930
<v Speaker 1>They would come to an agreement and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would change the agreement should be</v>

1780
01:11:11.931 --> 01:11:12.620
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

1781
01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I want more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he would be like,</v>

1782
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:14.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had an agreement.</v>

1783
01:11:14.881 --> 01:11:15.870
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>

1784
01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.990
<v Speaker 1>fuck you pay me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she would hang up the phone and</v>

1785
01:11:18.991 --> 01:11:21.660
<v Speaker 1>then the lawyer would contact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the new stipulations and he</v>

1786
01:11:21.661 --> 01:11:24.810
<v Speaker 1>would get ready to agree to those and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then she would drag that out for a</v>

1787
01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:27.120
<v Speaker 1>couple months and then ramp it up again</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was being completely</v>

1788
01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:29.700
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable and it hit on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship too.</v>

1789
01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:32.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when it's a hateful relationship,</v>

1790
01:11:32.791 --> 01:11:34.720
<v Speaker 1>it's still some kind of a connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1791
01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.490
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What people divorce.</v>

1792
01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Do I have to Piss my pants because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't make it through a whole podcast</v>

1793
01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.520
<v Speaker 1>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>

1794
01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you did.</v>

1795
01:11:42.991 --> 01:11:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was getting too wrapped up about</v>

1796
01:11:44.491 --> 01:11:48.360
<v Speaker 1>divorce talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's crazy to think he's going to get</v>

1797
01:11:48.361 --> 01:11:51.740
<v Speaker 1>married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you talk to someone who is a,</v>

1798
01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.140
<v Speaker 1>and I say this with all due respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hardcore pervert like Jim Norton,</v>

1799
01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.840
<v Speaker 1>the ideally is going to settle down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what it is,</v>

1800
01:11:57.841 --> 01:11:58.560
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1801
01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.380
<v Speaker 1>When you don't have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems so attractive to you.</v>

1802
01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:02.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>

1803
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:06.420
<v Speaker 1>if.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a guy who's got a regular nine</v>

1804
01:12:06.421 --> 01:12:08.250
<v Speaker 1>to five job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get up in the morning,</v>

1805
01:12:08.251 --> 01:12:10.170
<v Speaker 1>you get your newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you let the dog out,</v>

1806
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.480
<v Speaker 1>you say hi to your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat your breakfast,</v>

1807
01:12:12.481 --> 01:12:14.860
<v Speaker 1>you drink your coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to work the same way every day,</v>

1808
01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:18.180
<v Speaker 1>and then you hear about rsg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fear disappeared and thrown his phone</v>

1809
01:12:18.181 --> 01:12:23.181
<v Speaker 1>into the garbage and just traveling to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of God knows where the fuck</v>

1810
01:12:23.371 --> 01:12:24.720
<v Speaker 1>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think he's in Vietnam.</v>

1811
01:12:24.721 --> 01:12:27.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what we've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he could have left Vietnam Tuesday</v>

1812
01:12:27.511 --> 01:12:30.750
<v Speaker 1>and gotten a fucking Malaysia now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows where he is.</v>

1813
01:12:30.751 --> 01:12:32.280
<v Speaker 1>It might be in Bali,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might.</v>

1814
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:36.660
<v Speaker 1>He might be doing some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic ritual with some monks and</v>

1815
01:12:36.661 --> 01:12:39.780
<v Speaker 1>the top of a temple right now who knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict three months.</v>

1816
01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

1817
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.510
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome,</v>

1818
01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.970
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1819
01:12:44.971 --> 01:12:49.080
<v Speaker 1>but to someone who looks at light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I was miserable and I looked at</v>

1820
01:12:49.081 --> 01:12:50.310
<v Speaker 1>his life and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

1821
01:12:50.311 --> 01:12:52.410
<v Speaker 1>that's what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to do.</v>

1822
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.160
<v Speaker 1>So I think when people just aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely comfortable with their life,</v>

1823
01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Jim's problem and one of Jim's problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he's very smart and when he's</v>

1824
01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:04.200
<v Speaker 1>thinking he's constantly thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's constantly obsessing about</v>

1825
01:13:04.201 --> 01:13:06.300
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see him like going over all these</v>

1826
01:13:06.301 --> 01:13:10.050
<v Speaker 1>variables and that's one of the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>while while cry at movies,</v>

1827
01:13:10.051 --> 01:13:11.790
<v Speaker 1>it's also one of the reasons why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1828
01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:14.520
<v Speaker 1>like he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll go over all various aspects of</v>

1829
01:13:14.521 --> 01:13:16.470
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about how smart you are,</v>

1830
01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.380
<v Speaker 1>that it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How To pee.</v>

1831
01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll be lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to go again to my bladder is</v>

1832
01:13:22.261 --> 01:13:23.120
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

1833
01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:25.800
<v Speaker 1>it's already 3:00.</v>

1834
01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.290
<v Speaker 1>So you made it an hour and a half in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're an hour and a half in.</v>

1835
01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1836
01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1837
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:31.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ip,</v>

1838
01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:32.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much that,</v>

1839
01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:34.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you hold it for a little</v>

1840
01:13:34.651 --> 01:13:36.720
<v Speaker 1>while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your body doesn't release it all.</v>

1841
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my bladder is a fucking nightmare.</v>

1842
01:13:39.151 --> 01:13:41.340
<v Speaker 1>But I buy apnea so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wake up and have to Piss a lot.</v>

1843
01:13:41.341 --> 01:13:43.560
<v Speaker 1>But I think that someone told me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body waking you up so you don't</v>

1844
01:13:43.561 --> 01:13:45.390
<v Speaker 1>suffocate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're not breathing,</v>

1845
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.090
<v Speaker 1>your body's going breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing,</v>

1846
01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.560
<v Speaker 1>yelling and your body will sending the</v>
<v Speaker 1>signal pis and that gets you up and you</v>

1847
01:13:49.570 --> 01:13:50.210
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

1848
01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that.</v>

1849
01:13:51.331 --> 01:13:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how true it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't be pissing that much.</v>

1850
01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you drink a lot of water,</v>

1851
01:13:55.621 --> 01:13:57.600
<v Speaker 1>you would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pissed sometimes the middle of the</v>

1852
01:13:57.601 --> 01:13:57.810
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

1853
01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:00.180
<v Speaker 1>I try not to drink at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I get thirsty.</v>

1854

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>

1855
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:01.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get thirsty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1856
01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:05.580
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather have a drink of water now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get up in the middle of the night to</v>

1857
01:14:05.581 --> 01:14:07.200
<v Speaker 1>pee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love a good beverage.</v>

<v Speaker 1>point of being unmanageable.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Two hours.</v>

1872
01:14:36.401 --> 01:14:36.670
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

1873
01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Towards the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

1874
01:14:37.511 --> 01:14:40.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one I had.</v>

1875
01:14:40.481 --> 01:14:42.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a two hour movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means you left every 10 minutes.</v>

1876
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's without exaggeration.</v>

1877
01:14:45.071 --> 01:14:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pissed when I'm on a roll.</v>

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.270
<v Speaker 1>It's nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The girl must be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this guy doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knows me.</v>

1880
01:14:51.641 --> 01:14:53.800
<v Speaker 1>I told you like Ip a lot though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to sit in the aisle.</v>

1881
01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:58.090
<v Speaker 1>I flew to la the first time I went to La</v>
<v Speaker 1>was with Patrice and I are on a twa</v>

1882
01:14:58.091 --> 01:15:00.760
<v Speaker 1>flight and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the window and he was in the</v>

1883
01:15:00.761 --> 01:15:01.300
<v Speaker 1>aisle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1884
01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:02.260
<v Speaker 1>for maximum comfort.</v>

1885
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Fucking pissed so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is 94,</v>

1886
01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:11.920
<v Speaker 1>95 and Patrice said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to get checked for diabetes,</v>

1887
01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.120
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're diabetic.</v>

1888
01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.970
<v Speaker 1>And he was diabetic so he fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>freaked me out.</v>

1889
01:15:15.971 --> 01:15:18.120
<v Speaker 1>So I went and got checked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been checked multiple times since</v>

1890
01:15:18.121 --> 01:15:20.680
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not diabetic and I've had my bladder</v>

1891
01:15:20.681 --> 01:15:23.140
<v Speaker 1>like sonogrammed and I like the size of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1892
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:25.840
<v Speaker 1>Different checks and they said no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a normal size.</v>

1893
01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.540
<v Speaker 1>You just peel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a lot of thinking going on.</v>

1894
01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Jim Norton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do too much.</v>

1895
01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.200
<v Speaker 1>It's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things we were talking</v>

1896
01:15:32.201 --> 01:15:32.560
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1897
01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.240
<v Speaker 1>you think a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1898
01:15:34.241 --> 01:15:37.630
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're smart because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking in variables,</v>

1899
01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of variables involved.</v>

1900
01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always used to tell that to people</v>

1901
01:15:41.591 --> 01:15:42.424
<v Speaker 1>that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1902
01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:45.970
<v Speaker 1>my students back when I was teaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo and they would go to fight and</v>

1903
01:15:45.971 --> 01:15:49.300
<v Speaker 1>tournament's and they'd be really</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous and I would explain that the</v>

1904
01:15:49.301 --> 01:15:51.160
<v Speaker 1>smarter you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more nervous are going to be.</v>

1905
01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:55.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's just part of reality because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're aware of the variables.</v>

1906
01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:59.050
<v Speaker 1>The stupid people are not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of all the possibilities in their</v>

1907
01:15:59.051 --> 01:16:00.220
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their mind.</v>

1908
01:16:00.221 --> 01:16:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Everything's gonna go great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might be good if it goes great,</v>

1909
01:16:04.571 --> 01:16:07.390
<v Speaker 1>but it might be terrible if it goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrongs in the reality gets shattered</v>

1910
01:16:07.391 --> 01:16:09.740
<v Speaker 1>because they can't handle the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happened.</v>

1911
01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see this coming exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I'm always prepared for the</v>

1912
01:16:12.611 --> 01:16:14.380
<v Speaker 1>fucking Florida fallout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1913
01:16:14.410 --> 01:16:15.221
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1914
01:16:15.221 --> 01:16:17.470
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might be prepared to much.</v>

1915
01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:20.130
<v Speaker 1>You might be thinking too much about all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different variables.</v>

1916
01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:22.870
<v Speaker 1>They probably wouldn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like the whole worry about your</v>

1917
01:16:22.871 --> 01:16:25.570
<v Speaker 1>arm when your arm's fine right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1918
01:16:25.571 --> 01:16:28.690
<v Speaker 1>it is right now it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then like last week I was there two</v>

1919
01:16:28.691 --> 01:16:32.560
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago I was doing these curls and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I started doing curls.</v>

1920
01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Who's got you doing curls?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1921
01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:34.870
<v Speaker 1>my trend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I asked her.</v>

1922
01:16:34.871 --> 01:16:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do them and they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1923
01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in isolation exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's very little times in life we're</v>

1924
01:16:40.670 --> 01:16:43.810
<v Speaker 1>standing there doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just lifting things up with one arm.</v>

1925
01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:49.060
<v Speaker 1>A lot of time in life I'm doing a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>times that leads to imbalances I feel</v>

1926
01:16:49.901 --> 01:16:52.030
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as I got older I really believe this</v>

1927
01:16:52.031 --> 01:16:55.720
<v Speaker 1>more and more and the more really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>trainers that I've talked to,</v>

1928
01:16:55.721 --> 01:16:59.680
<v Speaker 1>the more they sort of harp on this exact</v>
<v Speaker 1>same things that you should treat the</v>

1929
01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:03.040
<v Speaker 1>body like a unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's one large unit and so if</v>

1930
01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:06.700
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should involve for the most part with</v>

1931
01:17:06.701 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>a few exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not terrible to do some isolation</v>

1932
01:17:10.101 --> 01:17:12.320
<v Speaker 1>exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think for the most part it should</v>

1933
01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:16.700
<v Speaker 1>involve most of your body or large</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle groups like a squat or deadlift</v>

1934
01:17:16.710 --> 01:17:19.340
<v Speaker 1>is one of the best because the deadlift</v>
<v Speaker 1>involves your arms,</v>

1935
01:17:19.341 --> 01:17:20.690
<v Speaker 1>your back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shoulders,</v>

1936
01:17:20.691 --> 01:17:22.040
<v Speaker 1>your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your calves.</v>

1937
01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's so much involved in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead lift.</v>

1938
01:17:24.351 --> 01:17:28.520
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why it's such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great exercise for overall physical</v>

1939
01:17:28.521 --> 01:17:33.170
<v Speaker 1>strength and I think for arms like chin</v>
<v Speaker 1>ups and rows and things along those</v>

1940
01:17:33.171 --> 01:17:34.140
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're doing that,</v>

1941
01:17:34.141 --> 01:17:36.620
<v Speaker 1>like you're involving so much of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

1942
01:17:36.621 --> 01:17:38.870
<v Speaker 1>like one armed rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your back.</v>

1943
01:17:38.871 --> 01:17:40.880
<v Speaker 1>It's your core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your arms,</v>

1944
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.080
<v Speaker 1>your shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1945
01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:45.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the curl is kind of just your</v>

1946
01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:47.330
<v Speaker 1>bicep and your forearm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1947
01:17:47.331 --> 01:17:49.010
<v Speaker 1>it's really mostly what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1948
01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.010
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of those too.</v>

1949
01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Those things we get pull into the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you've thrown a punch display or</v>

1950
01:17:52.731 --> 01:17:54.380
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really robust sizing.</v>

1951
01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:56.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not a very particularly exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud of.</v>

1952
01:17:57.570 --> 01:17:59.420
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they have you lifting weights,</v>

1953
01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:03.710
<v Speaker 1>are you lifting weights for a high</v>
<v Speaker 1>reputations or low repetitions?</v>

1954
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I depends on how tired I am really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1955
01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:10.520
<v Speaker 1>it really depends on what if I tell her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I sometimes I say I just want to do</v>

1956
01:18:10.521 --> 01:18:13.850
<v Speaker 1>like minor things today because I'm so</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhausted.</v>

1957
01:18:13.851 --> 01:18:15.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know it sounds like I'm being a</v>

1958
01:18:15.111 --> 01:18:17.780
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know how I feel and I'm like,</v>

1959
01:18:17.781 --> 01:18:21.260
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm going to pass out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel like it's like a fog.</v>

1960
01:18:21.261 --> 01:18:23.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't raise up when you start</v>

1961
01:18:23.421 --> 01:18:24.920
<v Speaker 1>working out a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>

1962
01:18:24.921 --> 01:18:28.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's literally like s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>

1963
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:32.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a thickness to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like looking through things.</v>

1964
01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:35.780
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had sleep when I have sleep apnea now,</v>

1965
01:18:35.781 --> 01:18:38.090
<v Speaker 1>but now I wear a mouthpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1966
01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mouthpiece is incredible,</v>

1967
01:18:39.771 --> 01:18:41.660
<v Speaker 1>but yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got the one that goes over your</v>

1968
01:18:41.661 --> 01:18:43.610
<v Speaker 1>tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get one like that because I</v>

1969
01:18:43.611 --> 01:18:45.600
<v Speaker 1>have to push my draw out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which helps,</v>

1970
01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.660
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't fucking.</v>

1971
01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I got the central apnea to your apnea is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a completely different animal.</v>

1972
01:18:51.621 --> 01:18:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Your happening is your brain tells you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop breathing.</v>

1973
01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also do.</v>

1974
01:18:57.591 --> 01:18:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I also had obstructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have both.</v>

1975
01:18:59.150 --> 01:18:59.741
<v Speaker 1>You have both?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1976
01:18:59.741 --> 01:19:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have that.</v>

1977
01:19:00.721 --> 01:19:02.990
<v Speaker 1>I have that one to Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stinks,</v>

1978
01:19:02.991 --> 01:19:05.950
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way the brain one is the creepiest</v>

1979
01:19:05.970 --> 01:19:08.330
<v Speaker 1>because obstructive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you need is a mouthpiece in is good.</v>

1980
01:19:08.331 --> 01:19:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Like I have the obstructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My tongue is too big and so it covers my</v>

1981
01:19:13.101 --> 01:19:15.950
<v Speaker 1>air hole when I lay on my back and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>neck and it falls.</v>

1982
01:19:16.090 --> 01:19:18.550
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of football players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weightlifter.</v>

1983
01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Reggie like died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1984
01:19:19.761 --> 01:19:23.390
<v Speaker 1>They get a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge problem with that and a guys like</v>

1985
01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:26.690
<v Speaker 1>that also that take sleeping pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That becomes a giant issue because then</v>

1986
01:19:26.691 --> 01:19:29.210
<v Speaker 1>you don't wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have like big ass neck,</v>

1987
01:19:29.211 --> 01:19:30.230
<v Speaker 1>big old weight lifter neck.</v>

1988
01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:33.620
<v Speaker 1>They live back in your tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally choke you to death.</v>

1989
01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

1990
01:19:34.381 --> 01:19:36.710
<v Speaker 1>they take probably the sleeping pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing because you're so fucking</v>

1991
01:19:36.711 --> 01:19:38.600
<v Speaker 1>tired of waking up every two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1992
01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:41.090
<v Speaker 1>And they're always exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm getting a good night's sleep</v>

1993
01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:43.290
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take a Melatonin once in a while.</v>

1994
01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Melatonin is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have on it.</v>

1995
01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.200
<v Speaker 1>We have a spray that's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sublingual under tongue.</v>

1996
01:19:48.201 --> 01:19:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Some really great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1997
01:19:49.161 --> 01:19:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1998
01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I would like to try that stuff because</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1999
01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:52.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2000
01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:54.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to sleep better but I just can't</v>

2001
01:19:54.651 --> 01:19:56.330
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know what they can do other</v>

2002
01:19:56.331 --> 01:19:59.030
<v Speaker 1>than that mask though for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that brain stuff.</v>

2003
01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Like if it's your brain shutting off</v>
<v Speaker 1>your breathing,</v>

2004
01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

2005
01:20:03.261 --> 01:20:05.870
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't send the signal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be a chemical thing.</v>

2006
01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:08.700
<v Speaker 1>I think your brain bored with too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece.</v>

2007
01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker sleep into a good.</v>

2008
01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:14.280
<v Speaker 1>That's probably what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make this more interesting than I</v>

2009
01:20:14.281 --> 01:20:15.900
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wake up and I checked my phone,</v>

2010
01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:17.700
<v Speaker 1>which will always be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keeps me awake.</v>

2011
01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll check my text messages or I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you two in the middle of the night.</v>

2012
01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:22.380
<v Speaker 1>At times I will yell a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just happened.</v>

2013
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:23.970
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2014
01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:24.910
<v Speaker 1>that's very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2015
01:20:24.930 --> 01:20:25.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sleep better.</v>

2016
01:20:25.951 --> 01:20:28.380
<v Speaker 1>My phone's across the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you put it across the room and it's</v>

2017
01:20:28.381 --> 01:20:29.340
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh cool.</v>

2018
01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I shut my phone off before I start</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading and then when I'm done reading</v>

2019
01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.250
<v Speaker 1>the phone stays off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2020
01:20:35.251 --> 01:20:37.830
<v Speaker 1>you don't check it before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's probably better that I don't</v>

2021
01:20:37.831 --> 01:20:41.830
<v Speaker 1>check it before bed and the only thing I</v>
<v Speaker 1>check in the morning is important shit.</v>

2022
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:46.830
<v Speaker 1>If someone's text messaging me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important but I just do it less and</v>

2023
01:20:47.101 --> 01:20:49.650
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think the phone is a tool but</v>

2024
01:20:49.651 --> 01:20:51.090
<v Speaker 1>it's also very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

2025
01:20:51.091 --> 01:20:55.910
<v Speaker 1>very addictive and being connected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media and you know,</v>

2026
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:57.800
<v Speaker 1>having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually one of my friends do it.</v>

2027
01:20:57.810 --> 01:20:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll send me a,</v>

2028
01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:01.320
<v Speaker 1>like a text message and I'll click on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the link and I'm like,</v>

2029
01:21:01.321 --> 01:21:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Christ at some crazy story or</v>

2030
01:21:03.690 --> 01:21:06.910
<v Speaker 1>some dude who got killed by a bear or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something nutty now.</v>

2031
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:10.260
<v Speaker 1>And then half hour later I'm still on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the toilet bowl.</v>

2032
01:21:10.261 --> 01:21:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Now my legs are numb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2033
01:21:12.241 --> 01:21:15.300
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing with my life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I got tired of doing that.</v>

2034
01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:18.150
<v Speaker 1>And so now I just look at my phone real</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>

2035
01:21:18.151 --> 01:21:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Anything important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No good.</v>

2036
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Leave it alone and then I'll go work out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll go get my day started.</v>

2037
01:21:23.850 --> 01:21:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you keep your phone with you and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>work out or do you leave it in the</v>

2038
01:21:25.861 --> 01:21:26.610
<v Speaker 1>locker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2039
01:21:26.610 --> 01:21:29.310
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I work out a good percentage of the</v>

2040
01:21:29.311 --> 01:21:31.290
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm not doing Jujitsu,</v>

2041
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is in my blocker or it's in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>bag.</v>

2042
01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm at home lifting weights,</v>

2043
01:21:37.651 --> 01:21:39.150
<v Speaker 1>like I lift weights in my own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my house,</v>

2044
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:40.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even touch it.</v>

2045
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Just leave it alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just put it away somewhere and I'll do</v>

2046
01:21:43.651 --> 01:21:45.900
<v Speaker 1>it in between sets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll kind of look at it for a second.</v>

2047
01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:48.510
<v Speaker 1>But fuck that man there too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn addictive.</v>

2048
01:21:48.630 --> 01:21:51.390
<v Speaker 1>They're too addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the other problem.</v>

2049
01:21:51.391 --> 01:21:54.810
<v Speaker 1>People get mad at me because it'll be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 2:00 in the afternoon and I haven't</v>

2050
01:21:54.811 --> 01:21:58.440
<v Speaker 1>responded to their test yet because I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got 30 of them and I look at my text</v>

2051
01:21:58.441 --> 01:22:01.050
<v Speaker 1>message just 30 fucking text messages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't respond to them.</v>

2052
01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:01.930
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't have.</v>

2053
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Because that takes you a half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally each one takes a minute.</v>

2054
01:22:05.710 --> 01:22:08.100
<v Speaker 1>You respond to each one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a half an hour down,</v>

2055
01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:11.400
<v Speaker 1>just text messages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you send someone something like</v>

2056
01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.230
<v Speaker 1>here's one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't respond to,</v>

2057
01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.220
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

2058
01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2059
01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:17.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not doing that,</v>

2060
01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.530
<v Speaker 1>not doing that last question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>

2061
01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:22.350
<v Speaker 1>can't do it to terrible question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>

2062
01:22:22.351 --> 01:22:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Going on where air breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitting</v>

2063
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Syria phone texting by fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2064
01:22:31.411 --> 01:22:34.110
<v Speaker 1>people just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they just want to connect with</v>

2065
01:22:34.111 --> 01:22:35.100
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just want to talk to you.</v>

2066
01:22:35.101 --> 01:22:36.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's someone I don't talk to that</v>

2067
01:22:36.541 --> 01:22:39.360
<v Speaker 1>often and they want to talk more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They to have shit to say,</v>

2068
01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:42.030
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then occasionally someone will say</v>

2069
01:22:42.031 --> 01:22:45.210
<v Speaker 1>something funny and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fun to get the if there's,</v>

2070
01:22:45.211 --> 01:22:48.300
<v Speaker 1>there's pros and cons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be managed and if it's not</v>

2071
01:22:48.301 --> 01:22:50.640
<v Speaker 1>managed to get away from you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't manage it very well.</v>

2072
01:22:50.641 --> 01:22:54.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent too much time obsessing on it.</v>

2073
01:22:54.650 --> 01:22:57.990
<v Speaker 1>And on the computer I discovered chatter</v>
<v Speaker 1>bait.</v>

2074
01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.940
<v Speaker 1>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fucking good man.</v>

2075
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 1>They have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you opened it up</v>

2076
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.780
<v Speaker 2>and there's all of these windows of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people being sexual and you can join or</v>

2077
01:23:10.781 --> 01:23:13.240
<v Speaker 2>you can almost watch for free as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a lurker,</v>

2078
01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.610
<v Speaker 2>but you just can't tip if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>lurking,</v>

2079
01:23:15.611 --> 01:23:17.110
<v Speaker 2>but you can just kind of go in there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>

2080
01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:20.590
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a lot of time to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2081
01:23:20.591 --> 01:23:21.201
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2082
01:23:21.201 --> 01:23:25.300
<v Speaker 2>It's very addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's other sites like that too.</v>

2083
01:23:25.301 --> 01:23:26.320
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just the name.</v>

2084
01:23:26.321 --> 01:23:28.540
<v Speaker 2>I know I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do any of those sites.</v>

2085
01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:31.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at any of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't either for a while at this one</v>

2086
01:23:31.271 --> 01:23:31.811
<v Speaker 2>I found.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2087
01:23:31.811 --> 01:23:34.780
<v Speaker 2>well it was so new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea of it was so new to me,</v>

2088
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2089
01:23:36.341 --> 01:23:38.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to stop doing it because it's</v>

2090
01:23:38.710 --> 01:23:40.650
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not even jerk off at the time just</v>

2091
01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:42.310
<v Speaker 2>watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like weird.</v>

2092
01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:45.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like what I dreamed of as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something human with your kid.</v>

2093
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.641
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

01:23:45.641 --> 01:23:48.040
<v Speaker 2>someday you're going to pick up that</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone in the kitchen and you're gonna be</v>

2095
01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:49.780
<v Speaker 2>able to see the person you're talking to</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So wonderful.</v>

2099
01:23:56.410 --> 01:24:00.320
<v Speaker 2>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't believe it.</v>

2100
01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Your brain is not ready for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's brain is.</v>

2101
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:06.760
<v Speaker 2>And especially a guy like you that knows</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people and has a lot of</v>

2102
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:09.220
<v Speaker 2>options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's almost like too much coming at</v>

2103
01:24:09.221 --> 01:24:10.570

<v Speaker 2>And I'm so afraid of missing the party.</v>

2105
01:24:13.121 --> 01:24:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm so afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2106
01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:16.990
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it goes back to.</v>

2108
01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:20.080

<v Speaker 2>I had fucked up.</v>

2109
01:24:20.290 --> 01:24:22.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember my friends,</v>

2110
01:24:22.591 --> 01:24:23.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two black kids there,</v>

2111

<v Speaker 2>pr and Randall and they wanted me to go</v>

2112
01:24:27.311 --> 01:24:30.250

<v Speaker 2>wouldn't let me go and I remember</v>

<v Speaker 2>screaming and crying and being so</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking angry and it was like I was</v>

<v Speaker 2>is we did a show that I opened for him</v>

<v Speaker 2>ever met him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran out into the lone pine nuts on it</v>

<v Speaker 2>and dice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said tigers might come back and he</v>

<v Speaker 2>let them.</v>

2128
01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:18.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm going up to the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't give a fuck that the greatest</v>

2129
01:25:18.341 --> 01:25:20.630
<v Speaker 2>golf for a live one to come back and say</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dice fucking meant it.</v>

2133

<v Speaker 2>creme ballet.</v>

2134
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:34.270
<v Speaker 2>That was what he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't give a shit about missing</v>

2135
01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.780
<v Speaker 2>because in his advice is fucking nuts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's the party,</v>

2136
01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:40.540
<v Speaker 2>but I admired that so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That ability to live without feeling</v>

2137
01:25:40.541 --> 01:25:45.010
<v Speaker 2>like you're going to miss out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're missing out is this fucking fear.</v>

2138
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.920
<v Speaker 2>It's addict is an addict stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to have that with this pool hall</v>

2139
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:52.420
<v Speaker 2>used to go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to go to this pool hall when I</v>

2140
01:25:52.421 --> 01:25:55.870
<v Speaker 2>lived in New York and it was a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>great place and there was executive</v>

2141
01:25:55.871 --> 01:25:58.060
<v Speaker 2>billiards in white plains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York and there was always a lot of</v>

2142
01:25:58.061 --> 01:26:00.580
<v Speaker 2>gambling going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of big gambling games.</v>

2143
01:26:00.581 --> 01:26:03.710
<v Speaker 2>Guys would come in from out of town or</v>
<v Speaker 2>were like great pool and people would</v>

2144
01:26:03.711 --> 01:26:06.890
<v Speaker 2>sit and watch and it was always</v>
<v Speaker 2>something happened and this was.</v>

2145
01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.830
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a cell phone back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this was like I'd be on a date with</v>

2146
01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:11.180
<v Speaker 2>my girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd just be thinking,</v>

2147
01:26:11.181 --> 01:26:12.440
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something going on at the pool</v>

2148
01:26:12.441 --> 01:26:14.620
<v Speaker 2>hall right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably happening.</v>

2149
01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:17.060
<v Speaker 2>Something's going down the street guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>are betting.</v>

2150
01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Guys are playing probably a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>

2151
01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:22.550
<v Speaker 2>Something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Total addict stuff was really when you</v>

2152
01:26:22.551 --> 01:26:23.660
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing happening.</v>

2153
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes there was though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

2154
01:26:25.581 --> 01:26:26.414
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once in a while,</v>

2155
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:29.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's the one time there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wipes out the 40 counties.</v>

2156
01:26:29.521 --> 01:26:30.410
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2157
01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:31.430
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

2158
01:26:31.431 --> 01:26:33.020
<v Speaker 2>It makes it worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like fishing.</v>

2159
01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:35.870
<v Speaker 2>You can go fishing three days in a row</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not catch a goddamn thing.</v>

2160
01:26:35.871 --> 01:26:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Go goddamn fishing sucks and then one</v>
<v Speaker 2>day you hook a giant Sam and you're</v>

2161
01:26:39.801 --> 01:26:41.270
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2162
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Another year of fishing because at one</v>
<v Speaker 2>time it's weird how that one,</v>

2163
01:26:44.601 --> 01:26:47.000
<v Speaker 2>the one time it worked overrides all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>times it does.</v>

2164
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:50.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I lived my life like that.</v>

2165
01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's like people going out and</v>

2166
01:26:51.921 --> 01:26:53.450
<v Speaker 2>trying to get laid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2167
01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how often does that work when a guy goes</v>

2168
01:26:55.581 --> 01:26:58.070
<v Speaker 2>out trying to get laid at a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the average fellow,</v>

2169
01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:01.130
<v Speaker 2>what is it like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he like three out of 10?</v>

2170
01:27:01.131 --> 01:27:04.850
<v Speaker 2>If he's great at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even maybe one at a 10.</v>

2171
01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ten nights trying to find the girl,</v>

2172
01:27:08.091 --> 01:27:09.800
<v Speaker 2>your dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the odds.</v>

2173
01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:13.760

<v Speaker 2>or finding a hot girl or finding a girl</v>

2174
01:27:13.761 --> 01:27:15.470
<v Speaker 2>you're attracted to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some guys will pull it off.</v>

2175
01:27:15.471 --> 01:27:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Chris delea could probably go out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>face the handsome guy I.</v>

2176
01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.850
<v Speaker 2>I give Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can probably pull a fucking four or</v>

2177
01:27:19.851 --> 01:27:22.590
<v Speaker 2>five nights out of 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're pulling home at least an eight and</v>

2180
01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Good looking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a combination as another man to</v>

<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>

2183
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2184
01:27:33.371 --> 01:27:35.960
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all I needed to date.</v>

2185
01:27:35.961 --> 01:27:40.700
<v Speaker 2>A girl who wants to fuck him on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>finished have no shot because he is</v>

2186
01:27:40.701 --> 01:27:41.990
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't funny.</v>

2187
01:27:41.991 --> 01:27:43.320
<v Speaker 2>It will be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if a guy is funny,</v>

2188
01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:46.160
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even get that one.</v>

2189
01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:48.380
<v Speaker 2>Trump card I have is that I'm a funny</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

2190
01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.560
<v Speaker 2>but if there's another dude's funny and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's good looking,</v>

2191
01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:52.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well I used to have to give up.</v>

2192
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:55.400
<v Speaker 2>I have to concede defeat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2193
01:27:55.401 --> 01:27:58.010
<v Speaker 2>unless he's a conservative guy sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it may be that maybe if she's a</v>

2194
01:27:58.011 --> 01:27:59.720
<v Speaker 2>pervert and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2195
01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:03.710
<v Speaker 2>maybe she's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not sucking on her hands or feet.</v>

2196
01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even that big Ip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just found them later in life.</v>

2197
01:28:05.751 --> 01:28:07.710
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's fun to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you beat up people thought,</v>

2198
01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:10.640
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not a big foot guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do ask the size of feet.</v>

2199
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2201
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:14.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you like them big?</v>

2202
01:28:14.511 --> 01:28:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Piking Morris better.</v>

2203
01:28:16.071 --> 01:28:16.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm a greedy fuck.</v>

2204
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:24.100
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>

2205
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you lose the sound?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2206
01:28:26.481 --> 01:28:28.060
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plugged the uh,</v>

2207
01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.170
<v Speaker 2>there's a little thing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has to be plugged in.</v>

2208
01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:35.060
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably knocked it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to fix that with our next setup.</v>

2209
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:35.930
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't fix it.</v>

2210
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get it.</v>

2211
01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Did I break it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2212
01:28:39.201 --> 01:28:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I just knocked that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Old Radio tape that was taped.</v>

2213
01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:45.380
<v Speaker 2>That special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Violent.</v>

2214
01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Hold the tape for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just crushed my legs,</v>

2215
01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:51.170
<v Speaker 2>my legs and properly broke the</v>
<v Speaker 2>equipment.</v>

2216
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:53.090
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one ace in the hole.</v>

2217
01:28:53.091 --> 01:28:55.430
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I got fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2218
01:28:55.431 --> 01:28:57.840
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be like A.</v>

2219
01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:59.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life is fun and I wanted.</v>

2220
01:28:59.690 --> 01:29:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of wanted to not settle down,</v>

2221
01:29:01.441 --> 01:29:04.560
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to see somebody regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When was the last time you did that</v>

2222
01:29:04.561 --> 01:29:06.120
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had a girlfriend for a while when we</v>

2223
01:29:06.121 --> 01:29:08.970
<v Speaker 2>were doing the virus tour way back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day.</v>

2224
01:29:08.970 --> 01:29:10.770
<v Speaker 2>What was that like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might've been 10 years ago.</v>

2225
01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:15.060
<v Speaker 2>That was 2006 and seven or seven and</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight maybe.</v>

2226
01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:20.130
<v Speaker 2>I had a girlfriend back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but after that I dated a girl seriously</v>

2227
01:29:20.131 --> 01:29:22.830
<v Speaker 2>to few years and we broke up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just too much fighting.</v>

2228
01:29:22.831 --> 01:29:24.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's my best friend.</v>

2229
01:29:24.241 --> 01:29:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I still talk to all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just don't date anymore.</v>

2230
01:29:26.290 --> 01:29:28.170
<v Speaker 2>You haven't slept with her five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're still,</v>

2231
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:29.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a great person.</v>

2232
01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Too much fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much fighting and everything.</v>

2233
01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:36.810
<v Speaker 2>I liked the arguing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I get obsessed with feeling like</v>

2234
01:29:36.811 --> 01:29:39.690
<v Speaker 2>I've been wronged or humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that whole.</v>

2235
01:29:39.691 --> 01:29:40.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

2236
01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:41.910
<v Speaker 2>It's that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you.</v>

2237
01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Do you realize that you're obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and it's not real while you're doing</v>

2238
01:29:46.411 --> 01:29:46.891
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2239
01:29:46.891 --> 01:29:48.510
<v Speaker 2>like if I had to write it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could write it down,</v>

2240
01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:51.090
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't change that because I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>addicted to feeling shitty.</v>

2241
01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Like I used to trap girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2242
01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:56.520
<v Speaker 2>I have a girl tell me like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would make them tell me if they're ex</v>

2243
01:29:56.521 --> 01:29:58.020
<v Speaker 2>boyfriends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick is bigger than mine.</v>

2244
01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let's be honest.</v>

2245
01:30:01.921 --> 01:30:03.540
<v Speaker 2>The odds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the odds were not bad.</v>

2246
01:30:04.450 --> 01:30:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Case Strap on and then you would get</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset that they had brought it up or</v>

2247
01:30:09.721 --> 01:30:12.300
<v Speaker 2>just be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will give me an excuse to hate myself</v>

2248
01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:17.700
<v Speaker 2>and feel bad about myself and like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>worthless and then that way there was</v>

2249
01:30:17.701 --> 01:30:20.390
<v Speaker 2>nothing they could do to make me feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

2250
01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:24.660
<v Speaker 2>I think this self fulfilling prophecy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I dated a girl one time who is</v>

2251
01:30:24.661 --> 01:30:28.790
<v Speaker 2>ex boyfriend had a giant Dick and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>timed it before I dated her I,</v>

2252
01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.110
<v Speaker 2>he said it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

2253
01:30:30.111 --> 01:30:30.944
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2254
01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:34.730
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had a video fucking him and she's</v>

2255
01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:36.000
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to want to see that.</v>

2256
01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.190
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way she said it was so sexy,</v>

2257
01:30:38.191 --> 01:30:41.520
<v Speaker 2>like a naughty girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to see it and I made myself</v>

2258
01:30:41.521 --> 01:30:44.580
<v Speaker 2>watch it and it turned me on to see her</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

2259
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:47.490
<v Speaker 2>like to see her being dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I took something that was going to</v>

2260
01:30:47.491 --> 01:30:49.350
<v Speaker 2>torture myself with and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

2261
01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:51.870
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like you throw your hands</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and you go with it.</v>

2262
01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Like instead of being ashamed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling bad about myself because of her</v>

2263
01:30:56.281 --> 01:30:58.950
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a woman's past and just make it a</v>

2264
01:30:58.951 --> 01:31:02.820
<v Speaker 2>dirty part of her that you like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I never gave a fuck again about</v>

2265
01:31:02.821 --> 01:31:03.190
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

2266
01:31:03.190 --> 01:31:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't care who you dated before me</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2267
01:31:05.610 --> 01:31:07.260
<v Speaker 2>His Dick was bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>

2268
01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:08.850
<v Speaker 2>Let's hear about it while I'm eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>your pussy.</v>

2269
01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:11.190
<v Speaker 2>That's what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me all about it.</v>

2270
01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:15.750
<v Speaker 2>He would do better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be fun.</v>

2271
01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:19.290
<v Speaker 2>Then it becomes a fun thing that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>fetishize and make good and they don't</v>

2272
01:31:19.291 --> 01:31:21.120
<v Speaker 2>ever have to feel embarrassed about</v>
<v Speaker 2>their past or like,</v>

2273
01:31:21.121 --> 01:31:22.590
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell this guy that.</v>

2274
01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:26.040
<v Speaker 2>That's a rare girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll show you a video of another guy.</v>

2275
01:31:26.041 --> 01:31:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Fucking her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2276
01:31:27.241 --> 01:31:30.780
<v Speaker 2>But I bugged her for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I kind of knew at that moment I knew</v>

2277
01:31:30.781 --> 01:31:34.140
<v Speaker 2>it that moment that it was a make or</v>
<v Speaker 2>break because I had done this my whole</v>

2278
01:31:34.141 --> 01:31:37.680
<v Speaker 2>life with girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had set up these scenarios where I was</v>

2279
01:31:37.681 --> 01:31:39.810
<v Speaker 2>going to lose and then we're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

2280
01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:44.100
<v Speaker 2>I was going to purposely put a wedge in</v>
<v Speaker 2>between that wasn't necessary that I</v>

2281
01:31:44.101 --> 01:31:46.830
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to deal with this girl</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she was super sexy and funny and</v>

2282
01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:50.730
<v Speaker 2>I just knew it was dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I made myself sit through it and see</v>

2283
01:31:50.731 --> 01:31:53.850
<v Speaker 2>how I felt about it and I was able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn it into a pornography and it was</v>

2284
01:31:53.851 --> 01:31:54.420
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2285
01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:58.110
<v Speaker 2>And when you said that you knew that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing it while you were doing it,</v>

2286
01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:01.210
<v Speaker 2>like you knew you were it while you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it at times.</v>

2287
01:32:01.211 --> 01:32:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not until after because I got</v>

2288
01:32:03.190 --> 01:32:05.820
<v Speaker 2>addicted to that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that burning feeling and the pity or</v>

2289
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:09.220
<v Speaker 2>stomach when you're feeling like you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been cheated on or you've been wrong.</v>

2290
01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:11.020
<v Speaker 2>It was just a stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a,</v>

2291
01:32:11.021 --> 01:32:12.550
<v Speaker 2>it was a good drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a fucking,</v>

2292
01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:16.660
<v Speaker 2>if a familiar feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you were actually addicted to feeling</v>

2293
01:32:16.661 --> 01:32:19.120
<v Speaker 2>disrespected and shitty and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2294
01:32:19.121 --> 01:32:20.470
<v Speaker 2>but not in a sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun way.</v>

2295
01:32:20.471 --> 01:32:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Like now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh the,</v>

2296
01:32:22.410 --> 01:32:23.180
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2297
01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:25.600
<v Speaker 2>a good dose of humiliation makes me</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

2298
01:32:25.601 --> 01:32:28.180
<v Speaker 2>But it really turns me on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2299
01:32:28.181 --> 01:32:29.440
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different.</v>

2300
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:32.150
<v Speaker 2>It feels unique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2301
01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:32.993
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2302
01:32:33.130 --> 01:32:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

2303
01:32:34.031 --> 01:32:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody relate to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you tell another friend?</v>

2304
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:37.120
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people do.</v>

2305
01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

2306
01:32:38.231 --> 01:32:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people like it.</v>

2307
01:32:39.281 --> 01:32:42.550
<v Speaker 2>They like humiliation or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll pay whatever it is or how many</v>

2308
01:32:42.551 --> 01:32:44.590
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And plus the women.</v>

2309
01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:47.020
<v Speaker 2>A lot of women enjoy it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love telling you about that stuff</v>

2310
01:32:47.290 --> 01:32:50.060
<v Speaker 2>because it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It lets them be who they want to be and</v>

2311
01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:51.520
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to feel like,</v>

2312
01:32:51.521 --> 01:32:52.990
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to pretend on this one.</v>

2313
01:32:54.250 --> 01:32:56.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck what the worst</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been.</v>

2314
01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:59.020
<v Speaker 2>The more you're going to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walked through the door,</v>

2315
01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.450
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's going to be nothing I do</v>

2316
01:33:01.451 --> 01:33:03.020
<v Speaker 2>that's going to surprise you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2317
01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:05.710
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I kind of like is like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want somebody.</v>

2318
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.510
<v Speaker 2>That's why I seek out people in the sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry,</v>

2319
01:33:07.511 --> 01:33:11.110
<v Speaker 2>I think because I have no judgment on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2320
01:33:11.111 --> 01:33:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Like if you do porn or if you escorted</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I feel like you're not going to</v>

2321
01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:16.600
<v Speaker 2>judge me.</v>

2322
01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:19.930
<v Speaker 2>I feel like whatever you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm okay with it.</v>

2323
01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a big.</v>

2324
01:33:21.610 --> 01:33:24.910
<v Speaker 2>That's really important because the real</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue is someone judging you,</v>

2325
01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:25.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2326
01:33:25.930 --> 01:33:27.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone deciding that what you've done</v>

2327
01:33:27.971 --> 01:33:31.090
<v Speaker 2>is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended a relationship one time.</v>

2328
01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:34.480
<v Speaker 2>There was a girl I was dating and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>was one of the girls I met who didn't</v>

2329
01:33:34.481 --> 01:33:37.480
<v Speaker 2>know my past or my history of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've joked about or talked about or said</v>

2330
01:33:37.481 --> 01:33:38.290
<v Speaker 2>that were true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that made.</v>

2331
01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:40.900
<v Speaker 2>I made sure there were jokes for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course a truck which was,</v>

2332
01:33:40.901 --> 01:33:41.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2333
01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:46.330
<v Speaker 2>I had to tell her a couple of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's googleable right now and</v>

2334
01:33:46.331 --> 01:33:47.164
<v Speaker 2>she's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2335
01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:48.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trans,</v>

2336
01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:52.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to come up and there's no way</v>

2337
01:33:52.301 --> 01:33:54.560
<v Speaker 2>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I talked to you about it a little.</v>

2338
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:58.750
<v Speaker 2>This is post nuptials posts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>

2339
01:33:59.170 --> 01:34:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Have you had fucked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2340
01:34:01.031 --> 01:34:02.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were seeing each other for a few</v>

2341
01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:03.580
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His marriage.</v>

2342
01:34:03.630 --> 01:34:04.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2343
01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was teaching there for a few weeks and</v>

2344
01:34:06.671 --> 01:34:07.450
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2345
01:34:07.450 --> 01:34:10.480
<v Speaker 2>she got really weird with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was uncomfortable with it and we</v>

2346
01:34:10.481 --> 01:34:12.760
<v Speaker 2>were eating lunch and she said something</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me like,</v>

2347
01:34:13.090 --> 01:34:15.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff you told me about,</v>

2348
01:34:15.221 --> 01:34:17.890
<v Speaker 2>like the stuff you've done with fan</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls or whatever.</v>

2349
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Like I had to say it because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be with you for four,</v>

2350
01:34:21.090 --> 01:34:23.170
<v Speaker 2>four or five months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden you pop it up and going,</v>

2351
01:34:23.171 --> 01:34:25.810
<v Speaker 2>I got a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not dealing with that on the way to</v>

2352
01:34:25.811 --> 01:34:29.770
<v Speaker 2>a wedding or a fucking party and looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at your dumb face because you don't get</v>

2353
01:34:29.771 --> 01:34:30.940
<v Speaker 2>it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it.</v>

2354
01:34:31.330 --> 01:34:32.950
<v Speaker 2>So I said fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would tell her,</v>

2355
01:34:33.170 --> 01:34:34.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's like,</v>

2356
01:34:34.181 --> 01:34:38.110
<v Speaker 2>you can never tell me stuff like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>again because I have an idea of what</v>

2357
01:34:38.111 --> 01:34:39.020
<v Speaker 2>being masculine is.</v>

2358
01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:39.701
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2359
01:34:39.701 --> 01:34:43.750
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as she was talking I felt every bit</v>

2360
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:47.740
<v Speaker 2>of attraction to her drain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

2361
01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the fact that I wasn't offended</v>

2362
01:34:51.821 --> 01:34:53.520
<v Speaker 2>by what she said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2363
01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:56.240
<v Speaker 2>go fuck yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2364
01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Finished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I stopped seeing her after that</v>

2365
01:34:59.150 --> 01:35:02.750
<v Speaker 2>because that was fair that she had that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't like that scolding shit.</v>

2366
01:35:02.751 --> 01:35:04.270
<v Speaker 2>Like don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

2367
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:08.780
<v Speaker 2>We all want something when someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>judges you or scold you sexually,</v>

2368
01:35:08.781 --> 01:35:10.130
<v Speaker 2>it drives me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2369
01:35:10.131 --> 01:35:12.290
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't just that she was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2370
01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I know that that's your past and I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is something that you're into,</v>

2371
01:35:16.101 --> 01:35:18.470
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be a problem.</v>

2372
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead she was saying that is not what</v>

2373
01:35:22.461 --> 01:35:27.200
<v Speaker 2>I think of as masculinity and you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not masking and I can't shake that</v>

2374
01:35:27.201 --> 01:35:28.430
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel like,</v>

2375
01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:29.150
<v Speaker 2>oh I'm not.</v>

2376
01:35:29.150 --> 01:35:29.751
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2377
01:35:29.751 --> 01:35:31.810
<v Speaker 2>if she had to put shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put her foot down.</v>

2378
01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she just didn't want to hear</v>

2379
01:35:34.011 --> 01:35:35.240
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

2380
01:35:35.241 --> 01:35:36.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you're into the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2381
01:35:36.771 --> 01:35:37.760
<v Speaker 2>I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2382
01:35:37.761 --> 01:35:39.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going be in the same things a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of women are into.</v>

2383
01:35:39.831 --> 01:35:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Apparently the times they want to hold</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands and here I love you and sexually</v>

2384
01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.450
<v Speaker 2>good luck with that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not happening.</v>

2385
01:35:45.130 --> 01:35:46.530
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not while,</v>

2386
01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:49.070
<v Speaker 2>not in that there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't have a loving sexual experience</v>

2387
01:35:49.071 --> 01:35:51.440
<v Speaker 2>unless we're strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's a weird high.</v>

2388
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

2389
01:35:54.710 --> 01:35:59.150
<v Speaker 2>So if you're strangers then you can have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a loving sexual experience that I want</v>

2390
01:35:59.151 --> 01:36:03.200
<v Speaker 2>to say I love you or I want you to tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>me you love me because they feel like</v>

2391
01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:04.300
<v Speaker 2>they're strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2392
01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:05.173
<v Speaker 2>Or if I'm paying them.</v>

2393
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:06.281
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2394
01:36:06.281 --> 01:36:08.060
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like whatever it feels,</v>

2395
01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:10.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it gets things mixed up a</v>

2396
01:36:10.221 --> 01:36:11.610
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's just for a,</v>

2397
01:36:11.630 --> 01:36:13.370
<v Speaker 2>for a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just for a moment.</v>

2398
01:36:13.371 --> 01:36:14.810
<v Speaker 2>So like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think too much.</v>

2399
01:36:14.811 --> 01:36:17.720
<v Speaker 2>It's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you really feel it in the moment</v>

2400
01:36:17.721 --> 01:36:19.370
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you feel connected.</v>

2401
01:36:19.630 --> 01:36:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some,</v>

2402
01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:22.120
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've analyzed this today.</v>

2403
01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:25.190
<v Speaker 2>I think what it is and what I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2404
01:36:25.191 --> 01:36:28.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel any pressure and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel scared,</v>

2405
01:36:28.221 --> 01:36:29.390
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to do well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2406
01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:31.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna fuck up.</v>

2407
01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:34.430
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're connected I feel completely</v>

2408
01:36:34.431 --> 01:36:38.990
<v Speaker 2>free just to feel things and be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once I know you and once I'm dating</v>

2409
01:36:38.991 --> 01:36:41.810
<v Speaker 2>you and I care about your opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then like you said,</v>

2410
01:36:41.811 --> 01:36:44.150
<v Speaker 2>all the variables come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck up.</v>

2411
01:36:44.151 --> 01:36:46.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do so when there's no risk.</v>

2412
01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:50.450
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what I always liked about</v>
<v Speaker 2>exchanges of money.</v>

2413
01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:53.750
<v Speaker 2>He was never dehumanizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I never treated the girls bad.</v>

2414
01:36:53.751 --> 01:36:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I was never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2415
01:36:55.251 --> 01:36:57.410
<v Speaker 2>I always made them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

2416
01:36:57.411 --> 01:37:01.130
<v Speaker 2>I just felt like free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I know she's not worried about how</v>

2417
01:37:01.131 --> 01:37:04.910
<v Speaker 2>I do so I can be comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be judged and I don't</v>

2418
01:37:04.911 --> 01:37:06.380
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just maybe I'm just justifying my</v>

2419
01:37:06.381 --> 01:37:07.260
<v Speaker 2>own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2420
01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:08.960
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>

2421
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:11.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like I've never heard that before</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2422
01:37:11.031 --> 01:37:16.031
<v Speaker 2>The only way that you can be loving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like lovey in a sexual sense is</v>

2423
01:37:17.931 --> 01:37:19.250
<v Speaker 2>if they're strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2424
01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Or if they're inaccessible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times it was just about to</v>

2425
01:37:21.621 --> 01:37:24.710
<v Speaker 2>chase and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that addictive stupid shit.</v>

2426
01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:27.050
<v Speaker 2>But I liked that one moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2427
01:37:27.051 --> 01:37:28.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all have these moments where we feel</v>

2428
01:37:28.641 --> 01:37:33.260
<v Speaker 2>better and that when that girl said that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt better about like I was glad that</v>

2429
01:37:33.261 --> 01:37:34.820
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go her.</v>

2430
01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Did you stay friends with her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2431
01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:39.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm not mad at her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not mad at her and she had told me</v>

2432
01:37:39.351 --> 01:37:40.790
<v Speaker 2>some sexual shit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

2433
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:43.610
<v Speaker 2>it was almost like the shit you told me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I didn't judge you on.</v>

2434
01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.400
<v Speaker 2>What kind of Shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2435
01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:51.560
<v Speaker 2>she had had a fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could say this because he doesn't even</v>

2436
01:37:51.561 --> 01:37:52.690
<v Speaker 2>live in state anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

2437
01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:53.990
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still sore.</v>

2438
01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:55.440
<v Speaker 2>I would feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2439
01:37:55.890 --> 01:37:59.610
<v Speaker 2>she had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just say how to have an and she'd</v>

2440
01:37:59.611 --> 01:38:02.790
<v Speaker 2>never done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she had had an animal fantasy or she</v>

2441
01:38:02.791 --> 01:38:06.900
<v Speaker 2>had watched a video of an animal fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman and admitted that there was</v>

2442
01:38:06.901 --> 01:38:09.150
<v Speaker 2>something about it that had turned her</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

2443
01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:11.550
<v Speaker 2>What kind of animal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2444
01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:16.450
<v Speaker 2>it was a pony</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

2445
01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:22.410
<v Speaker 2>something about tweets and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pause.</v>

2446
01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:27.600
<v Speaker 2>It was funny</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she told me that she wasn't being</v>

2447
01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.550
<v Speaker 2>dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was literally just talking to me</v>

2448
01:38:29.551 --> 01:38:30.030
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

2449
01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big fat hog.</v>

2450
01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I blurted that out front of.</v>

2451
01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.570
<v Speaker 2>I do with that pony hog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she's,</v>

2452
01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:42.750
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a famous,</v>

2453
01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:45.060
<v Speaker 2>that's a common fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women in horses,</v>

2454
01:38:45.650 --> 01:38:47.880
<v Speaker 2>a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His Dick is so big you can't think about</v>

2455
01:38:47.881 --> 01:38:49.380
<v Speaker 2>the horse without thinking about it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick.</v>

2456
01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about a horse,</v>

2457
01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:52.643
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2458
01:38:52.650 --> 01:38:55.890
<v Speaker 2>chill thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like it's a giant Dick.</v>

2459
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:58.540
<v Speaker 2>A horse dicks are fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a great reputation.</v>

2460
01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:00.480
<v Speaker 2>So dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't know what a great</v>

2461
01:39:00.481 --> 01:39:03.720
<v Speaker 2>reputation they being a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Socks.</v>

2462
01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also a lot of women that ride</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2463
01:39:05.611 --> 01:39:10.611
<v Speaker 2>They're like these Bach and no</v>
<v Speaker 2>disrespect ladies boxy sort of almost</v>

2464
01:39:10.651 --> 01:39:14.540
<v Speaker 2>androgynous flannel shirt wearing women</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like,</v>

2465
01:39:14.541 --> 01:39:17.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lose their feminine shape and they</v>

2466
01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:20.430
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get thick and they just ride that</v>

2467
01:39:20.431 --> 01:39:23.610
<v Speaker 2>horse and I always feel like they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting some sort of a vaginal</v>

2468
01:39:23.611 --> 01:39:28.350
<v Speaker 2>stimulation by just the constant</v>
<v Speaker 2>clop clop,</v>

2469
01:39:28.850 --> 01:39:31.860
<v Speaker 2>clop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about the movement of</v>

2470
01:39:31.861 --> 01:39:36.030
<v Speaker 2>the horse and saddle rubbing up against</v>
<v Speaker 2>their pussy and they're just wearing</v>

2471
01:39:36.031 --> 01:39:38.280
<v Speaker 2>their pussy out on the wrangler jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2472
01:39:38.281 --> 01:39:39.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way to look at.</v>

2473
01:39:39.250 --> 01:39:40.081
<v Speaker 2>I'm Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2474
01:39:40.081 --> 01:39:42.390
<v Speaker 2>I never thought of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think of it women who just like,</v>

2475
01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:45.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't need men just ride this horse</v>
<v Speaker 2>and come three or four times as it goes</v>

2476
01:39:45.961 --> 01:39:49.270
<v Speaker 2>up a hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This giant beast with</v>

2477
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:56.300

2478
01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.110

<v Speaker 2>I think that's a lot of what it is.</v>

2479
01:40:01.111 --> 01:40:03.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of women in my</v>

2480
01:40:03.241 --> 01:40:04.830
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in Lincoln Equestrian</v>

2481
01:40:04.831 --> 01:40:06.960
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know the Burbank is an equestrian</v>

2482
01:40:06.961 --> 01:40:09.720
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood and didn't know it can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Burbank and you'll see fucking people</v>

2483
01:40:09.721 --> 01:40:11.940
<v Speaker 2>walked on the street riding a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

2484
01:40:11.970 --> 01:40:13.770
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love petting horses.</v>

2485
01:40:14.010 --> 01:40:15.150

<v Speaker 2>They're great animals.</v>

2487
01:40:18.330 --> 01:40:20.700
<v Speaker 2>I like to pet all animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go to a sanctuary.</v>

2488
01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be the point with that girl.</v>

2489
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:24.120
<v Speaker 2>I didn't judge her when she told me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2490
01:40:24.150 --> 01:40:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Like I always a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think he was weird.</v>

2491
01:40:25.771 --> 01:40:29.010
<v Speaker 2>I was not my thing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not a size queen.</v>

2492
01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:30.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she sure was.</v>

2493
01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:35.730
<v Speaker 2>She picked the wrong fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well she probably liked you for some</v>

2494
01:40:35.731 --> 01:40:37.470
<v Speaker 2>parts of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's often the case with</v>

2495
01:40:37.471 --> 01:40:37.951
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2496
01:40:37.951 --> 01:40:39.960
<v Speaker 2>Like you like certain aspects but it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>

2497
01:40:40.230 --> 01:40:42.570
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't all line up,</v>

2498
01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:45.570
<v Speaker 2>but you like a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's got a great sense of humor.</v>

2499
01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.610
<v Speaker 2>He's fearless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's hilarious.</v>

2500
01:40:47.611 --> 01:40:50.640
<v Speaker 2>He says funny shit all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He keeps me entertained,</v>

2501
01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:54.820
<v Speaker 2>but he's fucked a few dudes dresses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well she like,</v>

2502
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:56.320
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never fuck could do to address.</v>

2503
01:40:56.321 --> 01:40:57.760
<v Speaker 2>That'd be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only a trans woman.</v>

2504
01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:00.360
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are Edward was the dude in a</v>

2505
01:41:00.361 --> 01:41:03.580
<v Speaker 2>dress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would never fuck Edward Trans woman?</v>

2506
01:41:03.930 --> 01:41:04.651
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2507
01:41:04.651 --> 01:41:07.980
<v Speaker 1>When you probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you get excited when people started</v>

2508
01:41:07.981 --> 01:41:10.360
<v Speaker 1>changing the differentiations between</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2509
01:41:10.361 --> 01:41:13.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it used to be like a tranny,</v>

2510
01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:16.790
<v Speaker 2>like everybody thought it was a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a guy and now it's,</v>

2511
01:41:16.791 --> 01:41:18.200
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2512
01:41:18.201 --> 01:41:20.170
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care what it,</v>

2513
01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:22.160
<v Speaker 2>whatever they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I felt that we would do is</v>

2514
01:41:22.161 --> 01:41:25.580
<v Speaker 2>probably some of the political correct</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit is so fucking irritating.</v>

2515
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:27.890
<v Speaker 2>And then there's times where I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it might make sense.</v>

2516
01:41:27.891 --> 01:41:30.710
<v Speaker 2>Not In punishing people but in like just</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a difference between this</v>

2517
01:41:30.711 --> 01:41:32.990
<v Speaker 2>person and that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some of it it's fine,</v>

2518
01:41:32.991 --> 01:41:33.920
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

2519
01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:35.780
<v Speaker 2>Whatever they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever people want to be like,</v>

2520
01:41:35.781 --> 01:41:36.800
<v Speaker 2>they won't be with Trent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

2521
01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>

2522
01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:41.180
<v Speaker 2>some transcripts I've talked to like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman and I'm like,</v>

2523
01:41:41.210 --> 01:41:42.770
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference.</v>

2524
01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:44.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fine,</v>

2525
01:41:45.330 --> 01:41:47.960
<v Speaker 2>you're great who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to change who you are.</v>

2526
01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:51.320
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to say you're this word</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the judgment of the country is</v>

2527
01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:54.680
<v Speaker 2>pleasant or for that word than it is for</v>
<v Speaker 2>this word,</v>

2528
01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:58.820
<v Speaker 2>but you are who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't just don't say your I,</v>

2529
01:41:58.870 --> 01:42:00.440
<v Speaker 2>I personally just don't look at it that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2530
01:42:00.441 --> 01:42:03.050
<v Speaker 2>But someone who's 20 would tell me on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking transphobic,</v>

2531
01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:05.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm going to get shanked talk</v>

2532
01:42:05.001 --> 01:42:06.920
<v Speaker 2>about in the special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm going to get shit for it,</v>

2533
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:07.910
<v Speaker 2>but fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2534
01:42:08.670 --> 01:42:10.930
<v Speaker 2>if you don't say every word right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

2535
01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:12.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone's throwing the mines down and</v>

2536
01:42:12.381 --> 01:42:14.960
<v Speaker 2>you step on one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you get fucked.</v>

2537
01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing with the.</v>

2538
01:42:16.021 --> 01:42:17.470
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about with the joke</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>

2539
01:42:17.770 --> 01:42:20.250
<v Speaker 1>That guy got in trouble for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people are looking to get mad.</v>

2540
01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:23.080
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that when it comes to</v>

2541
01:42:23.081 --> 01:42:25.120
<v Speaker 1>transgender people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's another thing,</v>

2542
01:42:25.121 --> 01:42:27.490
<v Speaker 1>like people will tell you if you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>trans,</v>

2543
01:42:27.491 --> 01:42:29.200
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be talking about trans</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

2544
01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:31.330
<v Speaker 1>How about fuck you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2545
01:42:31.331 --> 01:42:35.020
<v Speaker 1>because this is a national global thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going on right now,</v>

2546
01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:37.600
<v Speaker 1>but you should be able to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2547
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:38.650
<v Speaker 1>That's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2548
01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:43.680
<v Speaker 1>But there are people that definitely for</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>

2549
01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:49.030
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe has thrown them a strange</v>

2550
01:42:49.031 --> 01:42:53.530
<v Speaker 1>set of cards and they really should have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been born a woman and they are a man and</v>

2551
01:42:53.531 --> 01:42:56.560
<v Speaker 1>they identify with being a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel much better when they're</v>

2552
01:42:56.561 --> 01:42:59.110
<v Speaker 1>wearing a dress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel much better wearing women's</v>

2553
01:42:59.111 --> 01:42:59.770
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>

2554
01:42:59.770 --> 01:43:03.880
<v Speaker 1>They feel much better and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have to get surgery to do</v>

2555
01:43:03.881 --> 01:43:05.020
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should have to get</v>

2556
01:43:05.021 --> 01:43:05.920
<v Speaker 1>your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people said,</v>

2557
01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Melissa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get your coat off or not a woman.</v>

2558
01:43:08.450 --> 01:43:13.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you were a woman and and</v>

2559
01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:15.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote trapped inside a man's</v>

2560
01:43:15.641 --> 01:43:20.570
<v Speaker 1>body and someone told you that you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get surgery to appear whole and</v>

2561
01:43:20.571 --> 01:43:23.170
<v Speaker 1>that's the only way you could ever be</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought of as a woman,</v>

2562
01:43:23.171 --> 01:43:24.850
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't want to get surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2563
01:43:24.851 --> 01:43:26.350
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

2564
01:43:26.351 --> 01:43:31.351
<v Speaker 1>Like those rules are just as crazy as</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other bizarre restrictions that we</v>

2565
01:43:31.451 --> 01:43:34.570
<v Speaker 1>put on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are those people in the world,</v>

2566
01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:37.360
<v Speaker 1>but then there are also people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

2567
01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:38.493
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2568
01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:39.850
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of that.</v>

2569
01:43:39.970 --> 01:43:42.010
<v Speaker 2>People who think they know who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they want,</v>

2570
01:43:42.011 --> 01:43:44.560
<v Speaker 2>but they're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've asked that surgery question a lot.</v>

2571
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:46.690
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want,</v>

2572
01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:49.270
<v Speaker 2>why do you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to get this srs,</v>

2573
01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:53.480
<v Speaker 2>sexual risk manager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm genuinely curious.</v>

2574
01:43:53.481 --> 01:43:54.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to ask you to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2575
01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:58.040
<v Speaker 2>everybody would know what that meant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It deep into the world.</v>

2576
01:43:58.650 --> 01:44:02.930
<v Speaker 2>In my world that's old hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like human resources are going to</v>

2577
01:44:02.931 --> 01:44:05.130
<v Speaker 2>go talk to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2578
01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:07.160
<v Speaker 2>I forget sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>CIA,</v>

2579
01:44:07.161 --> 01:44:08.720
<v Speaker 2>FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 2>srs.</v>

2580
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:11.330
<v Speaker 2>I poked my head out the fucking cave</v>
<v Speaker 2>once in a while.</v>

2581
01:44:11.331 --> 01:44:11.781
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

2582
01:44:11.781 --> 01:44:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Everybody isn't talking about this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>

2583
01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:15.830
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've asked about it and I'm like</v>

2584
01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:17.720
<v Speaker 2>without.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm genuinely curious to what you say.</v>

2585
01:44:17.721 --> 01:44:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know the answer to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

2586
01:44:19.361 --> 01:44:20.420
<v Speaker 2>do you what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want it?</v>

2587
01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:23.510
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes the answer is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it will feel better and that's</v>

2588
01:44:23.511 --> 01:44:25.080
<v Speaker 2>one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then other girls as well,</v>

2589
01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:26.390
<v Speaker 2>this way I can go swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2590
01:44:26.391 --> 01:44:29.570
<v Speaker 2>but those were all outside things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other people's judgment.</v>

2591
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:34.370
<v Speaker 2>That's not like I feel a certain way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's other people will look at me more</v>

2592
01:44:34.371 --> 01:44:36.290
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a dangerous thing I think.</v>

2593
01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:38.990
<v Speaker 2>But if it's going to feel better and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how I want it to be,</v>

2594
01:44:38.991 --> 01:44:40.880
<v Speaker 2>that's the one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they can't come though.</v>

2595
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:42.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no orgasms,</v>

2596
01:44:42.681 --> 01:44:43.514
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2597
01:44:43.630 --> 01:44:46.340
<v Speaker 2>I your Dick removed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure the orgasms are done.</v>

2598
01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:47.900
<v Speaker 2>I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard different answers from</v>

2599
01:44:47.901 --> 01:44:49.250
<v Speaker 2>different people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

2600
01:44:49.251 --> 01:44:50.360
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answer.</v>

2601
01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I was in a funny that that's terrifying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to people as a thought to no longer be</v>

2602
01:44:54.231 --> 01:44:55.110
<v Speaker 2>able to have orgasms.</v>

2603
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:57.500
<v Speaker 2>How many orgasms even having a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2604
01:44:57.530 --> 01:44:59.920
<v Speaker 2>If you have like four or five orgasms a</v>
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

2605
01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:01.280
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not that many,</v>

2606
01:45:01.281 --> 01:45:04.550
<v Speaker 2>but not considering the 24 hours in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

2607
01:45:04.551 --> 01:45:08.960
<v Speaker 2>All the moments in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The few moments that 30 slash 40 seconds</v>

2608
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:15.680
<v Speaker 2>that's so important to people to lead up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

2609
01:45:15.681 --> 01:45:18.170
<v Speaker 2>It's fun though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I liked it that I get addicted to</v>

2610
01:45:18.171 --> 01:45:20.230
<v Speaker 2>the lead up and that's what you can keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>going for awhile.</v>

2611
01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:23.540
<v Speaker 2>You were the first person to tell me but</v>
<v Speaker 2>edging but edging.</v>

2612
01:45:23.590 --> 01:45:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

2613
01:45:24.590 --> 01:45:27.050
<v Speaker 2>I never heard about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we would get close and then stop,</v>

2614
01:45:27.090 --> 01:45:28.820
<v Speaker 2>get close and then stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awful.</v>

2615
01:45:28.850 --> 01:45:30.800
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I didn't do it because then sex</v>

2616
01:45:30.801 --> 01:45:32.630
<v Speaker 2>becomes this weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2617
01:45:32.631 --> 01:45:35.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got addicted to doing that when I</v>

2618
01:45:35.451 --> 01:45:38.600
<v Speaker 2>don't do it for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I just kind of feel normal now.</v>

2619
01:45:38.690 --> 01:45:41.660
<v Speaker 2>When you do a show like this and you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>real open about this kind of stuff,</v>

2620
01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:44.300
<v Speaker 2>do you get a bunch of freaky chicks just</v>
<v Speaker 2>start bawling?</v>

2621
01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:46.040
<v Speaker 2>I think because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2622
01:45:46.041 --> 01:45:46.650
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2623
01:45:46.650 --> 01:45:48.520
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with on the radio show in the morning,</v>

2624
01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:52.340
<v Speaker 2>there's enough people who have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who known me or it's not surprising to</v>

2625
01:45:52.341 --> 01:45:54.740
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking.</v>

2626
01:45:54.810 --> 01:45:58.010
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to this girl on instagram</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she was,</v>

2627
01:45:58.011 --> 01:45:59.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was trans and I was following her</v>

2628
01:45:59.781 --> 01:46:03.170
<v Speaker 2>and she wrote me this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this a private message and she's like,</v>

2629
01:46:03.171 --> 01:46:04.790
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to look you up.</v>

2630
01:46:05.210 --> 01:46:05.871
<v Speaker 2>Which is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2631
01:46:05.871 --> 01:46:06.390
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

2632
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:07.910
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>

2633
01:46:07.911 --> 01:46:11.030
<v Speaker 2>it's me can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll shoot you down a little bit for no</v>

2634
01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:11.980
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do anything to it.</v>

2635
01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:13.370
<v Speaker 2>That's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she's like,</v>

2636
01:46:13.371 --> 01:46:17.390
<v Speaker 2>that bit you did on strap on is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>disrespectful to trans.</v>

2637
01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:18.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2638
01:46:18.710 --> 01:46:22.640
<v Speaker 2>first of all too true story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think I'm proud of the fact that a</v>

2639
01:46:22.641 --> 01:46:25.400
<v Speaker 2>fucking I cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just two different strap on stories I</v>

2640
01:46:25.401 --> 01:46:28.640
<v Speaker 2>have and I've told them both and</v>
<v Speaker 2>specialist at both trope and I'm like,</v>

2641
01:46:28.641 --> 01:46:29.720
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're true stories.</v>

2642
01:46:29.721 --> 01:46:31.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're trying to act like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like trans girls,</v>

2643
01:46:31.491 --> 01:46:33.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's obvious you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just like,</v>

2644
01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:35.240
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking dope.</v>

2645
01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.130
<v Speaker 2>You not reading the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2646
01:46:37.131 --> 01:46:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2647
01:46:38.181 --> 01:46:41.520
<v Speaker 2>no one thinks I don't know one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2648
01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:44.780
<v Speaker 2>I sent her an interview from vice where</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk about it and then she blocked me.</v>

2649
01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:46.560
<v Speaker 2>He blocked her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She did.</v>

2650
01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She like an idiot.</v>

2651
01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 2>She was just trying</v>

2652
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:52.890
<v Speaker 1>to get mad at you for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she'd want to be proven wrong.</v>

2653
01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:55.050
<v Speaker 1>People are so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get mad.</v>

2654
01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:56.700
<v Speaker 1>They liked to get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get mad.</v>

2655
01:46:56.701 --> 01:46:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Just like you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were addicted to causing these</v>

2656
01:46:59.911 --> 01:47:03.570
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a twitter troll and a relationship.</v>

2657
01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:08.670
<v Speaker 1>That is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2658
01:47:08.671 --> 01:47:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm addicted to that feeling.</v>

2659
01:47:10.951 --> 01:47:14.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm addicted to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That rush and that high.</v>

2660
01:47:14.850 --> 01:47:18.060
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny that the president is</v>

2661
01:47:18.061 --> 01:47:20.010
<v Speaker 1>twitter as a twitter troll?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2662
01:47:20.011 --> 01:47:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a twitter troll and I don't</v>

2663
01:47:21.811 --> 01:47:24.060
<v Speaker 1>even say whatever you want about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't hate him,</v>

2664
01:47:24.061 --> 01:47:26.610
<v Speaker 1>but his twitter and as embarrassing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got to stop.</v>

2665
01:47:27.630 --> 01:47:29.820
<v Speaker 1>He's a legit twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter troll.</v>

2666
01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Weird word to say 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But twitter,</v>

2667
01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:32.821
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>troll,</v>

2668
01:47:32.821 --> 01:47:33.654
<v Speaker 1>twitter troll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2669
01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:34.981
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2670
01:47:34.981 --> 01:47:36.570
<v Speaker 1>he is an odd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>odd duck.</v>

2671
01:47:36.630 --> 01:47:37.463
<v Speaker 1>He's a troll.</v>

2672
01:47:37.470 --> 01:47:39.210
<v Speaker 1>He likes to troll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2673
01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:42.330
<v Speaker 1>him and Rosie O'donnell still go at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost every day,</v>

2674
01:47:42.570 --> 01:47:46.020
<v Speaker 1>or at least rosie goes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It srosy backed off for a long time,</v>

2675
01:47:46.021 --> 01:47:48.390
<v Speaker 1>but now that he's president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't she back off when he said he was</v>

2676
01:47:48.391 --> 01:47:50.460
<v Speaker 1>going to sue works?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she had said he was broke or he</v>

2677
01:47:50.461 --> 01:47:52.680
<v Speaker 1>went back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said something which technically,</v>

2678
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:55.800
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want to have to litigate</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a guy with a billion dollars.</v>

2679
01:47:55.801 --> 01:47:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a frightening proposition.</v>

2680
01:47:57.091 --> 01:47:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I think she apologized on the view or if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wrong,</v>

2681
01:47:59.850 --> 01:48:01.710
<v Speaker 1>which is probably a smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2682
01:48:01.711 --> 01:48:06.300
<v Speaker 1>that was when she started mocking him on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the view because he had done this thing</v>

2683
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:09.810
<v Speaker 1>where the Miss Usa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one does he own?</v>

2684
01:48:09.811 --> 01:48:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Miss Universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

2685
01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:16.020
<v Speaker 1>He owns one of them and he had made some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of distinction that the woman,</v>

2686
01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:20.460
<v Speaker 1>I forget the specifics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she had done something inappropriate</v>

2687
01:48:20.461 --> 01:48:24.600
<v Speaker 1>or what he deemed inappropriate and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was getting her crown removed or</v>

2688
01:48:24.601 --> 01:48:25.410
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2689
01:48:25.410 --> 01:48:29.550
<v Speaker 1>So Rosie O'donnell was mocking him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's mocking his hair and the way he</v>

2690
01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:33.870
<v Speaker 1>behaves and the whole deal and she went</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this long rant about him on the view</v>

2691
01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:38.580
<v Speaker 1>and then he went on Letterman and shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over her and then they went back and</v>

2692
01:48:38.581 --> 01:48:43.581
<v Speaker 1>forth and back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw she made a poem because</v>

2693
01:48:43.831 --> 01:48:48.330
<v Speaker 1>he had mocked her during the debates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when one of the things that drove</v>

2694
01:48:48.331 --> 01:48:52.340
<v Speaker 1>me crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a.</v>

2695
01:48:53.130 --> 01:48:54.720
<v Speaker 1>When Hillary Clinton was debating him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>

2696
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:58.230
<v Speaker 1>you have said this about women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the women in this woman's a pig</v>

2697
01:48:58.231 --> 01:48:58.951
<v Speaker 1>and a sweatshirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2698
01:48:58.951 --> 01:49:01.080
<v Speaker 1>But about which one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2699
01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:03.390
<v Speaker 1>well you can't say women overall in</v>
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

2700
01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.080
<v Speaker 1>She knew what she was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

2701
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:08.160
<v Speaker 1>she was trying to find like this hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>button issue.</v>

2702
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:09.061
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2703
01:49:09.061 --> 01:49:10.530
<v Speaker 1>you know my center about Rosie</v>
<v Speaker 1>O'donnell.</v>

2704
01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:12.930
<v Speaker 1>And so she was devastated by that.</v>

2705
01:49:13.010 --> 01:49:18.010
<v Speaker 1>She was watching it at home and wrote a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole poem about the sadness creeping</v>

2706
01:49:18.061 --> 01:49:20.190
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it was bothering her and the whole</v>

2707
01:49:20.191 --> 01:49:22.350
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now she like kind of bates him,</v>

2708
01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:25.020
<v Speaker 1>like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made a post yesterday about all the</v>

2709
01:49:25.021 --> 01:49:26.730
<v Speaker 1>jobs that have been created and erode</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>

2710
01:49:26.731 --> 01:49:27.564
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>

2711
01:49:27.690 --> 01:49:29.850
<v Speaker 1>and she retweeted it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

2712
01:49:29.851 --> 01:49:31.980
<v Speaker 1>tweeted it and said trees and trees and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trees.</v>

2713
01:49:32.010 --> 01:49:33.450
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

2714
01:49:33.590 --> 01:49:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People really don't have set this one.</v>

2715
01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:35.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2716
01:49:35.970 --> 01:49:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I love being alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love watching it.</v>

2717
01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:39.030
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

2718
01:49:39.031 --> 01:49:40.890
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all these protests.</v>

2719
01:49:40.970 --> 01:49:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get in front of the trump towers and</v>

2720
01:49:42.721 --> 01:49:45.000
<v Speaker 1>fucking scream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know in our studio is not far from</v>

2721
01:49:45.001 --> 01:49:46.790
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the Uber driver decides to go up</v>

2722
01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:49.180
<v Speaker 1>first avenue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I normally hit traffic crossing town.</v>

2723
01:49:49.290 --> 01:49:49.961
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey dummy.</v>

2724
01:49:49.961 --> 01:49:50.794
<v Speaker 1>Go Up the other way.</v>

2725
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:52.380
<v Speaker 1>It's recreational outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2726
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:54.720
<v Speaker 1>I think so many people that are out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there in front of his building.</v>

2727
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:58.630
<v Speaker 1>The hotel in your hotel at UFC $200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phone.</v>

2728
01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:01.540
<v Speaker 1>We had to walk home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

2729
01:50:01.541 --> 01:50:02.950
<v Speaker 1>that was married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was fun.</v>

2730
01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We walked from my hotel all the way to</v>

2731
01:50:06.431 --> 01:50:10.170
<v Speaker 1>the UFC because we could not get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking car to take us.</v>

2732
01:50:10.171 --> 01:50:13.390
<v Speaker 1>There was no car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had to put a hood on and just</v>

2733
01:50:13.391 --> 01:50:17.110
<v Speaker 1>fucking barrel down and just plow</v>
<v Speaker 1>through other people and then when we</v>

2734
01:50:17.111 --> 01:50:18.570
<v Speaker 1>started getting close to mass square</v>
<v Speaker 1>guard,</v>

2735
01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:21.090
<v Speaker 1>it started getting a little crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people recognize us.</v>

2736
01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:22.300
<v Speaker 1>It was getting a little squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

2738
01:50:23.411 --> 01:50:25.870
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you walked very purposeful purposefully.</v>

2739
01:50:25.871 --> 01:50:26.381
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let me get back picture.</v>

2746
01:50:34.571 --> 01:50:36.510

<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

2747
01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Can't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 50,000 people on the street.</v>

2748

2751
01:50:43.571 --> 01:50:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Then it's just two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was this feeling in the air too.</v>

2752
01:50:45.791 --> 01:50:48.190
<v Speaker 1>It was just such a weird feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it was almost festive.</v>

2753
01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Like people were festive in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>protesting.</v>

2754
01:50:50.730 --> 01:50:52.150
<v Speaker 1>It's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're giddy excited.</v>

2755
01:50:52.330 --> 01:50:54.940
<v Speaker 1>We're together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck him.</v>

2756
01:50:54.941 --> 01:50:56.380
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing anything,</v>

2757
01:50:56.381 --> 01:50:58.810
<v Speaker 1>you're just yelling and you know this</v>
<v Speaker 1>one guy,</v>

2758
01:50:58.870 --> 01:51:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I've told this story before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just so bizarre because he</v>

2759
01:51:00.971 --> 01:51:04.420
<v Speaker 1>was screaming out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump KKK,</v>

2760
01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:05.710
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>

2761
01:51:05.730 --> 01:51:07.870
<v Speaker 1>anti gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had this whole thing that he was</v>

2762
01:51:07.871 --> 01:51:10.810
<v Speaker 1>screaming out and then he sees these</v>
<v Speaker 1>black guys walking towards him and he</v>

2763
01:51:10.811 --> 01:51:13.900
<v Speaker 1>starts yelling out black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black lives matter.</v>

2764
01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:15.490
<v Speaker 1>He changed his rant.</v>

2765
01:51:17.610 --> 01:51:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Douche bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So gross.</v>

2766
01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:23.950
<v Speaker 1>He was such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a thin boned,</v>

2767
01:51:23.951 --> 01:51:27.400
<v Speaker 1>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as the kind of guy who would cry if</v>

2768
01:51:27.401 --> 01:51:29.020
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they were camping and they ran out of</v>

2769
01:51:29.021 --> 01:51:31.390
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that guy.</v>

2770
01:51:31.930 --> 01:51:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Frail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

2771
01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:35.620
<v Speaker 1>He was so frail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was not just frail.</v>

2772
01:51:35.621 --> 01:51:37.780
<v Speaker 1>He was just everything about it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hole,</v>

2773
01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:39.220
<v Speaker 1>the chant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2774
01:51:39.221 --> 01:51:41.650
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole racist,</v>

2775
01:51:41.651 --> 01:51:42.890
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti gay.</v>

2776
01:51:43.570 --> 01:51:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Let's just start with anti gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where?</v>

2777
01:51:45.610 --> 01:51:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Where's the evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>

2778
01:51:47.291 --> 01:51:49.210
<v Speaker 1>He's anti gang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what has he done?</v>

2779
01:51:49.650 --> 01:51:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he cares.</v>

2780
01:51:51.490 --> 01:51:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he does either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unless it's making him money or</v>

2781
01:51:53.711 --> 01:51:58.570
<v Speaker 1>losing money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was the thing about people trans</v>

2782
01:51:58.630 --> 01:52:03.400
<v Speaker 1>rights to be able to use the restroom</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they identify with,</v>

2783
01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:06.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that was a hot button subjects and</v>

2784
01:52:06.461 --> 01:52:11.461
<v Speaker 1>there was actual government support for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to use the bathroom that they</v>

2785
01:52:11.951 --> 01:52:12.880
<v Speaker 1>identify with.</v>

2786
01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:15.630
<v Speaker 1>And boy that is a tricky one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I,</v>

2787
01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2788
01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:19.690
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there almost should be three bathrooms.</v>

2789
01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like male,</v>

2790
01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:24.170
<v Speaker 1>female and who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2791
01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:26.790
<v Speaker 1>We're pull up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them all in when you can have them</v>

2792
01:52:26.791 --> 01:52:28.780
<v Speaker 1>all as single bathrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender neutral,</v>

2793
01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:29.673
<v Speaker 1>neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

2794
01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:33.160
<v Speaker 1>But then businesses go yet we have men</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a women's room and it's like we just</v>

2795
01:52:33.161 --> 01:52:36.640
<v Speaker 1>established he's in the bathroom now</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want us to pay $100,000 to have</v>

2796
01:52:36.641 --> 01:52:37.610
<v Speaker 1>a new bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put it like.</v>

2797
01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:39.610
<v Speaker 1>And there were people that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested.</v>

2798
01:52:39.611 --> 01:52:42.610
<v Speaker 1>A few guys who were arrested for saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were transgender and they were</v>

2799
01:52:42.890 --> 01:52:45.570
<v Speaker 1>sleeping and taking pictures of women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2800
01:52:45.571 --> 01:52:49.010
<v Speaker 1>it's like there are creeps out there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that scary.</v>

2801
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2802
01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:53.150
<v Speaker 1>and then people say in rightly so will</v>
<v Speaker 1>those creeps should be punished on an</v>

2803
01:52:53.151 --> 01:52:53.990
<v Speaker 1>individual basis.</v>

2804
01:52:54.230 --> 01:52:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

2805
01:52:55.780 --> 01:53:00.050
<v Speaker 1>that puts that up to law enforcement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to have more resources to</v>

2806
01:53:00.051 --> 01:53:03.410
<v Speaker 1>make sure that these guys aren't doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that creeping around and female</v>

2807
01:53:03.411 --> 01:53:05.630
<v Speaker 1>bathrooms and pretending to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>transgender.</v>

2808
01:53:05.631 --> 01:53:07.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2809
01:53:07.011 --> 01:53:09.140
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have an opening for creeps,</v>

2810
01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:12.740
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna find their way through</v>
<v Speaker 1>those cracks and that does not</v>

2811
01:53:12.741 --> 01:53:14.540
<v Speaker 1>necessarily saying that because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>creeps,</v>

2812
01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:18.630
<v Speaker 1>you should punish transgender people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to.</v>

2813
01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure of the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know the answer.</v>

2814
01:53:21.501 --> 01:53:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the law that they made was</v>

2815
01:53:23.490 --> 01:53:24.770
<v Speaker 1>North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little shitty,</v>

2816
01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:26.840
<v Speaker 1>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the law in North Carolina.</v>

2817
01:53:26.841 --> 01:53:29.600
<v Speaker 1>They just said basically you have to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>the men,</v>

2818
01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:31.430
<v Speaker 1>men and men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just said you can't do whatever is</v>

2819
01:53:31.431 --> 01:53:32.370
<v Speaker 1>on your birth certificate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2820
01:53:32.371 --> 01:53:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And get that changed.</v>

2821
01:53:34.670 --> 01:53:36.320
<v Speaker 1>I think you can get your birth</v>
<v Speaker 1>certificate changed.</v>

2822
01:53:36.610 --> 01:53:38.510
<v Speaker 1>That I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the answer to that.</v>

2823
01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:40.940
<v Speaker 1>If you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you get the gender on your birth</v>

2824
01:53:40.941 --> 01:53:43.880
<v Speaker 1>certificate changed Google that I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

2825
01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I think you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as there a legit complaint,</v>

2826
01:53:48.130 --> 01:53:51.470
<v Speaker 1>like if women are in the locker room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone is legitimately trans,</v>

2827
01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:53.540
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it odd for them to see somebody</v>

2828
01:53:53.541 --> 01:53:56.450
<v Speaker 1>walking around with car like I could get</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that would be weird and without</v>

2829
01:53:56.451 --> 01:53:58.640
<v Speaker 1>being transphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not something you expect to</v>

2830
01:53:58.641 --> 01:53:59.170
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the lady room.</v>

2831
01:53:59.170 --> 01:54:02.500
<v Speaker 1>The majority of states permit the name</v>
<v Speaker 1>and says to be changed on a birth</v>

2832
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:05.930
<v Speaker 1>certificate either through amending</v>
<v Speaker 1>existing birth certificate or by issuing</v>

2833
01:54:05.931 --> 01:54:07.220
<v Speaker 1>a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many states,</v>

2834
01:54:07.221 --> 01:54:10.340
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>require medical proof of sterilization</v>

2835
01:54:10.341 --> 01:54:15.341
<v Speaker 1>by sex reassignment surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What proof of sterilization?</v>

2836
01:54:16.130 --> 01:54:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Sex reassignment surgery in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>warrant a gender marker change.</v>

2837
01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:21.373
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird.</v>

2838
01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get surgery for the state to</v>

2839
01:54:23.361 --> 01:54:26.540
<v Speaker 1>agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not just that sterilization well</v>

2840
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:29.120
<v Speaker 1>bisects your sterilized by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reassignments.</v>

2841
01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:31.640
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a weird way is describing in</v>

2842
01:54:31.641 --> 01:54:32.960
<v Speaker 1>many states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

2843
01:54:32.961 --> 01:54:35.900
<v Speaker 1>require medical proof of sterilization</v>
<v Speaker 1>because guess what?</v>

2844
01:54:36.050 --> 01:54:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Female to male does not make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>sterile.</v>

2845
01:54:38.950 --> 01:54:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Like when when women start taking a male</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones,</v>

2846
01:54:42.430 --> 01:54:45.350
<v Speaker 1>like there was a one where there's this</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy with a beard and he was</v>

2847
01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:47.390
<v Speaker 1>breastfeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

2848
01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got pregnant,</v>

2849
01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:52.460
<v Speaker 1>gave birth and was breastfeeding and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people were saying,</v>

2850
01:54:52.461 --> 01:54:54.350
<v Speaker 1>well what kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this kid getting?</v>

2851
01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

2852
01:54:55.911 --> 01:54:59.720
<v Speaker 1>And I mean this guy's taking exogenous</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones and this kid is sucking on his</v>

2853
01:54:59.721 --> 01:55:00.500
<v Speaker 1>tits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2854
01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:01.251
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

2855
01:55:01.251 --> 01:55:02.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's maybe it's not bad for the</v>

2856
01:55:02.871 --> 01:55:04.760
<v Speaker 1>baby or maybe stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

2857
01:55:05.110 --> 01:55:07.910
<v Speaker 1>It gets a little dicey and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's this big hits in the</v>

2858
01:55:07.911 --> 01:55:09.080
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like other people if say,</v>

2859
01:55:09.130 --> 01:55:10.010
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying,</v>

2860
01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:11.890
<v Speaker 1>we're not everyone's.</v>

2861
01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:14.510
<v Speaker 1>This is a tricky one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are just trying to learn what it</v>

2862
01:55:14.511 --> 01:55:16.910
<v Speaker 1>is and get used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Science is not even 100 percent.</v>

2863
01:55:16.911 --> 01:55:20.330
<v Speaker 1>So give people some fucking time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjust.</v>

2864
01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone who's not 100 percent on</v>
<v Speaker 1>board is not trans phobic.</v>

2865
01:55:23.690 --> 01:55:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Some people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people who are learning to</v>

2866
01:55:25.461 --> 01:55:27.740
<v Speaker 1>differentiate that just because a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>says tranny,</v>

2867
01:55:27.741 --> 01:55:29.870
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're not true doesn't mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hates transpeople.</v>

2868
01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Who's transphobic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learn the difference when you're</v>

2869
01:55:31.971 --> 01:55:33.420
<v Speaker 1>labeling everyone who is not 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>onboard,</v>

2870
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:35.690
<v Speaker 1>transphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lose so many people who would be on</v>

2871
01:55:35.691 --> 01:55:36.411
<v Speaker 1>your site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2872
01:55:36.411 --> 01:55:39.560
<v Speaker 1>I think like many things with human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>

2873
01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:43.010
<v Speaker 1>people are messy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is messy realities to all of.</v>

2874
01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:46.980
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what's going on with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole transgender issue too.</v>

2875
01:55:47.310 --> 01:55:48.180
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

2876
01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:50.310
<v Speaker 1>People are messy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2877
01:55:50.370 --> 01:55:52.860
<v Speaker 1>it's just the whole thing is we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>

2878
01:55:52.861 --> 01:55:53.390
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2879
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:58.110
<v Speaker 1>We're everything about us is weird from</v>
<v Speaker 1>education to marriage to gender</v>

2880
01:55:58.111 --> 01:56:03.111
<v Speaker 1>relations to the roles that we choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was some fucking tweet that I</v>

2881
01:56:03.181 --> 01:56:05.890
<v Speaker 1>saw today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2882
01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:08.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smashing social justice.</v>

2883
01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:11.820
<v Speaker 1>This is what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go go to smashing social justice on</v>

2884
01:56:11.821 --> 01:56:15.300
<v Speaker 1>instagram and this is like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just shows how bizarre the way people</v>

2885
01:56:15.301 --> 01:56:18.000
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a line in front of the women's</v>

2886
01:56:18.001 --> 01:56:20.670
<v Speaker 1>room and no line in front of the men's</v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

2887
01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:25.110
<v Speaker 1>And I think the quote was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more subtle.</v>

2888
01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Patriarchy bullshit law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty minute line in front of the</v>

2889
01:56:28.681 --> 01:56:30.840
<v Speaker 1>women's room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No line in front of the men's room.</v>

2890
01:56:30.990 --> 01:56:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2891
01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:34.080
<v Speaker 1>that does nothing to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy.</v>

2892
01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:38.310
<v Speaker 1>That has to do with women need an</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual stall.</v>

2893
01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:42.420
<v Speaker 1>It requires more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more space.</v>

2894
01:56:43.050 --> 01:56:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Account accounts private.</v>

2895
01:56:44.971 --> 01:56:46.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a private.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2896
01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.033
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>

2897
01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:51.190
<v Speaker 2>They're probably getting a request</v>
<v Speaker 2>request to join you.</v>

2898
01:56:51.191 --> 01:56:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got locked out.</v>

2899
01:56:53.381 --> 01:56:55.210
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not logged in on this.</v>

2900
01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:56.091
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2901
01:56:56.091 --> 01:56:56.924
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2902
01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:58.810
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's a private account.</v>

2903
01:56:58.811 --> 01:57:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Must Be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get hated on by people.</v>

2904
01:57:01.090 --> 01:57:02.380
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2905
01:57:02.381 --> 01:57:03.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend not to.</v>

2906
01:57:03.421 --> 01:57:06.850
<v Speaker 2>It's funny on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when I've seen a few really</v>

2907
01:57:06.850 --> 01:57:09.160
<v Speaker 2>annoying things in the last month or so</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2908
01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:11.590
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not at mentioning me and I'm not</v>

2909
01:57:11.591 --> 01:57:12.940
<v Speaker 2>following them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't address it.</v>

2910
01:57:13.050 --> 01:57:15.280
<v Speaker 2>They're not talking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of practiced what I've always</v>

2911
01:57:15.281 --> 01:57:16.720
<v Speaker 2>preached.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I'm not,</v>

2912
01:57:16.750 --> 01:57:18.610
<v Speaker 2>if you're not following me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go fuck yourself.</v>

2913
01:57:18.611 --> 01:57:21.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this people that will say mean shit</v>

2914
01:57:21.191 --> 01:57:22.870
<v Speaker 2>to you that aren't following you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2915
01:57:22.871 --> 01:57:25.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to get your attention.</v>

2916
01:57:25.151 --> 01:57:27.060
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are those people?</v>

2917
01:57:27.061 --> 01:57:29.770
<v Speaker 2>Like why would anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you've done something egregious</v>

2918
01:57:30.010 --> 01:57:33.010
<v Speaker 2>or you've put something out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say like if you wrote a book and</v>

2919
01:57:33.011 --> 01:57:35.140
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trans people should all be shot and make</v>

2920
01:57:35.141 --> 01:57:35.974
<v Speaker 2>the world a lot.</v>

2921
01:57:36.610 --> 01:57:40.150
<v Speaker 2>That's something that someone should</v>
<v Speaker 2>address and them to doing that and</v>

2922
01:57:40.151 --> 01:57:41.920
<v Speaker 2>making a big deal out of it makes a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sense.</v>

2923
01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Putting their foot down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2924
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:45.430
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like what we're talking about with</v>

2925
01:57:45.431 --> 01:57:49.890
<v Speaker 2>that guy and the joke like pe people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily making points that are</v>

2926
01:57:49.891 --> 01:57:53.440
<v Speaker 2>just looking to be offended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Recreational outrage.</v>

2927
01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2928
01:57:54.070 --> 01:57:56.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a dumb guy laying there on his side</v>

2929
01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.390
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're saying that there's cock was</v>

2930
01:57:58.391 --> 01:58:00.380
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you liked having sex with him?</v>

2931
01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:05.090
<v Speaker 2>I would walk them to the logical steps</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to get them to say paint.</v>

2932
01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:08.400
<v Speaker 2>That's all I would lie on your side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2933
01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:10.960
<v Speaker 2>So we were in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember being in bed with one girl in</v>

2934
01:58:10.961 --> 01:58:14.050
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless I just discussing it in Florida.</v>

2935
01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Literally posting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever see the clip of.</v>

2936
01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:19.830
<v Speaker 2>And this is where trump was not media</v>
<v Speaker 2>savvy enough,</v>

2937
01:58:19.831 --> 01:58:21.730
<v Speaker 2>or Chris Matthews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was painted into a corner</v>

2938
01:58:21.731 --> 01:58:23.950
<v Speaker 2>about abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So should they be punished for having</v>

2939
01:58:24.250 --> 01:58:27.070
<v Speaker 2>like he just didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart dude and he just did a real</v>

2940
01:58:27.130 --> 01:58:31.090
<v Speaker 2>media savvy guy thing that trump is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>non politician,</v>

2941
01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:32.920
<v Speaker 2>wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't give a very good answer to which</v>

2942
01:58:32.921 --> 01:58:36.130
<v Speaker 2>was about abortion being illegal and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>logically walked him into a corner and</v>

2943
01:58:36.131 --> 01:58:39.580
<v Speaker 2>then trump had to go the like the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>answer was he had to put him in jail.</v>

2944
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I would do to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But just to get them</v>

2945
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:45.520
<v Speaker 1>to say bad shit on a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that one reporter that</v>

2946
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:49.090
<v Speaker 1>backed him into a corner when it came to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of electoral votes?</v>

2947
01:58:49.091 --> 01:58:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Like how big his electoral victory was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not.</v>

2948
01:58:51.821 --> 01:58:53.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>

2949
01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:55.990
<v Speaker 1>He was doing this thing that he does</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he brags,</v>

2950
01:58:56.410 --> 01:58:59.530
<v Speaker 1>which he's a braggadocious man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do that once you're the</v>

2951
01:58:59.531 --> 01:59:02.470
<v Speaker 1>fucking president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to change your ways and you try</v>

2952
01:59:02.471 --> 01:59:04.960
<v Speaker 1>to stop freewheeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He free wheels up there.</v>

2953
01:59:04.970 --> 01:59:05.691
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

2954
01:59:05.691 --> 01:59:07.840
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tie yourself up in knots and all the</v>

2955
01:59:07.841 --> 01:59:09.910
<v Speaker 1>shit that he was allowed to get away</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his whole life.</v>

2956
01:59:10.210 --> 01:59:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Now those become a liability and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just talking about the electoral college</v>

2957
01:59:14.411 --> 01:59:16.120
<v Speaker 1>victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy said,</v>

2958
01:59:16.121 --> 01:59:18.910
<v Speaker 1>you said that you won by the largest</v>
<v Speaker 1>margin history.</v>

2959
01:59:18.911 --> 01:59:20.200
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the case.</v>

2960
01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:21.281
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2961
01:59:21.281 --> 01:59:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I meant by Republicans.</v>

2962
01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:23.160
<v Speaker 1>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2963
01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:24.880
<v Speaker 1>he says by Barack Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he says,</v>

2964
01:59:24.881 --> 01:59:26.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Herbert Walker,</v>

2965
01:59:26.241 --> 01:59:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush won by a far larger margin than</v>

2966
01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Obama won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says that.</v>

2967
01:59:30.431 --> 01:59:31.264
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2968
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:32.770
<v Speaker 1>you will agree though that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2969
01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:35.530
<v Speaker 1>I won by a substantial number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just can't say he's wrong.</v>

2970
01:59:35.531 --> 01:59:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I did see that the guy was standing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the press conference.</v>

2971
01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:39.220
<v Speaker 1>He had a guy and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2972
01:59:39.221 --> 01:59:42.130
<v Speaker 1>people told me that you can't just</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you just got to go.</v>

2973
01:59:42.131 --> 01:59:43.330
<v Speaker 1>I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2974
01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:45.460
<v Speaker 1>People don't mind when you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

2975
01:59:45.461 --> 01:59:48.130
<v Speaker 1>the guy had a point there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reporter had a really good point.</v>

2976
01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:51.580
<v Speaker 1>The point was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to point at all these media</v>

2977
01:59:51.581 --> 01:59:54.490
<v Speaker 1>outlets and say they're fake news and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're giving bad information,</v>

2978
01:59:54.940 --> 01:59:57.850
<v Speaker 1>how can we listen to you when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving bad information?</v>

2979
01:59:58.540 --> 01:59:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a great point.</v>

2980
01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:00.820
<v Speaker 1>He shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People when you.</v>

2981
02:00:00.850 --> 02:00:02.800
<v Speaker 1>When you say maybe because people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>let you off the hook,</v>

2982
02:00:03.130 --> 02:00:05.140
<v Speaker 1>but if you say you're wrong about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2983
02:00:05.170 --> 02:00:06.130
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a mistake.</v>

2984
02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.450
<v Speaker 1>People have a tendency to look at you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like you for that because nobody,</v>

2985
02:00:10.451 --> 02:00:12.340
<v Speaker 1>nobody thinks she didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

2986
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:14.410
<v Speaker 1>of course everybody knows you did own up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

2987
02:00:14.770 --> 02:00:16.570
<v Speaker 1>We're all human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's perfect.</v>

2988
02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm always a person on bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I'm saying that he should</v>

2989
02:00:19.531 --> 02:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>know everybody's bad at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2990
02:00:21.010 --> 02:00:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a great.</v>

2991
02:00:22.961 --> 02:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Many of us are very bad at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2992
02:00:25.090 --> 02:00:27.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a very hard thing to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you feel like you're being</v>

2993
02:00:27.461 --> 02:00:29.710
<v Speaker 1>challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to admit that you're</v>

2994
02:00:29.711 --> 02:00:30.441
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2995
02:00:30.441 --> 02:00:31.271
<v Speaker 1>I like to just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2996
02:00:31.271 --> 02:00:32.200
<v Speaker 1>I made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made an error.</v>

2997
02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2998
02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:35.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's that feeling like I lost the</v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange.</v>

2999
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of winning a lot,</v>

3000
02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>but then when you got to learn how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose.</v>

3001
02:00:39.190 --> 02:00:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the good things about</v>

3002
02:00:40.571 --> 02:00:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn how to lose.</v>

3003
02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:43.173
<v Speaker 1>You Do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3004
02:00:43.330 --> 02:00:44.770
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's put tapping.</v>

3005
02:00:44.771 --> 02:00:46.870
<v Speaker 1>You get tapped all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in the beginning.</v>

3006
02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I'm going to take to just do it.</v>

3007
02:00:48.491 --> 02:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm only going to take it until I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>tapped that unfinished.</v>

3008
02:00:50.850 --> 02:00:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Taking it for one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

3009
02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3010
02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I really want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really wasn't a true the entire.</v>

3011
02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Because when I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3012
02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:57.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like you walk into a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get like a vibe,</v>

3013
02:00:57.221 --> 02:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>and Matt walked me in and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you think the mayor sure everyone</v>

3014
02:01:01.061 --> 02:01:03.070
<v Speaker 1>loves this guy and or even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3015
02:01:03.071 --> 02:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>he's so great governance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu state,</v>

3016
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:07.180
<v Speaker 1>and they love him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does.</v>

3017
02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:09.670
<v Speaker 1>He's the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the most genuine guy.</v>

3018
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>There's no bullshit in this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3019
02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:12.370

3020
02:01:12.370 --> 02:01:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I love Matt because he hates bullies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hates bullies.</v>

3021
02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:19.100
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those guys who just doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate a guy who.</v>

3022
02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:21.610
<v Speaker 1>He's a short guy now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably people fuck with him.</v>

3023
02:01:21.611 --> 02:01:24.430
<v Speaker 1>When he was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that he just can't stand it.</v>

3024
02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:27.250
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a lot of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what leads them to martial arts</v>

3025
02:01:27.251 --> 02:01:29.020
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>

<v Speaker 1>really liked the energy in there.</v>

3055
02:02:41.121 --> 02:02:43.100
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a place I could come and learn</v>

3079
02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:00.170
<v Speaker 2>He didn't put full strength with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

3080
02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:02.940
<v Speaker 2>That was like fight week sometime.</v>

3081
02:04:02.941 --> 02:04:05.160

<v Speaker 2>He didn't even hit your heart on it.</v>

3083
02:04:07.631 --> 02:04:09.180
<v Speaker 2>It's going to choke you with a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>outfit.</v>

02:04:14.370 --> 02:04:15.203
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's</v>

3087
02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:20.550
<v Speaker 3>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a horrible joke because he's</v>

3088
02:04:20.551 --> 02:04:21.070
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

3089

<v Speaker 2>that's an esophageal style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guillotine choke because he's.</v>

3090
02:04:24.970 --> 02:04:29.200
<v Speaker 2>He's using the bone of the forearm</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the front of your neck.</v>

3091
02:04:29.201 --> 02:04:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the worst.</v>

3092
02:04:30.690 --> 02:04:33.040
<v Speaker 2>That's the most painful of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guillotine.</v>

3093
02:04:33.041 --> 02:04:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Chokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3094
02:04:33.941 --> 02:04:34.980
<v Speaker 2>He did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3095
02:04:35.410 --> 02:04:36.211
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kick,</v>

3096
02:04:36.211 --> 02:04:38.760

<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

3097
02:04:38.761 --> 02:04:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to go to the bathroom.</v>

3098
02:04:41.010 --> 02:04:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was gonna vomit.</v>

3099
02:04:42.510 --> 02:04:45.690
<v Speaker 2>I had to go to the bathroom and splash</v>
<v Speaker 2>water on myself like that.</v>

3100
02:04:45.691 --> 02:04:47.150
<v Speaker 2>I literally had to put one on my face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3101
02:04:47.151 --> 02:04:50.130
<v Speaker 2>I might pass out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was because my body had not been.</v>

3102
02:04:50.330 --> 02:04:53.310
<v Speaker 2>It was like a shock to the system and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't felt that before.</v>

3103
02:04:53.311 --> 02:04:58.311
<v Speaker 2>Were your nerves to like slams into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat of your or your thigh and all those</v>

3104
02:04:58.951 --> 02:05:02.190
<v Speaker 2>nerves that run down the side of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>leg are all impacted and your whole</v>

3105
02:05:02.191 --> 02:05:03.990
<v Speaker 2>system just gets jacked dude.</v>

3106
02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:08.340
<v Speaker 2>But then you watch someone like Edson</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barboza kicking people like that lot and</v>

3107
02:05:08.341 --> 02:05:09.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a guy.</v>

3108
02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:11.550
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy standing there who knows</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is coming,</v>

3109
02:05:12.150 --> 02:05:13.830
<v Speaker 2>takes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he continued.</v>

3110
02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a different thing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so pumped up with adrenaline.</v>

3111
02:05:16.741 --> 02:05:18.750
<v Speaker 2>You're in the middle of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean those guys are in agony</v>

3112
02:05:18.751 --> 02:05:20.580
<v Speaker 2>afterwards though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure they're walking out of there</v>

3113
02:05:20.581 --> 02:05:21.690
<v Speaker 2>and deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

3114
02:05:21.691 --> 02:05:23.940
<v Speaker 2>deep pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to have felt any remote,</v>

3115
02:05:23.941 --> 02:05:27.720
<v Speaker 2>even if it's a 10 percent to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>felt that at all and then know that</v>

3116
02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:28.920
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's doing that,</v>

3117
02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:32.430
<v Speaker 2>because he wants to fucking put you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing 100 percent.</v>

3118
02:05:32.490 --> 02:05:34.320
<v Speaker 2>You know what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should do it for your show.</v>

3119

3181
02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:56.440
<v Speaker 2>I'll be on the air by [inaudible] till</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven and then I'll go fucking do spots</v>

3182
02:07:56.441 --> 02:07:59.630
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm up all night on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer like I'm up to no good that</v>

3183
02:07:59.780 --> 02:08:01.450
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3184
02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Because you can't go and take Jujitsu at</v>
<v Speaker 2>1:30 in the morning.</v>

3185
02:08:04.450 --> 02:08:06.520
<v Speaker 2>If that was an option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

3186
02:08:06.521 --> 02:08:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Afternoons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like there would be a place</v>

3187
02:08:09.611 --> 02:08:13.690
<v Speaker 2>where you could do Jujitsu in the 1:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the afternoon or 1:00 in the morning.</v>

3188
02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Once I'm up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got to go like Monday.</v>

3189
02:08:16.061 --> 02:08:17.110

<v Speaker 2>And I'm home by like three or 3:30 in</v>

3192
02:08:22.571 --> 02:08:24.130

<v Speaker 2>so I feel like I get a lot done.</v>

3193
02:08:24.180 --> 02:08:27.250
<v Speaker 2>And do you go out that night and do</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup on Monday?</v>

3194
02:08:27.250 --> 02:08:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I'll do two sets because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular set at the cellar and around the</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

3204
02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:45.850
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3205
02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:47.770
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shot in December,</v>

3206
02:08:48.010 --> 02:08:51.730
<v Speaker 2>so I've been since December working on</v>
<v Speaker 2>material just to get it sooner.</v>

3207
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Like loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a new 35,</v>

3208
02:08:53.170 --> 02:08:54.280
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3209
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.930
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3210
02:08:54.930 --> 02:08:56.800
<v Speaker 2>I just drop it as soon as I'm done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shoot.</v>

3211
02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Just think of it right by that point</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like enough.</v>

3212
02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:05.550
<v Speaker 2>Jerry Seinfeld did the Improv the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and did 20 year old jokes did he</v>

3213
02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:07.900
<v Speaker 2>did a set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did a couple of new bits and then he did</v>

3214
02:09:07.901 --> 02:09:11.020
<v Speaker 2>jokes from like 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really in a couple of my friends were in</v>

3215
02:09:11.021 --> 02:09:14.710
<v Speaker 2>the audience know like what is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why is he doing these jokes that</v>

3216
02:09:14.711 --> 02:09:18.310
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows and I guess in his eyes</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like classic songs.</v>

3217
02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like you go to see the Beatles,</v>

3218
02:09:20.021 --> 02:09:21.070
<v Speaker 2>you want to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to say.</v>

3219
02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:23.450
<v Speaker 2>The Beatles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all picking on another,</v>

3220
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:25.710
<v Speaker 2>a better lender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scattered a guns and roses.</v>

3221
02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:30.280
<v Speaker 2>If you go to see a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3222
02:09:30.281 --> 02:09:31.420
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever the fuck it is,</v>

3223
02:09:31.421 --> 02:09:32.790
<v Speaker 2>you expect to hear the classics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

3224
02:09:32.791 --> 02:09:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's different when you're a guy</v>

3225
02:09:34.661 --> 02:09:36.890
<v Speaker 2>from a different era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's from a different era than we are</v>

3226
02:09:37.050 --> 02:09:38.920
<v Speaker 2>hopeless songs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't have to catch you off guard jokes</v>

3227
02:09:38.921 --> 02:09:40.360
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why jokes don't work forever</v>

3228
02:09:40.990 --> 02:09:43.210
<v Speaker 2>because the song you're here and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>become familiar with and you learn the</v>

3229
02:09:43.211 --> 02:09:44.030
<v Speaker 2>lyrics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3230
02:09:44.030 --> 02:09:45.610
<v Speaker 2>and you like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You like it more.</v>

3231
02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:47.110
<v Speaker 2>You want to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean songs.</v>

3232
02:09:47.111 --> 02:09:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Repeat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug Stanhope was a great bit about</v>

3233
02:09:49.451 --> 02:09:52.090
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a great bit about songs being</v>

3234
02:09:52.150 --> 02:09:54.920
<v Speaker 2>fucking lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really funny to hear it.</v>

3235
02:09:55.630 --> 02:09:58.420
<v Speaker 2>He says like the same punchline over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again,</v>

3236
02:09:58.421 --> 02:10:01.270
<v Speaker 2>and then he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to give away the actual way</v>

3237
02:10:01.271 --> 02:10:02.500
<v Speaker 2>sets up the bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's funny.</v>

3238
02:10:02.530 --> 02:10:04.420
<v Speaker 2>That's very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's true.</v>

3239
02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But some,</v>

3240
02:10:05.830 --> 02:10:08.110
<v Speaker 2>some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to let go of that shit.</v>

3241
02:10:08.290 --> 02:10:09.850
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to let go of that old</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

3242
02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:10.793
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3243
02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:13.360
<v Speaker 2>they feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well jerry was always said that and I</v>

3244
02:10:13.361 --> 02:10:14.750
<v Speaker 2>don't know him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

3245
02:10:14.751 --> 02:10:15.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I know him,</v>

3246
02:10:15.941 --> 02:10:18.250
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said like that he thinks that the</v>

3247
02:10:18.490 --> 02:10:20.680
<v Speaker 2>people come for the act and not the</v>
<v Speaker 2>performer.</v>

3248
02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:23.050
<v Speaker 2>And maybe at one point they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to see your act.</v>

3249
02:10:23.051 --> 02:10:26.260
<v Speaker 2>I think lentil feels that way too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come to see the jokes in a way</v>

3250
02:10:26.261 --> 02:10:28.210
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also think that once they know</v>

3251
02:10:28.211 --> 02:10:30.370
<v Speaker 2>your jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want new jokes from the personality</v>

3252
02:10:30.371 --> 02:10:31.240
<v Speaker 2>they like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3253
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Seinfeld did that I'm telling you</v>

3254
02:10:33.861 --> 02:10:37.280
<v Speaker 2>for the last time we did a whole hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>special of old jokes.</v>

3255
02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:38.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That he was done with.</v>

3256
02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was like,</v>

3257
02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:40.450
<v Speaker 2>those are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

3258
02:10:40.450 --> 02:10:42.830
<v Speaker 2>there were again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were 20 year old bits and I don't</v>

3259
02:10:42.831 --> 02:10:44.330
<v Speaker 2>think that special was well received.</v>

3260
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:45.020
<v Speaker 2>I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3261
02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:46.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I saw it but don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

3262
02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I understand why you'd want to do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you'll make some money,</v>

3263
02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:52.430
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't feel good to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he has what I seem to new shit.</v>

3264
02:10:52.431 --> 02:10:55.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's new stuff kills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was doing when he goes out and just</v>

3265
02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:59.690
<v Speaker 2>start to work on things like he sees a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking really good comment.</v>

3266
02:10:59.691 --> 02:11:01.550
<v Speaker 2>He's a great comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about it.</v>

3267
02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:05.120
<v Speaker 2>But I think his idea is different than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the current guys and maybe</v>

3268
02:11:05.121 --> 02:11:09.260
<v Speaker 2>in a bit he's resisting this new trend</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the trend that everybody does.</v>

3269
02:11:09.261 --> 02:11:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Well it's burr or ck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you?</v>

3270
02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:14.750
<v Speaker 2>Everybody releases a special and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>abandoned the material.</v>

3271
02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:16.040
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It already does it?</v>

3272
02:11:16.370 --> 02:11:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Everybody I know does it and there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's a few guys that just don't</v>

3273
02:11:19.731 --> 02:11:21.650
<v Speaker 2>really specials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't.</v>

3274
02:11:21.710 --> 02:11:25.720
<v Speaker 2>And they have like really old material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know a few guys that are like</v>

3275
02:11:25.730 --> 02:11:29.450
<v Speaker 2>really good comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they just don't put out specials</v>

3276
02:11:29.810 --> 02:11:32.450
<v Speaker 2>because they want to keep doing the act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't want to be.</v>

3277
02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:36.560
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to be committed also to</v>
<v Speaker 2>to recording like that.</v>

3278
02:11:36.561 --> 02:11:39.470
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of pressure to bat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything down and tightened it up and</v>

3279
02:11:39.471 --> 02:11:41.750
<v Speaker 2>then get ready to release it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ready,</v>

3280
02:11:41.751 --> 02:11:42.710
<v Speaker 2>press,</v>

3282
02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:48.700
<v Speaker 2>a lot of pressure in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love doing it until I'm like,</v>

3283
02:11:48.710 --> 02:11:49.910
<v Speaker 2>amy did it weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She did.</v>

3284
02:11:49.970 --> 02:11:54.080
<v Speaker 2>She did her special and then she toured</v>
<v Speaker 2>until the special aired so now she has</v>

3285
02:11:54.081 --> 02:11:56.270
<v Speaker 2>to start over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for me I will as soon as it was shot</v>

3286
02:11:56.271 --> 02:11:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I wanted it done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by the time it airs or some like I</v>

3287
02:11:58.941 --> 02:11:59.370
<v Speaker 2>got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

3288
02:11:59.370 --> 02:12:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't wait to not say those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and couldn't fucking wave.</v>

3289
02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:04.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>One of the finished.</v>

3291
02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's got their own way of doing</v>

3292
02:12:07.791 --> 02:12:08.390
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3293
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:11.000
<v Speaker 2>But I think the point is that in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>day and age,</v>

3294
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:13.940
<v Speaker 2>the public demands content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

3295
02:12:14.300 --> 02:12:16.670
<v Speaker 2>you'll have to put it out and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting out a lot of content anyway</v>

3296
02:12:16.671 --> 02:12:18.740
<v Speaker 2>because you have your radio show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have your podcast,</v>

3297
02:12:19.110 --> 02:12:20.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember you used to write a lot of</v>

3298
02:12:20.391 --> 02:12:23.840
<v Speaker 2>blogs and you used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're used to be pretty prolific with</v>

3299
02:12:23.841 --> 02:12:26.000
<v Speaker 2>blogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was because we were off the radio</v>

3300
02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:29.690
<v Speaker 2>and I was blogging a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these sex that actually became happy</v>

3301
02:12:29.691 --> 02:12:30.590
<v Speaker 2>endings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first book,</v>

3302
02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:34.400
<v Speaker 2>it was all these blogs I wrote about</v>
<v Speaker 2>things I was doing and I had nowhere I</v>

3303
02:12:34.401 --> 02:12:36.560
<v Speaker 2>started writing again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reach that really want to do another</v>

3304
02:12:36.561 --> 02:12:39.680
<v Speaker 2>book on my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sexual experience with this girl.</v>

3305
02:12:39.890 --> 02:12:42.140
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had to write after it because it</v>

3306
02:12:42.141 --> 02:12:44.180
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really weird and intimate and</v>

3307
02:12:44.181 --> 02:12:45.014
<v Speaker 2>sexy.</v>

3308
02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:47.990
<v Speaker 2>And yet what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just felt connected.</v>

3309
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I felt really connected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no drugs.</v>

3310
02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:51.133
<v Speaker 2>And then she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3311
02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:53.690
<v Speaker 2>no drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she texted me from the elevator</v>

3312
02:12:54.170 --> 02:12:55.360
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which one is the,</v>

3313
02:12:55.361 --> 02:12:56.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which one is the lobby?</v>

3314
02:12:57.770 --> 02:13:02.770
<v Speaker 2>And I realized what a dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had the l one that says,</v>

3315
02:13:03.531 --> 02:13:04.060
<v Speaker 2>Al,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3316
02:13:04.060 --> 02:13:05.480
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not kidding you.</v>

3317
02:13:05.481 --> 02:13:08.770
<v Speaker 2>That she asked which one was the lobby</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she wasn't Jonathan Mistake,</v>

3318
02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:11.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had to write,</v>

3319
02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:13.130
<v Speaker 2>I had to write it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3320
02:13:13.131 --> 02:13:15.290
<v Speaker 2>it was so because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good at going back and grabbing</v>

3321
02:13:15.291 --> 02:13:16.124
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3322
02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:18.290
<v Speaker 2>and maybe that's the radio training</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're just alive.</v>

3323
02:13:18.291 --> 02:13:19.124
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking,</v>

3324
02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:21.920
<v Speaker 2>but I had to do it in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just write it like I'm good at writing</v>

3325
02:13:21.921 --> 02:13:23.690
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not good at going back and go,</v>

3326
02:13:23.691 --> 02:13:25.400
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two years ago when this happened and</v>

3327
02:13:25.670 --> 02:13:26.780
<v Speaker 2>people aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be nothing to show.</v>

3328
02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:27.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good at going back and writing</v>

3329
02:13:28.020 --> 02:13:29.960
<v Speaker 2>all that shit because the emotion for it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is past.</v>

3330
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever try those transcription</v>
<v Speaker 2>software programs where you talk and it</v>

3331
02:13:34.141 --> 02:13:36.880
<v Speaker 2>just records what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have another follow up series,</v>

3332
02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:40.500
<v Speaker 2>but I do use that a lot when I used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>write for time once in awhile and I</v>

3333
02:13:40.501 --> 02:13:43.290
<v Speaker 2>would just talk out the whole fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>article because I'm not good at starting</v>

3334
02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:46.980
<v Speaker 2>up a lot about and all of a sudden I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>good at organizing and editing,</v>

3335
02:13:47.370 --> 02:13:50.050
<v Speaker 2>but I yapped it out already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will be running for Time magazine and</v>

3336
02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:51.490
<v Speaker 2>David asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

3337
02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:54.150
<v Speaker 2>they would ask me to write about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first article I wrote.</v>

3338
02:13:54.151 --> 02:13:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I wish I didn't write actually about</v>
<v Speaker 2>prostitution.</v>

3339
02:13:58.500 --> 02:14:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Why do you wish you didn't write it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I.</v>

3340
02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:04.230
<v Speaker 2>There's certain things I said it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wished I had said it smarter.</v>

3341
02:14:04.530 --> 02:14:07.320
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had been clearer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about how John shouldn't</v>

3342
02:14:07.321 --> 02:14:09.030
<v Speaker 2>be embarrassed and in a way I agree with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3343
02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:12.690
<v Speaker 2>but there was certain things that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sex industry who had been victims</v>

3344
02:14:12.691 --> 02:14:15.900
<v Speaker 2>of trafficking and stuff like I should</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably address that better.</v>

3345
02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:18.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a big difference between</v>

3346
02:14:18.121 --> 02:14:23.121
<v Speaker 2>trafficking and a woman who just decides</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have sex with guys for money.</v>

3347
02:14:23.670 --> 02:14:26.070
<v Speaker 2>And there are a lot of those women and</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminists don't want to admit those</v>

3348
02:14:26.071 --> 02:14:28.740
<v Speaker 2>women exist because they still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for them,</v>

3349
02:14:28.741 --> 02:14:32.520
<v Speaker 2>they'll push up the trafficking numbers</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a stronger argument against</v>

3350
02:14:32.521 --> 02:14:34.410
<v Speaker 2>prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I get it.</v>

3351
02:14:34.411 --> 02:14:37.200
<v Speaker 2>The traffickers should be executed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>saved the people who are being</v>

3352
02:14:37.201 --> 02:14:39.840
<v Speaker 2>trafficked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if someone makes a decision and they</v>

3353
02:14:39.841 --> 02:14:42.150
<v Speaker 2>just want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's one friend of mine who's an</v>

3354
02:14:42.151 --> 02:14:45.360
<v Speaker 2>artist and she's a feminist and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually pretty successful and she's</v>

3355
02:14:45.361 --> 02:14:48.390
<v Speaker 2>actually talked pretty openly about when</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was younger,</v>

3356
02:14:48.391 --> 02:14:53.391
<v Speaker 2>she would do stuff like that where she</v>
<v Speaker 2>would fuck older rich guys for money.</v>

3357
02:14:53.970 --> 02:14:55.470
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with it.</v>

3358
02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Like I chose to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it because it was a great way for</v>

3359
02:14:58.561 --> 02:15:00.330
<v Speaker 2>me to pay my bills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy.</v>

3360
02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:01.980
<v Speaker 2>These are guides I chose to have sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

3361
02:15:02.010 --> 02:15:03.960
<v Speaker 2>They were nice guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd fuck them.</v>

3362
02:15:04.050 --> 02:15:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I'd take the money and she'd make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3363
02:15:05.881 --> 02:15:08.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the pay a thousand bucks,</v>

3364
02:15:08.311 --> 02:15:11.190
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she could get that in a couple of</v>

3365
02:15:11.191 --> 02:15:13.890
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're rather than working for an entire</v>

3366
02:15:13.891 --> 02:15:18.891
<v Speaker 2>week for probably more than we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same group of people that</v>

3367
02:15:19.051 --> 02:15:22.650
<v Speaker 2>are saying you shouldn't be ashamed of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex and keep your laws off my body are</v>

3368
02:15:22.651 --> 02:15:24.510
<v Speaker 2>the same ones as saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're getting paid for what,</v>

3369
02:15:24.511 --> 02:15:26.130
<v Speaker 2>you should be ashamed of it and I should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to lead.</v>

3370
02:15:26.220 --> 02:15:27.450
<v Speaker 2>It's so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's silly.</v>

3371
02:15:27.451 --> 02:15:31.170
<v Speaker 2>It's all silly because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should you be ashamed if you massage</v>

3372
02:15:31.171 --> 02:15:33.030
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you give him a back rub.</v>

3373
02:15:33.530 --> 02:15:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a shameful?</v>

3374
02:15:34.771 --> 02:15:36.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very respected thing.</v>

3375
02:15:36.421 --> 02:15:38.040
<v Speaker 2>If someone tells you their massage</v>
<v Speaker 2>therapist,</v>

3376
02:15:38.340 --> 02:15:39.570
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making people feel good,</v>

3377
02:15:39.810 --> 02:15:41.940
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just rub dicks and really good at</v>

3378
02:15:41.941 --> 02:15:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Robin Dicks and guys like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well they.</v>

3379
02:15:44.230 --> 02:15:46.890
<v Speaker 2>They probably feel real good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now when it comes to pleasure,</v>

3380
02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:50.160
<v Speaker 2>we don't allow pleasure in the genital</v>
<v Speaker 2>area that were like,</v>

3381
02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:52.390
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the dirty naughty prep.</v>

3382
02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Why I don't go to like is Asian massage</v>
<v Speaker 2>places don't do that.</v>

3383
02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:58.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're rushing because they feel like</v>

3384
02:15:58.290 --> 02:16:01.740
<v Speaker 2>those to me are more sex slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I don't like.</v>

3385
02:16:01.741 --> 02:16:02.461
<v Speaker 2>The energy there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3386
02:16:02.461 --> 02:16:06.420
<v Speaker 2>I've very rarely gone and I've got maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>two in my life in those places and I</v>

3387
02:16:06.421 --> 02:16:11.160
<v Speaker 2>don't go ever go to massage places</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I live an ethical pervert.</v>

3388
02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:14.790
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I like to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know that there are certain women</v>

3389
02:16:14.791 --> 02:16:17.100
<v Speaker 2>that do it because I've had a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>women I dated,</v>

3390
02:16:17.310 --> 02:16:21.600
<v Speaker 2>legitimately dated</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wound up doing stuff like that for</v>

3391
02:16:21.601 --> 02:16:24.070
<v Speaker 2>money after that they told me about</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3392
02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:26.790
<v Speaker 2>like really and had never done my</v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic with them,</v>

3393
02:16:26.791 --> 02:16:29.250
<v Speaker 2>so I know for 100 percent fact they</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't being pimped at forest.</v>

3394
02:16:29.250 --> 02:16:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I know they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like a massage place where I</v>

3395
02:16:33.401 --> 02:16:36.370
<v Speaker 2>think somebody has to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't again,</v>

3396
02:16:36.371 --> 02:16:38.680
<v Speaker 2>that's just sad to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're rushing place where I think</v>

3397
02:16:38.681 --> 02:16:40.340
<v Speaker 2>that they're being brought over for</v>
<v Speaker 2>these reasons,</v>

3398
02:16:40.650 --> 02:16:45.650
<v Speaker 2>like talking to a girl and I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>contacted with social media all the time</v>

3399
02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:46.960
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

3400
02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:49.150
<v Speaker 2>if I've talked to her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found out she's rushing and I'm not to</v>

3401
02:16:49.151 --> 02:16:50.350
<v Speaker 2>be raised in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ngos are hot,</v>

3402
02:16:51.130 --> 02:16:53.770
<v Speaker 2>but I start to doubt what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3403
02:16:53.940 --> 02:16:57.700
<v Speaker 2>like I talked to one girl off a website</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wasn't game right away.</v>

3404
02:16:58.030 --> 02:16:59.230
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she got a little weird.</v>

3405
02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:00.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you being forced to do this?</v>

3406
02:17:00.910 --> 02:17:01.601
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

3407
02:17:01.601 --> 02:17:02.411
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk to you later.</v>

3408
02:17:02.411 --> 02:17:03.730
<v Speaker 2>We just never spoke again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like it was just</v>

3409
02:17:03.930 --> 02:17:05.430
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it</v>

3410
02:17:05.430 --> 02:17:07.710
<v Speaker 2>wasn't something she was setting you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3411
02:17:07.711 --> 02:17:10.410
<v Speaker 2>It's just not a sexy energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not even sent me up,</v>

3412
02:17:10.411 --> 02:17:12.660
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it's just somebody was doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it so she had to pay back something.</v>

3413
02:17:12.661 --> 02:17:14.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a sexual energy.</v>

3414
02:17:14.641 --> 02:17:15.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a sad energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3415
02:17:16.090 --> 02:17:17.670
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

3416
02:17:17.671 --> 02:17:20.000
<v Speaker 2>So you definitely clearly differentiate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3417
02:17:20.001 --> 02:17:22.200
<v Speaker 2>You're unethical pervert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong with that.</v>

3418
02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3419
02:17:23.570 --> 02:17:24.460
<v Speaker 2>you're a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3420
02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:26.240
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the idea of I,</v>

3421
02:17:26.300 --> 02:17:27.880
<v Speaker 2>but I think everybody should look at it</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>

3422
02:17:27.881 --> 02:17:29.940
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people get married just for money.</v>

3423
02:17:30.180 --> 02:17:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Like how many married?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3424
02:17:32.220 --> 02:17:34.230
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you just a hooker with one client?</v>

3425
02:17:34.290 --> 02:17:35.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what you are?</v>

3426
02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3427
02:17:36.061 --> 02:17:38.670
<v Speaker 2>I met this woman the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like 40 years old.</v>

3428
02:17:38.671 --> 02:17:42.960
<v Speaker 2>Hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her husband looks like he's about 70.</v>

3429
02:17:43.230 --> 02:17:45.350
<v Speaker 2>He's got terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Posture is leaning over.</v>

3430
02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:48.540
<v Speaker 2>He stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stepped out of a fucking bad ass Bentley</v>

3431
02:17:48.541 --> 02:17:50.940
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the fuck it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some beautiful car.</v>

3432
02:17:50.941 --> 02:17:51.691
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3433
02:17:51.691 --> 02:17:52.740
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what's going on there.</v>

3434
02:17:52.741 --> 02:17:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no worries.</v>

3435
02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:55.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe you have the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality ever,</v>

3436
02:17:56.130 --> 02:17:58.410
<v Speaker 2>but the dude looked like it was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>falling asleep while he's walking.</v>

3437
02:17:58.530 --> 02:17:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what that's about.</v>

3438
02:17:59.881 --> 02:18:04.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a real rich older guy who got some</v>
<v Speaker 2>hot piece of ass who is younger than him</v>

3439
02:18:04.591 --> 02:18:07.800
<v Speaker 2>by like at least 30 years and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>both getting what they want.</v>

3440
02:18:08.250 --> 02:18:11.220
<v Speaker 2>She wants a guy who maybe talk to her</v>
<v Speaker 2>nicely and it isn't some young guy</v>

3441
02:18:11.221 --> 02:18:14.310
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking acting like an asshole</v>
<v Speaker 2>who can take care of her.</v>

3442
02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:16.310
<v Speaker 2>He wants to young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful like it.</v>

3443
02:18:16.350 --> 02:18:17.970
<v Speaker 2>As long as you both honest and</v>
<v Speaker 2>respectful,</v>

3444
02:18:17.971 --> 02:18:20.090
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a form of prostitution.</v>

3445
02:18:20.090 --> 02:18:20.911
<v Speaker 2>Shirt is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

3446
02:18:20.911 --> 02:18:23.120
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of marriages are form of</v>

3447
02:18:23.121 --> 02:18:25.560
<v Speaker 2>prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People just don't want to admit it</v>

3448
02:18:25.590 --> 02:18:27.270
<v Speaker 2>because they think the prostitution is</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

3449
02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Sex for money is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like there's a lot of people that</v>

3450
02:18:30.511 --> 02:18:34.110
<v Speaker 2>are engaged in some sexual relations</v>
<v Speaker 2>with people that are only doing it for</v>

3451
02:18:34.111 --> 02:18:35.800
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many women try to me,</v>

3452
02:18:36.030 --> 02:18:37.950
<v Speaker 2>let me try to trap basketball players.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3453
02:18:38.290 --> 02:18:40.380
<v Speaker 2>So your prostate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you try to trap a ballplayer and get</v>

3454
02:18:40.381 --> 02:18:41.700
<v Speaker 2>pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want the money.</v>

3455
02:18:41.730 --> 02:18:43.030
<v Speaker 2>That's prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3456
02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:44.700
<v Speaker 2>it's a payday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want a kid.</v>

3457
02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:46.660
<v Speaker 2>They want some Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

3458
02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I want some cash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a package deal.</v>

3459
02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful package deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3460
02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:52.530
<v Speaker 2>you can't get a better package to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked up by an NBA guy.</v>

3461
02:18:52.531 --> 02:18:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean Jesus Christ who wouldn't take a</v>
<v Speaker 2>load for Lebron,</v>

3462
02:18:55.640 --> 02:18:57.330
<v Speaker 2>going to ask him to put a bag on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

3463
02:18:57.331 --> 02:18:59.940
<v Speaker 2>If you do a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3464
02:19:00.380 --> 02:19:02.700
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's nothing you can sign where</v>

3465
02:19:02.701 --> 02:19:04.200
<v Speaker 2>if you have a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he won't get money.</v>

3466
02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:06.630
<v Speaker 2>Can't sign away that kids write to his</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

3467
02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:08.730
<v Speaker 2>As soon as they came out with genetic</v>
<v Speaker 2>testing,</v>

3468
02:19:09.090 --> 02:19:11.210
<v Speaker 2>boy that changed the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3469
02:19:11.630 --> 02:19:15.450
<v Speaker 2>no one's denying change the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta tell me fucking ty cobb didn't</v>

3470
02:19:15.451 --> 02:19:19.050
<v Speaker 2>lie about a few of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you know a ted Williams doesn't</v>

3471
02:19:19.051 --> 02:19:22.350
<v Speaker 2>even look like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good point to those guys.</v>

3472
02:19:22.351 --> 02:19:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Probably dump loads and the gals all</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the country.</v>

3473
02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:25.361
<v Speaker 2>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>

3474
02:19:25.361 --> 02:19:26.670
<v Speaker 2>What are you going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to find out?</v>

3475
02:19:26.910 --> 02:19:29.480
<v Speaker 2>How would you find out who she going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you?</v>

3476
02:19:30.130 --> 02:19:31.940
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fuck ty cobb and for somebody.</v>

3477
02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:34.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a different game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3478
02:19:34.130 --> 02:19:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Babe Ruth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fat face,</v>

3479
02:19:35.571 --> 02:19:37.720
<v Speaker 2>a little babies running around there</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably are a</v>

3480
02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:43.780
<v Speaker 2>little babe ruth legs moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny when you look back at Babe</v>

3481
02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Ruth at bobby that he had so ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 2>as fat,</v>

3482
02:19:46.401 --> 02:19:47.181
<v Speaker 2>Gut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>

3483
02:19:47.181 --> 02:19:48.560
<v Speaker 2>gut and eating hot dogs.</v>

3484
02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Drinking beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good picture though.</v>

3485
02:19:50.170 --> 02:19:51.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a deauville,</v>

3486
02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:55.430
<v Speaker 2>multifaceted player and I love the quote</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Cobb and it ran pretty well for fat</v>

3487
02:19:55.431 --> 02:19:57.030
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the only thing you can say</v>

3488
02:19:57.050 --> 02:19:59.780
<v Speaker 2>about Babe Ruth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ty cobb is one of the most underrated</v>

3489
02:19:59.781 --> 02:20:02.720
<v Speaker 2>films ever by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with fucking Robert Wool and uh,</v>

3490
02:20:02.721 --> 02:20:05.590
<v Speaker 2>and Tommy Lee Jones is ty cobb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3491
02:20:05.650 --> 02:20:08.420
<v Speaker 2>that's good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably secretly fairly accurate.</v>

3492
02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:09.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3493
02:20:10.030 --> 02:20:12.020
<v Speaker 2>you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of athletes are,</v>

3494
02:20:12.310 --> 02:20:16.070
<v Speaker 2>and especially back then was really very</v>
<v Speaker 2>few repercussions for being a piece</v>

3495
02:20:16.071 --> 02:20:17.130
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3496
02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:19.550
<v Speaker 2>It really wouldn't get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I won't say the quote,</v>

3497
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:23.690
<v Speaker 2>but it's got arguably the best quote in</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie history,</v>

3498
02:20:23.691 --> 02:20:25.970
<v Speaker 2>which I'll tell you after you tell me</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

3499
02:20:26.060 --> 02:20:28.940
<v Speaker 2>It's just really vicious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist and I just don't want to deal</v>

3500
02:20:28.941 --> 02:20:30.020
<v Speaker 2>with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the one.</v>

3501
02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're talking about my favorite</v>

3502
02:20:33.171 --> 02:20:34.004
<v Speaker 2>quote ever.</v>

3503
02:20:34.460 --> 02:20:36.130
<v Speaker 2>There's no way to squeeze it into</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

3504
02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:40.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's a funny a budget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a funny fucking thing.</v>

3505
02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:43.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think about athletes and how</v>

3506
02:20:43.671 --> 02:20:46.460
<v Speaker 2>competitive they have to be in how</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruthless you have to be,</v>

3507
02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:48.980
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that sort of bleeds out into</v>

3508
02:20:48.981 --> 02:20:50.360
<v Speaker 2>the rest of their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3509
02:20:50.361 --> 02:20:53.630
<v Speaker 2>and it bleeds out into the way they deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a fellow players,</v>

3510
02:20:53.631 --> 02:20:56.810
<v Speaker 2>the way they deal with women that deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>with managers or anybody.</v>

3511
02:20:57.600 --> 02:21:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's athletic athletics is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruthless,</v>

3512
02:21:01.581 --> 02:21:03.410
<v Speaker 2>ruthless pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

3513
02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:04.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just is.</v>

3514
02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Have you tasted on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3515
02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd be great.</v>

3516
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:08.660
<v Speaker 2>I would love to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had him on your show,</v>

3517
02:21:08.661 --> 02:21:09.141
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Launch.</v>

3518
02:21:09.141 --> 02:21:10.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure he would do this if he was</v>

3519
02:21:10.521 --> 02:21:11.420
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would love you.</v>

3520
02:21:11.421 --> 02:21:12.201
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love you.</v>

3521
02:21:12.201 --> 02:21:12.860
<v Speaker 2>He loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have.</v>

3522
02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:14.890
<v Speaker 2>Say when I first met with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

3523
02:21:18.030 --> 02:21:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

3524
02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:22.650
<v Speaker 2>he's awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a great athlete and just,</v>

3525
02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:26.330
<v Speaker 2>he's like kind of the personification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything you can go right and</v>

3526
02:21:26.331 --> 02:21:29.150
<v Speaker 2>everything that can go wrong and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance out at the end.</v>

3527
02:21:29.151 --> 02:21:32.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean he sort of achieve homeostasis at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of his life or it's at the end</v>

3528
02:21:32.920 --> 02:21:36.500
<v Speaker 2>like balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's at 50 years old,</v>

3529
02:21:36.501 --> 02:21:40.580
<v Speaker 2>he's got family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got this great new career where</v>

3530
02:21:40.581 --> 02:21:43.940
<v Speaker 2>he's does that one man show and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>hugely successful.</v>

3531
02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:47.090
<v Speaker 2>He loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a recent article in sports</v>

3532
02:21:47.091 --> 02:21:49.760
<v Speaker 2>illustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We was talking about doing that one man</v>

3533
02:21:49.761 --> 02:21:52.490
<v Speaker 2>show and how excited he gets to do and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how fun it is.</v>

3534
02:21:52.491 --> 02:21:55.100
<v Speaker 2>And he's amazing at it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3535
02:21:55.101 --> 02:21:57.980
<v Speaker 2>And then that documentary sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>revived him and then the one man show</v>

3536
02:21:57.981 --> 02:22:01.670
<v Speaker 2>came behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's like in this new stage in his</v>

3537
02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:05.570
<v Speaker 2>life where he's achieved this strange</v>
<v Speaker 2>new balance,</v>

3538
02:22:05.571 --> 02:22:06.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like foremen,</v>

3539
02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:09.080
<v Speaker 2>they always say foreman in when we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>kings,</v>

3540
02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:12.090
<v Speaker 2>it might have been a norman mailer who</v>
<v Speaker 2>said he was this.</v>

3541
02:22:12.580 --> 02:22:14.910
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was not a likable guy and he's.</v>

3542
02:22:14.930 --> 02:22:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Then he gets knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he comes back and he's a lovable grill</v>

3543
02:22:18.531 --> 02:22:19.910
<v Speaker 2>salesman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funny Dude,</v>

3544
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:22.460
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite clips ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just him on the tonight show.</v>

3545
02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:26.040
<v Speaker 2>There's a clip of him talking to Johnny</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carson in 1990 before he fought</v>

3546
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Alex Stewart and take a minute and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>

3547
02:22:28.060 --> 02:22:31.680
<v Speaker 1>It's just a funny like what a lovable</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun guy.</v>

3548
02:22:31.950 --> 02:22:33.840
<v Speaker 1>He was a different guy when he came back</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3549
02:22:33.841 --> 02:22:37.230
<v Speaker 1>He became a preacher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ballooned up to well over 300 pounds.</v>

3550
02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:39.750
<v Speaker 1>And what's really interesting is he made</v>
<v Speaker 1>his comeback,</v>

3551
02:22:39.751 --> 02:22:43.770
<v Speaker 1>I want to say he was 36 years old and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody thought it was a joke.</v>

3552
02:22:43.771 --> 02:22:45.510
<v Speaker 1>He was hugely fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like way,</v>

3553
02:22:45.511 --> 02:22:47.190
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way overweight when he made his first</v>

3554
02:22:47.191 --> 02:22:49.320
<v Speaker 1>comeback fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember as a boxing fan I was</v>

3555
02:22:49.321 --> 02:22:49.681
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3556
02:22:49.681 --> 02:22:51.120
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look on them.</v>

3557
02:22:51.450 --> 02:22:56.450
<v Speaker 1>And then slowly but surely over time his</v>
<v Speaker 1>body trimmed down and he got more muscle</v>

3558
02:22:57.751 --> 02:23:00.510
<v Speaker 1>and less fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he knocked Gerry Cooney the</v>

3559
02:23:00.511 --> 02:23:01.980
<v Speaker 1>fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he did that,</v>

3560
02:23:01.981 --> 02:23:03.630
<v Speaker 1>everybody went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

3561
02:23:03.631 --> 02:23:06.030
<v Speaker 1>He is for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is crazy.</v>

3562
02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Like George Foreman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only is he for real,</v>

3563
02:23:08.970 --> 02:23:12.530
<v Speaker 1>he might be a better fighter than he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was young and he fought.</v>

3564
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I remember when he fought Evander</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holyfield and he lost.</v>

3565
02:23:14.911 --> 02:23:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I think he lost a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3566
02:23:16.121 --> 02:23:18.540
<v Speaker 1>you did it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did and I love at the end he said</v>

3567
02:23:18.541 --> 02:23:21.030
<v Speaker 1>something about this is for people over</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 hip,</v>

3568
02:23:21.031 --> 02:23:22.230
<v Speaker 1>hip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hooray.</v>

3569
02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:26.310
<v Speaker 1>That was such a great quote by will have</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to lose the like what a victory</v>

3570
02:23:26.311 --> 02:23:27.830
<v Speaker 1>it was for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for age.</v>

3571
02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:30.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really knocked out Michael</v>

3572
02:23:30.450 --> 02:23:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Moore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say he was 46 years old and</v>

3573
02:23:33.031 --> 02:23:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Michael Maura was beating him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>winning and he hit him with a straight</v>

3574
02:23:36.001 --> 02:23:38.520
<v Speaker 1>right hand on the Chin and more just</v>
<v Speaker 1>flattened.</v>

3575
02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:40.350
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

3576
02:23:40.351 --> 02:23:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I think he was the oldest guy to ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>gained the heavyweight title at the</v>

3577
02:23:43.911 --> 02:23:44.880
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you feel the time?</v>

3578
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:46.230
<v Speaker 1>What did he beat them for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The title?</v>

3579
02:23:46.290 --> 02:23:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Think you'd beat Michael Moore for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>title.</v>

3580
02:23:48.150 --> 02:23:49.120
<v Speaker 1>He lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The holyfield.</v>

3581
02:23:49.170 --> 02:23:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Is that what?</v>

3582
02:23:49.480 --> 02:23:50.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think slept.</v>

3583
02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Having to pitch one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One more time.</v>

3584
02:23:52.831 --> 02:23:54.210
<v Speaker 1>We'll wrap this thing up when you come</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

3585
02:23:55.220 --> 02:23:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I think what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out how old George Foreman was when</v>

3586
02:23:59.821 --> 02:24:01.770
<v Speaker 1>he won the heavyweight title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's the thing.</v>

3587
02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they had human growth or</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they did have human growth hormone.</v>

3588
02:24:05.131 --> 02:24:08.700
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't really being used by boxers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they used to get human</v>

3589
02:24:08.730 --> 02:24:11.910
<v Speaker 1>growth hormone from the pituitary glands</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dead people.</v>

3590
02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:14.820
<v Speaker 1>He was 45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 when he won the title.</v>

3591
02:24:14.850 --> 02:24:18.780
<v Speaker 1>It'll be 26 year old Michael Moore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Moore was only 26 at the time.</v>

3592
02:24:19.050 --> 02:24:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Michael Moore was a murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>light heavyweight.</v>

3593
02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:23.430
<v Speaker 1>He was like one of the best light</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweights ever.</v>

3594
02:24:23.940 --> 02:24:26.220
<v Speaker 1>But light heavyweight was too hard for</v>
<v Speaker 1>him to make.</v>

3595
02:24:26.221 --> 02:24:31.221
<v Speaker 1>So we went up to heavyweight and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was when he won the title and then</v>

3596
02:24:31.351 --> 02:24:35.640
<v Speaker 1>who did he lose it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose it to Holyfield plus to Tommy,</v>

3597
02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Morrison to last a decision at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Marston was like Tommy Marson's</v>

3598
02:24:41.221 --> 02:24:42.650
<v Speaker 1>big biggest victory ever.</v>

3599
02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:47.180
<v Speaker 1>And that was like post a morrison was</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost,</v>

3600
02:24:47.181 --> 02:24:50.360
<v Speaker 1>was just before he beat Michael Moore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting.</v>

3601
02:24:50.710 --> 02:24:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Unless Shannon Briggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lost a decision to Shannon Briggs.</v>

3602
02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:55.311
<v Speaker 1>Shannon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cannon,</v>

3603
02:24:55.311 --> 02:24:56.760
<v Speaker 1>let's go champ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3604
02:24:57.290 --> 02:25:01.840
<v Speaker 1>and then I feel like the before to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shannon fight.</v>

3605
02:25:01.870 --> 02:25:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was before it as well.</v>

3606
02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:03.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it failed.</v>

3607
02:25:03.411 --> 02:25:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Last is 91.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrison was what is the,</v>

3608
02:25:08.030 --> 02:25:11.810
<v Speaker 1>what's the order of his fights?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had the holyfield loss,</v>

3609
02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:14.420
<v Speaker 1>the morrison loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then right afterwards he got shot at</v>

3610
02:25:14.421 --> 02:25:16.130
<v Speaker 1>the title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it says.</v>

3611
02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:18.020
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they give them a shot at the</v>

3612
02:25:18.021 --> 02:25:22.670
<v Speaker 1>title right away to Los Angeles for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vacant Wbo heavyweight title.</v>

3613
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Then he won the WBA Ibf and lineal</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight titles.</v>

3614
02:25:26.051 --> 02:25:31.051
<v Speaker 1>When he beat Michael Moore a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat him for the WBO title.</v>

3615
02:25:32.290 --> 02:25:34.870
<v Speaker 1>He lost that decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people thought that he should</v>

3616
02:25:34.871 --> 02:25:36.610
<v Speaker 1>have won the Shannon Briggs fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

3617
02:25:37.090 --> 02:25:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Was the Shannon breaks fighter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it the Morrison fight?</v>

3618
02:25:39.310 --> 02:25:40.690
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to go back and look at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

3619
02:25:40.691 --> 02:25:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe both of them were</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial,</v>

3620
02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:46.410
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Morrison or the more fun as is</v>

3621
02:25:46.411 --> 02:25:49.930
<v Speaker 1>undisputed decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a briggs was a mixed md.</v>

3622
02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Does that make decision or what does</v>
<v Speaker 1>that majority decision?</v>

3623
02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.100
<v Speaker 1>That was briggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3624
02:25:54.101 --> 02:25:56.660
<v Speaker 1>the breaks fight was the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was controversial when</v>

3625
02:25:56.740 --> 02:26:00.400
<v Speaker 1>shannon braDy against George Foreman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just going over the George Foreman</v>

3626
02:26:00.401 --> 02:26:01.900
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's wrap this up.</v>

3627
02:26:01.930 --> 02:26:02.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was fun,</v>

3628
02:26:02.621 --> 02:26:03.640
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always enjoy.</v>

3629
02:26:04.430 --> 02:26:06.160
<v Speaker 1>What are you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't asked you one prediction</v>

3630
02:26:06.161 --> 02:26:07.870
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Johnson against,</v>

3631
02:26:07.890 --> 02:26:09.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against columbia.</v>

3632
02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not have a prediction.</v>

3633
02:26:11.981 --> 02:26:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I never predict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that if it goes into the</v>

3634
02:26:15.071 --> 02:26:16.690
<v Speaker 1>third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth and fifth rounds,</v>

3635
02:26:16.691 --> 02:26:18.400
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna be really hard for rumbled a</v>
<v Speaker 1>win.</v>

3636
02:26:18.490 --> 02:26:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think rumbles chances of winning the</v>

3637
02:26:20.711 --> 02:26:21.600
<v Speaker 1>fight come early.</v>

3638
02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:24.280
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a goddamn short term hurricane that</v>

3639
02:26:24.281 --> 02:26:25.900
<v Speaker 1>rips the house right out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation.</v>

3640
02:26:25.930 --> 02:26:29.020
<v Speaker 1>He's not necessarily a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long storm.</v>

3641
02:26:29.940 --> 02:26:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I think what rumbled does is comes at</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fast and hard and he can go fast and</v>

3642
02:26:34.331 --> 02:26:37.270
<v Speaker 1>hard rather than anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just really hard for him to go with</v>

3643
02:26:37.271 --> 02:26:39.250
<v Speaker 1>that style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than three rounds.</v>

3644
02:26:39.700 --> 02:26:41.740
<v Speaker 1>The only time we've ever seen them do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>three rounds.</v>

3645
02:26:41.741 --> 02:26:45.280
<v Speaker 1>He beat phil davis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat the shit out of them for three</v>

3646
02:26:45.281 --> 02:26:48.460
<v Speaker 1>rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But phil davis wasn't threatening him.</v>

3647
02:26:48.970 --> 02:26:50.980
<v Speaker 1>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was fighting at his pace.</v>

3648
02:26:51.220 --> 02:26:54.130
<v Speaker 1>He was completely in control of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and you want a clear cut,</v>

3649
02:26:54.131 --> 02:26:56.590
<v Speaker 1>unanimous decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt davis a bunch of times,</v>

3650
02:26:56.591 --> 02:26:58.030
<v Speaker 1>and it was super dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

3651
02:26:58.210 --> 02:27:01.320
<v Speaker 1>I feel like rumble johnson today scarier</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the rumble johnson,</v>

3652
02:27:01.321 --> 02:27:05.470
<v Speaker 1>the flat phil davis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rumble when he fought dc the first</v>

3653
02:27:05.471 --> 02:27:08.620
<v Speaker 1>time when he fought cormier the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time he was preparing for jon jones,</v>

3654
02:27:08.621 --> 02:27:12.130
<v Speaker 1>so he's preparing for a different fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fight was a last minute replacement</v>

3655
02:27:12.131 --> 02:27:15.640
<v Speaker 1>with cormier and cormier's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a out wrestled them.</v>

3656
02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean daniel is one of the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers in the sport.</v>

3657
02:27:17.591 --> 02:27:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Period out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrestled them and then eventually got</v>

3658
02:27:19.451 --> 02:27:24.220
<v Speaker 1>his back and choked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that it's a terrifying</v>

3659
02:27:24.221 --> 02:27:28.250
<v Speaker 1>fight for cormay because this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy hits so god hard.</v>

3660
02:27:28.251 --> 02:27:30.970
<v Speaker 1>He's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make any mistakes and mistakes,</v>

3661
02:27:30.971 --> 02:27:33.550
<v Speaker 1>he lands a fucking nuclear bomb on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

3662
02:27:36.250 --> 02:27:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Be able to scare them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scare fighters.</v>

3663
02:27:39.461 --> 02:27:41.390
<v Speaker 1>The way that rumble does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has that.</v>

3664
02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:46.320
<v Speaker 1>He think that old school of afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being beaten up in the school yard,</v>

3665
02:27:46.620 --> 02:27:49.000
<v Speaker 1>like when it could be beat Michael</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson the way you had it on the</v>

3666
02:27:49.001 --> 02:27:50.710
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I would get beaten up,</v>

3667
02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:53.380
<v Speaker 1>like that was so claustrophobic for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to watch that,</v>

3668
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:56.200
<v Speaker 1>to like not be able to pull your arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was a really uncomfortable</v>

3669
02:27:56.201 --> 02:27:58.280
<v Speaker 1>fight because it just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't fight.</v>

3670
02:27:58.300 --> 02:27:59.590
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted it stopped.</v>

3671
02:28:00.070 --> 02:28:02.890
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to stop before they stopped it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bothering me.</v>

3672
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's not going to win.</v>

3673
02:28:04.361 --> 02:28:05.830
<v Speaker 1>This fight is getting the fuck beat out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of him.</v>

3674
02:28:05.831 --> 02:28:08.020
<v Speaker 1>He's getting his head punched and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best fighters in the world</v>

3675
02:28:08.021 --> 02:28:10.390
<v Speaker 1>and you're ruining them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just taking this beating.</v>

3676
02:28:10.770 --> 02:28:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Like just stop the god damn fight.</v>

3677
02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:16.000
<v Speaker 1>He was so outmatched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did hurt habib early in the</v>

3678
02:28:16.001 --> 02:28:18.480
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He heard he hurt khabib in the first</v>

3679
02:28:18.490 --> 02:28:21.920
<v Speaker 1>round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the fucking khabib not being</v>

3680
02:28:21.921 --> 02:28:23.630
<v Speaker 1>able to make the weight against tony</v>
<v Speaker 1>ferguson.</v>

3681
02:28:23.631 --> 02:28:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like this god damn weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting god.</v>

3682
02:28:25.971 --> 02:28:27.620
<v Speaker 1>It's such a horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible practice.</v>

3683
02:28:27.621 --> 02:28:29.900
<v Speaker 1>It makes me sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was heartbreaking because everybody</v>

3684
02:28:29.901 --> 02:28:32.270
<v Speaker 1>wants that fight and now they say</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be scared to put him</v>

3685
02:28:32.271 --> 02:28:34.280
<v Speaker 1>against conor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're going to have that pair</v>

3686
02:28:34.281 --> 02:28:35.540
<v Speaker 1>of fucking main event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

3687
02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:37.400
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

3688
02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:41.420
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we've talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it on the fight companion podcast</v>

3689
02:28:41.421 --> 02:28:43.570
<v Speaker 1>we did the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we pulled up the uh,</v>

3690
02:28:43.790 --> 02:28:47.300
<v Speaker 1>luke rockhold quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luke rockhold is his training partner</v>

3691
02:28:47.570 --> 02:28:51.230
<v Speaker 1>and he was saying that he couldn't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood to his liver and that was</v>

3692
02:28:51.231 --> 02:28:51.800
<v Speaker 1>something was going on.</v>

3693
02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:53.960
<v Speaker 1>He was in deep pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't getting blood to his liver.</v>

3694
02:28:53.961 --> 02:28:54.441
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3695
02:28:54.441 --> 02:28:56.930
<v Speaker 1>you fucking kidding me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy and this guy is going to</v>

3696
02:28:56.931 --> 02:28:59.360
<v Speaker 1>do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to lose that weight again</v>

3697
02:28:59.361 --> 02:29:02.030
<v Speaker 1>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And apparently he said that he had the</v>

3698
02:29:02.031 --> 02:29:03.500
<v Speaker 1>same problem in the Michael Johnson</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

3699
02:29:03.930 --> 02:29:07.010
<v Speaker 1>the Michael Johnson fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wound up getting down to 1:55,</v>

3700
02:29:07.011 --> 02:29:09.920
<v Speaker 1>but he was having the same issue where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't getting blood to his liver.</v>

3701
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck,</v>

3702
02:29:10.941 --> 02:29:12.320
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3703
02:29:12.321 --> 02:29:16.200
<v Speaker 1>and george st pierre is did an interview</v>
<v Speaker 1>today where he's saying that it's going</v>

3704
02:29:16.201 --> 02:29:18.380
<v Speaker 1>to kill one of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of us is gonna die from weight</v>

3705
02:29:18.381 --> 02:29:19.700
<v Speaker 1>cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lindsey's going to middleweight now.</v>

3706
02:29:19.701 --> 02:29:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the reasons why</v>

3707
02:29:21.260 --> 02:29:22.160
<v Speaker 1>it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3708
02:29:22.220 --> 02:29:23.510
<v Speaker 1>I think it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look out,</v>

3709
02:29:23.511 --> 02:29:25.550
<v Speaker 1>god damned good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calvin gasoline looked against or</v>

3710
02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:27.140
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>

3711
02:29:27.140 --> 02:29:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Johny hendricks I thought looked good</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

3712
02:29:28.450 --> 02:29:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked great.</v>

3713
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:32.280
<v Speaker 1>It looked great against hector lombard</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting heavy.</v>

3714
02:29:32.290 --> 02:29:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I makes you faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess it's just not draining</v>

3715
02:29:35.271 --> 02:29:36.710
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is because he's not</v>

3716
02:29:36.711 --> 02:29:38.270
<v Speaker 1>getting heavier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was always heavy.</v>

3717
02:29:38.420 --> 02:29:41.840
<v Speaker 1>He but he would be the same weight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then dehydrate himself down to one 70</v>

3718
02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:44.990
<v Speaker 1>and then go back up to [inaudible] 90</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around that,</v>

3719
02:29:45.020 --> 02:29:49.100
<v Speaker 1>which is what probably with johny</v>
<v Speaker 1>hendricks was instead this time just</v>

3720
02:29:49.101 --> 02:29:53.210
<v Speaker 1>last a couple of pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made one 85 easy and then look fucking</v>

3721
02:29:53.211 --> 02:29:56.900
<v Speaker 1>great against hector lombard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see more guys do that</v>

3722
02:29:56.901 --> 02:29:58.490
<v Speaker 1>because I think that's so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthier.</v>

3723
02:29:58.491 --> 02:30:01.320
<v Speaker 1>So much and the performances are better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at donald cerrone.</v>

3724
02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Donald's ronnie since going up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>welterweight looks far better than they</v>

3725
02:30:04.371 --> 02:30:05.360
<v Speaker 1>looked at lightweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3726
02:30:05.361 --> 02:30:07.850
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder why they do that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've asked them before and they just</v>

3727
02:30:07.851 --> 02:30:08.260
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3728
02:30:08.260 --> 02:30:09.550
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be fighting a heavier</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

3729
02:30:09.650 --> 02:30:10.940
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just fight it?</v>

3730
02:30:10.941 --> 02:30:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Your normal kind of your weighT,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your walk around now,</v>

3731
02:30:14.031 --> 02:30:16.490
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be better and not have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut all that weight and put it back on?</v>

3732
02:30:16.491 --> 02:30:17.630
<v Speaker 1>It just seems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>

3733
02:30:17.631 --> 02:30:19.430
<v Speaker 1>In their defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there should be more weight</v>

3734
02:30:19.431 --> 02:30:21.620
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there should be a weight class</v>

3735
02:30:21.621 --> 02:30:23.960
<v Speaker 1>every 10 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if there was a waY class every</v>

3736
02:30:23.961 --> 02:30:26.600
<v Speaker 1>10 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would alleviate a lot of the extreme</v>

3737
02:30:26.601 --> 02:30:28.490
<v Speaker 1>cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have a 1:45,</v>

3738
02:30:28.491 --> 02:30:30.560
<v Speaker 1>1:55,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one 65 slash 75,</v>

3739
02:30:30.590 --> 02:30:32.750
<v Speaker 1>85,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95 and then go up like that.</v>

3740
02:30:33.230 --> 02:30:35.510
<v Speaker 1>I think if we did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have more champions.</v>

3741
02:30:35.511 --> 02:30:39.320
<v Speaker 1>It would be more exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be an excellent way to</v>

3742
02:30:39.710 --> 02:30:43.040
<v Speaker 1>have a champion versus champion fights</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he wouldn't be that much much</v>

3743

3779
02:32:00.901 --> 02:32:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Who criticized his weight that I think</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

3782
02:32:07.411 --> 02:32:07.861
<v Speaker 1>Wait.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got submitted by ricardo lamas.</v>

3785
02:32:10.781 --> 02:32:13.680
<v Speaker 1>So it was a great fight for llamas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then before that pet submitted them.</v>

3786
02:32:14.250 --> 02:32:16.140
<v Speaker 1>And then before that he beat miles.</v>

3787
02:32:16.140 --> 02:32:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Jury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

3788
02:32:17.191 --> 02:32:18.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just,</v>

3789
02:32:18.310 --> 02:32:21.090
<v Speaker 1>it's another one of those Guys just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a really talented guy,</v>

3790
02:32:21.091 --> 02:32:23.730
<v Speaker 1>but that fucking weight cut is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>

3791
02:32:23.910 --> 02:32:26.130
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst part of the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There should be a way to do it,</v>

3792
02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:28.980
<v Speaker 1>to eliminate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they should be weighing these</v>

3793
02:32:28.981 --> 02:32:32.400
<v Speaker 1>guys in every Fifteen days or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and finding out what they</v>

3794
02:32:32.401 --> 02:32:34.680
<v Speaker 1>really way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's crazy.</v>

3795
02:32:34.740 --> 02:32:37.740
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's insane to dehydrate your</v>

3796
02:32:37.741 --> 02:32:39.030
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>

3797
02:32:39.540 --> 02:32:42.540
<v Speaker 1>get to death's door than 24 hours later</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a cage fight.</v>

3798
02:32:42.630 --> 02:32:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Gsp said there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said I didn't.</v>

3799
02:32:43.861 --> 02:32:46.920
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know they did that in boxing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was saying about inboxing a month</v>

3800
02:32:46.921 --> 02:32:47.490
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They waste,</v>

3801
02:32:47.490 --> 02:32:49.420
<v Speaker 1>you can't lose like 20 percent of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the percentage of body.</v>

3802
02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I never considered that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that Would probably be a good way to</v>

3803
02:32:51.961 --> 02:32:52.620
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

3804
02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the guy who runs the California</v>

3805
02:32:54.931 --> 02:32:57.180
<v Speaker 1>state athletic commission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is andy foster and he's</v>

3806
02:32:57.181 --> 02:32:58.530
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

3807
02:32:58.531 --> 02:33:02.730
<v Speaker 1>one of the very best commissioners in in</v>
<v Speaker 1>mma today in athletic commission</v>

3808
02:33:02.731 --> 02:33:05.490
<v Speaker 1>commissioners because he's just really</v>
<v Speaker 1>proactive.</v>

3809
02:33:05.491 --> 02:33:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I believe he's had some mma fights</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself and he's,</v>

3810
02:33:07.650 --> 02:33:11.280
<v Speaker 1>he's an accomplished martial artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really understands the sport and</v>

3811
02:33:11.310 --> 02:33:13.230
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're taking some really proactive</v>

3812
02:33:13.231 --> 02:33:16.140
<v Speaker 1>approaches to cutting weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting and making sure that people</v>

3813
02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:18.620
<v Speaker 1>don't dehydrate themselves as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

3814
02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:22.560
<v Speaker 1>he was really proactive and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancinG drugs,</v>

3815
02:33:22.561 --> 02:33:27.060

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3821
02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:44.190
<v Speaker 1>part of me actually considered putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the paste on and just sitting in the</v>

02:35:17.140 --> 02:35:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean like when I,</v>

3858
02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:21.040
<v Speaker 2>when I think about it more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to do it more,</v>

3859
02:35:21.340 --> 02:35:23.270
<v Speaker 2>but I mean when uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm like,</v>

3860
02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:24.870
<v Speaker 2>lactose fucking kills me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ice cream,</v>

3861
02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:26.980
<v Speaker 2>frozen yogurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yogurt too.</v>

3862
02:35:27.010 --> 02:35:29.170
<v Speaker 2>There's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have an ice cream sundae mean</v>

3863
02:35:29.180 --> 02:35:31.420
<v Speaker 2>you're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows how many hundreds of grams of</v>

3864
02:35:31.421 --> 02:35:33.190
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it feels so good.</v>

3865
02:35:33.191 --> 02:35:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going in and then you just.</v>

3866
02:35:36.100 --> 02:35:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Then you regret it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3867
02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Your body feels like dog shit for a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3868
02:35:39.930 --> 02:35:42.400
<v Speaker 2>For an hour or so afterWards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like dog shit.</v>

3869
02:35:42.430 --> 02:35:45.250
<v Speaker 2>I feel I feel that way for a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I gotta I gotta eat good for a</v>

3870
02:35:45.251 --> 02:35:46.790
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the gym and then when I started</v>

3871
02:35:46.810 --> 02:35:47.710
<v Speaker 2>this I've never had an attitude.</v>

3872
02:35:47.710 --> 02:35:49.750
<v Speaker 2>I never will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to have abs.</v>

3873
02:35:49.751 --> 02:35:51.490
<v Speaker 2>You're not far away from amps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3874
02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:53.740
<v Speaker 2>When you have a real trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a really good trainer.</v>

3875
02:35:53.741 --> 02:35:55.780
<v Speaker 2>That fucking kicks your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to check that.</v>

3876
02:35:55.781 --> 02:35:58.150
<v Speaker 2>You go to three different ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three different ones.</v>

3877
02:35:58.180 --> 02:35:59.020
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3878
02:35:59.021 --> 02:36:01.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well one couldn't do another schedule so</v>

3879
02:36:01.361 --> 02:36:02.950
<v Speaker 2>I use another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One monday,</v>

3880
02:36:02.951 --> 02:36:04.600
<v Speaker 2>one friday and they want to use tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thursday.</v>

3881
02:36:04.601 --> 02:36:06.580
<v Speaker 2>So I'll schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every time you work out you workout</v>

3882
02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:07.870
<v Speaker 2>with a trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time.</v>

3883
02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Unless I'm here and I'll do a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

3884
02:36:10.311 --> 02:36:12.490
<v Speaker 2>I'll pop up on the old elliptical for 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

3885
02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:16.210
<v Speaker 2>We all drove through a few things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've remembered do 45 minutes by myself,</v>

3886
02:36:16.211 --> 02:36:19.060
<v Speaker 2>but I would say almost every time I use</v>
<v Speaker 2>a trainer because I don't like.</v>

3887
02:36:19.390 --> 02:36:21.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm lazy.</v>

3888
02:36:21.341 --> 02:36:24.550
<v Speaker 2>I like to be fucking lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will at least make you do different</v>

3889
02:36:24.580 --> 02:36:27.020
<v Speaker 2>shit squad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3890
02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:29.980
<v Speaker 2>like all these full body exercises I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing things I wouldn't do on my own.</v>

3891
02:36:30.010 --> 02:36:31.390
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting that you say you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>lazy,</v>

3892
02:36:31.391 --> 02:36:33.790
<v Speaker 2>but you work out four days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not lazy.</v>

3893
02:36:33.850 --> 02:36:36.730
<v Speaker 2>I do that in spite of my laziness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I am lazy.</v>

3894
02:36:36.970 --> 02:36:39.160
<v Speaker 2>You do stand up seven nights a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're lAzy.</v>

3895
02:36:39.370 --> 02:36:41.080
<v Speaker 2>You do your radio show how many days a</v>
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

3896
02:36:41.081 --> 02:36:42.670
<v Speaker 2>five days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're lazy.</v>

3897
02:36:42.830 --> 02:36:45.550
<v Speaker 2>You do your podcast on top of the radio</v>
<v Speaker 2>show two days a week,</v>

3898
02:36:45.551 --> 02:36:46.810
<v Speaker 2>but you're lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3899
02:36:46.811 --> 02:36:47.890
<v Speaker 2>It's weird I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>

3900
02:36:47.891 --> 02:36:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I,</v>

3901
02:36:49.030 --> 02:36:49.870
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm not.</v>

3902
02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I always feel like I'm a lazy bum and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>really do.</v>

3903
02:36:53.580 --> 02:36:57.640
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm a fucking hard and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing all this stuff in spite of being</v>

3904
02:36:57.641 --> 02:36:59.830
<v Speaker 2>lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm fighting laziness constantly.</v>

3905
02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's the way you're defining maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>your self defining yourself in a very</v>

3906
02:37:03.580 --> 02:37:07.510
<v Speaker 2>negative and limiting way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe by thinking that like you're lazy.</v>

3907
02:37:07.511 --> 02:37:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Even though the evidence points to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>contrary,</v>

3908
02:37:09.701 --> 02:37:12.850
<v Speaker 2>you're still doing all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lazy person would find a way to not</v>

3909
02:37:12.851 --> 02:37:15.040
<v Speaker 2>work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lazy person would find a way to fuck</v>

3910
02:37:15.050 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 2>off and call in sick</v>

3911
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:17.720
<v Speaker 1>to the radio show a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3912
02:37:17.721 --> 02:37:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think your self critical,</v>

3913
02:37:19.971 --> 02:37:22.460
<v Speaker 1>which is usually what a lot of artists</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

3914
02:37:22.710 --> 02:37:24.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of artists hate everything they do</v>

3915
02:37:24.860 --> 02:37:25.910
<v Speaker 1>and they Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3916
02:37:25.911 --> 02:37:29.300
<v Speaker 1>they're constantly trying to do the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just never good enough and they</v>

3917
02:37:29.301 --> 02:37:30.790
<v Speaker 1>get pissed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3918
02:37:30.830 --> 02:37:34.280
<v Speaker 1>So it might be like this way you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at things,</v>

3919
02:37:34.610 --> 02:37:38.000
<v Speaker 1>you might have to blank that out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not think like that.</v>

3920
02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Just not allow those thoughts to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>into your head.</v>

3921
02:37:40.011 --> 02:37:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Like if I wanted to fuck off and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>work out,</v>

3922
02:37:42.471 --> 02:37:44.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I could come up with some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a reason,</v>

3923
02:37:44.421 --> 02:37:47.690
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't consider myself lazy in that</v>

3924
02:37:47.691 --> 02:37:50.690
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not a workout too much.</v>

3925
02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:52.700
<v Speaker 1>It would be ridiculous if I said I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>lazy.</v>

3926
02:37:53.130 --> 02:37:56.480
<v Speaker 1>I make myself do it with a trainer that</v>
<v Speaker 1>also forCes you to do it.</v>

3927
02:37:56.480 --> 02:37:58.020
<v Speaker 1>But I made myself do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

3928
02:37:58.040 --> 02:37:59.900
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not much difference between you and me</v>

3929
02:37:59.901 --> 02:38:02.020
<v Speaker 1>in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give myself a few days like,</v>

3930
02:38:02.021 --> 02:38:03.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still busy doing press this week.</v>

3931
02:38:03.831 --> 02:38:05.390
<v Speaker 1>I would give myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I did it twice,</v>

3932
02:38:05.391 --> 02:38:07.190
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let the third day go.</v>

3933
02:38:07.191 --> 02:38:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not as driven as I was at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

3934
02:38:09.500 --> 02:38:10.910
<v Speaker 1>bUt the trainers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always show up.</v>

3935
02:38:10.911 --> 02:38:12.890
<v Speaker 1>I never don't show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't cut.</v>

3936
02:38:12.891 --> 02:38:14.860
<v Speaker 1>The workouts are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just make yourself dillard.</v>

3937
02:38:14.900 --> 02:38:16.820
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like baking shall be faithful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3938
02:38:16.821 --> 02:38:18.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I start cheating,</v>

3939
02:38:18.380 --> 02:38:20.390
<v Speaker 1>goodbye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all shades are open.</v>

3940
02:38:20.420 --> 02:38:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Floodgates are open because I'm no</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer perfect.</v>

3941
02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Cd shit comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not perfect.</v>

3942
02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:28.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're defining.</v>

3943
02:38:28.850 --> 02:38:32.300
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a negative definition that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've latched onto yourself,</v>

3944
02:38:32.301 --> 02:38:36.170
<v Speaker 1>that you're lazy because it's impossible</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you to be lazy when you look at all</v>

3945
02:38:36.171 --> 02:38:38.240
<v Speaker 1>the things you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

3946
02:38:38.241 --> 02:38:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't thought of it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

3947
02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always identified myself like that.</v>

3948
02:38:41.451 --> 02:38:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm just a driven guy who's tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3949
02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:45.430
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3950
02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:47.050
<v Speaker 1>jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about all the shit you're doing.</v>

3951
02:38:47.060 --> 02:38:49.730
<v Speaker 1>You're doIng five days of radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing two days a podcast.</v>

3952
02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:52.370
<v Speaker 1>You're doing standup every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're working at night and then you're</v>

3953
02:38:52.371 --> 02:38:54.410
<v Speaker 1>getting up in the morning to do radio.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So you're getting up at seven?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I requested it,</v>

3959
02:39:06.741 --> 02:39:10.890
<v Speaker 1>so I'm usually done by about 8:30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be home by nine.</v>

3960
02:39:10.990 --> 02:39:13.460
<v Speaker 1>A little something to yell some</v>
<v Speaker 1>vietnamese food and relax.</v>

3961
02:39:13.550 --> 02:39:14.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

3962
02:39:14.211 --> 02:39:18.050
<v Speaker 1>even then like you're barely getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight hours sleep then if you go right</v>

3963
02:39:18.051 --> 02:39:19.190

3964

<v Speaker 1>It was to get that eight hours.</v>

3969
02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I just think that that's one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things is non negotiable.</v>

3970
02:39:36.380 --> 02:39:38.660
<v Speaker 1>I just think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's gonna be days where I</v>

3971
02:39:38.661 --> 02:39:41.330
<v Speaker 1>can't I gotta get up early for a flight</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

3972
02:39:41.331 --> 02:39:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think sleep is one of the most non</v>

3973
02:39:44.341 --> 02:39:45.330
<v Speaker 1>negotiable things.</v>

3974
02:39:45.330 --> 02:39:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Sleeping and drinking water and eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy food,</v>

3975
02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:50.330
<v Speaker 1>those are pretty non negotiable with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of?</v>

3976
02:39:50.331 --> 02:39:52.430
<v Speaker 1>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last nIght it was pretty late.</v>

3977
02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Last night was probably like 1:00 in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

3978
02:39:54.501 --> 02:39:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I got up at a like somewhere around nine</v>
<v Speaker 1>ish.</v>

3979
02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:00.140
<v Speaker 1>That's still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's still a good schedule for a</v>

3980
02:40:00.141 --> 02:40:02.030
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for comedians.</v>

3981
02:40:02.031 --> 02:40:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's good that the store's not far</v>

3982
02:40:04.611 --> 02:40:06.590
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get to the store and a half</v>

3983
02:40:06.591 --> 02:40:08.750
<v Speaker 1>an hour at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get there and do a set.</v>

<v Speaker 1>1130.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3986
02:40:12.351 --> 02:40:13.930

<v Speaker 1>That's what scared me though.</v>

3987
02:40:13.931 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

3988
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:18.840
<v Speaker 2>was the idea of doing radio during the</v>
<v Speaker 2>day and then like I did afternoons I do,</v>

3989
02:40:18.841 --> 02:40:21.410
<v Speaker 2>I set at night and then one and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3990

<v Speaker 2>That's what you're wearing and.</v>

3991
02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:26.490
<v Speaker 2>And nobody's around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody is around.</v>

3992
02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:26.940
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3993

02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:57.510

<v Speaker 2>I actually just screen cap that because</v>

4006
02:40:57.511 --> 02:40:59.050
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like the pixel using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I just screamed and especially could you</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys use that?</v>

4008
02:41:00.970 --> 02:41:01.770

4011
02:41:03.570 --> 02:41:06.150
<v Speaker 2>I liked that too because you're in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of a set,</v>

4012
02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:08.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's a real picture.</v>

4013
02:41:08.580 --> 02:41:11.940
<v Speaker 2>That's a real like you're not posing</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I posed for a bunch of netflix</v>

4014
02:41:11.941 --> 02:41:13.200

<v Speaker 2>pictures and I was like,</v>

4015

<v Speaker 2>well there's one they took of me where</v>
<v Speaker 2>my hands over my mouth,</v>

4016
02:41:17.011 --> 02:41:19.440
<v Speaker 2>but it's a screen grab from the set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing a joke right?</v>

4017
02:41:19.450 --> 02:41:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Cover my mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

4018
02:41:21.090 --> 02:41:23.610

<v Speaker 2>can't see my face and be.</v>

4019
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:26.520
<v Speaker 2>Because I know it's a mouthful of shame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like I'm going,</v>

4020
02:41:26.521 --> 02:41:28.350
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said something naughty,</v>

4021
02:41:28.351 --> 02:41:31.350
<v Speaker 2>which is not what the joke is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it looks like I called it mouthful</v>

4022
02:41:31.351 --> 02:41:32.610
<v Speaker 2>of shame and that went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that could be a pRoblem if somebody was</v>

4025
02:41:37.330 --> 02:41:38.910
<v Speaker 2>centered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cynical and they were like,</v>

02:41:38.911 --> 02:41:42.750
<v Speaker 2>who's this guy the fuck out of here with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mouth full to say whatever I want.</v>

4027
02:41:43.020 --> 02:41:45.000
<v Speaker 2>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one sensory me.</v>

4028
02:41:45.090 --> 02:41:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Isn't netflix amazing in that regard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could not be happier.</v>

4029
02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so amazing.</v>

4030
02:41:49.970 --> 02:41:51.620
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robby process.</v>

4031
02:41:52.290 --> 02:41:54.390
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an hour in one minute or hour and</v>

4032
02:41:54.391 --> 02:41:55.950
<v Speaker 2>two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an hour and 14 with a set.</v>

4033
02:41:55.951 --> 02:41:58.010
<v Speaker 2>I chopped the bid up and I asked robbie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

4034
02:41:58.150 --> 02:42:00.720
<v Speaker 2>you might want to turn this a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's up to you and like this one</v>

4035
02:42:00.721 --> 02:42:03.300
<v Speaker 2>part and he was right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trim was actually smart and that</v>

4036
02:42:03.301 --> 02:42:04.770
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the whole suggestion.</v>

4037
02:42:05.100 --> 02:42:05.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was.</v>

4038
02:42:05.620 --> 02:42:08.180
<v Speaker 2>The only notes they gave me when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>recording was like,</v>

4039
02:42:08.190 --> 02:42:11.760
<v Speaker 2>one of the ladies really enjoyed the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphin bit.</v>

4040
02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:13.200
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't do the dolphin bed on that</v>

4041
02:42:13.220 --> 02:42:13.680
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4042
02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:15.300
<v Speaker 2>it's just because I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry,</v>

4043
02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:16.620
<v Speaker 2>it'll be on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

4044
02:42:16.621 --> 02:42:18.030
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't want to do it during that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sec.</v>

4045
02:42:18.031 --> 02:42:19.450
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do.</v>

4046
02:42:19.530 --> 02:42:22.530
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want any of the sets to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer than an hour and some of them are</v>

4047
02:42:22.531 --> 02:42:25.020
<v Speaker 2>going to have material that's not in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other ones that will decide which way to</v>

4048
02:42:25.021 --> 02:42:26.460
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was it.</v>

4049
02:42:26.750 --> 02:42:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Like I like a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Don't worry.</v>

4051

<v Speaker 2>That bit's going to be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4052

4055
02:42:35.341 --> 02:42:36.990
<v Speaker 2>standup by far.</v>

4082
02:43:34.490 --> 02:43:35.081
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4083
02:43:35.081 --> 02:43:36.250
<v Speaker 2>they don't tell you shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just go.</v>

4084
02:43:36.251 --> 02:43:37.450
<v Speaker 2>We're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very happy.</v>

4085
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:39.430
<v Speaker 2>I want to do another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4086
02:43:39.460 --> 02:43:42.780
<v Speaker 2>I should act like I'm holding out when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to do it on and I'm not ready</v>

4087
02:43:42.781 --> 02:43:44.880
<v Speaker 2>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would make in a year or</v>

4088
02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:46.930
<v Speaker 2>something more on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to do it.</v>

4089
02:43:46.931 --> 02:43:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Then what's your schedule do you like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do?</v>

4090
02:43:48.731 --> 02:43:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Do you like to do one a year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not always possible,</v>

4091
02:43:51.551 --> 02:43:53.680
<v Speaker 2>but at my age my goal is to do one every</v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

4092
02:43:53.681 --> 02:43:58.120
<v Speaker 2>year and a half maximum because by then</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the material is like when I</v>

4093
02:43:58.121 --> 02:44:01.900
<v Speaker 2>touch topical stuff now I try to touch</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in a way that ties into an overall</v>

4094
02:44:01.901 --> 02:44:05.290
<v Speaker 2>theme so it still makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I talk about how I don't really</v>

4095
02:44:05.291 --> 02:44:07.360
<v Speaker 2>think I'm a pervert and I mentioned that</v>
<v Speaker 2>jared is a pervert,</v>

4096
02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:08.510
<v Speaker 2>but I don't do a whole long.</v>

4097
02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Jarrod said I'd like to have something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is fairly timeless to that bit.</v>

4098
02:44:12.580 --> 02:44:14.410
<v Speaker 2>Nothing specific to the moment where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

4099
02:44:14.411 --> 02:44:15.244
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember that.</v>

4100
02:44:15.530 --> 02:44:17.860
<v Speaker 2>You know what he did so that I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4101
02:44:17.950 --> 02:44:20.350
<v Speaker 2>but after a year and a half I just lose</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in what I'm saying,</v>

4102
02:44:20.351 --> 02:44:22.570
<v Speaker 2>joke wise and that plus I liked doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

4103
02:44:22.660 --> 02:44:24.130
<v Speaker 2>YeaH,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love doing that.</v>

4104
02:44:24.131 --> 02:44:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I feel like why not just put it out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many places to put specials</v>

4105
02:44:26.621 --> 02:44:27.454
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4106
02:44:27.470 --> 02:44:29.470
<v Speaker 2>And especially when you're doing so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup.</v>

4107
02:44:29.471 --> 02:44:31.720
<v Speaker 2>If you're doing standup six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven nights a week and then you're</v>

4108
02:44:31.721 --> 02:44:34.420
<v Speaker 2>constantly doing a radio show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's constantly new themes running</v>

4109
02:44:34.421 --> 02:44:36.460
<v Speaker 2>through your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to get that out there and it's</v>

4110
02:44:36.461 --> 02:44:39.550
<v Speaker 2>always there and it's like I may</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually do shorter videos or something.</v>

4111
02:44:39.551 --> 02:44:42.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to get them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like things that are so topical just to</v>

4112
02:44:42.510 --> 02:44:43.450
<v Speaker 2>just to spit them out there.</v>

4113
02:44:43.450 --> 02:44:45.370
<v Speaker 2>So they're there and they're posted</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting wasted in a set.</v>

4114
02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:47.410
<v Speaker 2>I want to be your self esteem coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pump you up.</v>

4115
02:44:47.650 --> 02:44:49.990
<v Speaker 2>No more negative thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive gym,</v>

4116
02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:52.810
<v Speaker 2>but then again you might be fueled by</v>
<v Speaker 2>that negative thing and it might be why</v>

4117
02:44:52.811 --> 02:44:54.850
<v Speaker 2>you're so prolific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a combination of both.</v>

4118
02:44:54.880 --> 02:44:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Like I could feel good and be funny too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't even realize it was a</v>

4119
02:44:58.331 --> 02:45:01.240
<v Speaker 2>negative thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think I was confusing being tired</v>

4120
02:45:01.720 --> 02:45:03.910
<v Speaker 2>with being lazy and I think that's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

4121
02:45:03.980 --> 02:45:05.770
<v Speaker 2>You just pointed something out that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes a lot of stuff.</v>

4122
02:45:05.771 --> 02:45:07.780
<v Speaker 2>DefInitely not lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a lot of shit done.</v>

4123
02:45:08.020 --> 02:45:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel but I.</v>

4124
02:45:09.150 --> 02:45:12.830
<v Speaker 2>But I'll watch you and I see you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a company you've got 30 during</v>

4125
02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:14.710
<v Speaker 2>the and I'm like motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting in,</v>

4126
02:45:14.740 --> 02:45:16.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting on a block of ice doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

4127
02:45:16.730 --> 02:45:18.280
<v Speaker 2>what lilly's doing this area here.</v>

4128
02:45:18.520 --> 02:45:20.920
<v Speaker 2>You see all your friends comparing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>

4129
02:45:20.921 --> 02:45:22.960
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you feel lazy when you see your</v>

4130
02:45:22.961 --> 02:45:26.200
<v Speaker 2>friends doing these great things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the things that I'm doing though,</v>

4131
02:45:26.201 --> 02:45:29.450
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoyed doing those things so</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't seem like work to me.</v>

4132
02:45:29.451 --> 02:45:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Like not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a goddamn thing I do that</v>

4133
02:45:31.121 --> 02:45:33.070
<v Speaker 2>seems like work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's working for the ufc,</v>

4134
02:45:33.370 --> 02:45:35.950
<v Speaker 2>whether it's students stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's obligations.</v>

4135
02:45:36.110 --> 02:45:39.640
<v Speaker 2>She'll have to be there to certain time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's writing involved.</v>

4136
02:45:39.641 --> 02:45:42.330
<v Speaker 2>There's things that I have to do where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to sit down and be alone and forced</v>

4137
02:45:42.331 --> 02:45:44.500
<v Speaker 2>myself to do that kind of work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't.</v>

4138
02:45:44.520 --> 02:45:46.840
<v Speaker 2>None of it seems like work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all fun stuff.</v>

4139
02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was only doing stuff I want,</v>

4140
02:45:48.251 --> 02:45:50.740
<v Speaker 2>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish if somehow watching chatter bait</v>

4141
02:45:50.741 --> 02:45:53.220
<v Speaker 2>would advance me in this business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be fucking.</v>

4142
02:45:53.380 --> 02:45:57.460
<v Speaker 2>he'd be seeing my fucking heels and</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably if you did like live commentary</v>

4143
02:45:57.461 --> 02:46:00.370
<v Speaker 2>on twitch for chatter bait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have chattery windows in the</v>

4144
02:46:00.371 --> 02:46:02.650
<v Speaker 2>background and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just sitting there like old old</v>

4145
02:46:02.651 --> 02:46:04.000
<v Speaker 2>jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to,</v>

4146
02:46:04.001 --> 02:46:06.460
<v Speaker 2>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I do want to do is I want to get a</v>

4147
02:46:06.461 --> 02:46:10.400
<v Speaker 2>beautiful girl and chatter bait and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to just come on as fucking chip</v>

4148
02:46:10.401 --> 02:46:11.234
<v Speaker 2>and sit next to her.</v>

4149
02:46:13.610 --> 02:46:16.340
<v Speaker 2>all these years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jerking off in Portugal</v>

<v Speaker 2>I really wanted,</v>

4152
02:46:22.130 --> 02:46:24.590
<v Speaker 2>but I would have to have somebody like</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow capturing,</v>

4153
02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:26.570
<v Speaker 2>because you have to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't show them that you'll get</v>

4154
02:46:26.571 --> 02:46:27.590
<v Speaker 2>sued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>

4155
02:46:27.591 --> 02:46:30.170
<v Speaker 2>there's a way to capture what they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>said and change it a little and put it</v>

4156
02:46:30.171 --> 02:46:31.760
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's so funny.</v>

4157
02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:33.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
