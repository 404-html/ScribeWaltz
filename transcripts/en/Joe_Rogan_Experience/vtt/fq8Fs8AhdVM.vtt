39
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.730
<v Speaker 2>like holes in his jeans.</v>

63
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not into the jewelry.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't have any fashion tastes.</v>

95
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.603
<v Speaker 2>sneakers.</v>

96
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.510
<v Speaker 2>They get no sneaker cred or I'll wear like converse all star.</v>

97
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.631
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

98
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:48.170
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

99
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Look at this teen beat.</v>

100
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Donnie Wahlberg.</v>

101
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

102
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:51.854
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

103
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.040
<v Speaker 2>How does his hog not just slipped right out of that one on the right,</v>

104
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.150
<v Speaker 2>right hand side.</v>

105
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.120
<v Speaker 2>That one on the right hand side come on.</v>

106
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Silly Fox</v>

107
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 3>like I don't know.</v>

108
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 3>I see that and I feel like it guys will probably went in a thong under that too.</v>

109
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.371
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

110
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine there's something going on like with with the women,</v>

111
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.161
<v Speaker 3>like it's,</v>

112
00:03:10.161 --> 00:03:12.870
<v Speaker 3>it's so much nicer to me at all.</v>

113
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tell you right now,</v>

114
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 3>this is where I'm a hypocrite.</v>

115
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 3>Like with Beyonce right there.</v>

116
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 3>She fills it out.</v>

117
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.921
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

118
00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:19.860
<v Speaker 3>she does that.</v>

119
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 3>See that's kind of different because like a woman's legs and everything are very</v>

120
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 3>sexual.</v>

121
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:26.171
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

122
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 3>So you've see extra leg.</v>

123
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like just shut your mouth and take the bonus.</v>

124
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

125
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

126
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

127
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to complain about it,</v>

128
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 3>but a dude wearing something like that,</v>

129
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's,</v>

130
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 3>it's literally like,</v>

131
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 3>well not literally,</v>

132
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 3>but it's so much like a guy wearing a dress.</v>

133
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 3>It's a fashion for women.</v>

134
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's trying way too hard.</v>

135
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.791
<v Speaker 3>Like this.</v>

136
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.624
<v Speaker 3>Look at this fellow.</v>

137
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 3>He this like seems like the 80s though.</v>

138
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 3>Cause he's got a suit jacket on.</v>

139
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can look at the quality of picture.</v>

140
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

141
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

142
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

143
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.640
<v Speaker 3>That hairstyle.</v>

144
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 3>The suit suit jackets never came back.</v>

145
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.790
<v Speaker 3>Got Patches too.</v>

146
00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.140

00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:02.260

<v Speaker 3>that was those pants.</v>

153
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 3>Those pants were ridiculous,</v>

154
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.340
<v Speaker 3>but ripped up pants.</v>

155
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Men allegedly ripped up pants and,</v>

156
00:04:14.301 --> 00:04:14.481
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

157
00:04:14.481 --> 00:04:15.200
<v Speaker 3>and skinny Jean.</v>

158
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.310

160
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm still 100% against skinny jeans.</v>

161
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.960
<v Speaker 3>You know what I say that I'm against gain jeans,</v>

162
00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:23.090
<v Speaker 3>but I wear these things called barbell jeans.</v>

163
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.983
<v Speaker 3>You ever wear those?</v>

164
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.450
<v Speaker 3>They look like skinny jeans because they,</v>

165
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.440
<v Speaker 3>they're tight to you.</v>

00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 3>I know he had a lot.</v>

296
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

297
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.670
<v Speaker 3>he was involved with pro wrestling a lot too.</v>

298
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

299
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 3>but now I haven't spoken to him in a long time.</v>

300
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.910
<v Speaker 3>I had a couple of shows with him in the UFC when I first came aboard.</v>

301
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:32.510
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

302
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.920
<v Speaker 3>he was doing the UFC back in the day.</v>

303
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

304
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.671
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

305
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:35.504
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

306
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.650
<v Speaker 3>I was just Wah.</v>

307
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.483
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing.</v>

308
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.271
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing.</v>

309
00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:39.710
<v Speaker 3>Going back and watching these old fights,</v>

310
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 3>I've been on fight pass and I was watching,</v>

311
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like you're [inaudible] wow.</v>

312
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

313
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 3>when Louisiana,</v>

314
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 3>when boosted match and Linden that card.</v>

315
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.521
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

316
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:50.670
<v Speaker 3>That was the restart fight.</v>

317
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:51.411
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

318
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:53.690
<v Speaker 3>Remember that on that card?</v>

319
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.330
<v Speaker 3>My Tim and I tapped him again.</v>

320
00:07:56.331 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 3>Big John kind of screwed it up and yeah,</v>

321
00:07:59.121 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

322
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.230
<v Speaker 3>you know that that was the early days too.</v>

323
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.050
<v Speaker 3>I think nowadays I think big John would have just said,</v>

324
00:08:06.051 --> 00:08:06.221
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

325
00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:06.320
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

326
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:06.620
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

327
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

328
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:07.690
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

329
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:07.851
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

330
00:08:07.851 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

331
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean we were all learning back then,</v>

332
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 3>but that was still like UFC middleweight championship and it was like they had</v>

333
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:18.740
<v Speaker 3>had 30 plus shows.</v>

334
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.693
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

335
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.570
<v Speaker 3>it was something that you wouldn't expect for sure.</v>

336
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.300
<v Speaker 3>Lynn Lynn was so is so crazy.</v>

337
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 3>Didn't he bite somebody and when he was wrestling Lynn Lynn,</v>

338
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

339
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:30.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

340
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.520
<v Speaker 3>In the wrestling days he bit somebody here's boosting launch versus chocolate</v>

341
00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 3>Dell.</v>

342
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 3>This is a different one.</v>

343
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:36.981
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

344
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:41.981
<v Speaker 3>This was a fight where boosted monsters out power and he was just too small.</v>

345
00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.990
<v Speaker 3>Chuck was just so scary back then and he boosted,</v>

346
00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:46.280
<v Speaker 3>much wasn't taking chuck down.</v>

347
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:46.701
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

348
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 3>boosting Monch had fought some big fucking dudes though,</v>

349
00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:49.611
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

350
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:49.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

351
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.590
<v Speaker 3>That was the thing that he hadn't taken chucked out.</v>

352
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.840
<v Speaker 3>He had fought some big fucking dude's.</v>

353
00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 3>Remember he fought Tom Erickson in like world combat something or another?</v>

354
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the organization.</v>

355
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I do vaguely remember the fight.</v>

356
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:03.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember watching it,</v>

357
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.631
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

358
00:09:04.631 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

359
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.161
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

360
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:05.371
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

361
00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:06.204
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

362
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.570
<v Speaker 3>it was a mat.</v>

363
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:07.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

364
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.290
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it was on a mat and there was no cage or oil ring.</v>

365
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.600
<v Speaker 3>Mabee you might be right.</v>

366
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

367
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 3>That's what my dream is.</v>

368
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 3>My dream is to do a MMA fights in a football field.</v>

369
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.660
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm speaking for football fields.</v>

370
00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:21.961
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

371
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 3>So you can't get trapped up against the cage.</v>

372
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.550
<v Speaker 3>I feel like if a guy takes you down and holds you down,</v>

373
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 3>he should be able to hold you down because there's nothing there.</v>

374
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:29.251
<v Speaker 3>But the ground.</v>

375
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:29.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

376
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.540
<v Speaker 3>but a cage,</v>

377
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 3>you can wall walk up the cage there.</v>

378
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 3>You could protect yourself against submissions up against the cage.</v>

379
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.810
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of shit that happens against the cage that just doesn't happen</v>

380
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:41.160
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a basketball court.</v>

381
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.860
<v Speaker 3>But then because of that you got to develop new technique.</v>

382
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.221
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

383
00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:46.530
<v Speaker 3>You've got to develop something to deal with that situation.</v>

384
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

385
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:47.461
<v Speaker 3>Are you,</v>

386
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:48.294
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

387
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.770
<v Speaker 3>like do you think the rules are okay?</v>

388
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:50.940
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

389
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.241
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>

390
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:52.074
<v Speaker 3>what would you change?</v>

391
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.483
<v Speaker 3>I um,</v>

392
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.710
<v Speaker 3>I would definitely change the 12 to six elbow.</v>

393
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 3>That's one I only got the big way.</v>

394
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

395
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.030
<v Speaker 3>you know why that one's illegal,</v>

396
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:00.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

397
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

398
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:01.771
<v Speaker 3>So stupid.</v>

399
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 3>I used to watch those,</v>

400
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:03.444
<v Speaker 3>those um,</v>

401
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 3>demonstration used to come on late at night on ESPN and I was a kid.</v>

402
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 3>I used to watch those things all the time.</v>

403
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 3>I used to love him too.</v>

404
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.650
<v Speaker 3>Even when even when I was fighting,</v>

405
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:13.330
<v Speaker 3>I was still watching those things because it was at a Damon.</v>

406
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:15.880
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

407
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 3>those things are so silly</v>

408
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.070
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

409
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.261
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

410
00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:22.621
<v Speaker 3>they get,</v>

411
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:23.700
<v Speaker 3>they get so intense to,</v>

412
00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:24.534
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

413
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.150
<v Speaker 3>the athletic commissions really thought that you couldn't do that to a person</v>

414
00:10:28.151 --> 00:10:28.984
<v Speaker 3>because you'd kill them.</v>

415
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.190
<v Speaker 3>So they made that technique illegal at all this shit.</v>

416
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Like we have that power cube thing in the back where Ghana gone registered that</v>

417
00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:36.864
<v Speaker 3>power punch.</v>

418
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 3>If you go all there at elbow,</v>

419
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:38.821
<v Speaker 3>that thing,</v>

420
00:10:38.821 --> 00:10:41.130
<v Speaker 3>you'd be shocked at how weak ass her elbows,</v>

421
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 3>especially a dropdown elbow.</v>

422
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just not that much power.</v>

423
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:46.590
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

424
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean when they're breaking those boards,</v>

425
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:49.800
<v Speaker 3>if they're using that,</v>

426
00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:50.880
<v Speaker 3>that joint as a,</v>

427
00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:51.714
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

428
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.820
<v Speaker 3>as a post as the letter.</v>

429
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.311
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

430
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:55.260
<v Speaker 3>And they're just putting their body weight behind it.</v>

431
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.191
<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>

432
00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:59.490
<v Speaker 3>You can't necessarily do that when you're inside someone's guard.</v>

433
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.120
<v Speaker 3>You don't want John Jones elbow new in the face period.</v>

434
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:03.940
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

435
00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:04.621
<v Speaker 3>No difference.</v>

436
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:06.420
<v Speaker 3>If John's hitting you with a downward elbow,</v>

437
00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:10.320
<v Speaker 3>like he got disqualified for when he fought Matt Hamill or if he's hitting you</v>

438
00:11:10.321 --> 00:11:11.280
<v Speaker 3>with a sideways elbow,</v>

439
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:12.330
<v Speaker 3>he's going smashing you.</v>

440
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:12.901
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

441
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:15.120
<v Speaker 3>that download elbow is going to cut a lot less and less.</v>

442
00:11:15.121 --> 00:11:16.590
<v Speaker 3>It's the point on the top of the head.</v>

443
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.513
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

444
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:18.230
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

445
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.650
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

446
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.100
<v Speaker 3>that's a very important point.</v>

447
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.480
<v Speaker 3>Like that was always the,</v>

448
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.433
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

449
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.220
<v Speaker 3>the argument against no gloves was that you'd cut,</v>

450
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:27.470
<v Speaker 3>he'd cut people wanting.</v>

451
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.313
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

452
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.730
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

453
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean that that skin getting pinched between bone at that speed,</v>

454
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:33.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

455
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.710
<v Speaker 3>she's getting torn,</v>

456
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.120
<v Speaker 3>it's not really cut.</v>

457
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.420
<v Speaker 3>But do you think that having wrapped up hands and having padded gloves,</v>

458
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.770
<v Speaker 3>like is that an unrealistic sort of thing?</v>

459
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.521
<v Speaker 3>Because like if you're,</v>

460
00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:48.354
<v Speaker 3>if you're striking,</v>

461
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.650
<v Speaker 3>if you in a dude,</v>

462
00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:50.484
<v Speaker 3>we're just fighting,</v>

463
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:50.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

464
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:51.480
<v Speaker 3>You're just fighting.</v>

465
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.620
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no like,</v>

466
00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:52.771
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

467
00:11:52.771 --> 00:11:54.540
<v Speaker 3>this is a play fight and we're going to have rules.</v>

468
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.440
<v Speaker 3>This is just a fight you and a guy are fighting.</v>

469
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 3>You can't just hit them with bare hands.</v>

470
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Speaker 3>The way you can hit them with gloves on with your wrist taped up,</v>

471
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:03.941
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

472
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:04.091
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

473
00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:07.480
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be very wary about punching him full blast and the forehead.</v>

474
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.890
<v Speaker 3>You might shatter your hand.</v>

475
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.450
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things you have to think about.</v>

476
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:11.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

477
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:16.590
<v Speaker 3>But I guess as as if someone has done it and trained to,</v>

478
00:12:16.591 --> 00:12:18.130
<v Speaker 3>to try to knock someone out,</v>

479
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.500
<v Speaker 3>but you're not thinking about you.</v>

480
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 3>We never throwing punches at your skull.</v>

481
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:22.810
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

482
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:23.080
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

483
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.281
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

484
00:12:23.281 --> 00:12:25.770
<v Speaker 3>we're aiming for these targets that are soft for sure.</v>

485
00:12:25.771 --> 00:12:27.130
<v Speaker 3>So like when you're in a street fight,</v>

486
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.720
<v Speaker 3>like those things don't turn off.</v>

487
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:29.421
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

488
00:12:29.421 --> 00:12:30.280
<v Speaker 3>so as a fighter,</v>

489
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:30.520
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

490
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

491
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.360
<v Speaker 3>that's not a concern to me in a street fight situation when you bring that up.</v>

492
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

493
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.730
<v Speaker 3>but I know it can happen.</v>

494
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:40.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean it happened in some of the early UFC guys guys break their hands on</v>

495
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:40.541
<v Speaker 3>skulls.</v>

496
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:41.374
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

497
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 3>Is it unrealistic to put gloves on?</v>

498
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:46.390
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to tape the wrist up when we don't give them any other advantage</v>

499
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:50.260
<v Speaker 3>for striking and any other way you don't let them cast up your ankles or do</v>

500
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:51.270
<v Speaker 3>something where you,</v>

501
00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:51.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

502
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:55.060
<v Speaker 3>your protect your shins and make it easier for you to kick hard.</v>

503
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:59.230
<v Speaker 3>Cause if you had like some sort of spandex thing with a,</v>

504
00:12:59.260 --> 00:12:59.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

505
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 3>like a Shin Pad,</v>

506
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.080
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

507
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.860
<v Speaker 3>like the same sort of thickness of Shim pad as you have on the knuckles,</v>

508
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.770
<v Speaker 3>you would just be slamming into everything,</v>

509
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

510
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.023
<v Speaker 3>elbows,</v>

511
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.511
<v Speaker 3>arms.</v>

512
00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:11.291
<v Speaker 3>Who gives a fuck?</v>

513
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.220
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't worry about it.</v>

514
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.480
<v Speaker 3>Just slamming in there.</v>

515
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.020
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

516
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:14.853
<v Speaker 3>It would change the game.</v>

517
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 3>A W W it would completely change the game,</v>

518
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:17.061
<v Speaker 3>but it would,</v>

519
00:13:17.061 --> 00:13:19.150
<v Speaker 3>it would slow it down a lot more.</v>

520
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:19.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

521
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.320
<v Speaker 3>in MMA fights now that you look at a punched out for him and may five versus a</v>

522
00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 3>boxing match,</v>

523
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:24.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

524
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.020
<v Speaker 3>of course they can only punch so,</v>

525
00:13:26.021 --> 00:13:30.100
<v Speaker 3>so the punch counts higher but your hands are getting hurt.</v>

526
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

527
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.421
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

528
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:34.840
<v Speaker 3>guys will lose fights simply because they can't continue going into the second</v>

529
00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:35.530
<v Speaker 3>round sometimes.</v>

530
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.840
<v Speaker 3>Will that be the case or will it change their style?</v>

531
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.330
<v Speaker 3>It will definitely change the style,</v>

532
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 3>but without having the gloves and hand wraps and that stuff there,</v>

533
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.020
<v Speaker 3>there is going to be those times when it's still going to,</v>

534
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:47.910
<v Speaker 3>it's just going to minimize,</v>

535
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.810
<v Speaker 3>not minimize but bring the number down.</v>

536
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.490
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to stop it though.</v>

537
00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:52.630
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

538
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:53.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

539
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think if I wanted to look at it in terms of just pure entertainment</v>

540
00:13:57.431 --> 00:13:58.180
<v Speaker 3>value,</v>

541
00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.350
<v Speaker 3>I'd say leave it the way it is.</v>

542
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

543
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:00.820
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

544
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.500
<v Speaker 3>Changed downward elbows.</v>

545
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:03.940
<v Speaker 3>Checked out a couple of other things.</v>

546
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:04.471
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

547
00:14:04.471 --> 00:14:04.691
<v Speaker 3>Some,</v>

548
00:14:04.691 --> 00:14:06.460
<v Speaker 3>some things like I liked pride rules.</v>

549
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

550
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.650
<v Speaker 3>So bad rules,</v>

551
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.420
<v Speaker 3>including with the judging.</v>

552
00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:10.831
<v Speaker 3>The pride.</v>

553
00:14:10.831 --> 00:14:11.231
<v Speaker 3>It was judge,</v>

554
00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:12.550
<v Speaker 3>the whole fight drives the whole fight.</v>

555
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.443
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

556
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.050
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

557
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:14.883
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

558
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.740
<v Speaker 3>And I think I'm more judges,</v>

559
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.371
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

560
00:14:18.371 --> 00:14:19.204
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

561
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.560
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's a big one I was talking about with that with Pat Miletich</v>

562
00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:24.490
<v Speaker 3>show the day were saying like five judges are more,</v>

563
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:25.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

564
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:26.613
<v Speaker 3>why only three?</v>

565
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:27.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

566
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:27.720
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

567
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.610
<v Speaker 3>And I agree with more judges that you will get a little more diversity.</v>

568
00:14:30.611 --> 00:14:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Also though I think,</v>

569
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:32.913
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

570
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.330
<v Speaker 3>you got to change,</v>

571
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.670
<v Speaker 3>change the scoring criteria.</v>

572
00:14:36.671 --> 00:14:38.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean we are using a boxing criteria,</v>

573
00:14:38.531 --> 00:14:39.150
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

574
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.560
<v Speaker 3>like when you talk about wrestling and when I see guys go,</v>

575
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:41.891
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

576
00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:42.701
<v Speaker 3>he's going to take that.</v>

577
00:14:42.701 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 3>When a guy goes down,</v>

578
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.260
<v Speaker 3>he pops right back up.</v>

579
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:44.561
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

580
00:14:44.561 --> 00:14:45.341
<v Speaker 3>this is not a take down.</v>

581
00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:47.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not too so,</v>

582
00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.710
<v Speaker 3>so like why can't we implement some of the things,</v>

583
00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 3>because we're taking aspects of all these different styles of fighting,</v>

584
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:54.360
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

585
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.900
<v Speaker 3>the scoring system and the values for things should,</v>

586
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.570
<v Speaker 3>should come from that to some degree.</v>

587
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.081
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

588
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:02.160
<v Speaker 3>I would take down with the immediate standup.</v>

589
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:02.331
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

590
00:15:02.331 --> 00:15:03.111
<v Speaker 3>if someone takes you down,</v>

591
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:03.944
<v Speaker 3>you're right back up.</v>

592
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.740
<v Speaker 3>That is not a whole lot different than you blocking the kick.</v>

593
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:07.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

594
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

595
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.640
<v Speaker 3>does blocking a kick count if you get your knee up and your elbow up and you</v>

596
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 3>catch one right here,</v>

597
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.300
<v Speaker 3>are you counting that as something that got through right?</v>

598
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:14.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

599
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:15.463
<v Speaker 3>no you're not.</v>

600
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.740
<v Speaker 3>So you know who does right?</v>

601
00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.340
<v Speaker 3>Jackson,</v>

602
00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.180
<v Speaker 3>he's a great coach and I don't say he.</v>

603
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:21.260
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>

604
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I think he does this psychological thing.</v>

605
00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:24.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm letting the cat out of the bag,</v>

606
00:15:24.211 --> 00:15:25.044
<v Speaker 3>but this way,</v>

607
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.340
<v Speaker 3>cause I'm in the cage with,</v>

608
00:15:26.341 --> 00:15:30.700
<v Speaker 3>with Isaac Valley flag and Isaac throws a kick and I block it and Greg is like,</v>

609
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:31.540
<v Speaker 3>it's a great kick.</v>

610
00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.630
<v Speaker 3>Isaac Greg Kick like that landed me,</v>

611
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

612
00:15:34.011 --> 00:15:34.790
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

613
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.980
<v Speaker 3>and then he does something else and it doesn't affect me,</v>

614
00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:38.630
<v Speaker 3>but he's cheering him on like it does.</v>

615
00:15:38.631 --> 00:15:39.290
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

616
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.490
<v Speaker 3>is he doing that for the rat,</v>

617
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:41.330
<v Speaker 3>for the judges?</v>

618
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:42.980
<v Speaker 3>Cause that I'm like,</v>

619
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.150
<v Speaker 3>I went back to the corner,</v>

620
00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:44.721
<v Speaker 3>I told Mike,</v>

621
00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:45.051
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

622
00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:45.351
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>

623
00:15:45.351 --> 00:15:45.691
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

624
00:15:45.691 --> 00:15:48.320
<v Speaker 3>he's cheering them on and getting kind of getting the judges on his side.</v>

625
00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:48.651
<v Speaker 3>Mike's like,</v>

626
00:15:48.651 --> 00:15:49.461
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about that.</v>

627
00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:50.300
<v Speaker 3>This is what you need to do.</v>

628
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:50.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

629
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.100
<v Speaker 3>You gotta get that shit out of your head.</v>

630
00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:52.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

631
00:15:52.341 --> 00:15:53.030
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

632
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.571
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

633
00:15:53.571 --> 00:15:55.350
<v Speaker 3>But if he's right there,</v>

634
00:15:55.351 --> 00:15:59.210
<v Speaker 3>it'll give you see where one corner is and then the other corner is when the</v>

635
00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:00.740
<v Speaker 3>fight is not going on there,</v>

636
00:16:00.741 --> 00:16:02.150
<v Speaker 3>over there by the stairs.</v>

637
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.590
<v Speaker 3>The judge is right there.</v>

638
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

639
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.130
<v Speaker 3>The judges just a few feet over and if they're looking enthusiastic,</v>

640
00:16:07.131 --> 00:16:07.281
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

641
00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:07.731
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

642
00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:08.181
<v Speaker 3>you gotta,</v>

643
00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:08.601
<v Speaker 3>you gotta,</v>

644
00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:11.300
<v Speaker 3>you gotta those judges a certain percent,</v>

645
00:16:11.301 --> 00:16:15.730
<v Speaker 3>let's say 30 don't know what the fuck they're watching and so they're very soon</v>

646
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.460
<v Speaker 3>we say a name.</v>

647
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:16.641
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

648
00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:16.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

649
00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:16.970
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

650
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.520
<v Speaker 3>let's not say any names because I know what we'd say.</v>

651
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.230
<v Speaker 3>We'd all say the same name,</v>

652
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:22.064
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately.</v>

653
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.210
<v Speaker 3>Nice Lady.</v>

654
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.043
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

655
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.033
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

656
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.200
<v Speaker 3>this fucking situation is there should be way better judges for sure.</v>

657
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

658
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.140
<v Speaker 3>I think guys who were former fighters,</v>

659
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.000
<v Speaker 3>guys who are martial arts experts,</v>

660
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.340
<v Speaker 3>guys who like really care about the sport,</v>

661
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.320
<v Speaker 3>you have no shortage of them.</v>

662
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.940
<v Speaker 3>You can go to any MMA school,</v>

663
00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:42.050
<v Speaker 3>any Jujitsu school,</v>

664
00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Eddie kickboxing school,</v>

665
00:16:43.221 --> 00:16:44.054
<v Speaker 3>any websites,</v>

666
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.250
<v Speaker 3>any website all across the country.</v>

667
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:49.220
<v Speaker 3>And you will find hundreds and hundreds of qualified candidates.</v>

668
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.010
<v Speaker 3>People that will tell you why that's a bad decision.</v>

669
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.170
<v Speaker 3>People that'll tell you why that doesn't work.</v>

670
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.420
<v Speaker 3>People will tell you why this shouldn't mean anything.</v>

671
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.390
<v Speaker 3>And we don't have that right now for no reason.</v>

672
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:00.860
<v Speaker 3>There's like zero reason.</v>

673
00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.120
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

674
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:02.961
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>

675
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:03.400
<v Speaker 3>wow man,</v>

676
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.233
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough money.</v>

677
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.590
<v Speaker 3>Like what is this?</v>

678
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:05.991
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

679
00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:07.190
<v Speaker 3>there's enough money for it.</v>

680
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.300
<v Speaker 3>This is this crazy.</v>

681
00:17:08.301 --> 00:17:09.500
<v Speaker 3>This is no reason.</v>

682
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:10.191
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>

683
00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:10.431
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

684
00:17:10.431 --> 00:17:10.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

685
00:17:10.671 --> 00:17:12.440
<v Speaker 3>water's wet and that's just how it goes.</v>

686
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:13.290
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

687
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:13.760
<v Speaker 3>that would be,</v>

688
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.110
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be a good thing also now that like the second generation I,</v>

689
00:17:18.111 --> 00:17:19.220
<v Speaker 3>I have like in my head,</v>

690
00:17:19.221 --> 00:17:22.970
<v Speaker 3>I have this three generations of them may and that's where we are now in the</v>

691
00:17:22.971 --> 00:17:24.740
<v Speaker 3>third starting to move into the fourth.</v>

692
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

693
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:29.540
<v Speaker 3>and I feel like with the first two generations being done pretty much.</v>

694
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:29.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

695
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of guys that are highly qualified to,</v>

696
00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.790
<v Speaker 3>to play more,</v>

697
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:35.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

698
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.450
<v Speaker 3>then it may mean the sport is giant.</v>

699
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.970
<v Speaker 3>There's so many good writers out there.</v>

700
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.800
<v Speaker 3>If you read MMA articles,</v>

701
00:17:42.801 --> 00:17:47.801
<v Speaker 3>they're really good writing and a lot of these like mainstream websites SLAAC a</v>

702
00:17:47.881 --> 00:17:50.340
<v Speaker 3>lot of experts out there talking</v>

703
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:50.790
<v Speaker 2>about stuff.</v>

704
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:55.790
<v Speaker 2>That's why a fight like next weekend is so fascinating because between Tony and</v>

705
00:17:56.731 --> 00:17:57.270
<v Speaker 2>could be,</v>

706
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.580
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows what the fuck is going to happen.</v>

707
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:01.200
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those fights where everybody's like,</v>

708
00:18:01.201 --> 00:18:01.711
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

709
00:18:01.711 --> 00:18:02.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

710
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 2>And you got all these people breaking it down on one side and then you've got</v>

711
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:07.380
<v Speaker 2>people making compelling arguments on the other side and you're like,</v>

712
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.413
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

713
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 2>this one's going to be weird.</v>

714
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.061
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

715
00:18:12.061 --> 00:18:14.820
<v Speaker 2>I've been bouncing back and forth between my pick for that fight.</v>

716
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.590
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

717
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:16.423
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

718
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.920
<v Speaker 4>I guess because I've been bouncing back and forth,</v>

719
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.740
<v Speaker 4>this isn't necessarily where I'm going to stay,</v>

720
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.041
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

721
00:18:22.041 --> 00:18:23.510
<v Speaker 4>I feel like,</v>

722
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:24.141
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

723
00:18:24.141 --> 00:18:25.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't see how that can change.</v>

724
00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:25.851
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

725
00:18:25.851 --> 00:18:26.391
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

726
00:18:26.391 --> 00:18:30.260
<v Speaker 4>there are people that are making these arguments and if somebody convinces me of</v>

727
00:18:30.261 --> 00:18:32.840
<v Speaker 4>something that kinda defeats this argument,</v>

728
00:18:32.841 --> 00:18:33.381
<v Speaker 4>then it's like,</v>

729
00:18:33.381 --> 00:18:33.771
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

730
00:18:33.771 --> 00:18:35.420
<v Speaker 4>now you opened the door for this again.</v>

731
00:18:35.421 --> 00:18:36.890
<v Speaker 4>And what I think is like what I first,</v>

732
00:18:36.891 --> 00:18:38.720
<v Speaker 4>my first thought was could be,</v>

733
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:39.291
<v Speaker 4>he was this guy,</v>

734
00:18:39.291 --> 00:18:42.980
<v Speaker 4>he takes everybody down and he controls you and beat you up and you think he's</v>

735
00:18:42.981 --> 00:18:43.610
<v Speaker 4>going to do that.</v>

736
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:44.240
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

737
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:44.840
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

738
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.860
<v Speaker 4>but Tony is this guy,</v>

739
00:18:45.861 --> 00:18:46.970
<v Speaker 4>he just does not,</v>

740
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.310
<v Speaker 4>he's like one of these submission first kind of guys.</v>

741
00:18:49.311 --> 00:18:49.600
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

742
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.221
<v Speaker 4>where that argument,</v>

743
00:18:50.221 --> 00:18:52.820
<v Speaker 4>submission or position told him he wasn't even too worried about the position.</v>

744
00:18:52.821 --> 00:18:53.750
<v Speaker 4>He'll create scrambles.</v>

745
00:18:53.751 --> 00:18:54.200
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

746
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.840
<v Speaker 4>he's aware of where he is at all times and what he's giving up.</v>

747
00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.380
<v Speaker 4>So I feel like he would just continue to scramble.</v>

748
00:19:00.381 --> 00:19:02.090
<v Speaker 4>He'd be able to get back to his feet at least.</v>

749
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:03.283
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

750
00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:07.670
<v Speaker 4>and then I go back to Khabib and seeing Tony Against Kevin Lee and Kevin Lee</v>

751
00:19:07.671 --> 00:19:09.260
<v Speaker 4>kind of control him early in that fight.</v>

752
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:09.951
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

753
00:19:09.951 --> 00:19:11.720
<v Speaker 4>he was able to pass his guard and do some,</v>

754
00:19:11.721 --> 00:19:13.250
<v Speaker 4>some good controlling things.</v>

755
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.940
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

756
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:14.810
<v Speaker 4>If a guy like could be,</v>

757
00:19:14.811 --> 00:19:15.644
<v Speaker 4>you can do that.</v>

758
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.150
<v Speaker 4>Right then he's not getting back up and could be,</v>

759
00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:19.850
<v Speaker 4>he was going to be able to take him down.</v>

760
00:19:19.851 --> 00:19:21.890
<v Speaker 4>He is the best wrestler in the game.</v>

761
00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:22.860
<v Speaker 4>Like without a doubt.</v>

762
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

763
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Make good arguments.</v>

764
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.893
<v Speaker 2>Good arguments.</v>

765
00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:26.291
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

766
00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:27.850
<v Speaker 2>I think another argument is it Kevin,</v>

767
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.560
<v Speaker 2>when Kevin Lee fought Tony,</v>

768
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.870
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody knew Kevin had a staph infection.</v>

769
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.300
<v Speaker 2>I knew I saw him walking to the cage.</v>

770
00:19:34.301 --> 00:19:35.134
<v Speaker 2>I look at his chest.</v>

771
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.591
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

772
00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

773
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:37.150
<v Speaker 2>that guy's got staff.</v>

774
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:38.710
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was going to be weak.</v>

775
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I knew in compared to the Kevin Lee,</v>

776
00:19:41.341 --> 00:19:44.080
<v Speaker 2>the destroyer that you see when he's on point and in shape,</v>

777
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:44.711
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

778
00:19:44.711 --> 00:19:46.070
<v Speaker 2>this guy is going to be compromised.</v>

779
00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

780
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.530
<v Speaker 2>and he's also a big one 55 so it's a hard cut for him.</v>

781
00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Tony makes it mean Tony can get pretty heavy,</v>

782
00:19:53.441 --> 00:19:54.580
<v Speaker 2>but he's super disciplined.</v>

783
00:19:54.581 --> 00:19:55.414
<v Speaker 2>He makes it easy.</v>

784
00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Tony's endurance,</v>

785
00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.420
<v Speaker 2>his endurance is off the charts,</v>

786
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.130
<v Speaker 2>off the charts impeccable.</v>

787
00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.050
<v Speaker 2>He was posting the other day that he went on a six,</v>

788
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.910
<v Speaker 2>six mile run at one o'clock in the morning.</v>

789
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like extra credit.</v>

790
00:20:05.081 --> 00:20:06.490
<v Speaker 2>He wrote Hashtag extra credit.</v>

791
00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's an animal.</v>

792
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean Eddie Bravo trains of them up there in big bear all the time.</v>

793
00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.760
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] he said he's never seen anything like it.</v>

794
00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:16.780
<v Speaker 2>So to do is just everybody else like pace and everybody up the hill coming back</v>

795
00:20:16.781 --> 00:20:17.081
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

796
00:20:17.081 --> 00:20:19.060
<v Speaker 2>They're still trying to make it up the first time he's running past them.</v>

797
00:20:19.061 --> 00:20:21.040
<v Speaker 2>The second time he's a fucking animal.</v>

798
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Like aw,</v>

799
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.230
<v Speaker 2>he wants it bad.</v>

800
00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.980
<v Speaker 2>But so he knew that Kevin goes into that fight was compromised.</v>

801
00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.600
<v Speaker 2>So if he knew Kevin was compromised,</v>

802
00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.300
<v Speaker 2>maybe he decided just to let them work.</v>

803
00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Let them work that first round.</v>

804
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

805
00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.510
<v Speaker 2>And Kevin's don't know joke.</v>

806
00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:35.890
<v Speaker 2>Kevin's fucking dangerous.</v>

807
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.903
<v Speaker 2>Very skilled.</v>

808
00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:37.893
<v Speaker 2>Very skilled,</v>

809
00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:38.831
<v Speaker 2>very aggressive.</v>

810
00:20:38.831 --> 00:20:39.790
<v Speaker 2>Very strong.</v>

811
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Very dangerous.</v>

812
00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:41.261
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

813
00:20:41.261 --> 00:20:42.094
<v Speaker 2>So Tony,</v>

814
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.140
<v Speaker 2>he got in bad positions in that fight though,</v>

815
00:20:44.141 --> 00:20:44.960
<v Speaker 2>didn't he get mounted?</v>

816
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.900
<v Speaker 4>He gets routed.</v>

817
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.990
<v Speaker 4>He is guy got pretty convinced,</v>

818
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.800
<v Speaker 3>like pretty easily early in the fight.</v>

819
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:52.323
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

820
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:53.470
<v Speaker 3>but that's crazy because if,</v>

821
00:20:53.471 --> 00:20:53.950
<v Speaker 3>if he,</v>

822
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.360
<v Speaker 3>if he did take that time off,</v>

823
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.520
<v Speaker 3>even knowing that a guy like Kevin Lee was,</v>

824
00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

825
00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.013
<v Speaker 3>compromised,</v>

826
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 3>that's still a high level guy to be,</v>

827
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:03.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

828
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:04.690
<v Speaker 3>take this time off.</v>

829
00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 3>It'll be a little bit laxed.</v>

830
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Might just have been Kevin.</v>

831
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:09.964
<v Speaker 3>Is that good?</v>

832
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.580
<v Speaker 3>I really wish that fight took place with Kevin Healthy.</v>

833
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.530
<v Speaker 3>Really wish that fight took place with Kit Kat.</v>

834
00:21:14.531 --> 00:21:16.900
<v Speaker 3>I said Kevin is an interesting guy because he's,</v>

835
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.220
<v Speaker 3>he talks a lot of shit.</v>

836
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

837
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:19.990
<v Speaker 3>He's really aggressive.</v>

838
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.490
<v Speaker 3>He fights well.</v>

839
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.450
<v Speaker 3>He looks the part,</v>

840
00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:22.961
<v Speaker 3>when you look at him,</v>

841
00:21:22.961 --> 00:21:24.130
<v Speaker 3>he's fucking jacked.</v>

842
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.233
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

843
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 3>that's a bad break for a dude like that.</v>

844
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.460
<v Speaker 3>He had like a golf ball growing out of his tit.</v>

845
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:31.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

846
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:31.930
<v Speaker 3>That was crazy.</v>

847
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.471
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

848
00:21:32.471 --> 00:21:35.440
<v Speaker 3>it could happen again relatively soon depending on how it was fight with with</v>

849
00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:36.280
<v Speaker 3>Barboza goes.</v>

850
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

851
00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:37.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

852
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.343
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

853
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.670
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting fight for Barboza tube are,</v>

854
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.800
<v Speaker 3>has got to recover from that.</v>

855
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Mauling the can you put on them that was horrendous.</v>

856
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:45.970
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

857
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:47.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm an opponent to Tony.</v>

858
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:48.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

859
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.001
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

860
00:21:49.001 --> 00:21:50.770
<v Speaker 3>And I want to look back at,</v>

861
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:51.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

862
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.540
<v Speaker 3>the Barbosa fight.</v>

863
00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:53.261
<v Speaker 3>But when I,</v>

864
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:54.340
<v Speaker 3>when I did look at it,</v>

865
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:55.960
<v Speaker 3>he defended,</v>

866
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.060
<v Speaker 3>he defended some of those takedowns early,</v>

867
00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:58.961
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

868
00:21:58.961 --> 00:21:59.441
<v Speaker 3>It's against,</v>

869
00:21:59.441 --> 00:21:59.921
<v Speaker 3>could be eve now.</v>

870
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:00.461
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

871
00:22:00.461 --> 00:22:01.031
<v Speaker 3>You can defend,</v>

872
00:22:01.031 --> 00:22:02.950
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be the strongest in the first round,</v>

873
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.150
<v Speaker 3>but still,</v>

874
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

875
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.510
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of people defending,</v>

876
00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:07.580
<v Speaker 3>could be his takedowns.</v>

877
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.870
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

878
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:08.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

879
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

880
00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.890
<v Speaker 3>there's a great New York Times article that was us just on,</v>

881
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:12.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

882
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.330
<v Speaker 3>or three or four days ago about wrestlers from Dagestan.</v>

883
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:16.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

884
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:21.810
<v Speaker 3>And about how wrestling is their way out because so many of them trying to prove</v>

885
00:22:22.211 --> 00:22:23.020
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

886
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.800
<v Speaker 3>they wind up joining those Islamic terrorist groups and,</v>

887
00:22:26.801 --> 00:22:26.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

888
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.980
<v Speaker 3>that these coaches try to take these young,</v>

889
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.730
<v Speaker 3>aggressive kids and give them something,</v>

890
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:33.600
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

891
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.740
<v Speaker 3>something else and give them another alternative,</v>

892
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:36.701
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

893
00:22:36.701 --> 00:22:38.650
<v Speaker 3>really well written article.</v>

894
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.680
<v Speaker 3>Interesting stuff about like how powerful these guys are and how young they get</v>

895
00:22:43.871 --> 00:22:44.704
<v Speaker 3>him into it.</v>

896
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.830
<v Speaker 3>And when you see Khabib,</v>

897
00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.380
<v Speaker 3>the thing about him,</v>

898
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 3>it's like he's not doing different things and everybody else,</v>

899
00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:51.243
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

900
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Like some people are doing different things like wonder boy is doing different</v>

901
00:22:55.871 --> 00:22:56.201
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

902
00:22:56.201 --> 00:22:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Like he stands totally sideways,</v>

903
00:22:57.881 --> 00:22:58.870
<v Speaker 3>his hands are down.</v>

904
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:00.640
<v Speaker 3>He's throwing front leg sidekicks.</v>

905
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:00.821
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

906
00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:02.290
<v Speaker 3>he's doing a lot of different things and you're like,</v>

907
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:02.711
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

908
00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:02.891
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

909
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:03.311
<v Speaker 3>this is some,</v>

910
00:23:03.311 --> 00:23:04.680
<v Speaker 3>a new thing to adjust to.</v>

911
00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.510
<v Speaker 3>It could be labs doing standard shit,</v>

912
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:12.810
<v Speaker 3>but he's just doing it at not just our notch but several notches past what</v>

913
00:23:14.201 --> 00:23:15.160
<v Speaker 3>everybody else is doing.</v>

914
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.650
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the thing about these Dagestani guys.</v>

915
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

916
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.720
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy because like,</v>

917
00:23:19.721 --> 00:23:21.220
<v Speaker 3>it's this American wrestling style,</v>

918
00:23:21.221 --> 00:23:23.860
<v Speaker 3>folk style wrestling of being on top and having that control.</v>

919
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:24.970
<v Speaker 3>That's a big deal.</v>

920
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.140
<v Speaker 3>But like Nick Lens,</v>

921
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.310
<v Speaker 3>that's one of his strengths.</v>

922
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.050
<v Speaker 3>When nick gets on top of you,</v>

923
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:29.870
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>

924
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:30.870
<v Speaker 3>a Dorf,</v>

925
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:31.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

926
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.560
<v Speaker 3>like he's not going anywhere,</v>

927
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.080
<v Speaker 3>but he can also escape that.</v>

928
00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:35.561
<v Speaker 3>A lot of guys,</v>

929
00:23:35.561 --> 00:23:36.550
<v Speaker 3>same thing with Mike Brown,</v>

930
00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:37.680
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

931
00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.220
<v Speaker 3>Nick Lance got written out at the w in,</v>

932
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.260
<v Speaker 3>in the fight in Brooklyn.</v>

933
00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:46.200
<v Speaker 3>I forget which car that I'm Holly Holmes and Jermaine Mandarin to me.</v>

934
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.350
<v Speaker 3>You know that car he wanted by getting right?</v>

935
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:49.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

936
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:50.750
<v Speaker 3>the ones launch one which fight,</v>

937
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:51.741
<v Speaker 3>I forget who,</v>

938
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:52.551
<v Speaker 3>who he fought,</v>

939
00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 3>I forget he fought a Dagestani guy.</v>

940
00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:54.711
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

941
00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:57.440
<v Speaker 3>But he just got written out against his own style.</v>

942
00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what I'm saying.</v>

943
00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.000
<v Speaker 3>These guys are better at what they are with the American style is.</v>

944
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 3>But like for something like that,</v>

945
00:24:04.131 --> 00:24:07.090
<v Speaker 3>I want to see one of those guys against a guy like Greg Gillespie,</v>

946
00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:07.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

947
00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.000
<v Speaker 3>cause that style of wrestling of being on top and grinding on you.</v>

948
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:16.220
<v Speaker 3>That's a high like a high level wrestler like that and no fault out four time.</v>

949
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:19.730
<v Speaker 3>All American national champion kind of guy with that kind of conditioning who's</v>

950
00:24:19.731 --> 00:24:20.564
<v Speaker 3>not going to break.</v>

951
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:22.400
<v Speaker 3>I want to see that battle.</v>

952
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.060
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>

953
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:27.080
<v Speaker 3>cause that'll be like a a Nash National Championship with two guys that can</v>

954
00:24:27.081 --> 00:24:27.950
<v Speaker 3>punch and kick a bit.</v>

955
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.370
<v Speaker 3>Well look at guy like Jordan Burroughs or Jordan Burroughs getting into mmn.</v>

956
00:24:31.371 --> 00:24:31.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

957
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.360
<v Speaker 3>Like what happens when he fights when those Dagestani guys.</v>

958
00:24:34.361 --> 00:24:34.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

959
00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.510
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

960
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.360
<v Speaker 3>But see there's Dagestani guys and then it's could beep.</v>

961
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:40.910
<v Speaker 3>He's another notch above them.</v>

962
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:42.620
<v Speaker 3>He's a notch above them.</v>

963
00:24:42.621 --> 00:24:42.771
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

964
00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:44.570
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of those guys that are real good.</v>

965
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.590
<v Speaker 3>They're real tough,</v>

966
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:46.483
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

967
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.990
<v Speaker 3>but he's another level.</v>

968
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.350
<v Speaker 3>He is a scary level when you see him on top of guys,</v>

969
00:24:51.351 --> 00:24:51.621
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

970
00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:53.150
<v Speaker 3>like especially the Michael Johnson,</v>

971
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.800
<v Speaker 3>that was helpless.</v>

972
00:24:54.801 --> 00:24:56.300
<v Speaker 3>That was mauling man,</v>

973
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.320
<v Speaker 3>horrifying.</v>

974
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.090
<v Speaker 3>And having a conversation with him,</v>

975
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.100
<v Speaker 3>pleading with him to give up,</v>

976
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.810
<v Speaker 3>you must quit title shut this mind,</v>

977
00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:03.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

978
00:25:03.761 --> 00:25:05.090
<v Speaker 3>title shot they deserve.</v>

979
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.280
<v Speaker 3>Bam just keeps,</v>

980
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.290
<v Speaker 3>and he's got his arm tied behind his back is punching him in the face.</v>

981
00:25:09.291 --> 00:25:10.124
<v Speaker 3>It's horrific.</v>

982
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.150
<v Speaker 3>It's horrific.</v>

983
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:12.051
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

984
00:25:12.051 --> 00:25:13.730
<v Speaker 3>he can do shit to you that like,</v>

985
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 3>it's like white belt,</v>

986
00:25:15.231 --> 00:25:16.270
<v Speaker 3>black belt beat up.</v>

987
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:19.640
<v Speaker 3>It's against the best guy in the world against the best guys in the world.</v>

988
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:20.893
<v Speaker 3>Michael Johnson.</v>

989
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.250
<v Speaker 3>Michael Johnson clipped him.</v>

990
00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:22.730
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

991
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:23.890
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing about that fight.</v>

992
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:24.783
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting to me.</v>

993
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.620
<v Speaker 3>It could be came into that fight with the same problem.</v>

994
00:25:27.621 --> 00:25:29.630
<v Speaker 3>He went into the Tony Ferguson fight that was canceled.</v>

995
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:34.280
<v Speaker 3>He cut too much weight and his liver apparently shutdown making wait for that</v>

996
00:25:34.281 --> 00:25:35.114
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

997
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.070
<v Speaker 3>So then they went into the next fight.</v>

998
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

999
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.140
<v Speaker 3>and he didn't make weight at all.</v>

1000
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Rushed to the hospital.</v>

1001
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Then he hired a nutritionist.</v>

1002
00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Looks fucking fantastic.</v>

1003
00:25:43.731 --> 00:25:47.030
<v Speaker 3>Event Against Barboza has zero problems making weight and now he's got it all</v>

1004
00:25:47.031 --> 00:25:47.864
<v Speaker 3>under control.</v>

1005
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.650
<v Speaker 3>But you got to wonder if he was compromised in the Michael Johnson fight.</v>

1006
00:25:51.651 --> 00:25:55.100
<v Speaker 3>How much of a factor did that play into the him getting stunned.</v>

1007
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:55.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1008
00:25:55.381 --> 00:25:55.670
<v Speaker 3>he got,</v>

1009
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.503
<v Speaker 3>he got clipped,</v>

1010
00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:57.453
<v Speaker 3>he got clipped.</v>

1011
00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:01.350
<v Speaker 3>And you know as well as anybody that when you're dehydrated or you have been</v>

1012
00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:01.661
<v Speaker 3>dehydrated,</v>

1013
00:26:01.661 --> 00:26:02.810
<v Speaker 3>you just don't take a punch as well.</v>

1014
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1015
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.093
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1016
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Dehydration,</v>

1017
00:26:04.971 --> 00:26:05.804
<v Speaker 3>conditioning,</v>

1018
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.621
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>

1019
00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:07.011
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1020
00:26:07.011 --> 00:26:08.780
<v Speaker 3>those things help you recover when you,</v>

1021
00:26:08.781 --> 00:26:10.430
<v Speaker 3>when you're hydrated and you're conditioning is,</v>

1022
00:26:10.431 --> 00:26:11.264
<v Speaker 3>is up to.</v>

1023
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:12.463
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1024
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:12.771
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1025
00:26:12.771 --> 00:26:13.604
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1026
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.001
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1027
00:26:14.001 --> 00:26:15.170
<v Speaker 3>you seen him take some punches.</v>

1028
00:26:15.171 --> 00:26:16.490
<v Speaker 3>He always backs guys up.</v>

1029
00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:20.150
<v Speaker 3>He's always coming forward and he does eat a lot of shots coming forward.</v>

1030
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:21.650
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1031
00:26:21.651 --> 00:26:24.530
<v Speaker 3>if his conditioning is fine and that's the only time that I can remember him</v>

1032
00:26:24.531 --> 00:26:26.930
<v Speaker 3>getting hurt in a fight and from taking shots,</v>

1033
00:26:26.931 --> 00:26:28.040
<v Speaker 3>like the same thing with Barbosa,</v>

1034
00:26:28.041 --> 00:26:28.381
<v Speaker 3>Barbosa,</v>

1035
00:26:28.381 --> 00:26:29.420
<v Speaker 3>who was thrown at him hard,</v>

1036
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:29.931
<v Speaker 3>hard,</v>

1037
00:26:29.931 --> 00:26:30.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1038
00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:31.004
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>

1039
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:31.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1040
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:32.120
<v Speaker 3>just stuff.</v>

1041
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

1042
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:33.423
<v Speaker 3>He's like a Zombie.</v>

1043
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:34.940
<v Speaker 3>He got wheel kicked a couple of times.</v>

1044
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not the club in the back of the head would wheel kicks.</v>

1045
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:37.940
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1046
00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:38.690
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

1047
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:39.523
<v Speaker 3>Not Today.</v>

1048
00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Just constantly charging forward.</v>

1049
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 3>He's</v>

1050
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.030
<v Speaker 2>a fucking tank.</v>

1051
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Terrifying guy.</v>

1052
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:47.670
<v Speaker 2>But this is the fight.</v>

1053
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.530
<v Speaker 2>To me that's the most intriguing.</v>

1054
00:26:49.531 --> 00:26:50.850
<v Speaker 2>Other than him fighting Conor,</v>

1055
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.590
<v Speaker 2>him fighting Conor for the name value.</v>

1056
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:53.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like chaos,</v>

1057
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:53.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1058
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Like Holy Shit.</v>

1059
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:55.830
<v Speaker 2>Like they might do that.</v>

1060
00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:56.630
<v Speaker 2>If he wins,</v>

1061
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:57.211
<v Speaker 2>he might do that.</v>

1062
00:26:57.211 --> 00:26:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Do that Russia,</v>

1063
00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:58.561
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1064
00:26:58.561 --> 00:26:59.130
<v Speaker 2>if they do that,</v>

1065
00:26:59.130 --> 00:26:59.491
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>

1066
00:26:59.491 --> 00:27:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Connor better bring his own food.</v>

1067
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I tell you that.</v>

1068
00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1069
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:04.710
<v Speaker 2>better bring some fucking corn,</v>

1070
00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:06.480
<v Speaker 2>beef and cabbage right from the motherland.</v>

1071
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.210
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to take any chances.</v>

1072
00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.220
<v Speaker 2>But when Khabib,</v>

1073
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:13.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1074
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.330
<v Speaker 2>when Khabib's fighting Tony,</v>

1075
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.420
<v Speaker 2>the thing about Tony is that Tony so creative,</v>

1076
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.220
<v Speaker 2>like he's very unpredictable.</v>

1077
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.460
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what he might step in and throw an upward elbow.</v>

1078
00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:23.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1079
00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.160
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1080
00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:24.401
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1081
00:27:24.401 --> 00:27:25.740
<v Speaker 2>he'll do all kinds of weird shit.</v>

1082
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.150
<v Speaker 2>He'll do Granby rolls on you.</v>

1083
00:27:27.151 --> 00:27:28.410
<v Speaker 2>He'll die for a leg.</v>

1084
00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:28.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1085
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.510
<v Speaker 2>he might try to take Khabib down.</v>

1086
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.520
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what he's going to do and stand up.</v>

1087
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.500
<v Speaker 2>He's got legit knockout power,</v>

1088
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:35.250
<v Speaker 2>legit.</v>

1089
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:36.480
<v Speaker 2>And he can take a shot.</v>

1090
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Rolls with punches real well,</v>

1091
00:27:38.081 --> 00:27:38.851
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mind.</v>

1092
00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:39.870
<v Speaker 2>When he gets hit hard,</v>

1093
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.370
<v Speaker 2>he just kind of rolls with Shit,</v>

1094
00:27:41.371 --> 00:27:43.440
<v Speaker 2>comes back like the Barboza fight.</v>

1095
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.290
<v Speaker 2>The Barboza fight with him was a very interesting fight.</v>

1096
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1097
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:47.371
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1098
00:27:47.371 --> 00:27:48.840
<v Speaker 2>that fight was fun to watch.</v>

1099
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:49.471
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't,</v>

1100
00:27:49.471 --> 00:27:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember all the details right now,</v>

1101
00:27:51.481 --> 00:27:52.530
<v Speaker 2>but I remember thinking,</v>

1102
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.520
<v Speaker 2>I remember tweeting,</v>

1103
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.271
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1104
00:27:54.271 --> 00:27:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching this and these guys are savages.</v>

1105
00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:56.620
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1106
00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:57.300
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1107
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.230
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I thought one of these days I have bad daddy can steal.</v>

1108
00:28:01.231 --> 00:28:01.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1109
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:02.131
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1110
00:28:02.131 --> 00:28:02.964
<v Speaker 2>I fought them both.</v>

1111
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:06.901
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1112
00:28:06.901 --> 00:28:07.191
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1113
00:28:07.191 --> 00:28:08.550
<v Speaker 2>that fight was fun to watch.</v>

1114
00:28:08.551 --> 00:28:08.911
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1115
00:28:08.911 --> 00:28:11.760
<v Speaker 2>that's that common opponent thing that you say and yeah.</v>

1116
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:12.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1117
00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.370
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things also though,</v>

1118
00:28:14.371 --> 00:28:16.950
<v Speaker 2>because you know the rule fighter ABC,</v>

1119
00:28:16.951 --> 00:28:19.080
<v Speaker 2>that thing doesn't play out like stout beats,</v>

1120
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.060
<v Speaker 2>like stat Jeremy Stevens beats down.</v>

1121
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:22.920
<v Speaker 2>I'd beat Jeremy and Jeremy.</v>

1122
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:23.791
<v Speaker 2>That would be,</v>

1123
00:28:23.791 --> 00:28:24.181
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

1124
00:28:24.181 --> 00:28:25.410
<v Speaker 2>it's this crazy,</v>

1125
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.660
<v Speaker 2>crazy thing where it just doesn't add up.</v>

1126
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.553
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't add up.</v>

1127
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.011
<v Speaker 2>MMA.</v>

1128
00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Math just doesn't work.</v>

1129
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:34.920
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why someone like a could be so impressive.</v>

1130
00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:36.270
<v Speaker 2>It's cause he beats everybody.</v>

1131
00:28:36.271 --> 00:28:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Everyone undefeated.</v>

1132
00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:37.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1133
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.770
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck is undefeated at that level?</v>

1134
00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:40.380
<v Speaker 2>The game,</v>

1135
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:45.380
<v Speaker 2>I think he has 25 victories is f five and 25 at Oh him and that's the other</v>

1136
00:28:45.781 --> 00:28:47.520
<v Speaker 2>thing like I still called John Jay.</v>

1137
00:28:47.521 --> 00:28:50.160
<v Speaker 2>I called him one defeated because Jon Jones,</v>

1138
00:28:50.161 --> 00:28:52.400
<v Speaker 2>he's undefeated in my book cause nonsense.</v>

1139
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.190
<v Speaker 2>You know when when you get smashed.</v>

1140
00:28:54.191 --> 00:28:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1141
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:55.950
<v Speaker 2>He dominated that fight.</v>

1142
00:28:55.951 --> 00:28:57.860
<v Speaker 2>100% was a,</v>

1143
00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:01.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a goofy rule and I don't even know if he totally violated it.</v>

1144
00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's trying to get through the guard while he's finishing a guy guys</v>

1145
00:29:05.671 --> 00:29:07.860
<v Speaker 2>covering up stupid.</v>

1146
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:09.211
<v Speaker 2>It makes me mad.</v>

1147
00:29:09.211 --> 00:29:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it hit a nerve.</v>

1148
00:29:10.111 --> 00:29:12.080
<v Speaker 2>It that one time at the 12 to six help.</v>

1149
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:15.330
<v Speaker 2>It makes me mad because it makes me mad because it's still there because they</v>

1150
00:29:15.331 --> 00:29:18.420
<v Speaker 2>changed the rules like they went through this new unified rule system.</v>

1151
00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1152
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:19.613
<v Speaker 2>oh this is good.</v>

1153
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.490
<v Speaker 2>We have some new regulations as far as like putting your hand on the mat and</v>

1154
00:29:23.491 --> 00:29:23.970
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>

1155
00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.020
<v Speaker 2>taking a knee,</v>

1156
00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:25.701
<v Speaker 2>you know like when,</v>

1157
00:29:25.701 --> 00:29:26.740
<v Speaker 2>when can you hit a guy with a knee?</v>

1158
00:29:26.741 --> 00:29:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Now it's one hand,</v>

1159
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.160
<v Speaker 2>now you can do it with one hand.</v>

1160
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

1161
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:30.743
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

1162
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.130
<v Speaker 2>What Donna's 12,</v>

1163
00:29:32.131 --> 00:29:34.740
<v Speaker 2>six elbows still in c,</v>

1164
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:35.520
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

1165
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.250
<v Speaker 2>here's what I've learned since I've retired,</v>

1166
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:40.980
<v Speaker 2>is that all of these formulas fit into something.</v>

1167
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 2>So right now</v>

1168
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:42.820
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1169
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.020
<v Speaker 3>well you change this one thing,</v>

1170
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:45.520
<v Speaker 3>will all this other shit is wrong?</v>

1171
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.001
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1172
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:47.980
<v Speaker 3>you look at society and you look at the world,</v>

1173
00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:48.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1174
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:51.490
<v Speaker 3>And like these little changes or what happens,</v>

1175
00:29:51.491 --> 00:29:52.324
<v Speaker 3>it's never,</v>

1176
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.060
<v Speaker 3>everything that's wrong is in fixed at all times.</v>

1177
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:57.040
<v Speaker 3>It's always as one little things fixed.</v>

1178
00:29:57.041 --> 00:29:58.230
<v Speaker 3>This other little things fixed.</v>

1179
00:29:58.231 --> 00:29:59.064
<v Speaker 3>There's a little things,</v>

1180
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.183
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1181
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:01.870
<v Speaker 3>So it's gonna take a while.</v>

1182
00:30:01.871 --> 00:30:03.010
<v Speaker 3>It'll happen eventually.</v>

1183
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:03.880
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>

1184
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.200
<v Speaker 3>there is so much in the,</v>

1185
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.570
<v Speaker 3>like there should be something that changes every year.</v>

1186
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:08.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1187
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:08.860
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

1188
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:09.490
<v Speaker 3>I think they,</v>

1189
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.500
<v Speaker 3>they've got to figure out something with the I pokes.</v>

1190
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:12.933
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1191
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.210
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's,</v>

1192
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:17.351
<v Speaker 3>I think some,</v>

1193
00:30:17.351 --> 00:30:17.670
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

1194
00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:18.371
<v Speaker 3>he might have been you.</v>

1195
00:30:18.371 --> 00:30:18.701
<v Speaker 3>I feel,</v>

1196
00:30:18.701 --> 00:30:19.031
<v Speaker 3>cause it was,</v>

1197
00:30:19.031 --> 00:30:19.321
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1198
00:30:19.321 --> 00:30:19.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1199
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.760
<v Speaker 3>an announcer or a commentator or something talking about it,</v>

1200
00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:22.600
<v Speaker 3>but having like a,</v>

1201
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.240
<v Speaker 3>a glove just to covers the fingers,</v>

1202
00:30:25.241 --> 00:30:26.710
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't really change anything.</v>

1203
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:27.130
<v Speaker 3>Even,</v>

1204
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:32.020
<v Speaker 3>even so much so that like it's a webbing and that your fingers are still</v>

1205
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:33.340
<v Speaker 3>virtually individual,</v>

1206
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1207
00:30:34.091 --> 00:30:37.120
<v Speaker 3>but you can bring them all down together or you can just put those two on and</v>

1208
00:30:37.121 --> 00:30:38.440
<v Speaker 3>these two are going to be tugged that,</v>

1209
00:30:38.441 --> 00:30:39.520
<v Speaker 3>but it takes no effort.</v>

1210
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:39.750
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1211
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:40.583
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1212
00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.170
<v Speaker 3>Some things that are covering like that with the padding over the front so that</v>

1213
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.050
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't go in the eyes as a single point.</v>

1214
00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:48.603
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1215
00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:54.700
<v Speaker 3>is there anybody even playing with prototypes or something like that and doing</v>

1216
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.370
<v Speaker 3>an exhibition or demonstration to,</v>

1217
00:30:57.371 --> 00:30:58.080
<v Speaker 3>good question.</v>

1218
00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:58.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1219
00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.860
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen anything compelling.</v>

1220
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.660
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen anybody come up with anything.</v>

1221
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:02.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1222
00:31:02.051 --> 00:31:02.771
<v Speaker 3>It was my idea.</v>

1223
00:31:02.771 --> 00:31:04.210
<v Speaker 3>My idea was to have it like,</v>

1224
00:31:04.211 --> 00:31:04.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1225
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.673
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1226
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:06.700
<v Speaker 3>like uh,</v>

1227
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:07.720
<v Speaker 3>like old school,</v>

1228
00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:08.350
<v Speaker 3>bad glove.</v>

1229
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:09.221
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1231
00:31:09.221 --> 00:31:09.471
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1232
00:31:09.471 --> 00:31:14.400
<v Speaker 3>like Joe Lewis with those old school bad gloves because it's a very thin glove.</v>

1233
00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.680
<v Speaker 3>They would cover the tips and they used to hit the bag with them back in like</v>

1234
00:31:17.681 --> 00:31:18.514
<v Speaker 3>the fucking twenties.</v>

1235
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1236
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.440
<v Speaker 3>It was just like leather and,</v>

1237
00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.240
<v Speaker 3>and maybe maybe that's what it is.</v>

1238
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:22.541
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1239
00:31:22.541 --> 00:31:23.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1240
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:26.940
<v Speaker 3>Keith still got love and just kind of a topping of that type of thing.</v>

1241
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.540
<v Speaker 3>That makes so much sense.</v>

1242
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:28.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1243
00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.640
<v Speaker 3>Why would the tips of the fingers,</v>

1244
00:31:30.641 --> 00:31:32.110
<v Speaker 3>like you don't in grappling,</v>

1245
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.640
<v Speaker 3>you never use individual,</v>

1246
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:34.690
<v Speaker 3>no cop.</v>

1247
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.340
<v Speaker 3>Everything is done like this.</v>

1248
00:31:36.341 --> 00:31:36.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1249
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:37.780
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't change anything.</v>

1250
00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.651
<v Speaker 3>Nothing at all.</v>

1251
00:31:38.651 --> 00:31:40.310
<v Speaker 3>And change a single thing though.</v>

1252
00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:41.800
<v Speaker 3>The only thing it changes is,</v>

1253
00:31:41.801 --> 00:31:43.450
<v Speaker 3>is yeah,</v>

1254
00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:43.841
<v Speaker 3>cause he,</v>

1255
00:31:43.841 --> 00:31:44.840
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even change this.</v>

1256
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:45.260
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1257
00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:45.470
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1258
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm still here.</v>

1259
00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:47.500
<v Speaker 3>It makes it better honestly.</v>

1260
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:48.430
<v Speaker 3>You have more grip.</v>

1261
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:48.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1262
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.050
<v Speaker 3>Like if it's like a,</v>

1263
00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:50.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1264
00:31:50.561 --> 00:31:51.450
<v Speaker 3>like um,</v>

1265
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.410
<v Speaker 3>suede material,</v>

1266
00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:54.520
<v Speaker 3>like something that's a little rough,</v>

1267
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.020
<v Speaker 3>you could actually get good.</v>

1268
00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1269
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.340
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

1270
00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:01.710
<v Speaker 3>It would help grappling because gloves definitely hurt some submissions they get</v>

1271
00:32:01.711 --> 00:32:03.100
<v Speaker 3>in the way of rear naked chokes.</v>

1272
00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:08.050
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the reasons why Georgia submission over Bisping was so impressive</v>

1273
00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:09.520
<v Speaker 3>because he went this way.</v>

1274
00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:09.941
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1275
00:32:09.941 --> 00:32:12.370
<v Speaker 3>he went deep back of the hand to the back of the neck,</v>

1276
00:32:12.371 --> 00:32:13.240
<v Speaker 3>the real way,</v>

1277
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.660
<v Speaker 3>which you don't sometimes you don't see because the guy can't get the glove in</v>

1278
00:32:16.661 --> 00:32:16.900
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1279
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:17.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1280
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:18.280
<v Speaker 3>That's the one that's on the,</v>

1281
00:32:18.281 --> 00:32:20.210
<v Speaker 3>on the display image of like,</v>

1282
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:21.040
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1283
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.360
<v Speaker 3>of Jujitsu jokes.</v>

1284
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean that one was fucking tight.</v>

1285
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.660
<v Speaker 3>That was crazy to watch George dude.</v>

1286
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:28.781
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1287
00:32:28.781 --> 00:32:30.040
<v Speaker 3>they've got to figure out something.</v>

1288
00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.630
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to have these open,</v>

1289
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.340
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't affect risk control.</v>

1290
00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.880
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't affect any kind of grappling in,</v>

1291
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.060
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1292
00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.450
<v Speaker 3>in fact it would make it better.</v>

1293
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.580
<v Speaker 3>What does bell tour?</v>

1294
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:39.893
<v Speaker 3>There's one.</v>

1295
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:41.091
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1296
00:32:41.091 --> 00:32:42.110
<v Speaker 5>Bella tour has done,</v>

1297
00:32:42.111 --> 00:32:43.370
<v Speaker 5>what pride did you,</v>

1298
00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.360
<v Speaker 5>are they curved it?</v>

1299
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:44.901
<v Speaker 5>I like it.</v>

1300
00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:45.950
<v Speaker 5>They use an Everlast.</v>

1301
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.780
<v Speaker 5>Everlast is their glove manufacturer.</v>

1302
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.880
<v Speaker 5>Obviously they make fucking killer shit,</v>

1303
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:51.470
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

1304
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:54.290
<v Speaker 5>what they're doing is having it so it's,</v>

1305
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:56.870
<v Speaker 5>it's more difficult to open your fingers up.</v>

1306
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:57.770
<v Speaker 5>That's a smart move.</v>

1307
00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.320
<v Speaker 5>It's a little little thicker.</v>

1308
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.180
<v Speaker 5>So you didn't see a lot of,</v>

1309
00:33:02.181 --> 00:33:02.750
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1310
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:03.790
<v Speaker 5>I tried.</v>

1311
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:04.281
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1312
00:33:04.281 --> 00:33:04.850
<v Speaker 5>you didn't.</v>

1313
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:05.511
<v Speaker 5>That's the point,</v>

1314
00:33:05.511 --> 00:33:05.741
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1315
00:33:05.741 --> 00:33:05.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1316
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:06.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1317
00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:06.950
<v Speaker 5>It was very,</v>

1318
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:08.480
<v Speaker 5>it was the UFC,</v>

1319
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:09.680
<v Speaker 5>those gloves,</v>

1320
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.650
<v Speaker 5>it's almost harder to close than it is to,</v>

1321
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:13.430
<v Speaker 5>to open them.</v>

1322
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:14.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1323
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:14.893
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

1324
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:16.011
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

1325
00:33:16.011 --> 00:33:18.020
<v Speaker 5>I feel like maybe it was just the commission,</v>

1326
00:33:18.021 --> 00:33:18.854
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like,</v>

1327
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:19.401
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1328
00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:21.880
<v Speaker 5>you always break it gloves then you tried to break a man and let,</v>

1329
00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.240
<v Speaker 5>cause they're stiff when you first get them.</v>

1330
00:33:23.241 --> 00:33:23.870
<v Speaker 5>They're new.</v>

1331
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:24.260
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1332
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.730
<v Speaker 5>but there was at least one commission.</v>

1333
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:25.900
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1334
00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.050
<v Speaker 5>they wouldn't even let us like,</v>

1335
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:27.321
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1336
00:33:27.321 --> 00:33:29.910
<v Speaker 5>break the gloves and they wouldn't give you the gloves you had.</v>

1337
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.550
<v Speaker 5>You didn't get them until you put them on.</v>

1338
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.040
<v Speaker 5>That must be some amateur shit.</v>

1339
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:35.270
<v Speaker 5>Like some commission.</v>

1340
00:33:35.271 --> 00:33:36.380
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't know what they're doing yet.</v>

1341
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.060
<v Speaker 5>You all commission doesn't know what they're doing.</v>

1342
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.331
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>

1343
00:33:38.331 --> 00:33:39.164
<v Speaker 5>not the commission.</v>

1344
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:39.920
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1345
00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.300
<v Speaker 5>the hospitals after the,</v>

1346
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:43.670
<v Speaker 5>after the fight itself in New York,</v>

1347
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:45.620
<v Speaker 5>really mad in Brooklyn.</v>

1348
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.180
<v Speaker 5>I had the,</v>

1349
00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:46.371
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1350
00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:47.204
<v Speaker 5>the crazy,</v>

1351
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.991
<v Speaker 5>well I had,</v>

1352
00:33:47.991 --> 00:33:48.620
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't me.</v>

1353
00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.410
<v Speaker 5>Dustin poray had the craziest trip.</v>

1354
00:33:51.411 --> 00:33:52.220
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

1355
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.220
<v Speaker 5>so after that fight with Jim Miller with all those shin cakes,</v>

1356
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:55.851
<v Speaker 5>they were both,</v>

1357
00:33:55.851 --> 00:34:00.080
<v Speaker 5>they both went to the hospital with a calf kicks and I'm Dustin's calf and Shin</v>

1358
00:34:00.081 --> 00:34:01.580
<v Speaker 5>was swollen and they will,</v>

1359
00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:03.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm giving him some morphine and truck.</v>

1360
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.140
<v Speaker 5>We got there and they,</v>

1361
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:09.200
<v Speaker 5>the doctor came in and they wanted to perform a surgery on him there.</v>

1362
00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:11.420
<v Speaker 5>They wanted to slice his shin open,</v>

1363
00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:12.770
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1364
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:15.500
<v Speaker 5>and relieve the pressure because they were saying,</v>

1365
00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:19.670
<v Speaker 5>you're going to lose nerve tissue and your nerves are going to die.</v>

1366
00:34:19.671 --> 00:34:20.120
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1367
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:20.781
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>

1368
00:34:20.781 --> 00:34:20.961
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1369
00:34:20.961 --> 00:34:22.580
<v Speaker 5>if you start not feeling when they go,</v>

1370
00:34:22.581 --> 00:34:23.031
<v Speaker 5>there's no,</v>

1371
00:34:23.031 --> 00:34:23.900
<v Speaker 5>and there's no coming back.</v>

1372
00:34:23.901 --> 00:34:25.270
<v Speaker 5>You can't fix it.</v>

1373
00:34:25.271 --> 00:34:26.330
<v Speaker 5>You can't fix those things.</v>

1374
00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.530
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1375
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.070
<v Speaker 5>they were really pushing for this thing.</v>

1376
00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.740
<v Speaker 5>It was just a crazy situation.</v>

1377
00:34:30.741 --> 00:34:30.951
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1378
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:31.491
<v Speaker 5>So we're like,</v>

1379
00:34:31.491 --> 00:34:31.671
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1380
00:34:31.671 --> 00:34:32.091
<v Speaker 5>Dustin,</v>

1381
00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:32.420
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1382
00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.810
<v Speaker 5>And then I called Mike Brown back then and we started having this discussion</v>

1383
00:34:35.811 --> 00:34:36.644
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

1384
00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.460
<v Speaker 5>it's just like,</v>

1385
00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.211
<v Speaker 5>it's leg kicks.</v>

1386
00:34:38.211 --> 00:34:40.270
<v Speaker 5>We've seen this all the time and the thigh and whatnot.</v>

1387
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:40.561
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1388
00:34:40.561 --> 00:34:41.560
<v Speaker 5>when they're not in,</v>

1389
00:34:41.561 --> 00:34:42.021
<v Speaker 5>Dustin was like,</v>

1390
00:34:42.021 --> 00:34:42.141
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1391
00:34:42.141 --> 00:34:42.974
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to do that.</v>

1392
00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.120
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1393
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.110
<v Speaker 5>then they started,</v>

1394
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.711
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>

1395
00:34:45.711 --> 00:34:45.801
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1396
00:34:45.801 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 5>I want to get out of here basically.</v>

1397
00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:48.140
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>

1398
00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:49.400
<v Speaker 5>can I just have something for the pain?</v>

1399
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.050
<v Speaker 5>And it felt like they were like,</v>

1400
00:34:51.051 --> 00:34:51.884
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1401
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.461
<v Speaker 5>They said,</v>

1402
00:34:52.461 --> 00:34:53.270
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1403
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.760
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to let you leave here on pain medication.</v>

1404
00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:00.380
<v Speaker 5>And I felt like they were trying to keep him the entice him to stay fucking pain</v>

1405
00:35:00.381 --> 00:35:01.214
<v Speaker 5>medication.</v>

1406
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.860
<v Speaker 5>It was just a really weird situation.</v>

1407
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.160
<v Speaker 5>And we were there for way too long and they were really pushing for this like</v>

1408
00:35:07.161 --> 00:35:08.470
<v Speaker 5>three or four different doc.</v>

1409
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.620
<v Speaker 5>No three different doctors came in and trying to convince him to get this</v>

1410
00:35:12.621 --> 00:35:13.454
<v Speaker 5>surgery done.</v>

1411
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:14.330
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1412
00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:15.170
<v Speaker 5>It was crazy.</v>

1413
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.720
<v Speaker 5>Just for some swelling to swelling in the calf.</v>

1414
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:19.970
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

1415
00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:20.893
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't,</v>

1416
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:25.790
<v Speaker 5>I honestly think that it would cause nerve damage to have so much swelling.</v>

1417
00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:32.690
<v Speaker 5>The swelling was pushing up against the blood vessel supposedly.</v>

1418
00:35:32.691 --> 00:35:34.310
<v Speaker 5>And there wasn't,</v>

1419
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:34.850
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1420
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 5>circulation coming through that to what was,</v>

1421
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1422
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.491
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

1423
00:35:38.491 --> 00:35:39.310
<v Speaker 5>this is what I,</v>

1424
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:40.890
<v Speaker 5>and this is a over a year ago,</v>

1425
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:42.420
<v Speaker 5>so I'm trying to remember exactly.</v>

1426
00:35:42.421 --> 00:35:43.370
<v Speaker 5>And I'm not a met,</v>

1427
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:44.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a doctor.</v>

1428
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.653
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1429
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.820
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

1430
00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.870
<v Speaker 5>the swell and they were asking him about,</v>

1431
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:49.260
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1432
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.400
<v Speaker 5>cause he was having some,</v>

1433
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.620
<v Speaker 5>some loss of sensation right.</v>

1434
00:35:52.621 --> 00:35:53.580
<v Speaker 5>And his toes,</v>

1435
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.290
<v Speaker 5>but he had just fought,</v>

1436
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:56.161
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1437
00:35:56.161 --> 00:35:57.930
<v Speaker 5>and they'd given him morphine and all this other stuff.</v>

1438
00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:58.441
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1439
00:35:58.441 --> 00:35:58.800
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1440
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.900
<v Speaker 5>maybe no poking at his toes with a pin or something.</v>

1441
00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:02.250
<v Speaker 5>You feel that he feel that and he's like,</v>

1442
00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:02.490
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1443
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:03.270
<v Speaker 5>a little bit.</v>

1444
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.060
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1445
00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.550
<v Speaker 5>you know these different answers.</v>

1446
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.540
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1447
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.040
<v Speaker 5>they would,</v>

1448
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.670
<v Speaker 5>they claim to be concerned about it.</v>

1449
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.410
<v Speaker 5>They were telling him that this is what,</v>

1450
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.530
<v Speaker 5>this is a possibility and this is what's going to happen and we want to prevent</v>

1451
00:36:13.531 --> 00:36:14.364
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1452
00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:15.331
<v Speaker 5>They weren't like,</v>

1453
00:36:15.331 --> 00:36:17.610
<v Speaker 5>well this is guaranteed that this is what's going on.</v>

1454
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.700
<v Speaker 5>This is just the realistic possibility and we want to prevent it.</v>

1455
00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.230
<v Speaker 5>And it was just like,</v>

1456
00:36:22.231 --> 00:36:25.560
<v Speaker 5>he wanted to wait as long as possible and they were just,</v>

1457
00:36:25.561 --> 00:36:28.410
<v Speaker 5>they just seem to be really pushy about wanting to do this.</v>

1458
00:36:28.411 --> 00:36:30.750
<v Speaker 5>So where would they're going to make the incision in?</v>

1459
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:32.400
<v Speaker 5>In the Shin</v>

1460
00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:35.423
<v Speaker 5>up the shin.</v>

1461
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.473
<v Speaker 5>How big?</v>

1462
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:37.913
<v Speaker 5>It was big.</v>

1463
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.480
<v Speaker 5>It was just as long as my phone.</v>

1464
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.200
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

1465
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.180
<v Speaker 5>So that list instead.</v>

1466
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.510
<v Speaker 5>That's why we were like,</v>

1467
00:36:42.511 --> 00:36:42.721
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1468
00:36:42.721 --> 00:36:43.800
<v Speaker 5>this is kind of crazy.</v>

1469
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.200
<v Speaker 5>And they were just want to drain it and they want to drain it.</v>

1470
00:36:46.201 --> 00:36:47.610
<v Speaker 5>They want to release the pressure.</v>

1471
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.390
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1472
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:49.440
<v Speaker 5>And then they were like,</v>

1473
00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:49.591
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1474
00:36:49.591 --> 00:36:49.950
<v Speaker 5>we can,</v>

1475
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:51.390
<v Speaker 5>there's a test that we can do.</v>

1476
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:52.920
<v Speaker 5>You can't really see it from that angle.</v>

1477
00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.000
<v Speaker 5>But then it was so much worse than the hospital.</v>

1478
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:56.880
<v Speaker 5>They were like,</v>

1479
00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:57.151
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1480
00:36:57.151 --> 00:36:57.391
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1481
00:36:57.391 --> 00:36:57.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1482
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.991
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1483
00:36:57.991 --> 00:36:58.920
<v Speaker 5>when Dustin was like,</v>

1484
00:36:58.921 --> 00:36:59.191
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1485
00:36:59.191 --> 00:37:00.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't like that idea.</v>

1486
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.051
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to do that.</v>

1487
00:37:01.051 --> 00:37:01.430
<v Speaker 5>And they were,</v>

1488
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:02.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that let's just wait.</v>

1489
00:37:02.701 --> 00:37:03.121
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

1490
00:37:03.121 --> 00:37:03.281
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1491
00:37:03.281 --> 00:37:03.721
<v Speaker 5>they were like,</v>

1492
00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:04.320
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1493
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.640
<v Speaker 5>there's a thing that we can do,</v>

1494
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.620
<v Speaker 5>but we have to take a needle.</v>

1495
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.720
<v Speaker 5>And they wanted to take a neat along needle,</v>

1496
00:37:09.721 --> 00:37:11.010
<v Speaker 5>stick it into his leg,</v>

1497
00:37:11.011 --> 00:37:14.610
<v Speaker 5>past the bone into the muscle and like do a pressure test on it.</v>

1498
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:15.991
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>

1499
00:37:15.991 --> 00:37:16.171
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1500
00:37:16.171 --> 00:37:17.004
<v Speaker 5>I don't like,</v>

1501
00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.230
<v Speaker 5>it was crazy because he doesn't like needles.</v>

1502
00:37:19.231 --> 00:37:19.710
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1503
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:20.770
<v Speaker 5>That's the HDLs.</v>

1504
00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:21.421
<v Speaker 5>And I'll be like,</v>

1505
00:37:21.421 --> 00:37:25.050
<v Speaker 5>all these title fights were living scared of needles.</v>

1506
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.850
<v Speaker 5>I'm the same way about needles,</v>

1507
00:37:26.851 --> 00:37:28.350
<v Speaker 5>but I don't have the tattoos that kid has,</v>

1508
00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.640
<v Speaker 5>but he's just like,</v>

1509
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:30.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to do that.</v>

1510
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:31.531
<v Speaker 5>I don't want like,</v>

1511
00:37:31.531 --> 00:37:31.951
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

1512
00:37:31.951 --> 00:37:32.101
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1513
00:37:32.101 --> 00:37:35.430
<v Speaker 5>cause they wanted it would have been this much in it inside his shit.</v>

1514
00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:37.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1515
00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:38.610
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how long it would have been,</v>

1516
00:37:38.611 --> 00:37:40.160
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't.</v>

1517
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:40.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1518
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.430
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't just like looking for vein and they were just testing for pressure.</v>

1519
00:37:44.431 --> 00:37:44.770
<v Speaker 5>They will,</v>

1520
00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:47.850
<v Speaker 5>they will like talk and they was saying they wanted to test her tire gauge in</v>

1521
00:37:47.851 --> 00:37:50.040
<v Speaker 5>there and showed exactly doing</v>

1522
00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:52.771
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1523
00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:53.280
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1524
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.330
<v Speaker 5>so anyway,</v>

1525
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.710
<v Speaker 5>they didn't happen.</v>

1526
00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:56.870
<v Speaker 5>The dust we started,</v>

1527
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.210
<v Speaker 5>Dustin's started getting frustrated and,</v>

1528
00:37:58.211 --> 00:37:58.510
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1529
00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:00.360
<v Speaker 5>and they really pushing for it.</v>

1530
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:04.410
<v Speaker 5>It was late at night and I don't think I was helping the situation because I was</v>

1531
00:38:04.411 --> 00:38:05.070
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1532
00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:06.330
<v Speaker 5>these guys are probably interns.</v>

1533
00:38:06.331 --> 00:38:08.760
<v Speaker 5>They probably back there with like a chart and they're like,</v>

1534
00:38:08.761 --> 00:38:09.120
<v Speaker 5>they get,</v>

1535
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.690
<v Speaker 5>they get bonus points for whatever surgery that he can,</v>

1536
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.863
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1537
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:13.741
<v Speaker 5>you never know,</v>

1538
00:38:13.741 --> 00:38:14.280
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1539
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.860
<v Speaker 5>People are really skeptical about our kind of stuff.</v>

1540
00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:18.360
<v Speaker 5>But you know what I mean?</v>

1541
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.530
<v Speaker 5>They definitely do surgeries on people that you don't have to.</v>

1542
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.640
<v Speaker 5>Some doctors too.</v>

1543
00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.080
<v Speaker 5>It definitely can happen.</v>

1544
00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:25.241
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1545
00:38:25.241 --> 00:38:27.420
<v Speaker 5>you'd hope that you're not running into one of those doctors,</v>

1546
00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:28.710
<v Speaker 5>but they have done it before.</v>

1547
00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:29.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1548
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.220
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a doctor that got just got arrested recently and there was a</v>

1549
00:38:33.221 --> 00:38:37.030
<v Speaker 5>whole story about all the different surgeries that he did that he didn't have to</v>

1550
00:38:37.031 --> 00:38:40.600
<v Speaker 5>do and including cancer surgeries,</v>

1551
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.420
<v Speaker 5>like he removed cancer on people that didn't even have cancer.</v>

1552
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:43.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1553
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.381
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1554
00:38:44.381 --> 00:38:44.681
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1555
00:38:44.681 --> 00:38:45.550
<v Speaker 5>that's a scam.</v>

1556
00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:46.930
<v Speaker 5>Just started driving fat.</v>

1557
00:38:46.931 --> 00:38:49.270
<v Speaker 5>Mercedes got to make those payments.</v>

1558
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.670
<v Speaker 5>He should just got into the plastic surgery business.</v>

1559
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:52.121
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

1560
00:38:52.121 --> 00:38:52.760
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1561
00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.060
<v Speaker 5>Do you could talk those crazy ladies into to anything,</v>

1562
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.350
<v Speaker 5>anything and everything.</v>

1563
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.310
<v Speaker 5>You need some unique,</v>

1564
00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:58.950
<v Speaker 5>you need to take some of that meat out of your button.</v>

1565
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.823
<v Speaker 5>Putting your lips.</v>

1566
00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:00.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1567
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:01.960
<v Speaker 5>That's the move.</v>

1568
00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:03.790
<v Speaker 5>Meaty Buck Lips.</v>

1569
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:07.660
<v Speaker 5>So will they ice in the Shin the entire time?</v>

1570
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.350
<v Speaker 5>They were.</v>

1571
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:09.310
<v Speaker 5>They had ice on it.</v>

1572
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:10.150
<v Speaker 5>They had a drip,</v>

1573
00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:12.760
<v Speaker 5>like a morphine drip to kill the pain.</v>

1574
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.540
<v Speaker 5>Why didn't they just wait a couple of days while they want to just go right into</v>

1575
00:39:16.541 --> 00:39:17.051
<v Speaker 5>it right now?</v>

1576
00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:17.884
<v Speaker 5>They wanted,</v>

1577
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:20.520
<v Speaker 5>they wanted to do it that night and they,</v>

1578
00:39:20.521 --> 00:39:21.041
<v Speaker 5>they said,</v>

1579
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:24.550
<v Speaker 5>they said they didn't want or the reason why they didn't want to wait was</v>

1580
00:39:24.551 --> 00:39:27.190
<v Speaker 5>because when the nerve nerve damage happens,</v>

1581
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.240
<v Speaker 5>when the nerves die,</v>

1582
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

1583
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:29.410
<v Speaker 5>They're debt.</v>

1584
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:30.243
<v Speaker 5>There's no way to,</v>

1585
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.083
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1586
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.040
<v Speaker 5>to bring those things back.</v>

1587
00:39:33.041 --> 00:39:34.860
<v Speaker 5>So man,</v>

1588
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:36.550
<v Speaker 5>I just uh,</v>

1589
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.250
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what if that's right.</v>

1590
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be taught at shit about the doctors.</v>

1591
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:46.510
<v Speaker 5>It's not right because Dustin fought again after that.</v>

1592
00:39:46.511 --> 00:39:48.840
<v Speaker 5>Eddie both flag and he's fighting in a few weeks.</v>

1593
00:39:48.841 --> 00:39:50.140
<v Speaker 5>Like when was his leg better?</v>

1594
00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:51.580
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1595
00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:51.971

1596
00:39:51.971 --> 00:39:53.920

1597
00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:55.090
<v Speaker 5>so I had a hat.</v>

1598
00:39:55.091 --> 00:39:56.500
<v Speaker 5>Real quick little side note.</v>

1599
00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:57.810
<v Speaker 5>I had had some problems.</v>

1600
00:39:57.811 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Speaker 5>I was helping him for that camp and I had an injury and um,</v>

1601
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:05.470
<v Speaker 5>I got Tylenol with codeine in it and man,</v>

1602
00:40:05.471 --> 00:40:06.304

1604
00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:08.230
<v Speaker 5>that's powerful medicine.</v>

1605
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.210
<v Speaker 5>How powerful is that?</v>

1606
00:40:11.211 --> 00:40:11.950
<v Speaker 5>It was po.</v>

1607
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:12.401
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1608
00:40:12.401 --> 00:40:13.234
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't,</v>

1609
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:14.800
<v Speaker 5>Dustin took me to the hospital.</v>

1610
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:15.790
<v Speaker 5>I know I went in,</v>

1611
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:16.021
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

1612
00:40:16.021 --> 00:40:17.740
<v Speaker 5>I was in so much pain and they were like,</v>

1613
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.760
<v Speaker 5>they prescribed that I took one pill and about 20 minutes later I was like,</v>

1614
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.720
<v Speaker 5>it was the first time I was able to relax and like three days the pain was so</v>

1615
00:40:25.721 --> 00:40:27.190
<v Speaker 5>bad and I was like,</v>

1616
00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:28.150
<v Speaker 5>when I get bad,</v>

1617
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.280
<v Speaker 5>I got to the end of my cat,</v>

1618
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:30.040
<v Speaker 5>my thing.</v>

1619
00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.170
<v Speaker 5>I like two pills left and I was like,</v>

1620
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't need them.</v>

1621
00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:35.710
<v Speaker 5>I'll keep them in case I get hurt again,</v>

1622
00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:36.370
<v Speaker 5>some point,</v>

1623
00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:37.203
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1624
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1625
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.030
<v Speaker 5>fortunately I had them because I was like,</v>

1626
00:40:40.031 --> 00:40:40.450
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1627
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:41.111
<v Speaker 5>like this,</v>

1628
00:40:41.111 --> 00:40:41.381
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1629
00:40:41.381 --> 00:40:41.621
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1630
00:40:41.621 --> 00:40:43.540
<v Speaker 5>that pain that you're going through when you get on a plane.</v>

1631
00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:44.440
<v Speaker 5>Because I was in Japan,</v>

1632
00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:48.190
<v Speaker 5>I had busted my foot and then I had to fly 16 hours and my foot was swelling on</v>

1633
00:40:48.191 --> 00:40:49.024
<v Speaker 5>the plane,</v>

1634
00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:51.430
<v Speaker 5>the pressure of high altitude,</v>

1635
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:52.210
<v Speaker 5>it was miserable.</v>

1636
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:52.961
<v Speaker 5>It started in my,</v>

1637
00:40:52.961 --> 00:40:53.351
<v Speaker 5>in my,</v>

1638
00:40:53.351 --> 00:40:56.470
<v Speaker 5>in my foot and my ankle and it's swollen up into my Shin and calf all the way</v>

1639
00:40:56.471 --> 00:40:57.340
<v Speaker 5>down into my toes.</v>

1640
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:58.690
<v Speaker 5>But it was so,</v>

1641
00:40:58.691 --> 00:40:59.171
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1642
00:40:59.171 --> 00:40:59.441
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1643
00:40:59.441 --> 00:41:00.610
<v Speaker 5>I don't want that to happen to you.</v>

1644
00:41:00.611 --> 00:41:01.340
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>

1645
00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:01.631
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1646
00:41:01.631 --> 00:41:02.650
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be miserable,</v>

1647
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.750
<v Speaker 5>but just take this with you and take a pill,</v>

1648
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:05.440
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1649
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:05.771
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1650
00:41:05.771 --> 00:41:05.960
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1651
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.120
<v Speaker 5>he just took one pill.</v>

1652
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.800
<v Speaker 5>He said it was a great feeling.</v>

1653
00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.450
<v Speaker 5>It helped with the help with the flight.</v>

1654
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.780
<v Speaker 5>I got ahold of some of that old school nyquil back when day.</v>

1655
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.080
<v Speaker 5>I've only taken it like maybe two or three times ever in my life,</v>

1656
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:20.620
<v Speaker 5>but the last time I got some was like 20 years ago,</v>

1657
00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:21.850
<v Speaker 5>I took some,</v>

1658
00:41:21.851 --> 00:41:26.080
<v Speaker 5>I was sick and I took old school nyquil and I was lying in bed and it was like</v>

1659
00:41:26.081 --> 00:41:26.500
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

1660
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.510
<v Speaker 5>my bed was just hugging me.</v>

1661
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:32.170
<v Speaker 5>My bed was made out of love and it was just hugging me and I was like,</v>

1662
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.520
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

1663
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 5>I didn't give</v>

1664
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 3>a fuck about that cold.</v>

1665
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.370
<v Speaker 3>I was just so relaxed.</v>

1666
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Like old school.</v>

1667
00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:39.560
<v Speaker 3>NYQUIL's amazing.</v>

1668
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.120
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>

1669
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.540
<v Speaker 3>I own,</v>

1670
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:42.350
<v Speaker 3>that's coding right,</v>

1671
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:42.860
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1672
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.300
<v Speaker 3>I think coding was a Nyquil ooze.</v>

1673
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.970
<v Speaker 3>Nice man back in the day.</v>

1674
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:47.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1675
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.440
<v Speaker 3>Tito Ortiz.</v>

1676
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:49.240
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1677
00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.170
<v Speaker 3>I called Tito at one point because I was real sick.</v>

1678
00:41:51.171 --> 00:41:52.310
<v Speaker 3>I had a fight coming up too,</v>

1679
00:41:52.311 --> 00:41:52.731
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

1680
00:41:52.731 --> 00:41:53.031
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1681
00:41:53.031 --> 00:41:53.411
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1682
00:41:53.411 --> 00:41:54.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to do.</v>

1683
00:41:54.321 --> 00:41:54.920
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1684
00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.753
<v Speaker 3>here's what you do.</v>

1685
00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.300
<v Speaker 3>You take three packs a theraflu and you put that in one cup of water.</v>

1686
00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:00.343
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1687
00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:08.810
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1688
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:09.231
<v Speaker 3>so he's like,</v>

1689
00:42:09.231 --> 00:42:10.040
<v Speaker 3>you boil it,</v>

1690
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.530
<v Speaker 3>you boil the water and you pour that and you put three facts.</v>

1691
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:13.700
<v Speaker 3>Type Theraflu went there.</v>

1692
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:14.691
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1693
00:42:14.691 --> 00:42:15.524
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1694
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.120
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1695
00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.750
<v Speaker 3>I started to do it and I was like,</v>

1696
00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.081
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1697
00:42:18.081 --> 00:42:19.250
<v Speaker 3>Tito is a light heavyweight.</v>

1698
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:22.070
<v Speaker 3>That's a good move.</v>

1699
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:23.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you did that.</v>

1700
00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:24.603
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to go to,</v>

1701
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.650
<v Speaker 3>cause I was out for 18 hours.</v>

1702
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.660
<v Speaker 3>I laid down,</v>

1703
00:42:29.661 --> 00:42:31.160
<v Speaker 3>I woke up and I still,</v>

1704
00:42:31.161 --> 00:42:32.150
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I,</v>

1705
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:33.290
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want to get up.</v>

1706
00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:33.891
<v Speaker 3>And I slept.</v>

1707
00:42:33.891 --> 00:42:34.520
<v Speaker 3>I slept for,</v>

1708
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.110
<v Speaker 3>I was in bed for 18 hours.</v>

1709
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.000
<v Speaker 3>I did wake up feeling better though.</v>

1710
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Like I would imagine you probably weren't thinking about the cold at all.</v>

1711
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:42.201
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1712
00:42:42.201 --> 00:42:45.410
<v Speaker 3>So the stress was gone and you're getting that rest.</v>

1713
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.370
<v Speaker 3>You're out cold.</v>

1714
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.530
<v Speaker 3>I know I was laid out.</v>

1715
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.640
<v Speaker 3>I was one of the biggest it,</v>

1716
00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:55.190
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the best arguments for like cold medicine is that they let you go</v>

1717
00:42:55.191 --> 00:42:55.701
<v Speaker 3>to sleep.</v>

1718
00:42:55.701 --> 00:42:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Like if I'm sick and miserable,</v>

1719
00:42:57.201 --> 00:42:58.280
<v Speaker 3>I can't fucking sleep.</v>

1720
00:42:58.310 --> 00:42:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1721
00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.660
<v Speaker 3>But if you take something and you just fucking Theraflu is a good one,</v>

1722
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:03.200
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

1723
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.070
<v Speaker 3>it cleans you out.</v>

1724
00:43:04.071 --> 00:43:06.410
<v Speaker 3>Like you could breathe and just calm the fuck out.</v>

1725
00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:07.330
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1726
00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:08.570
<v Speaker 3>and isn't that when you,</v>

1727
00:43:08.571 --> 00:43:09.290
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1728
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.981
<v Speaker 3>what does this chamber,</v>

1729
00:43:09.981 --> 00:43:12.370
<v Speaker 3>that old school night call it had a pseudoephedrine Annette,</v>

1730
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.360
<v Speaker 3>which is what is used to make math.</v>

1731
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:15.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

1732
00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:17.390
<v Speaker 3>Math keep you up.</v>

1733
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:18.141
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1734
00:43:18.141 --> 00:43:18.920
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean any sense.</v>

1735
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.660
<v Speaker 3>A stimulant says sudafed.</v>

1736
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.340
<v Speaker 3>I got to Google what it was.</v>

1737
00:43:22.341 --> 00:43:22.880
<v Speaker 3>This is what,</v>

1738
00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.061
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1739
00:43:23.061 --> 00:43:24.590
<v Speaker 3>but sudafed is not nyquil.</v>

1740
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:26.360
<v Speaker 3>That's very different.</v>

1741
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:30.230
<v Speaker 3>Sudafeds a stimulant sudafed to the stuff that cleans your nose out.</v>

1742
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:30.651
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1743
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:31.160
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1744
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.520
<v Speaker 3>This is what doing like what,</v>

1745
00:43:33.521 --> 00:43:34.820
<v Speaker 3>how to pseudoephedrine Oh,</v>

1746
00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:38.690
<v Speaker 3>the reason why I called the original green death formula Nyquil's behind the</v>

1747
00:43:38.691 --> 00:43:40.670
<v Speaker 3>pharmacy counter now because gasp,</v>

1748
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.490
<v Speaker 3>it has the evil pseudoephedrine it.</v>

1749
00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:42.981
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1750
00:43:42.981 --> 00:43:44.690
<v Speaker 3>so you can buy that shit still.</v>

1751
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Some people were looking at,</v>

1752
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:48.020
<v Speaker 3>I was finding an article someone was looking for it in New York.</v>

1753
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:49.280
<v Speaker 3>That's 2013.</v>

1754
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:50.540
<v Speaker 3>I got to get a good doctor.</v>

1755
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:51.860
<v Speaker 3>Might be able to find some stuff.</v>

1756
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:54.373
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

1757
00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.390
<v Speaker 3>That stuff fucks you up.</v>

1758
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:59.090
<v Speaker 3>You go deep with that stuff.</v>

1759
00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:03.500
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the chemical that it's mixed with the pseudoephedrine is probably</v>

1760
00:44:03.501 --> 00:44:04.550
<v Speaker 3>what keeps you alive.</v>

1761
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:07.040
<v Speaker 3>Coding.</v>

1762
00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.810
<v Speaker 3>What's the drag you down into the grave.</v>

1763
00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.060
<v Speaker 3>The pseudoephedrine shit keeps you alive.</v>

1764
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:12.950
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about about sleeping though,</v>

1765
00:44:12.951 --> 00:44:13.251
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1766
00:44:13.251 --> 00:44:13.731
<v Speaker 3>That's when,</v>

1767
00:44:13.731 --> 00:44:14.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1768
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:15.223
<v Speaker 3>when your body,</v>

1769
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:18.320
<v Speaker 3>everything else is off to all your body can do is,</v>

1770
00:44:18.321 --> 00:44:18.800
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1771
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.633
<v Speaker 3>is heal.</v>

1772
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.050
<v Speaker 3>You know what else happens man.</v>

1773
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.460
<v Speaker 3>You make good decisions like that term sleep on it.</v>

1774
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:26.780
<v Speaker 3>That's not a joke.</v>

1775
00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:27.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1776
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:29.960
<v Speaker 3>There's something about going to sleep with a problem,</v>

1777
00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 3>waking up in the morning and you have a new perspective.</v>

1778
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:32.341
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1779
00:44:32.341 --> 00:44:32.510
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1780
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:33.450
<v Speaker 5>it's not that big a deal.</v>

1781
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:34.170
<v Speaker 5>Our ads,</v>

1782
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:34.980
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

1783
00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:35.813
<v Speaker 5>I don't care.</v>

1784
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.601
<v Speaker 5>Or you know,</v>

1785
00:44:36.601 --> 00:44:38.970
<v Speaker 5>or maybe I should do something about this or maybe I should apologize.</v>

1786
00:44:38.971 --> 00:44:39.670
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I should,</v>

1787
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.850
<v Speaker 5>you know something about sleeping on something.</v>

1788
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:42.810
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what it is,</v>

1789
00:44:42.811 --> 00:44:43.081
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1790
00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:47.460
<v Speaker 5>but it gives me a truer compass as to which direction I should go.</v>

1791
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:49.500
<v Speaker 5>There's a thing about that too.</v>

1792
00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:49.800
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

1793
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm sleeping on it.</v>

1794
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:52.583
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1795
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.330
<v Speaker 5>I had to teach myself some things about like car mechanics and I,</v>

1796
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.330
<v Speaker 5>I had a problem,</v>

1797
00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.231
<v Speaker 5>but it's somebody who's like,</v>

1798

1801
00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.200
<v Speaker 5>Cause my engine wouldn't stay on,</v>

1802
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:01.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1806
00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:05.610
<v Speaker 5>And I was broke.</v>

1807
00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.240
<v Speaker 5>That was in,</v>

1808

1812
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:11.160
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:15.720
<v Speaker 5>how much that cost as like too much shit.</v>

1816
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:16.290
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1817
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:16.680
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:17.761
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

1820
00:45:17.761 --> 00:45:18.241
<v Speaker 5>you can do it.</v>

00:45:18.241 --> 00:45:18.550
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>how are you going to,</v>

1823
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:19.341
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1824
00:45:19.341 --> 00:45:20.520
<v Speaker 5>I can't afford that either,</v>

1825
00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:21.840
<v Speaker 5>but if you can do it,</v>

1826
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:22.710
<v Speaker 5>I'll figure it out.</v>

1827
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.970
<v Speaker 5>So I went to the store,</v>

1828
00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:24.804
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1829
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:25.021
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1830
00:45:25.021 --> 00:45:26.550
<v Speaker 5>I need to buy an alternator for this,</v>

1831
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:27.570
<v Speaker 5>this model car.</v>

1832
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.231
<v Speaker 5>They were like,</v>

1833
00:45:28.231 --> 00:45:28.531
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1834
00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:29.670
<v Speaker 5>They bring it out and they're like,</v>

1835
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.600
<v Speaker 5>they weren't going,</v>

1836
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.910
<v Speaker 5>they weren't going to give it to me cause you have to give them the other one</v>

1837
00:45:32.911 --> 00:45:33.420
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>

1838
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.470
<v Speaker 5>You have to exchange it.</v>

1839
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:34.920
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1840
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1841
00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:38.400
<v Speaker 5>Like at least this is the way it was in like 2000 Texas,</v>

1842
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:39.210
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1843
00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:39.860
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1844
00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:40.170
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1845
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.420
<v Speaker 5>but fortunately one of the managers that that store was,</v>

1846
00:45:42.421 --> 00:45:44.580
<v Speaker 5>one of my students is right across the street from my gym.</v>

1847
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:45.571
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>

1848
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:46.021
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>

1849
00:45:46.021 --> 00:45:46.860
<v Speaker 5>here you can take it,</v>

1850
00:45:46.861 --> 00:45:48.060
<v Speaker 5>just bring the alternator back.</v>

1851
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:48.391
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1852
00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:48.751
<v Speaker 5>awesome.</v>

1853
00:45:48.751 --> 00:45:50.220
<v Speaker 5>Because I didn't know what an alternator was.</v>

1854
00:45:50.221 --> 00:45:51.480
<v Speaker 5>My plan was to grab it,</v>

1855
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:53.250
<v Speaker 5>go look in my engine and said like,</v>

1856
00:45:53.251 --> 00:45:53.611
<v Speaker 5>fine,</v>

1857
00:45:53.611 --> 00:45:54.211
<v Speaker 5>this is fine.</v>

1858
00:45:54.211 --> 00:45:55.044
<v Speaker 5>The like thing,</v>

1859
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:55.560
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1860
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.281
<v Speaker 5>So that's what I did.</v>

1861
00:45:56.281 --> 00:45:57.180
<v Speaker 5>I found the like thing,</v>

1862
00:45:57.330 --> 00:45:58.163
<v Speaker 5>I put it in there.</v>

1863
00:45:58.980 --> 00:45:59.161
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1864
00:45:59.161 --> 00:45:59.671
<v Speaker 5>I changed it.</v>

1865
00:45:59.671 --> 00:46:00.540
<v Speaker 5>I took the other one back,</v>

1866
00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:01.890
<v Speaker 5>but I couldn't get the belt on.</v>

1867
00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:04.950
<v Speaker 5>I did everything that I was trying to do everything and somebody who's like the</v>

1868
00:46:04.951 --> 00:46:05.940
<v Speaker 5>tensioning bolt and I was like,</v>

1869
00:46:05.941 --> 00:46:07.050
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what you're talking about.</v>

1870
00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:08.280
<v Speaker 5>And I slept on it.</v>

1871
00:46:08.281 --> 00:46:09.420
<v Speaker 5>I went to bed that night.</v>

1872
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:10.920
<v Speaker 5>I went to sleep and I woke up,</v>

1873
00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:12.600
<v Speaker 5>ran downstairs,</v>

1874
00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:13.471
<v Speaker 5>connected it,</v>

1875
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:15.750
<v Speaker 5>you know like I cause overnight.</v>

1876
00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:19.980
<v Speaker 5>But there was something about being relaxed and not being like stressed about</v>

1877
00:46:19.981 --> 00:46:20.641
<v Speaker 5>trying to find it.</v>

1878
00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:21.900
<v Speaker 5>Right now it's right in front of me.</v>

1879
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:26.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm just away from it and I see the whole engine in my sleep and it's like you</v>

1880
00:46:26.371 --> 00:46:29.070
<v Speaker 5>put the ratchet in there and you pull on it and that's,</v>

1881
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.180
<v Speaker 5>that's the tensioning bolt.</v>

1882
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:33.600
<v Speaker 5>I have a crazy spiritual idea about that.</v>

1883
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.140
<v Speaker 5>I think when you go to sleep,</v>

1884
00:46:35.141 --> 00:46:36.390
<v Speaker 5>you go into the spirit world.</v>

1885
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.010
<v Speaker 5>When you come back you're refreshed.</v>

1886
00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.200
<v Speaker 5>I think you live a new life every morning.</v>

1887
00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:42.241
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

1888
00:46:42.241 --> 00:46:44.010
<v Speaker 5>Live on the momentum of your past life.</v>

1889
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:47.610
<v Speaker 5>But I think you have a new life every morning you just returned from the spirit</v>

1890
00:46:47.611 --> 00:46:50.880
<v Speaker 5>world with the mess that you left behind and you got to clean it up,</v>

1891
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.860
<v Speaker 5>clean it up and figure it out and like,</v>

1892
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:53.461
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

1893
00:46:53.461 --> 00:46:55.380
<v Speaker 5>I should have just cranked it bolt over there.</v>

1894
00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.273
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1895
00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:57.990
<v Speaker 5>It all makes sense.</v>

1896
00:46:57.991 --> 00:47:00.630
<v Speaker 5>There's something to that cause I got some stuff going on now where I'm just</v>

1897
00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:01.464
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1898
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.910
<v Speaker 5>when I wake up the next day and I'm like,</v>

1899
00:47:02.911 --> 00:47:03.744
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

1900
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:04.730
<v Speaker 5>it's not that big of,</v>

1901
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:05.910
<v Speaker 5>it's not that big of a deal.</v>

1902
00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:06.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1903
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:08.520
<v Speaker 5>Most things are not that big of a deal.</v>

1904
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:11.820
<v Speaker 5>If you're still alive and you're walking around and talking,</v>

1905
00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.500
<v Speaker 5>ultimately it's not that big of a deal.</v>

1906
00:47:13.501 --> 00:47:16.500
<v Speaker 5>Like I give things like the 10 year test,</v>

1907
00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.090
<v Speaker 5>like if you look back on 10 years,</v>

1908
00:47:18.091 --> 00:47:21.180
<v Speaker 5>how much of a big deal it was just going to be not that big of a deal.</v>

1909
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:21.751
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1910
00:47:21.751 --> 00:47:22.800
<v Speaker 5>It was fucking alternator.</v>

1911
00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.270
<v Speaker 5>That big of a deal at 10 year test is a good test.</v>

1912
00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:27.901
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1913
00:47:27.901 --> 00:47:28.920
<v Speaker 5>that makes a lot of sense.</v>

1914
00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:30.280
<v Speaker 5>But people</v>

1915
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.480
<v Speaker 2>operate on momentum.</v>

1916
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:33.010
<v Speaker 2>That's a big problem with people.</v>

1917
00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:33.581
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1918
00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:34.540
<v Speaker 2>like when you go to bed,</v>

1919
00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:35.351
<v Speaker 2>you wake up in the morning,</v>

1920
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:35.531
<v Speaker 2>you'd,</v>

1921
00:47:35.531 --> 00:47:40.531
<v Speaker 2>you still got this shit that you left behind the day before piling up bills you</v>

1922
00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:44.680
<v Speaker 2>gotta pay and chores you get to do and all these different tasks that need to</v>

1923
00:47:44.681 --> 00:47:45.221
<v Speaker 2>get done.</v>

1924
00:47:45.221 --> 00:47:46.054
<v Speaker 2>Like fuck.</v>

1925
00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:46.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1926
00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:47.920
<v Speaker 2>like you can't never get behind it.</v>

1927
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:48.271
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1928
00:47:48.271 --> 00:47:48.500
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1929
00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.460
<v Speaker 2>it's a good day when when he feel like,</v>

1930
00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:51.941
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1931
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:56.110
<v Speaker 2>everything's done and like this day is completely mine.</v>

1932
00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:56.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1933
00:47:56.651 --> 00:47:57.220
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

1934
00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.060
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking,</v>

1935
00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:03.360
<v Speaker 2>that's to to to have like a clean slate in your mind in terms of things you need</v>

1936
00:48:03.791 --> 00:48:04.600
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

1937
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.540
<v Speaker 2>There's no way to underestimate that.</v>

1938
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:08.680
<v Speaker 2>That's giant.</v>

1939
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.380
<v Speaker 2>You can't underemphasize how important that is.</v>

1940
00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1941
00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Or overemphasized rather.</v>

1942
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.190
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree with that is um,</v>

1943
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of those guys who my brain,</v>

1944
00:48:18.071 --> 00:48:21.690
<v Speaker 2>I feel like as soon as I wake up first thought leads into the next and to the</v>

1945
00:48:21.691 --> 00:48:22.560
<v Speaker 2>next and you,</v>

1946
00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:23.260
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1947
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:27.430
<v Speaker 2>you can't stay ahead of it and not staying ahead of it.</v>

1948
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.531
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1949
00:48:27.531 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of being dragged along,</v>

1950
00:48:29.081 --> 00:48:31.300
<v Speaker 2>being pulled by these thoughts and all these different directions.</v>

1951
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Especially when I'm trying to organize some things.</v>

1952
00:48:33.601 --> 00:48:34.181
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I,</v>

1953
00:48:34.181 --> 00:48:36.580
<v Speaker 2>if I don't have a list or something like that,</v>

1954
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get,</v>

1955
00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.800
<v Speaker 2>if I have five things to do,</v>

1956
00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:39.730
<v Speaker 2>let me get one thing done.</v>

1957
00:48:39.731 --> 00:48:40.570
<v Speaker 2>If I don't have a list,</v>

1958
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:41.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1959
00:48:41.021 --> 00:48:43.450
<v Speaker 2>what changed a lot of my life.</v>

1960
00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.700
<v Speaker 2>I started working out early in the morning.</v>

1961
00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:47.350
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

1962
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:50.260
<v Speaker 2>my day almost always starts out.</v>

1963
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Today's one of the rare days where it didn't,</v>

1964
00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:54.370
<v Speaker 2>like today I'm going to work out after the podcast,</v>

1965
00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:58.450
<v Speaker 2>but most days I get up in the morning and I work out and the only reason why I</v>

1966
00:48:58.451 --> 00:49:01.810
<v Speaker 2>didn't do it today is because everyone in my house is sick.</v>

1967
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Everyone and I wanted to get some sleep.</v>

1968
00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1969
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.610
<v Speaker 2>My kids are little petri dishes,</v>

1970
00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:07.270
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1971
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:08.350
<v Speaker 2>They're just always sick.</v>

1972
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's sick.</v>

1973
00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.050
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>

1974
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only one so far that's been able to fight it off.</v>

1975
00:49:13.211 --> 00:49:14.740
<v Speaker 2>And I woke up yesterday and I'm like,</v>

1976
00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:15.041
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1977
00:49:15.041 --> 00:49:16.750
<v Speaker 2>I got a sore throat like it's coming.</v>

1978
00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.580
<v Speaker 2>And I fought it off yesterday and I fought it off to,</v>

1979
00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:20.680
<v Speaker 2>I got in the sauna,</v>

1980
00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:21.573
<v Speaker 2>chilled out.</v>

1981
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.950
<v Speaker 2>But something changed in my life.</v>

1982
00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:25.930
<v Speaker 2>When I started working out in the morning,</v>

1983
00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:28.530
<v Speaker 2>my thought process became clearer.</v>

1984
00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:29.710
<v Speaker 2>It May,</v>

1985
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:33.400
<v Speaker 2>it makes more sense because I clean out my mind when I workout.</v>

1986
00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:34.301
<v Speaker 2>So I get up in,</v>

1987
00:49:34.301 --> 00:49:38.290
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I do is just go work out and clean up my mind.</v>

1988
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.980
<v Speaker 2>My mind gets cleaned up on my body's like fully,</v>

1989
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:42.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1990
00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.320
<v Speaker 2>elevated in terms of like,</v>

1991
00:49:44.321 --> 00:49:45.970
<v Speaker 2>my heart rate got jacked up.</v>

1992
00:49:45.971 --> 00:49:47.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm sweating like a pig.</v>

1993
00:49:47.261 --> 00:49:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I already strained already pushed,</v>

1994
00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:54.190
<v Speaker 2>already got over some shit already made it to the end and then so there's</v>

1995
00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:55.930
<v Speaker 2>already a victory by the time it's,</v>

1996
00:49:55.931 --> 00:49:56.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1997
00:49:56.141 --> 00:49:57.310
<v Speaker 2>8:00 AM yeah.</v>

1998
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.821
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1999
00:49:57.821 --> 00:50:01.180
<v Speaker 2>that to me like then my day just starts off way better.</v>

2000
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:04.390
<v Speaker 2>Like I start off with a clear perspective.</v>

2001
00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2002
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:08.320
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's similar when I,</v>

2003
00:50:08.321 --> 00:50:11.440
<v Speaker 2>especially when I was fighting because you woke up,</v>

2004
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:12.760
<v Speaker 2>get a run in,</v>

2005
00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:13.420
<v Speaker 2>eat something,</v>

2006
00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.253
<v Speaker 2>head to the gym,</v>

2007
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:14.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2008
00:50:14.811 --> 00:50:18.100
<v Speaker 2>and then you train now that especially run fasted.</v>

2009
00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2010
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:20.223
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

2011
00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:20.681
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

2012
00:50:20.681 --> 00:50:21.670
<v Speaker 2>that would be the first thing I did.</v>

2013
00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.080
<v Speaker 2>I brushed my teeth and go for a run.</v>

2014
00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:23.711
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2015
00:50:23.711 --> 00:50:23.851
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2016
00:50:23.851 --> 00:50:24.684
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

2017
00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like eating anything.</v>

2018
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 2>This is when you were living in</v>

2019
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.520
<v Speaker 3>Texas.</v>

2020
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.350
<v Speaker 3>This is whenever like,</v>

2021
00:50:30.351 --> 00:50:32.330
<v Speaker 3>even to this day when I run like,</v>

2022
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:35.450
<v Speaker 3>especially especially in Texas because in the summer</v>

2023
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.530
<v Speaker 3>you got to go early before it turns into a barbecue outside.</v>

2024
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:41.463
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2025
00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.710
<v Speaker 3>What I was gonna say is in Texas,</v>

2026
00:50:42.711 --> 00:50:43.910
<v Speaker 3>your d mostly flat.</v>

2027
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:44.833
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly flat.</v>

2028
00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Especially,</v>

2029
00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:47.060
<v Speaker 3>especially in Houston.</v>

2030
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.410
<v Speaker 3>Austin has some hills,</v>

2031
00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:51.140
<v Speaker 3>but Houston is there.</v>

2032
00:50:51.141 --> 00:50:51.760
<v Speaker 3>They're the,</v>

2033
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.600
<v Speaker 3>the only hills in Houston or the overpasses on.</v>

2034
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:55.190
<v Speaker 3>But now they're out here.</v>

2035
00:50:55.191 --> 00:50:55.401
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

2036
00:50:55.401 --> 00:50:57.200
<v Speaker 3>There's some ferocious trails you can run.</v>

2037
00:50:57.790 --> 00:50:58.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2038
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.851
<v Speaker 3>there is a,</v>

2039
00:50:58.851 --> 00:51:00.860
<v Speaker 3>there was a hill on my street that's,</v>

2040
00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:01.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm a quarter mile.</v>

2041
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:02.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2042
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:03.350
<v Speaker 3>that's miserable.</v>

2043
00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:03.641
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2044
00:51:03.641 --> 00:51:05.240
<v Speaker 3>This is a miserable shit in the Hollywood hills.</v>

2045
00:51:05.241 --> 00:51:05.481
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2046
00:51:05.481 --> 00:51:06.314
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

2047
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:06.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2048
00:51:06.741 --> 00:51:09.050
<v Speaker 3>If you wanted to get at the bottom and do some sprints going up,</v>

2049
00:51:09.051 --> 00:51:09.500
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2050
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:10.910
<v Speaker 3>that's so good for your knees too,</v>

2051
00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:11.601
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

2052
00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:13.370
<v Speaker 3>you're not really a stomping down.</v>

2053
00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:13.851
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2054
00:51:13.851 --> 00:51:14.210
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2055
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:15.043
<v Speaker 3>you're pushing,</v>

2056
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:15.950
<v Speaker 3>you're pushing up.</v>

2057
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:16.813
<v Speaker 3>So it's just,</v>

2058
00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:18.950
<v Speaker 3>it's basically like doing a bunch of lunges.</v>

2059
00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:19.873
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2060
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2061
00:51:20.571 --> 00:51:21.620
<v Speaker 3>You feel it in your ass,</v>

2062
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:22.190
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

2063
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:23.750
<v Speaker 3>My ass is way bigger than it used to be.</v>

2064
00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:25.093
<v Speaker 3>It looks good.</v>

2065
00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:29.031
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

2066
00:51:29.031 --> 00:51:29.601
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

2067
00:51:29.601 --> 00:51:30.320
<v Speaker 3>there was a drill.</v>

2068
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.910
<v Speaker 3>Went and I did this a couple of times.</v>

2069
00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:32.773
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2070
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.470
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2071
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:35.690
<v Speaker 3>they would incline the treadmill to the,</v>

2072
00:51:35.691 --> 00:51:40.691
<v Speaker 3>to its peak and then turn it up to like 12 or 10 or 12 and you're sprinting for</v>

2073
00:51:41.091 --> 00:51:42.260
<v Speaker 3>like 15 seconds.</v>

2074
00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.400
<v Speaker 3>That was miserable.</v>

2075
00:51:43.401 --> 00:51:43.731
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

2076
00:51:43.731 --> 00:51:44.930
<v Speaker 3>you'd feel that really,</v>

2077
00:51:44.931 --> 00:51:45.471
<v Speaker 3>really hard.</v>

2078
00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:47.150
<v Speaker 3>I had to wait until you fall off.</v>

2079
00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:47.391
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2080
00:51:47.391 --> 00:51:47.901
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2081
00:51:47.901 --> 00:51:50.000
<v Speaker 3>Or how do you get off that fucking thing where you're sprinting?</v>

2082
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.620
<v Speaker 3>You got to grab the edges and hop.</v>

2083
00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:53.540
<v Speaker 3>Did you know and I just started using the other day.</v>

2084
00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:54.590
<v Speaker 3>It's a motherfucker.</v>

2085
00:51:54.591 --> 00:51:55.890
<v Speaker 3>Is that versa climber?</v>

2086
00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2087
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:58.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

2088
00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.593
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

2089
00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:02.060
<v Speaker 3>I've never been on it for an extended period of time.</v>

2090
00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:03.230
<v Speaker 3>Always in a circuit.</v>

2091
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:04.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2092
00:52:04.521 --> 00:52:07.190
<v Speaker 3>I did it in a circuit to the last exercise.</v>

2093
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.881
<v Speaker 3>It's miserable.</v>

2094
00:52:07.881 --> 00:52:08.241
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2095
00:52:08.241 --> 00:52:09.074
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>

2096
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:12.200
<v Speaker 3>this thing like you do the first two or three strokes,</v>

2097
00:52:12.201 --> 00:52:14.840
<v Speaker 3>so like I can get through this and then you're like 10 and you're like,</v>

2098
00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:15.920
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>

2099
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:17.330
<v Speaker 3>You like how much time I got left,</v>

2100
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:19.100
<v Speaker 3>a minute and 10 seconds.</v>

2101
00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:20.570
<v Speaker 3>How's that possible?</v>

2102
00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:21.261
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2103
00:52:21.261 --> 00:52:23.810
<v Speaker 3>I am not going to make a minute and 10 seconds of this.</v>

2104
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:27.170
<v Speaker 3>It feels weird because like with every stroke it doesn't,</v>

2105
00:52:27.171 --> 00:52:28.004
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>

2106
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:30.440
<v Speaker 3>it's not heavy or hard to make the stroke.</v>

2107
00:52:30.441 --> 00:52:31.430
<v Speaker 3>It feels like it's nothing.</v>

2108
00:52:31.431 --> 00:52:32.960
<v Speaker 3>But you're also going nowhere,</v>

2109
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.983
<v Speaker 3>just like you have,</v>

2110
00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:38.360
<v Speaker 3>you're making this motion and I don't know,</v>

2111
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:39.680
<v Speaker 3>read the shit.</v>

2112
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:40.281
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2113
00:52:40.281 --> 00:52:41.360
<v Speaker 3>you're like down here like this.</v>

2114
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:41.850
<v Speaker 3>Like how much?</v>

2115
00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:43.430
<v Speaker 3>Like how is that possible?</v>

2116
00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:45.290
<v Speaker 3>I've only been doing this for 15 seconds.</v>

2117
00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:47.000
<v Speaker 3>I get what I like that.</v>

2118
00:52:47.001 --> 00:52:47.750
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2119
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:51.350
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing called the echo bike that rogue makes that I have out here.</v>

2120
00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

2121
00:52:52.491 --> 00:52:56.180
<v Speaker 3>it's an air dyne but it's like an airdyne built for gorillas.</v>

2122
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:59.360
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're gonna put an air dime machine into fucking gorilla cage,</v>

2123
00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:00.740
<v Speaker 3>you'd would make like this robot,</v>

2124
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.980
<v Speaker 3>it's like thick ass fucking steal thing with thick ass handles.</v>

2125
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Everything's like super beefy and jacked up.</v>

2126
00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:07.641
<v Speaker 3>God Damn,</v>

2127
00:53:07.641 --> 00:53:09.080
<v Speaker 3>that thing kicks you out and show me that.</v>

2128
00:53:09.081 --> 00:53:09.640
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

2129
00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:10.401

2131
00:53:10.401 --> 00:53:11.121
<v Speaker 3>It's the Shit,</v>

2132
00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:11.480
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2133
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:11.991
<v Speaker 3>It's the shit.</v>

2134
00:53:11.991 --> 00:53:13.160
<v Speaker 3>I do two bottles on that,</v>

2135
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.030
<v Speaker 3>so I'll do twenties and tens 20 seconds work ten second break.</v>

2136
00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.500
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2137
00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.300
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking hard man.</v>

2138
00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.740
<v Speaker 3>Those airtime machines look.</v>

2139
00:53:21.741 --> 00:53:23.870
<v Speaker 3>So they look and like nothing.</v>

2140
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:25.730
<v Speaker 3>That's one of those things where you look at it,</v>

2141
00:53:25.731 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 3>you're like how</v>

2142
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:26.910
<v Speaker 2>can that be hard?</v>

2143
00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2144
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:28.733
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

2145
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.240
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to,</v>

2146
00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:30.571
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

2147
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:31.470
<v Speaker 2>when you alternate,</v>

2148
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:32.700
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2149
00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.500
<v Speaker 2>So you're riding them both together,</v>

2150
00:53:34.501 --> 00:53:37.350
<v Speaker 2>but you're doing a conditioning workout and coach is standing right there and</v>

2151
00:53:37.351 --> 00:53:37.680
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>

2152
00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:40.200
<v Speaker 2>You take your feet off of the panels and you're pumping with your arms.</v>

2153
00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:41.490
<v Speaker 2>That's miserable.</v>

2154
00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Miserable as fuck.</v>

2155
00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:44.670
<v Speaker 2>And I also don't,</v>

2156
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:46.710
<v Speaker 2>not that I don't like it,</v>

2157
00:53:46.711 --> 00:53:48.570
<v Speaker 2>but one of the in the conditioning workouts,</v>

2158
00:53:48.571 --> 00:53:51.910
<v Speaker 2>the parts that were so hard and then kind of draining that I'm,</v>

2159
00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:52.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you call it,</v>

2160
00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.720
<v Speaker 2>but it's with the hydraulic presses.</v>

2161
00:53:55.410 --> 00:54:00.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's miserable too because every direction there's no rest on that machine.</v>

2162
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:02.123
<v Speaker 2>There's none.</v>

2163
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:05.310
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of crazy when you go back and look at like old school strength and</v>

2164
00:54:05.311 --> 00:54:08.610
<v Speaker 2>conditioning workouts at fighters used to do and you know,</v>

2165
00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:11.160
<v Speaker 2>comparison to what all the crazy shit that guys do today.</v>

2166
00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>

2167
00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.493
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

2168
00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:14.580
<v Speaker 2>which camp?</v>

2169
00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:16.440
<v Speaker 2>Well it's an argument,</v>

2170
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.450
<v Speaker 2>but which camps?</v>

2171
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:20.190
<v Speaker 2>I'll go camp cause I feel like there's two,</v>

2172
00:54:20.191 --> 00:54:22.650
<v Speaker 2>which camps really started that,</v>

2173
00:54:22.651 --> 00:54:22.921
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2174
00:54:22.921 --> 00:54:24.630
<v Speaker 2>that the conditioning thing.</v>

2175
00:54:24.631 --> 00:54:25.740
<v Speaker 2>Who are ahead of the game?</v>

2176
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:27.000
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking of Att,</v>

2177
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:30.720
<v Speaker 2>I always think of them cause they were like when Lambert created that place,</v>

2178
00:54:30.721 --> 00:54:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Dan Lambert,</v>

2179
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.310
<v Speaker 2>the fucking man,</v>

2180
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.330
<v Speaker 2>that guy,</v>

2181
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:36.780
<v Speaker 2>that guy has done a lot for MMA and he doesn't get his horn blown enough.</v>

2182
00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2183
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.333
<v Speaker 2>He had to respect,</v>

2184
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2185
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:40.590
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>

2186
00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:44.190
<v Speaker 2>he put a shit ton of money and an American top team and one of the things that</v>

2187
00:54:44.191 --> 00:54:46.530
<v Speaker 2>they did about it was make it a full,</v>

2188
00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:48.300
<v Speaker 2>like they have everything.</v>

2189
00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:50.310
<v Speaker 2>They have great wrestling coaches,</v>

2190
00:54:50.311 --> 00:54:51.370
<v Speaker 2>great striking coaches,</v>

2191
00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:52.081
<v Speaker 2>great Jujitsu,</v>

2192
00:54:52.081 --> 00:54:53.010
<v Speaker 2>huge facility,</v>

2193
00:54:53.011 --> 00:54:54.360
<v Speaker 2>everything state of the art.</v>

2194
00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:59.640
<v Speaker 2>And I was felt like those guys were out of very high level early on.</v>

2195
00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember Tiago Alvarez was making weight this back when like Tiago</v>

2196
00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Alvarez Garrell law.</v>

2197
00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Remember how big he was at one 70.</v>

2198
00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:11.370
<v Speaker 2>And man when he fought Matt Hughes and he didn't make the weight and he looked</v>

2199
00:55:11.371 --> 00:55:12.930
<v Speaker 2>like he weighed about 400 pounds.</v>

2200
00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:14.850
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even look like a human man.</v>

2201
00:55:14.851 --> 00:55:15.930
<v Speaker 2>He was so jacked.</v>

2202
00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:17.213
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2203
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.730
<v Speaker 2>he was making weight once and it was a fight that they did.</v>

2204
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.860
<v Speaker 2>I think it was at the hard rock.</v>

2205
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:24.743
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

2206
00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2207
00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:27.060
<v Speaker 2>but it was somewhere where they had,</v>

2208
00:55:27.061 --> 00:55:30.150
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was at the palms somewhere where they had like the smaller ring,</v>

2209
00:55:30.151 --> 00:55:30.601
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2210
00:55:30.601 --> 00:55:31.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I remember this,</v>

2211
00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:36.920
<v Speaker 2>but what I remember was he was warming up for that day's fight.</v>

2212
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2213
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:40.200
<v Speaker 2>he had made weight and then,</v>

2214
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:40.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2215
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:45.710
<v Speaker 2>after making weight they had a workout that they would do to put weight back on</v>

2216
00:55:46.111 --> 00:55:46.830
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2217
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:49.500
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that they would do was really burned him out.</v>

2218
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:51.090
<v Speaker 2>So they had him,</v>

2219
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.410
<v Speaker 2>he was in the gym.</v>

2220
00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:53.520
<v Speaker 2>I wish he was here.</v>

2221
00:55:53.521 --> 00:55:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I could ask him exactly what this was.</v>

2222
00:55:55.091 --> 00:56:00.091
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'm talking many years ago and he goes through this really hard pad</v>

2223
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:01.160
<v Speaker 2>workouts like that.</v>

2224
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.710
<v Speaker 2>Bam,</v>

2225
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:01.911
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>

2226
00:56:01.911 --> 00:56:03.480
<v Speaker 2>I got Bam Bam.</v>

2227
00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:05.460
<v Speaker 2>And there they were saying they wanted a pump,</v>

2228
00:56:05.461 --> 00:56:09.510
<v Speaker 2>everything up full of blood and then they fill them up with carbs and it would</v>

2229
00:56:09.511 --> 00:56:10.344
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2230
00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:11.970
<v Speaker 2>everything would blow back up.</v>

2231
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:16.380
<v Speaker 2>So like the muscles get super dehydrated cause he's draining himself out big</v>

2232
00:56:16.381 --> 00:56:17.040
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2233
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:17.281
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2234
00:56:17.281 --> 00:56:19.870
<v Speaker 2>he was walking around north of 200 pounds,</v>

2235
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 2>cutting down to one 70 and then after the weight cut</v>

2236
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:25.990
<v Speaker 3>they would swell them back up again.</v>

2237
00:56:25.991 --> 00:56:29.740
<v Speaker 3>So he got to put 30 pounds back on them in 24 hours.</v>

2238
00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:34.720
<v Speaker 3>And that was one of the methods that they used was exercise followed by fuel.</v>

2239
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 3>I guess a,</v>

2240
00:56:38.310 --> 00:56:41.590
<v Speaker 3>it kind of makes sense and it also confuses me because it confused me too</v>

2241
00:56:41.591 --> 00:56:44.010
<v Speaker 3>because I'm a dummy and I was listening to him talking about this.</v>

2242
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:44.291
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2243
00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:44.801
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2244
00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:45.041
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2245
00:56:45.041 --> 00:56:46.660
<v Speaker 3>why is this like what's happening?</v>

2246
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:47.703
<v Speaker 3>How are you doing this?</v>

2247
00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:51.270
<v Speaker 3>I get the principle that you're saying but what's the science behind?</v>

2248
00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:51.480
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2249
00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.360
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's where I'm at.</v>

2250
00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:53.291
<v Speaker 3>Science.</v>

2251
00:56:53.291 --> 00:56:56.740
<v Speaker 3>He looks like a gorilla when he fights and he really put that weight back on.</v>

2252
00:56:56.741 --> 00:57:01.741
<v Speaker 3>Well and they had glace in and nobody is bigger at one 55 in glace and t bow.</v>

2253
00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:02.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2254
00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.161
<v Speaker 3>glaze and tee ball.</v>

2255
00:57:03.161 --> 00:57:04.630
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a fucking light heavyweight.</v>

2256
00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:09.070
<v Speaker 3>He's so big and somehow or another it makes it down to 55 like when he gets on</v>

2257
00:57:09.071 --> 00:57:10.520
<v Speaker 3>the scale it's like you're,</v>

2258
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:12.100
<v Speaker 3>it's like Yoel Romero.</v>

2259
00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.200
<v Speaker 3>When he gets on the scary,</v>

2260
00:57:13.201 --> 00:57:13.660
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2261
00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:14.140
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2262
00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:16.390
<v Speaker 3>am I seeing something wrong?</v>

2263
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:19.730
<v Speaker 3>Like how has that one 85 how's that possible?</v>

2264
00:57:19.731 --> 00:57:20.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2265
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:20.861
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make sense.</v>

2266
00:57:20.861 --> 00:57:22.240
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm watching him weigh in.</v>

2267
00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:26.530
<v Speaker 3>He is one 85 the guy says one 85 he steps off and you're like,</v>

2269
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:29.103
<v Speaker 3>How's that possible?</v>

2270
00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:30.150
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>

2271
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Like good t bow.</v>

<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2282
00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:44.590
<v Speaker 3>He don't want to get on the scale.</v>

2283
00:57:44.591 --> 00:57:48.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm guarantee use like two 10 get out of here that one night.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Silly strong dude.</v>

2297
00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:08.360
<v Speaker 3>He's the most diesel guide that I've ever seen at one 55 like it,</v>

2298
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:10.700
<v Speaker 3>that is about as thick as it means.</v>

2299
00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:12.160
<v Speaker 3>There's no room for error there.</v>

2300
00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:14.050
<v Speaker 3>And he made wait a lot.</v>

2301
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2302
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:15.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean he might've missed it.</v>

2303
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.410
<v Speaker 3>He missed it like once or twice,</v>

2304
00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:19.720
<v Speaker 3>but he made most of the time t bow made weight.</v>

2305
00:58:19.721 --> 00:58:19.901

2349
00:59:09.731 --> 00:59:10.564
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2350
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:12.610
<v Speaker 3>when you said about what you said about att,</v>

2351
00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:14.201
<v Speaker 3>I agree,</v>

2352
00:59:14.201 --> 00:59:16.690
<v Speaker 3>but I mean even further back than that,</v>

2353
00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:17.970
<v Speaker 3>the earliest guys,</v>

2354
00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:21.680
<v Speaker 3>frank shamrock was one of the writing shamrock and then the middle and military,</v>

2355
00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.950
<v Speaker 3>those share mark was the guy really figured out conditioning.</v>

2356
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:25.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2357
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:26.390
<v Speaker 3>That's how he beat Tito.</v>

2358
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2359
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:27.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2360
00:59:27.321 --> 00:59:27.651
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2361
00:59:27.651 --> 00:59:28.970
<v Speaker 3>He was so small in that fight.</v>

2362
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:29.810
<v Speaker 3>He was tiny.</v>

2363
00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:33.320
<v Speaker 3>He was like one 95 and Tito was a goal ruler.</v>

2364
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:35.150
<v Speaker 3>He was a big fella.</v>

2365
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:36.043
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2366
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:37.100
<v Speaker 3>War is out south.</v>

2367
00:59:37.101 --> 00:59:39.230
<v Speaker 3>That was when the weight class was 200 pounds to the,</v>

2368
00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:39.471
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2369
00:59:39.471 --> 00:59:40.700
<v Speaker 3>you had to make one 99.</v>

2370
00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2371
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:41.901
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

2372
00:59:41.901 --> 00:59:42.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2373
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:43.460
<v Speaker 3>the early days,</v>

2374
00:59:43.461 --> 00:59:44.294
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2375
00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:44.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2376
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:46.610
<v Speaker 3>It was very different back then,</v>

2377
00:59:46.611 --> 00:59:46.911
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2378
00:59:46.911 --> 00:59:47.241
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2379
00:59:47.241 --> 00:59:47.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2380
00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:49.910
<v Speaker 3>I was scrolling through fipass watching the whole,</v>

2381
00:59:49.911 --> 00:59:51.410
<v Speaker 3>like the entire events.</v>

2382
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:54.020
<v Speaker 3>Then I get down to like 2000 and it gets like,</v>

2383
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:57.560
<v Speaker 3>you scrolling through and it's like 2017 it has all these events across the</v>

2384
00:59:57.561 --> 00:59:57.801
<v Speaker 3>screen.</v>

2385
00:59:57.801 --> 00:59:59.630
<v Speaker 3>You've got to scroll 16 same thing.</v>

2386
00:59:59.631 --> 01:00:01.580
<v Speaker 3>15 starts going down and you get to 10.</v>

2387
01:00:01.581 --> 01:00:02.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's still less,</v>

2388
01:00:02.961 --> 01:00:04.430
<v Speaker 3>but you still got to crawl across the screen.</v>

2389
01:00:04.431 --> 01:00:05.810
<v Speaker 3>Then you get to like seven,</v>

2390
01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:07.850
<v Speaker 3>you got to like eight and it's like five events,</v>

2391
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:08.961
<v Speaker 3>five events,</v>

2392
01:00:08.961 --> 01:00:10.070
<v Speaker 3>five events and that's it.</v>

2393
01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:15.790
<v Speaker 3>You know like [inaudible] I have 21 UFC fights under my belt,</v>

2394
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:21.730
<v Speaker 3>but there were five UFC is a year back then it's like now there's like two</v>

2395
01:00:22.221 --> 01:00:23.360
<v Speaker 3>months you get like six,</v>

2396
01:00:23.361 --> 01:00:23.900
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

2397
01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:24.733
<v Speaker 3>seven cards.</v>

2398
01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:27.520
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like you got fucked and uh,</v>

2399
01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:28.460
<v Speaker 3>Josh Thomson,</v>

2400
01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:32.720
<v Speaker 3>a lot of guys in your era because they cut out the 55 pound division for a long</v>

2401
01:00:32.721 --> 01:00:36.140
<v Speaker 3>time and then you went out and fought up Bodog and all these other</v>

2402
01:00:36.141 --> 01:00:36.974
<v Speaker 3>organizations.</v>

2403
01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.230
<v Speaker 3>There was no 55 for how many years?</v>

2404
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:41.441
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2405
01:00:41.441 --> 01:00:42.200
<v Speaker 3>my shoe.</v>

2406
01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:42.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2407
01:00:42.591 --> 01:00:45.680
<v Speaker 3>like 2004 to 2000.</v>

2408
01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.990
<v Speaker 3>2005 to like 2010 for sure.</v>

2409
01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.730
<v Speaker 3>They didn't come back until,</v>

2410
01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:50.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2411
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.260
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate fighter.</v>

2412
01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:51.621
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2413
01:00:51.621 --> 01:00:55.010
<v Speaker 3>like that's when Gilbert and Josh Thompson,</v>

2414
01:00:55.011 --> 01:00:57.560
<v Speaker 3>we're having those epic war's over in strike force.</v>

2415
01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.540
<v Speaker 3>So like those years,</v>

2416
01:00:59.541 --> 01:01:04.541
<v Speaker 3>like there was those guys like you Thompson and I feel like Gilbert Gilbert</v>

2417
01:01:05.691 --> 01:01:08.870
<v Speaker 3>staked his claim in the UFC and had some epic fights in the UFC.</v>

2418
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:13.520
<v Speaker 3>But I honestly don't think we see the same Gilbert that we saw in strike force.</v>

2419
01:01:13.521 --> 01:01:13.791
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2420
01:01:13.791 --> 01:01:14.260
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2421
01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:14.750
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2422
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:15.583
<v Speaker 3>no one,</v>

2423
01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:19.970
<v Speaker 3>no one can say better than you because you've been in there that how much those</v>

2424
01:01:19.971 --> 01:01:22.040
<v Speaker 3>wars we'll just take out of you.</v>

2425
01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.690
<v Speaker 3>They will.</v>

2426
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:24.510
<v Speaker 3>And a guy like,</v>

2427
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:27.740
<v Speaker 3>like the wars that Gilbert and Josh went through it strike force.</v>

2428
01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:29.540
<v Speaker 3>And then Gilbert is that kind of guy.</v>

2429
01:01:29.541 --> 01:01:32.480
<v Speaker 3>He's just like his fight with the eagles.</v>

2430
01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:33.561
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2431
01:01:33.561 --> 01:01:34.160
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>

2432
01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.390
<v Speaker 3>they're not backing down.</v>

2433
01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:35.961
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2434
01:01:35.961 --> 01:01:36.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2435
01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:37.430
<v Speaker 3>they got the chance to take it.</v>

2436
01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.061
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2437
01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:38.661
<v Speaker 3>there's not,</v>

2438
01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:40.220
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of guys that can,</v>

2439
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.360
<v Speaker 3>that can take it like that.</v>

2440
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2441
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.160
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been in a lot of wars that,</v>

2442
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:45.410
<v Speaker 3>that we're back and forth.</v>

2443
01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:45.921
<v Speaker 3>Even if the,</v>

2444
01:01:45.921 --> 01:01:47.330
<v Speaker 3>if the fight had some attrition,</v>

2445
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:48.830
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of times it was,</v>

2446
01:01:48.831 --> 01:01:49.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2447
01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:53.180
<v Speaker 3>I was winning the striking battle and it wasn't taking as many shots as those</v>

2448
01:01:53.181 --> 01:01:54.050
<v Speaker 3>guys have taken.</v>

2449
01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:55.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2450
01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:55.671
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

2451
01:01:55.671 --> 01:01:56.960
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a chin to do that,</v>

2452
01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:58.753
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2453
01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.410
<v Speaker 3>Like I couldn't imagine to this day having been in having,</v>

2454
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.040
<v Speaker 3>I have like my record shows like 60 something fights.</v>

2455
01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:10.400
<v Speaker 3>I have like 80 plus fights overall.</v>

2456
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:11.800
<v Speaker 3>And I still like,</v>

2457
01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:15.020
<v Speaker 3>I look at some of those fights like Diego and Gilbert and I'm like,</v>

2458
01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:15.943
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2459
01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad that Joe,</v>

2460
01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 3>I remember as a kid I was</v>

2461
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.370
<v Speaker 5>laying on my couch watching Vernon white and pancreas and I'm laying there</v>

2462
01:02:23.371 --> 01:02:25.140
<v Speaker 5>watching and he's getting his ass beat.</v>

2463
01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.280
<v Speaker 5>Then it gets to the third round and he turns it around,</v>

2464
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.310
<v Speaker 5>knocks the guy out,</v>

2465
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:29.880
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2466
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.450
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

2467
01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:31.470
<v Speaker 5>I roll off of the cows,</v>

2468
01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:32.430
<v Speaker 5>I get on my knees and I'm like,</v>

2469
01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:32.941
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

2470
01:02:32.941 --> 01:02:34.280
<v Speaker 5>please let me have fights like that.</v>

2471
01:02:34.281 --> 01:02:35.370
<v Speaker 5>That was the kind of fights that went up.</v>

2472
01:02:35.371 --> 01:02:35.641
<v Speaker 5>Please,</v>

2473
01:02:35.641 --> 01:02:35.900
<v Speaker 5>please,</v>

2474
01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:36.091
<v Speaker 5>please.</v>

2475
01:02:36.091 --> 01:02:37.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm like the young kid,</v>

2476
01:02:37.231 --> 01:02:37.411
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2477
01:02:37.411 --> 01:02:37.780
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

2478
01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:38.611
<v Speaker 5>I want to do that.</v>

2479
01:02:38.611 --> 01:02:40.410
<v Speaker 5>I want to have epic fights like that.</v>

2480
01:02:40.411 --> 01:02:41.010
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2481
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.080
<v Speaker 5>But now that I'm done and I'm looking back at it,</v>

2482
01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.370
<v Speaker 5>like there are times I watched that stout fight and when I get hit,</v>

2483
01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:46.921
<v Speaker 5>I'm just like,</v>

2484
01:02:46.921 --> 01:02:47.370
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2485
01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:47.641
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

2486
01:02:47.641 --> 01:02:47.810
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2487
01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:48.271
<v Speaker 5>it's still,</v>

2488
01:02:48.271 --> 01:02:48.811
<v Speaker 5>it hurts.</v>

2489
01:02:48.811 --> 01:02:49.830
<v Speaker 5>It didn't hurt then,</v>

2490
01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:50.461
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

2491
01:02:50.461 --> 01:02:51.270
<v Speaker 5>it hurts now.</v>

2492
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:53.670
<v Speaker 5>Like I feel like a slight physical pain from it.</v>

2493
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:54.990
<v Speaker 5>Not like it breaks my heart.</v>

2494
01:02:54.991 --> 01:02:55.290
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2495
01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:55.711
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2496
01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:57.060
<v Speaker 5>that part will always hurt.</v>

2497
01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:57.751
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

2498
01:02:57.751 --> 01:02:57.931
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2499
01:02:57.931 --> 01:02:59.280
<v Speaker 5>that looks brutal.</v>

2500
01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:00.181
<v Speaker 5>It's painful.</v>

2501
01:03:00.181 --> 01:03:01.014
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

2502
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:02.760
<v Speaker 5>but it looks that way.</v>

2503
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:03.511
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

2504
01:03:03.511 --> 01:03:05.150
<v Speaker 5>those fights with Gilbert and,</v>

2505
01:03:05.151 --> 01:03:05.310
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2506
01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:06.560
<v Speaker 5>and like Gilbert and,</v>

2507
01:03:06.561 --> 01:03:08.730
<v Speaker 5>and Diego,</v>

2508
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:10.080
<v Speaker 5>when they're still in it,</v>

2509
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.033
<v Speaker 5>that shit hurts.</v>

2510
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:12.541
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2511
01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:14.310
<v Speaker 5>Gilbert didn't have to fight them that way.</v>

2512
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.480
<v Speaker 5>That's why it was so crazy.</v>

2513
01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.120
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

2514
01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.590
<v Speaker 5>Gilbert decided to use his skills and find a technical fight.</v>

2515
01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:20.970
<v Speaker 5>He would have been,</v>

2516
01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:21.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2517
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.900
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

2518
01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:25.230
<v Speaker 5>he was the better fighter technically at the time,</v>

2519
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.610
<v Speaker 5>but he just said,</v>

2520
01:03:26.611 --> 01:03:27.030
<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>

2521
01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:27.863
<v Speaker 5>Let's go to war.</v>

2522
01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:28.530
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2523
01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:29.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2524
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:30.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2525
01:03:30.761 --> 01:03:32.700
<v Speaker 5>there's just not a whole lot of people that are willing to do that.</v>

2526
01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:33.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2527
01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:33.301
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

2528
01:03:33.301 --> 01:03:34.770
<v Speaker 5>that I think that's what it is.</v>

2529
01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:35.460
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2530
01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:36.300
<v Speaker 5>like Erin,</v>

2531
01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:37.770
<v Speaker 5>like my fight with Erin Riley,</v>

2532
01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:38.933
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2533
01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:42.450
<v Speaker 5>I was able to figure him out and I could pick him apart.</v>

2534
01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:45.030
<v Speaker 5>So at Aaron is the kind of guy who would go to war with you.</v>

2535
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:47.460
<v Speaker 5>Like if I figured you out,</v>

2536
01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to go like this.</v>

2537
01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:50.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm not giving you a chance.</v>

2538
01:03:50.521 --> 01:03:51.330
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>

2539
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:51.511
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2540
01:03:51.511 --> 01:03:51.750
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2541
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:56.370
<v Speaker 5>that's why I don't have to prove to anybody else how much of Man I am.</v>

2542
01:03:56.610 --> 01:03:58.260
<v Speaker 5>And on the other side of that,</v>

2543
01:03:58.490 --> 01:03:59.490
<v Speaker 5>I don't like getting hit.</v>

2544
01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:01.020
<v Speaker 5>That shit's nonsense.</v>

2545
01:04:01.021 --> 01:04:03.570
<v Speaker 5>That prove how much of a man you are by getting hit.</v>

2546
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.070
<v Speaker 5>That's nonsense.</v>

2547
01:04:05.071 --> 01:04:09.090
<v Speaker 5>I like when guys like Gilbert choose to go crazy and go to war,</v>

2548
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:11.220
<v Speaker 5>but that's on him.</v>

2549
01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.390
<v Speaker 5>That's because he wants to,</v>

2550
01:04:12.450 --> 01:04:13.283
<v Speaker 5>that is on him.</v>

2551
01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:13.990
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

2552
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:18.030
<v Speaker 5>like there's a guy who did something like that and he was willing to go to war,</v>

2553
01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:19.140
<v Speaker 5>but you can see he,</v>

2554
01:04:19.141 --> 01:04:21.420
<v Speaker 5>he still kept his technique when he went to war.</v>

2555
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:24.030
<v Speaker 5>And I'm talking about Max Holloway when he,</v>

2556
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:24.331
<v Speaker 5>when he,</v>

2557
01:04:24.331 --> 01:04:27.600
<v Speaker 5>when he with I'm Ricardo Lamas when he's like right here right now.</v>

2558
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:29.040
<v Speaker 5>He started trading,</v>

2559
01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.140
<v Speaker 5>but he wasn't just sitting in the pocket trading.</v>

2560
01:04:31.141 --> 01:04:32.220
<v Speaker 5>He was throwing his,</v>

2561
01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:32.911
<v Speaker 5>getting out,</v>

2562
01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:33.571
<v Speaker 5>coming back,</v>

2563
01:04:33.571 --> 01:04:34.980
<v Speaker 5>getting up and getting out.</v>

2564
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:36.480
<v Speaker 5>That's how you do that.</v>

2565
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:37.140
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2566
01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:38.400
<v Speaker 5>you don't just sit there and go,</v>

2567
01:04:38.401 --> 01:04:38.701
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2568
01:04:38.701 --> 01:04:39.421
<v Speaker 5>I got mine now.</v>

2569
01:04:39.421 --> 01:04:40.570
<v Speaker 5>You get yours now.</v>

2570
01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:43.140
<v Speaker 5>Just bite down on that mouthpiece in wing punches.</v>

2571
01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:44.043
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2572
01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:48.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's Diego Specialty Diego's the best blood and guts fighter ever.</v>

2573
01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:49.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2574
01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:51.660
<v Speaker 5>every single fight he's ever had,</v>

2575
01:04:51.661 --> 01:04:52.440
<v Speaker 5>his blood and guts.</v>

2576
01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.620
<v Speaker 5>I would go back to his fight with Martin Kampmann lost the first two rounds.</v>

2577
01:04:55.621 --> 01:05:00.150
<v Speaker 5>He's got his face hanging off like literally like a Zombie and he's chasing</v>

2578
01:05:00.151 --> 01:05:02.130
<v Speaker 5>after Martin Cameron and he wins a third round.</v>

2579
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:03.420
<v Speaker 5>When's the third round against?</v>

2580
01:05:03.421 --> 01:05:06.030
<v Speaker 5>Ellenberger is fighting Ellenberger who was at the time,</v>

2581
01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:06.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2582
01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.231
<v Speaker 5>a strong,</v>

2583
01:05:07.231 --> 01:05:08.070
<v Speaker 5>powerful one.</v>

2584
01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:09.840
<v Speaker 5>70 big punches.</v>

2585
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:12.330
<v Speaker 5>Diego's got his back and the third round he's beating him up.</v>

2586
01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's just blood and guts.</v>

2587
01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.890
<v Speaker 5>That guy's got more blood and guts.</v>

2588
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.390
<v Speaker 5>Then virtually a like 99% of the population of the planet earth.</v>

2589
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:27.310
<v Speaker 5>Diego is one of those guys too that he's a scary individual.</v>

2590
01:05:27.311 --> 01:05:27.521
<v Speaker 5>When you,</v>

2591
01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:28.660
<v Speaker 5>when you look at him as like,</v>

2592
01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:30.130
<v Speaker 5>okay that's a potential opponent,</v>

2593
01:05:30.131 --> 01:05:31.180
<v Speaker 5>especially in his prime,</v>

2594
01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:35.290
<v Speaker 5>but away from that he likes now he's a really,</v>

2595
01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:36.190
<v Speaker 5>especially now.</v>

2596
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:37.263
<v Speaker 5>And I was um,</v>

2597
01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:38.800
<v Speaker 5>when he fought rigs</v>

2598
01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:41.200
<v Speaker 5>like I felt,</v>

2599
01:05:41.201 --> 01:05:42.034
<v Speaker 5>I feel like</v>

2600
01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:45.370
<v Speaker 5>those two kinds of personalities,</v>

2601
01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.400
<v Speaker 5>they're just going to be like added at each other all the time.</v>

2602
01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:51.520
<v Speaker 5>And you feel like that's how they're going to be always.</v>

2603
01:05:51.521 --> 01:05:52.600
<v Speaker 5>But like a guy like Diego,</v>

2604
01:05:52.601 --> 01:05:53.600
<v Speaker 5>like look at what he's doing with,</v>

2605
01:05:53.601 --> 01:05:53.910
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

2606
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:54.850
<v Speaker 5>with the guys in,</v>

2607
01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:55.980
<v Speaker 5>in Albuquerque is hell,</v>

2608
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:57.070
<v Speaker 5>I forget the guy's name,</v>

2609
01:05:57.071 --> 01:05:59.830
<v Speaker 5>but he's helping out that guy that he has a big UFC fan,</v>

2610
01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:00.581
<v Speaker 5>the down syndrome,</v>

2611
01:06:00.581 --> 01:06:01.414
<v Speaker 5>down syndrome.</v>

2612
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:02.583
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember how old.</v>

2613
01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:03.490
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>

2614
01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:04.090
<v Speaker 5>But like,</v>

2615
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:04.571
<v Speaker 5>like he's,</v>

2616
01:06:04.571 --> 01:06:05.740
<v Speaker 5>he's committed to this.</v>

2617
01:06:05.741 --> 01:06:06.221
<v Speaker 5>It's not like,</v>

2618
01:06:06.221 --> 01:06:07.054
<v Speaker 5>it's not like,</v>

2619
01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:07.893
<v Speaker 5>and it's not like,</v>

2620
01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.741
<v Speaker 5>hey check me out.</v>

2621
01:06:08.741 --> 01:06:09.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing,</v>

2622
01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:09.963
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

2623
01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:10.990
<v Speaker 5>All the time.</v>

2624
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:12.550
<v Speaker 5>Like he was with the guy all the time.</v>

2625
01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:14.320
<v Speaker 5>I like Diego Man.</v>

2626
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:15.370
<v Speaker 5>He's a good dude.</v>

2627
01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.390
<v Speaker 5>He's a very good dude.</v>

2628
01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:16.811
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2629
01:06:16.811 --> 01:06:18.070
<v Speaker 5>That Rick's fight was crazy too.</v>

2630
01:06:18.071 --> 01:06:21.220
<v Speaker 5>Cause rigs never thought the Diego's got Kale stepping in.</v>

2631
01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:21.610
<v Speaker 5>Kayla.</v>

2632
01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:23.840
<v Speaker 5>And when the right hook like early in the fight too,</v>

2633
01:06:23.841 --> 01:06:24.430
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

2634
01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:26.710
<v Speaker 5>and rigs is one of those guys that see,</v>

2635
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that he ever totally showed in the octagon what he was capable of</v>

2636
01:06:33.071 --> 01:06:33.904
<v Speaker 5>in the gym.</v>

2637
01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:37.090
<v Speaker 5>And he also has a guard that peaked during like the kind of like the rich</v>

2638
01:06:37.091 --> 01:06:38.050
<v Speaker 5>Franklin Arrow.</v>

2639
01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:38.770
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2640
01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:40.150
<v Speaker 5>like when he fought Matt Hughes,</v>

2641
01:06:40.151 --> 01:06:41.050
<v Speaker 5>didn't he miss wait,</v>

2642
01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.220
<v Speaker 5>when he fought for the title,</v>

2643
01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:43.750
<v Speaker 5>Mr weighed against mad.</v>

2644
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:44.291
<v Speaker 5>He was mad.</v>

2645
01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:46.000
<v Speaker 5>He was Kimora Adam and,</v>

2646
01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:46.261
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

2647
01:06:46.261 --> 01:06:51.261
<v Speaker 5>what are the always heard is that Joe rigs in the gym was a world beater.</v>

2648
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.560
<v Speaker 5>Like people would spar with them and they'd be like,</v>

2649
01:06:53.561 --> 01:06:54.610
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

2650
01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:56.260
<v Speaker 5>Like Joe rigs are world champion.</v>

2651
01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:00.580
<v Speaker 5>Like he's that good and that he would be Dustin up all these like really high</v>

2652
01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:01.750
<v Speaker 5>level guys in the gym.</v>

2653
01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:02.621
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

2654
01:07:02.621 --> 01:07:05.350
<v Speaker 5>there's something though about being in the gym and you know,</v>

2655
01:07:05.351 --> 01:07:06.370
<v Speaker 5>you know this button.</v>

2656
01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:10.270
<v Speaker 5>The thing that about being in the gym versus being inside the Octagon.</v>

2657
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:12.023
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2658
01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:15.160
<v Speaker 5>it's that the stakes are a real now,</v>

2659
01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:16.360
<v Speaker 5>like in the gym,</v>

2660
01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:21.430
<v Speaker 5>a lot of guys will open up more because you can't really lose there.</v>

2661
01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:22.383
<v Speaker 5>You can't,</v>

2662
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2663
01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.760
<v Speaker 5>but when you're in the fight itself,</v>

2664
01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:25.661
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2665
01:07:25.661 --> 01:07:26.494
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2666
01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:27.371
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2667
01:07:27.371 --> 01:07:28.204
<v Speaker 5>you kind of,</v>

2668
01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.720
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to pull all the triggers because if,</v>

2669
01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:32.560
<v Speaker 5>if this bullet misses right,</v>

2670
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:33.221
<v Speaker 5>I'm exposed,</v>

2671
01:07:33.221 --> 01:07:34.450
<v Speaker 5>I got no defense to that.</v>

2672
01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:35.291
<v Speaker 5>So you're not,</v>

2673
01:07:35.291 --> 01:07:39.160
<v Speaker 5>you're not putting everything on the table that you would in the gym because the</v>

2674
01:07:39.161 --> 01:07:41.200
<v Speaker 5>risk is so much greater.</v>

2675
01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:42.500
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's where,</v>

2676
01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.470
<v Speaker 5>where are the guys who can perform,</v>

2677
01:07:44.471 --> 01:07:45.880
<v Speaker 5>who step up to the game?</v>

2678
01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:49.900
<v Speaker 5>I believe that's the aspect that they have to their game,</v>

2679
01:07:49.901 --> 01:07:52.570
<v Speaker 5>that that's missing from some of these guys who were world beaters in the gym.</v>

2680
01:07:52.571 --> 01:07:53.351
<v Speaker 5>But when they did it,</v>

2681
01:07:53.351 --> 01:07:54.640
<v Speaker 5>they just can't bring it to the field.</v>

2682
01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:56.500
<v Speaker 5>It's a mental strength for sure.</v>

2683
01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:59.670
<v Speaker 5>And it's a confidence and your technique and,</v>

2684
01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:00.513
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>

2685
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:01.503
<v Speaker 5>the outcome.</v>

2686
01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:03.550
<v Speaker 5>Some people think that the world's against him.</v>

2687
01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:04.350
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2688
01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:06.100
<v Speaker 5>there's an attitude that some people have.</v>

2689
01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.660
<v Speaker 5>Icon never works out for me.</v>

2690
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:08.800
<v Speaker 5>A fucking no more.</v>

2691
01:08:08.801 --> 01:08:10.060
<v Speaker 5>I can't catch a break off.</v>

2692
01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:10.721
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>

2693
01:08:10.721 --> 01:08:14.200
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting because those are the guys that can't catch a break and you</v>

2694
01:08:14.201 --> 01:08:15.034
<v Speaker 5>always wonder,</v>

2695
01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:16.310
<v Speaker 5>he always wonder</v>

2696
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:17.061
<v Speaker 2>what came first,</v>

2697
01:08:17.061 --> 01:08:17.841
<v Speaker 2>the chicken or the egg.</v>

2698
01:08:17.841 --> 01:08:22.841
<v Speaker 2>Is it the attitude that is making their life this impossible puzzle to solve or</v>

2699
01:08:25.011 --> 01:08:25.970
<v Speaker 2>is it they just got,</v>

2700
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.630
<v Speaker 2>they just keep getting shitty rolls of the dice are think it's the attitude</v>

2701
01:08:29.631 --> 01:08:30.464
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

2702
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:35.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a snowball effect from the very first decisions you make real</v>

2703
01:08:35.301 --> 01:08:36.110
<v Speaker 2>early on,</v>

2704
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:38.600
<v Speaker 2>especially when competing and you're like,</v>

2705
01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:41.180
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows that there's times where you can quit.</v>

2706
01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows there's times where you,</v>

2707
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:43.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2708
01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:46.730
<v Speaker 2>you didn't train as hard or you didn't push as hard or you didn't.</v>

2709
01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:50.480
<v Speaker 2>And some people don't.</v>

2710
01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't learn like they have those moments.</v>

2711
01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're a little kid and you know,</v>

2712
01:08:56.061 --> 01:08:58.610
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're wrestling or something like that and you got scared,</v>

2713
01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.890
<v Speaker 2>he didn't perform well and then you go back and go,</v>

2714
01:09:00.891 --> 01:09:01.724
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2715
01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:02.713
<v Speaker 2>that sucked.</v>

2716
01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that again.</v>

2717
01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.140
<v Speaker 2>I've got to figure out how to fucking toughen up or I've got to figure out how</v>

2718
01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:07.550
<v Speaker 2>to just perform.</v>

2719
01:09:07.730 --> 01:09:08.990
<v Speaker 2>And some people just don't date.</v>

2720
01:09:08.991 --> 01:09:10.670
<v Speaker 2>Some people just run away from it.</v>

2721
01:09:10.671 --> 01:09:12.980
<v Speaker 2>The runaway never ever see that thing again.</v>

2722
01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:13.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2723
01:09:13.491 --> 01:09:18.491
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's the weird little moments in fights that you could see</v>

2724
01:09:18.741 --> 01:09:20.480
<v Speaker 2>happening where guys are exhausted,</v>

2725
01:09:20.481 --> 01:09:21.560
<v Speaker 2>but they dig down.</v>

2726
01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.281
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

2727
01:09:22.281 --> 01:09:22.471
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

2728
01:09:22.471 --> 01:09:23.860
<v Speaker 2>I always call upon like,</v>

2729
01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.800
<v Speaker 2>here's a dude who's got impossible mental strength.</v>

2730
01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:29.540
<v Speaker 2>Darren Elkins,</v>

2731
01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Merseyside Tick Merseyside Beck is lightened him up like a Christmas tree in</v>

2732
01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:35.001
<v Speaker 2>Times Square.</v>

2733

2737
01:09:39.951 --> 01:09:41.300
<v Speaker 2>He looks fantastic.</v>

2738
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:43.610
<v Speaker 2>Darren Elkins won't stop.</v>

2739
01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:45.020
<v Speaker 2>He won't stop.</v>

2740
01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.250
<v Speaker 2>He keeps going.</v>

2741
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:47.430
<v Speaker 2>He keeps coming.</v>

2742
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:49.100
<v Speaker 2>He's absorbing punches,</v>

2743
01:09:49.101 --> 01:09:50.180
<v Speaker 2>he's covered in blood.</v>

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.101
<v Speaker 2>He catches them.</v>

2749
01:09:58.101 --> 01:09:59.510
<v Speaker 2>You see backtick Waba and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>

2754
01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Darren Elkins is pounded them out and then the referee stops the fight and then</v>

2755
01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.500
<v Speaker 2>can steps off of them is like,</v>

2756
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.190
<v Speaker 2>it's like God damn I that is,</v>

2757
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.790
<v Speaker 2>that is the reward for having indomitable spirit like that.</v>

2758
01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:17.680
<v Speaker 2>That is a,</v>

2759
01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.680
<v Speaker 2>the kind of victory cry that you only get when you went through hell and you did</v>

2760
01:10:23.061 --> 01:10:23.920
<v Speaker 2>not give up.</v>

2761
01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:24.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2762
01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:24.781

2763
01:10:24.781 --> 01:10:27.030
<v Speaker 4>that fight itself after the second,</v>

2764
01:10:27.031 --> 01:10:28.830
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was you just like,</v>

2765
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:29.731
<v Speaker 4>this is like,</v>

2766
01:10:29.731 --> 01:10:30.564
<v Speaker 4>they should be stopped.</v>

2767
01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:31.380
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2768
01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:32.270
<v Speaker 4>This should be stopped.</v>

2769
01:10:32.271 --> 01:10:35.910
<v Speaker 4>He's though there's no chance and I don't really watch them get beat up as much.</v>

2770
01:10:35.911 --> 01:10:36.181
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2771
01:10:36.181 --> 01:10:36.480
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2772
01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:36.720
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2773
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.260
<v Speaker 4>like tweeting about the fight and watching and I'm looking back and forth and</v>

2774
01:10:40.261 --> 01:10:41.220
<v Speaker 4>then holy fuck,</v>

2775
01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.540

<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>

2778
01:10:45.621 --> 01:10:47.690
<v Speaker 2>And then Elkins chokes out Michael Johnson.</v>

2779
01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Man shows people he's got skills.</v>

2780
01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:49.590
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2781
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.940
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2782
01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:50.671
<v Speaker 2>that's the other thing.</v>

2783
01:10:50.671 --> 01:10:51.504
<v Speaker 2>There it is right there.</v>

2784
01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:52.281

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.430

2788
01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.310
<v Speaker 2>like just an undefeated coming into this fight.</v>

2789
01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Daren was covered in blood and he got crucifixed here and he's getting smashed</v>

2790
01:11:04.101 --> 01:11:05.420
<v Speaker 2>with punches and elbows.</v>

2791

2793
01:11:09.171 --> 01:11:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Darren just doesn't give up.</v>

2794
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:12.470
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing about Messiah is massage.</v>

2795
01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.440
<v Speaker 4>I've trained Messiah,</v>

2796
01:11:13.450 --> 01:11:14.640
<v Speaker 4>Messiah trains hard.</v>

2797
01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:17.520
<v Speaker 4>His conditioning earlier that is conditioning is on point.</v>

2801
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:23.051
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

2803
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:27.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2804
01:11:27.311 --> 01:11:28.420
<v Speaker 2>It's another one like that.</v>

2805
01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:30.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember her victory dude.</v>

2806
01:11:30.311 --> 01:11:31.690
<v Speaker 2>That one is bone chilling.</v>

2807
01:11:31.691 --> 01:11:32.740
<v Speaker 2>You hear the scream,</v>

2808
01:11:32.741 --> 01:11:33.130

01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:33.963
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:36.910
<v Speaker 2>Like it gets your hair like I might,</v>

2811
01:11:36.911 --> 01:11:38.700
<v Speaker 2>I got goosebumps just thinking about it.</v>

2812
01:11:38.701 --> 01:11:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2813
01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:39.903
<v Speaker 2>Listen to that</v>

2814
01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:46.060
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2815
01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.500
<v Speaker 4>That meant a lot to her man.</v>

2816
01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:48.940
<v Speaker 4>You can hear it.</v>

2817
01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:49.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2818
01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.373
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

2819
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:52.660
<v Speaker 4>that's some shit you can't fake.</v>

2820
01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:53.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2821
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.660
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2822
01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:56.440
<v Speaker 4>there's something about what you were saying though about um,</v>

2823
01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.380
<v Speaker 4>people like walking away from these things.</v>

2824
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:01.793
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2825
01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.180
<v Speaker 4>it makes me think of like of a kid,</v>

2826
01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:05.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry this is,</v>

2827
01:12:05.161 --> 01:12:07.840
<v Speaker 4>this is going to be like a bunch of things tied into one thing,</v>

2828
01:12:07.841 --> 01:12:08.674
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2829
01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.230
<v Speaker 4>babies when they're first born,</v>

2830
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:14.140
<v Speaker 4>like first thing that come out of babies usually cry.</v>

2831
01:12:14.141 --> 01:12:14.490
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2832
01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:14.800
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2833
01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.940
<v Speaker 4>And it's like my thought on that is like this is the first time they felt</v>

2834
01:12:18.941 --> 01:12:20.500
<v Speaker 4>anything outside of that womb.</v>

2835
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:21.100
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2836
01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:21.361
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2837
01:12:21.361 --> 01:12:23.920
<v Speaker 4>and they don't know what pain is like a pain tolerance.</v>

2838
01:12:23.921 --> 01:12:26.290
<v Speaker 4>The first time you got kicked it it,</v>

2839
01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:28.240
<v Speaker 4>it hurts a lot more than it does now.</v>

2840
01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:28.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2841
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:29.081
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2842
01:12:29.081 --> 01:12:31.690
<v Speaker 4>So like every sensation is new for them.</v>

2843
01:12:31.691 --> 01:12:31.961
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2844
01:12:31.961 --> 01:12:33.610
<v Speaker 4>And then you're growing up and you grow up to be,</v>

2845
01:12:33.611 --> 01:12:34.321
<v Speaker 4>these people in your,</v>

2846
01:12:34.321 --> 01:12:35.890
<v Speaker 4>your parents are telling you can do anything,</v>

2847
01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:38.410
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time they're telling you don't do that.</v>

2848
01:12:38.890 --> 01:12:39.640
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2849
01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.473
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

2850
01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.560
<v Speaker 4>like the mind is,</v>

2851
01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:42.580
<v Speaker 4>your brain is this,</v>

2852
01:12:42.581 --> 01:12:46.660
<v Speaker 4>this is a blank slate when you're born and you get all these different</v>

2853
01:12:46.661 --> 01:12:47.494
<v Speaker 4>influences.</v>

2854
01:12:47.710 --> 01:12:50.980
<v Speaker 4>And this goes back to the people that are like,</v>

2855
01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:51.911
<v Speaker 4>I can't catch a break.</v>

2856
01:12:51.911 --> 01:12:52.900
<v Speaker 4>I can't get your break.</v>

2857
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.980
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2858
01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:55.293
<v Speaker 4>are we,</v>

2859
01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.850
<v Speaker 4>are we doing this right?</v>

2860
01:12:57.910 --> 01:13:00.580
<v Speaker 4>Because for so many people that have this attitude,</v>

2861
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.511
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2862
01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:02.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2863
01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:02.941
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2864
01:13:02.941 --> 01:13:03.311
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>

2865
01:13:03.311 --> 01:13:04.420
<v Speaker 4>where is that coming from?</v>

2866
01:13:04.421 --> 01:13:05.320
<v Speaker 4>Because it's,</v>

2867
01:13:05.410 --> 01:13:08.140
<v Speaker 4>there are so many people like that and then there are people that are like that</v>

2868
01:13:08.141 --> 01:13:10.210
<v Speaker 4>at times and then,</v>

2869
01:13:10.450 --> 01:13:10.961
<v Speaker 4>but they can,</v>

2870
01:13:10.961 --> 01:13:14.180
<v Speaker 4>they can either come out of it and started having good things or,</v>

2871
01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.450
<v Speaker 4>and then they go back into it and they bounced back and forth.</v>

2872
01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:18.910
<v Speaker 4>But why are people the way they are?</v>

2873
01:13:18.911 --> 01:13:19.810
<v Speaker 4>Like the Ma,</v>

2874
01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:23.860
<v Speaker 4>the human mind to me is like the most amazing,</v>

2875
01:13:23.861 --> 01:13:25.060
<v Speaker 4>confusing.</v>

2876
01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:26.403
<v Speaker 4>Like ev,</v>

2877
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:27.731
<v Speaker 4>it's everything,</v>

2878
01:13:27.731 --> 01:13:29.620
<v Speaker 4>but like there's no rule.</v>

2879
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2880
01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:30.821
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

2881
01:13:30.821 --> 01:13:30.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2882
01:13:30.921 --> 01:13:31.151
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2883
01:13:31.151 --> 01:13:32.420
<v Speaker 2>everybody's different there.</v>

2884
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's similar,</v>

2885
01:13:33.401 --> 01:13:34.390
<v Speaker 2>but everybody's different.</v>

2886
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:37.900
<v Speaker 2>And your attitude has a giant effect,</v>

2887
01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:41.890
<v Speaker 2>not just on your life but on other people's lives around you.</v>

2888
01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.180
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing about it.</v>

2889
01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:43.451
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

2890
01:13:43.451 --> 01:13:44.830
<v Speaker 2>I can't catch a break guys.</v>

2891
01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Get them the fuck away from me.</v>

2892
01:13:47.050 --> 01:13:47.590
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

2893
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:48.910
<v Speaker 2>I can't be around those guys.</v>

2894
01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:50.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear that shit.</v>

2895
01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear that shit.</v>

2896
01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:54.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy it because everybody has bad brakes.</v>

2897
01:13:54.251 --> 01:13:54.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2898
01:13:54.371 --> 01:13:56.110
<v Speaker 2>I've had a shit ton of bad breaks,</v>

2899
01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:57.070
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I did?</v>

2900
01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:02.100
<v Speaker 2>I stayed up and I thought through it and I figured out what the fuck I did wrong</v>

2901
01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:03.160
<v Speaker 2>and then I went back.</v>

2902
01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:06.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like I fucked up everything I've ever done a hundred times.</v>

2903
01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:07.533
<v Speaker 2>There's no way to other,</v>

2904
01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.870
<v Speaker 2>there's no other way to do it and I've had a bunch of shitty breaks everybody,</v>

2905
01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 2>but you got to realize</v>

2906
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.180
<v Speaker 3>when you have those shitty breaks,</v>

2907
01:14:13.181 --> 01:14:14.014
<v Speaker 3>what that is,</v>

2908
01:14:14.170 --> 01:14:17.230
<v Speaker 3>it's an opportunity for you to reassess,</v>

2909
01:14:17.231 --> 01:14:17.831
<v Speaker 3>reboot,</v>

2910
01:14:17.831 --> 01:14:18.521
<v Speaker 3>get better,</v>

2911
01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:19.660
<v Speaker 3>figure out another way,</v>

2912
01:14:19.661 --> 01:14:21.040
<v Speaker 3>find another way through.</v>

2913
01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:21.511
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2914
01:14:21.511 --> 01:14:24.430
<v Speaker 3>this is just a little challenges and the people that look at those challenges to</v>

2915
01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:24.581
<v Speaker 3>gold,</v>

2916
01:14:24.581 --> 01:14:26.260
<v Speaker 3>one whoa does have its challenges,</v>

2917
01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.393
<v Speaker 3>their cancer,</v>

2918
01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:29.110
<v Speaker 3>those people are dangerous to be around.</v>

2919
01:14:29.111 --> 01:14:30.820
<v Speaker 3>They will rob you of your enthusiasm.</v>

2920
01:14:30.821 --> 01:14:33.320
<v Speaker 3>They don't give you any fuel that the opposite of fuel,</v>

2921
01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:35.360
<v Speaker 3>the fuel people there,</v>

2922
01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:35.690
<v Speaker 3>the whole,</v>

2923
01:14:35.690 --> 01:14:36.970
<v Speaker 3>the people that are kicking ass,</v>

2924
01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.980
<v Speaker 3>the people that are out there just fucking hustling,</v>

2925
01:14:39.010 --> 01:14:39.551
<v Speaker 3>always,</v>

2926
01:14:39.551 --> 01:14:40.900
<v Speaker 3>always getting things done.</v>

2927
01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:45.310
<v Speaker 3>It got like my friend Jocko every morning I'll check his Instagram page for 30</v>

2928
01:14:45.311 --> 01:14:45.551
<v Speaker 3>shows,</v>

2929
01:14:45.551 --> 01:14:46.450
<v Speaker 3>a picture of his watch.</v>

2930
01:14:46.451 --> 01:14:47.284
<v Speaker 3>Get after it.</v>

2931
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.420
<v Speaker 3>He's out there working out four 30 in the morning.</v>

2932
01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:50.770
<v Speaker 3>He does it every fucking morning.</v>

2933
01:14:50.771 --> 01:14:51.041
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2934
01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:51.700
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>

2935
01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:53.530
<v Speaker 3>cause he doesn't want to and that's how you do it.</v>

2936
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.520
<v Speaker 3>You go and get after it.</v>

2937
01:14:54.521 --> 01:14:57.460
<v Speaker 3>You don't make any excuses and those kind of guys are fuel.</v>

2938
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:58.151
<v Speaker 3>But those,</v>

2939
01:14:58.151 --> 01:14:59.440
<v Speaker 3>I can't catch a break guys.</v>

2940
01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:00.770
<v Speaker 3>They're the opposite of fuel.</v>

2941
01:15:00.771 --> 01:15:02.110
<v Speaker 3>They just pissing on your fire.</v>

2942
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:03.183
<v Speaker 3>They're no fun.</v>

2943
01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:03.611
<v Speaker 3>And though,</v>

2944
01:15:03.611 --> 01:15:07.540
<v Speaker 3>and then the people that surround them are all idiots because only idiots want</v>

2945
01:15:07.541 --> 01:15:08.081
<v Speaker 3>to be around.</v>

2946
01:15:08.081 --> 01:15:08.950
<v Speaker 3>I can't catch a break.</v>

2947
01:15:08.951 --> 01:15:12.010
<v Speaker 3>Guys owned a dummy stick around after a while.</v>

2948
01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:13.000
<v Speaker 3>Even if they're your good friend,</v>

2949
01:15:13.001 --> 01:15:13.720
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be like,</v>

2950
01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:13.991
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>

2951
01:15:13.991 --> 01:15:15.460
<v Speaker 3>you got to fucking stop.</v>

2952
01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:16.630
<v Speaker 3>You've gotta stop with all this.</v>

2953
01:15:16.631 --> 01:15:17.650
<v Speaker 3>I can't catch a break.</v>

2954
01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit all the time.</v>

2955
01:15:19.001 --> 01:15:19.990
<v Speaker 3>Your complaining.</v>

2956
01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.730
<v Speaker 3>You could be instead hustling.</v>

2957
01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.680
<v Speaker 3>You could be instead chasing your dream.</v>

2958
01:15:23.681 --> 01:15:26.140
<v Speaker 3>You could be instead figuring out what you're doing wrong,</v>

2959
01:15:26.141 --> 01:15:27.820
<v Speaker 3>trying to improve certain aspects of your life,</v>

2960
01:15:27.821 --> 01:15:28.720
<v Speaker 3>getting your shit together,</v>

2961
01:15:28.721 --> 01:15:29.500
<v Speaker 3>reading a book,</v>

2962
01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.120
<v Speaker 3>meditating something,</v>

2963
01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:32.440
<v Speaker 3>fucking something.</v>

2964
01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:32.981
<v Speaker 3>But this,</v>

2965
01:15:32.981 --> 01:15:33.910
<v Speaker 3>I can't catch a break.</v>

2966
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Shit is not helping anybody and it pushes everybody away from you.</v>

2967
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.170
<v Speaker 3>But some people they get caught in that pattern and it might be their parents.</v>

2968
01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:42.700
<v Speaker 3>It might be how they were raised.</v>

2969
01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:45.100
<v Speaker 3>Somebody might've told him they were useless real early on.</v>

2970
01:15:45.101 --> 01:15:46.390
<v Speaker 3>It's stuck and they just,</v>

2971
01:15:46.391 --> 01:15:47.224
<v Speaker 3>they always,</v>

2972
01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:49.690
<v Speaker 3>they never feel like they get enough reassurance.</v>

2973
01:15:49.691 --> 01:15:53.650
<v Speaker 3>They never feel like they get enough motivation and they feel like other people</v>

2974
01:15:53.651 --> 01:15:56.740
<v Speaker 3>get more and they look at all these other people who commute to hook them.</v>

2975
01:15:56.741 --> 01:15:57.574
<v Speaker 3>She gets this,</v>

2976
01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.420
<v Speaker 3>how come he's got that going on and that all that's bad for you too.</v>

2977
01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.980
<v Speaker 3>That shit ain't no good for you.</v>

2978
01:16:03.010 --> 01:16:07.300
<v Speaker 3>How much of that is tied into not paying attention to yourself?</v>

2979
01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:07.601
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

2980
01:16:07.601 --> 01:16:09.070
<v Speaker 3>not knowing yourself,</v>

2981
01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:09.940
<v Speaker 3>you know how much time,</v>

2982
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.590
<v Speaker 3>how much of that is his time as tuned into a,</v>

2983
01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.890
<v Speaker 3>tied into you always on your brain,</v>

2984
01:16:17.891 --> 01:16:18.930
<v Speaker 3>always outside of yourself.</v>

2985
01:16:18.930 --> 01:16:19.100
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2986
01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:20.440
<v Speaker 3>you've flushing,</v>

2987
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:23.740
<v Speaker 3>you're flooding your brain with TV or Instagram or you know,</v>

2988
01:16:23.741 --> 01:16:24.071
<v Speaker 3>and not,</v>

2989
01:16:24.071 --> 01:16:28.990
<v Speaker 3>not something that even even reading a book I believe is,</v>

2990
01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:29.853
<v Speaker 3>is different.</v>

2991
01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:30.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2992
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:31.510
<v Speaker 3>when you're watching TV,</v>

2993
01:16:31.511 --> 01:16:32.350
<v Speaker 3>what you're watching,</v>

2994
01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.393
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2995
01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.560
<v Speaker 3>If you're watching something that,</v>

2996
01:16:34.561 --> 01:16:37.120
<v Speaker 3>that has a message where you have to think where you,</v>

2997
01:16:37.121 --> 01:16:41.620
<v Speaker 3>you can see yourself in that and you can put yourself in these situations and</v>

2998
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:42.310
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2999
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:43.143
<v Speaker 3>oh well that's,</v>

3000
01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.350
<v Speaker 3>I can empathize with that.</v>

3001
01:16:44.351 --> 01:16:44.401
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3002
01:16:44.401 --> 01:16:44.980
<v Speaker 3>I can this.</v>

3003
01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.210
<v Speaker 3>But when you're just watching,</v>

3004
01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:47.373
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3005
01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:49.400
<v Speaker 3>spending money on cars and,</v>

3006
01:16:49.401 --> 01:16:51.610
<v Speaker 3>and making it rain and this and that,</v>

3007
01:16:51.611 --> 01:16:51.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3008
01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:52.803
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3009
01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:54.190
<v Speaker 3>and wonder how much of that,</v>

3010
01:16:54.191 --> 01:16:59.191
<v Speaker 3>because like the thing and I've found is like entertainment isn't what it used</v>

3011
01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:01.680
<v Speaker 3>to be and this,</v>

3012
01:17:01.681 --> 01:17:02.231
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

3013
01:17:02.231 --> 01:17:03.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sound old as shit,</v>

3014
01:17:03.521 --> 01:17:04.354
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3015
01:17:05.050 --> 01:17:05.890
<v Speaker 3>Back in my day,</v>

3016
01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:08.890
<v Speaker 3>entertainment entertainment wasn't what it is now.</v>

3017
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:09.973
<v Speaker 3>It's just like</v>

3018
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.900
<v Speaker 5>bright lights and flashing bombs.</v>

3019
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:12.230
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3020
01:17:12.230 --> 01:17:14.750
<v Speaker 5>Versus like something that you could actually feel.</v>

3021
01:17:14.751 --> 01:17:16.640
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it's a lot less of that.</v>

3022
01:17:16.730 --> 01:17:16.881
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3023
01:17:16.881 --> 01:17:19.490
<v Speaker 5>there's some entertainment that you could feel like TV shows.</v>

3024
01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:22.730
<v Speaker 5>Do you watch black mirror that'll freak the fuck out of you or make you think</v>

3025
01:17:22.731 --> 01:17:24.680
<v Speaker 5>there's still some good shit that's being made.</v>

3026
01:17:24.810 --> 01:17:25.750
<v Speaker 5>The stranger things there's,</v>

3027
01:17:25.930 --> 01:17:27.800
<v Speaker 5>and go find it so much more.</v>

3028
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:29.210
<v Speaker 5>Like I feel like the,</v>

3029
01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:30.170
<v Speaker 5>the bigger things,</v>

3030
01:17:30.171 --> 01:17:32.660
<v Speaker 5>like the things that most people have access to</v>

3031
01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.140
<v Speaker 5>that I think that's what it is.</v>

3032
01:17:36.230 --> 01:17:36.590
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

3033
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.950
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3034
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:40.240
<v Speaker 5>But is it that they have more access to that or is that the easiest thing to</v>

3035
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:41.570
<v Speaker 5>easiest thing to,</v>

3036
01:17:41.571 --> 01:17:42.404
<v Speaker 5>to consume?</v>

3037
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:43.820
<v Speaker 5>It's very easy to consume.</v>

3038
01:17:43.821 --> 01:17:46.280
<v Speaker 5>It's mindless and everybody wants cars.</v>

3039
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.671
<v Speaker 5>Uber,</v>

3040
01:17:46.671 --> 01:17:47.210
<v Speaker 5>the car,</v>

3041
01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:48.110
<v Speaker 5>everybody wants money.</v>

3042
01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:48.953
<v Speaker 5>Look at his money.</v>

3043
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:49.401
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3044
01:17:49.401 --> 01:17:51.660
<v Speaker 5>it's like you just get sucked up in it and it's,</v>

3045
01:17:51.670 --> 01:17:55.430
<v Speaker 5>it's a very low level frequency that everybody sorta has like a little bit of it</v>

3046
01:17:55.431 --> 01:17:56.181
<v Speaker 5>and you see this,</v>

3047
01:17:56.181 --> 01:17:58.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm dude with his open shirt,</v>

3048
01:17:58.310 --> 01:18:02.780
<v Speaker 5>all these chains and it's always girls behind him and their underwear.</v>

3049
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:03.701
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's dancing.</v>

3050
01:18:03.701 --> 01:18:05.030
<v Speaker 5>It's like this guy's life's a party.</v>

3051
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.260
<v Speaker 5>My life is a party.</v>

3052
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.700
<v Speaker 5>I can't catch a fucking break.</v>

3053
01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:08.481
<v Speaker 5>I'm over here.</v>

3054
01:18:08.481 --> 01:18:09.870
<v Speaker 5>A current character work.</v>

3055
01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:10.990
<v Speaker 5>It's cool.</v>

3056
01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:11.250
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3057
01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:12.890
<v Speaker 5>it's cool sometimes,</v>

3058
01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:13.753
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3059
01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.990
<v Speaker 5>sometimes it's silly.</v>

3060
01:18:15.170 --> 01:18:15.471
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3061
01:18:15.471 --> 01:18:16.150
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

3062
01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:17.390
<v Speaker 5>Because there's a point like,</v>

3063
01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:18.591
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3064
01:18:18.591 --> 01:18:18.891
<v Speaker 5>who's,</v>

3065
01:18:18.891 --> 01:18:23.620
<v Speaker 5>who's a deep guy fucking chilling and Shell is very deep and he,</v>

3066
01:18:23.621 --> 01:18:24.170
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

3067
01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:26.690
<v Speaker 5>he pointed this out to me through a different way,</v>

3068
01:18:26.691 --> 01:18:30.130
<v Speaker 5>but there's a point where everything becomes a bad thing.</v>

3069
01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.720
<v Speaker 5>There's a point where like humility is,</v>

3070
01:18:31.721 --> 01:18:31.921
<v Speaker 5>is a,</v>

3071
01:18:31.921 --> 01:18:32.754
<v Speaker 5>is a bad thing.</v>

3072
01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:36.860
<v Speaker 5>There's a point where I'm having fun as a bad thing.</v>

3073
01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:38.930
<v Speaker 5>It's like you can't,</v>

3074
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:39.883
<v Speaker 5>you can't,</v>

3075
01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:41.090
<v Speaker 5>like eating does,</v>

3076
01:18:41.091 --> 01:18:43.290
<v Speaker 5>it isn't always a pleasure if you,</v>

3077
01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:44.300
<v Speaker 5>if you're constantly eating,</v>

3078
01:18:44.301 --> 01:18:45.410
<v Speaker 5>if you're never hungry,</v>

3079
01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:47.750
<v Speaker 5>you don't appreciate it as much as if you are hungry.</v>

3080
01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:49.581
<v Speaker 5>Because if you're,</v>

3081
01:18:49.581 --> 01:18:51.910
<v Speaker 5>if you're starving and they feed you and you can start you,</v>

3082
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.020
<v Speaker 5>you're full and you have to keep eating,</v>

3083
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:54.840
<v Speaker 5>that's not fun.</v>

3084
01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:55.261
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

3085
01:18:55.261 --> 01:18:55.521
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

3086
01:18:55.521 --> 01:18:55.850
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3087
01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:56.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3088
01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:56.921
<v Speaker 5>So there's,</v>

3089
01:18:56.921 --> 01:19:00.290
<v Speaker 5>there's this moderation thing that I feel that's missing and I'm trying to find</v>

3090
01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:01.400
<v Speaker 5>that balance with myself,</v>

3091
01:19:01.401 --> 01:19:01.820
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3092

<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3096
01:19:06.021 --> 01:19:06.291
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

3097
01:19:06.291 --> 01:19:08.750
<v Speaker 5>with how much time I spend doing this versus this.</v>

3098
01:19:08.751 --> 01:19:10.780
<v Speaker 5>Especially now that I'm not fighting because that,</v>

3099
01:19:10.781 --> 01:19:12.440
<v Speaker 5>that was for a long time.</v>

3100
01:19:12.441 --> 01:19:14.810
<v Speaker 5>That was the biggest part of my days.</v>

3101
01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:15.170
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3102
01:19:15.170 --> 01:19:18.920
<v Speaker 5>just just training and everything else and now I still get to train,</v>

3103
01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:23.570
<v Speaker 5>but I have more time and a lot of time by myself in my own head.</v>

3104
01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:25.420
<v Speaker 5>So I'm back to reading and listening.</v>

3113
01:19:41.301 --> 01:19:42.030

3124
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:57.470
<v Speaker 5>It's not because the kid didn't do anything wrong,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I knew I came at 15.</v>

3201
01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:55.770

3205
01:21:57.511 --> 01:21:59.340
<v Speaker 5>the years when everything is being set,</v>

3206
01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:00.720
<v Speaker 5>I was in The Bahamas,</v>

3207
01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:01.763
<v Speaker 5>in your brain.</v>

3208
01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.120
<v Speaker 5>So when I got here,</v>

3209
01:22:03.121 --> 01:22:05.550
<v Speaker 5>like I still had no idea what the confederate flag was.</v>

3210
01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:05.930
<v Speaker 5>A,</v>

3211
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:10.830

3215
01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:16.110
<v Speaker 5>And when I got here I didn't know anything about that.</v>

3216
01:22:16.111 --> 01:22:19.620
<v Speaker 5>The confederate flag didn't mean anything to me until I was in my twenties man.</v>

3230
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:47.730
<v Speaker 5>we were driving and there was a truck with a US flag posted on the back.</v>

01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:07.460
<v Speaker 2>got a lot of great quality.</v>

3243
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Know you guys need a new flag.</v>

3244
01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.210
<v Speaker 2>You can't have the flag of the dudes who are fighting for slavery.</v>

3245
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:15.330
<v Speaker 2>You can't have that anymore Joe.</v>

3246
01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:16.450
<v Speaker 2>They weren't fighting for slavery.</v>

3247
01:23:18.430 --> 01:23:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3248
01:23:18.730 --> 01:23:19.070
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3249
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:21.100
<v Speaker 2>that argument is a piss poor argument.</v>

3250
01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:22.000
<v Speaker 2>It falls apart.</v>

3251
01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:25.090
<v Speaker 2>That argument is one of the shittiest arguments and people try to,</v>

3252
01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:29.740
<v Speaker 2>they try to like soldier up and use big words and try to repackage that</v>

3253
01:23:29.741 --> 01:23:30.574
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

3254
01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:32.560
<v Speaker 2>They wanted slavery period.</v>

3255
01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:34.530
<v Speaker 2>They're fighting for economics.</v>

3256
01:23:34.570 --> 01:23:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3257
01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:35.470
<v Speaker 2>Slavery.</v>

3258
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:36.760
<v Speaker 2>They wanted people to work for free.</v>

3259
01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:38.440
<v Speaker 2>That's like a big part of what it was.</v>

3260
01:23:38.441 --> 01:23:40.390
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of other shit going on as well.</v>

3261
01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:41.380
<v Speaker 2>That was a big part of it.</v>

3262
01:23:41.381 --> 01:23:42.610
<v Speaker 2>That was a huge part of it.</v>

3263
01:23:42.670 --> 01:23:43.361
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it's,</v>

3264
01:23:43.361 --> 01:23:47.800
<v Speaker 2>it's representative in the laws that came right after slavery was abolished.</v>

3265
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that there's a reason why,</v>

3266
01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:50.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3267
01:23:50.891 --> 01:23:52.600
<v Speaker 2>when people think about people from the south,</v>

3268
01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.670
<v Speaker 2>people think of them as being like slack,</v>

3269
01:23:54.671 --> 01:23:56.380
<v Speaker 2>jawed and kind of stupid.</v>

3270
01:23:56.410 --> 01:23:58.240
<v Speaker 2>That's like the worst stereotype.</v>

3271
01:23:58.241 --> 01:23:58.421
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3272
01:23:58.421 --> 01:23:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3273
01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Southern people knew her,</v>

3274
01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:00.821

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3277
01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:07.080
<v Speaker 2>There was a hookworm epidemic in the south for years where a substantial portion</v>

3278
01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:13.060
<v Speaker 2>of the population had hookworm where they were walking around barefoot and they</v>

3279
01:24:13.061 --> 01:24:18.061
<v Speaker 2>got shit in their fee and those parasites infected their brain and compromise</v>

3280
01:24:18.311 --> 01:24:22.480
<v Speaker 2>the way they think and severely diminishes your,</v>

3281
01:24:22.481 --> 01:24:23.680
<v Speaker 2>your level of thinking.</v>

3282
01:24:24.130 --> 01:24:25.570
<v Speaker 2>So does that,</v>

3283

01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Here it goes.</v>

3305
01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:53.050
<v Speaker 2>How a worm gave the south a bad name.</v>

3306
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:54.183
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

3307
01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:55.300
<v Speaker 2>Make the shit a little bigger.</v>

3308
01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3309
01:24:55.930 --> 01:24:56.980
<v Speaker 2>for more than three centuries,</v>

3310
01:24:56.981 --> 01:24:58.060
<v Speaker 2>a plague of unshakable,</v>

3311
01:24:58.061 --> 01:25:00.550
<v Speaker 2>lethargic blanketed the American south.</v>

3312
01:25:00.551 --> 01:25:02.200
<v Speaker 2>It began with ground itch,</v>

3313
01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:07.060
<v Speaker 2>a prickly tingling in the tender webs between the toes soon followed by a dry</v>

3314
01:25:07.061 --> 01:25:07.511
<v Speaker 2>cough.</v>

3315
01:25:07.511 --> 01:25:08.051
<v Speaker 2>Weeks later,</v>

3316
01:25:08.051 --> 01:25:12.280
<v Speaker 2>victim succumb to an insatiable exhaustion and an impenetrable haziness of the</v>

3317
01:25:12.281 --> 01:25:14.710
<v Speaker 2>mind that some called stupidity.</v>

3318
01:25:15.070 --> 01:25:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Adults neglected their fields and children grew pale and listless victims</v>

3319
01:25:19.451 --> 01:25:22.840
<v Speaker 2>develop grossly distended bellies and angel wings.</v>

3320
01:25:22.841 --> 01:25:27.841
<v Speaker 2>A macerated shoulderblades accentuated by hunching all gays doubt Deli from</v>

3321
01:25:27.851 --> 01:25:30.670
<v Speaker 2>sunken sockets with a telltale fisheye stare.</v>

3322
01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:34.240
<v Speaker 2>The culprit behind the germ of laziness of the south's affliction was sometimes</v>

3323
01:25:34.241 --> 01:25:34.930
<v Speaker 2>called,</v>

3324
01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:39.880
<v Speaker 2>was nick k tore Americana's the American murderer.</v>

3325
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3326
01:25:40.570 --> 01:25:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Better known today as the Hookworm,</v>

3327
01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:45.370
<v Speaker 2>millions of those blood sucking parasites lived,</v>

3328
01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:46.120
<v Speaker 2>fed,</v>

3329
01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:46.931
<v Speaker 2>multiplied,</v>

3330
01:25:46.931 --> 01:25:51.130
<v Speaker 2>and died within the guts of up to 40% of the population.</v>

3331
01:25:51.150 --> 01:25:54.400
<v Speaker 2>Stretching from southern southeastern Texas to West Virginia.</v>

3332
01:25:54.690 --> 01:25:59.230
<v Speaker 2>Hooks warms stymied development throughout the region and bread stereotypes</v>

3333
01:25:59.231 --> 01:26:00.070
<v Speaker 2>about lazy,</v>

3334
01:26:00.071 --> 01:26:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Moronic southerners.</v>

3335
01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:03.530
<v Speaker 2>So where do you as you're reading that,</v>

3336
01:26:03.531 --> 01:26:04.640
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah,</v>

3337
01:26:04.641 --> 01:26:05.181
<v Speaker 2>that's gross.</v>

3338
01:26:05.181 --> 01:26:08.030
<v Speaker 2>I remember learning about hookworms as a kid in The Bahamas,</v>

3339
01:26:08.031 --> 01:26:08.890
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

3340
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.830
<v Speaker 2>as you're reading that,</v>

3341
01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:10.664
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3342
01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:11.330
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

3343
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this is,</v>

3344
01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:14.780
<v Speaker 2>I go through this whole thing in my brain as you're reading.</v>

3345
01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.960
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if they didn't do what they did to native Americans because those guys had</v>

3346
01:26:20.061 --> 01:26:24.350
<v Speaker 2>moccasins and they probably had magazines because they learned about this a</v>

3347
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:25.150
<v Speaker 2>couple of hundred years ago.</v>

3348
01:26:25.150 --> 01:26:25.831
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3349
01:26:25.831 --> 01:26:26.361
<v Speaker 2>No Shit.</v>

3350
01:26:26.361 --> 01:26:27.194
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3351
01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.760
<v Speaker 2>If anybody was going to be barefoot,</v>

3352
01:26:28.761 --> 01:26:29.720
<v Speaker 2>it'd be the native American.</v>

3353
01:26:29.721 --> 01:26:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3354
01:26:30.170 --> 01:26:30.620
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

3355
01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:31.453
<v Speaker 2>no dog.</v>

3356
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:32.683
<v Speaker 2>Not a good move.</v>

3357
01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Got To cover your feet,</v>

3358
01:26:33.831 --> 01:26:34.011
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3359
01:26:34.011 --> 01:26:36.500
<v Speaker 2>It's been shit gets in there and get stupid and can't figure out how to find the</v>

3360
01:26:36.501 --> 01:26:37.334
<v Speaker 2>buffalo anymore.</v>

3361
01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:37.770
<v Speaker 2>That's where,</v>

3362
01:26:37.770 --> 01:26:41.140
<v Speaker 2>that's where that's sharing information comes in handy,</v>

3363
01:26:41.141 --> 01:26:41.810
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3364
01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:42.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

3365
01:26:43.130 --> 01:26:44.150
<v Speaker 2>That's a real good point.</v>

3366
01:26:44.151 --> 01:26:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Cause I always think that when I see that all those survivor dudes,</v>

3367
01:26:47.291 --> 01:26:48.560
<v Speaker 2>I like to walk around barefoot.</v>

3368
01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:53.150
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy dudes to get the thick calluses and the bottom of their feet and</v>

3369
01:26:53.151 --> 01:26:53.811
<v Speaker 2>their idea is that,</v>

3370
01:26:53.811 --> 01:26:54.390
<v Speaker 2>you know like,</v>

3371
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.651
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3372
01:26:54.651 --> 01:26:55.880
<v Speaker 2>if the world goes to shrimp,</v>

3373
01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:58.190
<v Speaker 2>you're going to need to be able to walk barefoot.</v>

3374
01:26:59.480 --> 01:26:59.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3375
01:26:59.781 --> 01:27:01.100
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

3376
01:27:01.130 --> 01:27:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

3377
01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you make shoes,</v>

3378
01:27:02.751 --> 01:27:03.584
<v Speaker 2>you fuck,</v>

3379
01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:06.170
<v Speaker 2>you know there's a bunch of shoes and warehouses the world.</v>

3380
01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:06.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3381
01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:07.190
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3382
01:27:07.190 --> 01:27:08.023
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

3383
01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:09.890
<v Speaker 2>how would you run out of shoes?</v>

3384
01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:10.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3385
01:27:10.371 --> 01:27:11.150
<v Speaker 2>if you just,</v>

3386
01:27:11.150 --> 01:27:11.731
<v Speaker 2>if you found it,</v>

3387
01:27:11.731 --> 01:27:12.480
<v Speaker 2>the world was gonna End,</v>

3388
01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:15.530
<v Speaker 2>you bought 20 pairs of shoes that might last you two,</v>

3389
01:27:15.531 --> 01:27:16.364
<v Speaker 2>you're dead.</v>

3390
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:17.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3391
01:27:17.690 --> 01:27:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it depends on what you're doing.</v>

3392
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.790
<v Speaker 2>What kind of hiking.</v>

3393
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:21.623
<v Speaker 2>You're running a lot.</v>

3394
01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Burn through those.</v>

3395
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:25.850
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you're going to have to be on your feet more because you got hunt now.</v>

3396
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:26.570
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

3397
01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:27.650
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to be hiking.</v>

3398
01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3399
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you need more than 20 you don't need more than 50 50 pairs of shoes.</v>

3400
01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Probably repurpose them to,</v>

3401
01:27:33.970 --> 01:27:34.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3402
01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:36.440
<v Speaker 2>but that's what the native Americans did,</v>

3403
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:37.303
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3404
01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3405
01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:38.380
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3406
01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:38.740
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3407
01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:39.101
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3408
01:27:39.101 --> 01:27:41.570
<v Speaker 2>they used every piece of the Buffalo.</v>

3409
01:27:41.630 --> 01:27:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3410
01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:42.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3411
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:44.420
<v Speaker 2>they were smart too because they didn't develop,</v>

3412
01:27:44.421 --> 01:27:45.201
<v Speaker 2>like I'm a,</v>

3413
01:27:45.201 --> 01:27:47.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm a on this barefoot running kick.</v>

3414
01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:48.680
<v Speaker 2>I run with barefoot shoes.</v>

3415
01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:51.170
<v Speaker 2>I either run with those Vibram five fingers,</v>

3416
01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.400
<v Speaker 2>which are my favorite,</v>

3417
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:53.790
<v Speaker 2>but when it gets muddy out there,</v>

3418
01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.280
<v Speaker 2>those don't have a lot of traction.</v>

3419
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:57.560
<v Speaker 2>And I liked this other company called Vivo Barefoot.</v>

3420
01:27:57.770 --> 01:27:58.221
<v Speaker 2>Plus they don't,</v>

3421
01:27:58.221 --> 01:27:59.180
<v Speaker 2>you don't look as Dorky.</v>

3422
01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:00.050
<v Speaker 2>The VI,</v>

3423
01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:02.990
<v Speaker 2>the five fingers ones you're committing to the project,</v>

3424
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3425
01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.360
<v Speaker 2>You got to walk around with gloves on your feet.</v>

3426
01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:07.460
<v Speaker 2>People mock you mercilessly.</v>

3427
01:28:07.461 --> 01:28:08.031
<v Speaker 2>Like Jamie,</v>

3428
01:28:08.031 --> 01:28:09.140
<v Speaker 2>he mocks me mercilessly.</v>

3429
01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:09.921
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

3430
01:28:09.921 --> 01:28:11.480
<v Speaker 2>the Vivo barefoot wants to just like,</v>

3431
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:14.480
<v Speaker 2>they just have no padding but they have good traction's.</v>

3432
01:28:14.481 --> 01:28:15.620
<v Speaker 2>I like running in those too.</v>

3433
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:18.860
<v Speaker 2>But when you run in something that has no padding at all,</v>

3434
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:23.150
<v Speaker 2>you do all the muscles in your foot develop cause that your toes have to work</v>

3435
01:28:23.151 --> 01:28:23.960
<v Speaker 2>and push.</v>

3436
01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.790
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like these things,</v>

3437
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:29.510
<v Speaker 2>these things are way stiffer than what I run with most of the time.</v>

3438
01:28:29.511 --> 01:28:30.590
<v Speaker 2>These things are hard,</v>

3439
01:28:30.591 --> 01:28:30.711
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3440
01:28:30.711 --> 01:28:31.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like a cast.</v>

3441
01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Like this shit is like a cast for your foot,</v>

3442
01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:34.731
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3443
01:28:34.731 --> 01:28:37.670
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea is when your foot is in those kinds of like a normal running</v>

3444
01:28:37.671 --> 01:28:38.390
<v Speaker 2>shoe,</v>

3445
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:41.570
<v Speaker 2>it's not really squishing and pushing and you're all,</v>

3446
01:28:41.571 --> 01:28:45.110
<v Speaker 2>your muscles aren't getting activated and so they're just not as strong.</v>

3447
01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:45.530
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

3448
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:46.363
<v Speaker 2>they're just weaker,</v>

3449
01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:47.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3450
01:28:47.091 --> 01:28:48.350
<v Speaker 2>and that it's not good for anything.</v>

3451
01:28:48.351 --> 01:28:48.801
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for,</v>

3452
01:28:48.801 --> 01:28:49.700
<v Speaker 2>your balance is not,</v>

3453
01:28:49.701 --> 01:28:50.540
<v Speaker 2>it's not optimum.</v>

3454
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:52.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's better to run with running shoes on then,</v>

3455
01:28:52.851 --> 01:28:53.684
<v Speaker 2>not Ron,</v>

3456
01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:58.550
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of like foot strength and like just maximize your ability to move</v>

3457
01:28:58.551 --> 01:29:00.050
<v Speaker 2>correctly and have good balance.</v>

3458
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:01.410
<v Speaker 2>It's not nearly good.</v>

3459
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:02.210
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3460
01:29:02.210 --> 01:29:02.670
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3461
01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:03.640
<v Speaker 4>you can feel it too.</v>

3462
01:29:03.641 --> 01:29:03.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3463
01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:06.870
<v Speaker 4>when I first started doing MMA for a long time,</v>

3464
01:29:06.871 --> 01:29:09.900
<v Speaker 4>until I went down to Florida and was at American top team,</v>

3465
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:13.170
<v Speaker 4>there were certain things that I didn't do without shoes on.</v>

3466
01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:15.080
<v Speaker 4>Like if we were kickboxing,</v>

3467
01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:18.690
<v Speaker 4>I would put on shins and I would wear my wrestling shoes really?</v>

3468
01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:19.510
<v Speaker 4>How come?</v>

3469
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:20.040
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3470
01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:23.100
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't like wrestling without my toes out like that,</v>

3471
01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:23.730
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3472
01:29:23.730 --> 01:29:25.470
<v Speaker 4>Especially when I was throwing kicks,</v>

3473
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.740
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3474
01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:26.460
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

3475
01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:26.761
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3476
01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:27.050
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3477
01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:28.770
<v Speaker 4>over time I got more comfortable with it,</v>

3478
01:29:28.890 --> 01:29:30.840
<v Speaker 4>but over time getting more comfortable with it,</v>

3479
01:29:30.841 --> 01:29:34.560
<v Speaker 4>I could feel the difference when I would have my shoes on versus not having my</v>

3480
01:29:34.561 --> 01:29:34.890
<v Speaker 4>shoot.</v>

3481
01:29:34.890 --> 01:29:35.320
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3482
01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:35.580
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3483
01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:38.230
<v Speaker 4>Versus not having my shoes on and it's,</v>

3484
01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:38.980
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

3485
01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:42.210
<v Speaker 4>I felt more decks Darrius I felt more agile.</v>

3486
01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:44.610
<v Speaker 4>It felt more in connection with,</v>

3487
01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:45.230
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3488
01:29:45.230 --> 01:29:46.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3489
01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:46.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3490
01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:47.293
<v Speaker 2>When I was doing,</v>

3491
01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:47.541
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3492
01:29:47.541 --> 01:29:48.374
<v Speaker 2>That's legit.</v>

3493
01:29:48.410 --> 01:29:49.250
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

3494
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:52.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what I do with these barefoot running shoes.</v>

3495
01:29:52.670 --> 01:29:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3496
01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:54.440
<v Speaker 2>I believe in him 100%.</v>

3497
01:29:54.441 --> 01:29:57.650
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a bunch of good companies that make them Morel make some good</v>

3498
01:29:57.651 --> 01:29:58.484
<v Speaker 2>ones too.</v>

3499
01:29:59.070 --> 01:29:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3500
01:29:59.510 --> 01:30:03.380
<v Speaker 2>but I just feel like we have too much padding on our shoes.</v>

3501
01:30:03.410 --> 01:30:03.641
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

3502
01:30:03.641 --> 01:30:03.980
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3503
01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:06.680
<v Speaker 2>I w I lift weights and do everything else totally barefoot.</v>

3504
01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:08.540
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like a,</v>

3505
01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.220
<v Speaker 2>or are we are like,</v>

3506
01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:11.323
<v Speaker 2>I like chucks,</v>

3507
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:12.530
<v Speaker 2>converse all stars.</v>

3508
01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3509
01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:13.603
<v Speaker 2>those are good too.</v>

3510
01:30:13.670 --> 01:30:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3511
01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:15.020
<v Speaker 2>because they don't,</v>

3512
01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:15.853
<v Speaker 2>they're just flat,</v>

3513
01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:16.820
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3514
01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Those are good for lifting weights sometimes if I want like a little bit more,</v>

3515
01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:21.950
<v Speaker 2>but most of the time I do it barefoot.</v>

3516
01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:24.590
<v Speaker 2>I would say 99% of the time I do it barefoot.</v>

3517
01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:25.850
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

3518
01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:27.020
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just better for your feet,</v>

3519
01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:28.153
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3520
01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:31.940
<v Speaker 2>I just think I'm the same thing when I was saying with gloves and punching,</v>

3521
01:30:32.630 --> 01:30:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I've saying it's unnatural.</v>

3522
01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:36.170
<v Speaker 2>It's unnatural to have a bunch of shit underneath your foot.</v>

3523
01:30:36.290 --> 01:30:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Your foot is not designed for that.</v>

3524
01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:39.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3525
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:42.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3526
01:30:42.130 --> 01:30:42.411
<v Speaker 4>When you,</v>

3527
01:30:42.411 --> 01:30:43.071
<v Speaker 4>when you say that,</v>

3528
01:30:43.071 --> 01:30:44.240
<v Speaker 4>I start thinking about,</v>

3529
01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:45.643
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3530
01:30:46.490 --> 01:30:51.490
<v Speaker 4>how people I design and where people are designed for and then write thoughts</v>

3531
01:30:51.710 --> 01:30:52.580
<v Speaker 4>and they go everywhere.</v>

3532
01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:54.110
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes my thoughts like run into another,</v>

3533
01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:54.261
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3534
01:30:54.261 --> 01:30:55.041
<v Speaker 4>that's a good idea.</v>

3535
01:30:55.041 --> 01:30:55.940
<v Speaker 4>Like he come together.</v>

3536
01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:56.470
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3537
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.840
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3538
01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:57.770
<v Speaker 4>but when you say that,</v>

3539
01:30:57.771 --> 01:31:01.280
<v Speaker 4>I started thinking about when we talk about changing your Dna,</v>

3540
01:31:01.281 --> 01:31:02.900
<v Speaker 4>where we started with the hookworm thing,</v>

3541
01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:04.093
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3542
01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.060
<v Speaker 4>and your feet,</v>

3543
01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:10.900
<v Speaker 4>if you take someone from an area that is where they have to be agile and you</v>

3544
01:31:11.391 --> 01:31:13.490
<v Speaker 4>take them to a place where you just have to be strong,</v>

3545
01:31:13.491 --> 01:31:14.840
<v Speaker 4>you take a child from,</v>

3546
01:31:14.841 --> 01:31:17.930
<v Speaker 4>from the Agile area and you make him grow up in a strong area,</v>

3547
01:31:17.931 --> 01:31:19.790
<v Speaker 4>in an area where you have to be strong,</v>

3548
01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:20.810
<v Speaker 4>physically strong.</v>

3549
01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:21.591
<v Speaker 4>Does,</v>

3550
01:31:21.591 --> 01:31:22.220
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3551
01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:26.150
<v Speaker 4>how does that child fear in that environment as he's going up,</v>

3552
01:31:26.151 --> 01:31:27.110
<v Speaker 4>does he adapt?</v>

3553
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:30.740
<v Speaker 4>Not as fast as the people that already have those traits,</v>

3554
01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:33.350
<v Speaker 4>but does he adapt and be able to survive?</v>

3555
01:31:33.650 --> 01:31:34.970
<v Speaker 4>And then can he go back to that,</v>

3556
01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:35.490
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

3557
01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:37.640
<v Speaker 4>to the agile lifestyle and with,</v>

3558
01:31:37.641 --> 01:31:38.870
<v Speaker 4>and take some of that strength?</v>

3559
01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:40.110
<v Speaker 4>Depends on how many,</v>

3560
01:31:40.110 --> 01:31:40.380
<v Speaker 4>how big</v>

3561
01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:41.210
<v Speaker 2>he gets.</v>

3562
01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:41.481
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3563
01:31:41.481 --> 01:31:43.610
<v Speaker 2>like if you were talking like strong man strength,</v>

3564
01:31:43.850 --> 01:31:46.040
<v Speaker 2>those guys are not known for their agility right there.</v>

3565
01:31:46.041 --> 01:31:46.874
<v Speaker 2>Giant.</v>

3566
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:47.301
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3567
01:31:47.301 --> 01:31:47.571
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3568
01:31:47.571 --> 01:31:48.980
<v Speaker 2>there's a trade off for sure.</v>

3569
01:31:49.190 --> 01:31:50.510
<v Speaker 2>There's a power trade off.</v>

3570
01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:51.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3571
01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:55.370
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things it's so terrifying about Francis in Ghana is that he's</v>

3572
01:31:55.371 --> 01:31:56.600
<v Speaker 2>270 lbs.</v>

3573
01:31:56.601 --> 01:31:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Cuts down to two 65 but he moves like a,</v>

3574
01:31:59.530 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3575
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's not missing anything.</v>

3576
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:02.230
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3577
01:32:02.230 --> 01:32:02.771
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

3578
01:32:02.771 --> 01:32:04.480
<v Speaker 2>He's got ridiculous power,</v>

3579
01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.030
<v Speaker 2>but he's also fast as fuck.</v>

3580
01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Like that left hook that he hit over him with.</v>

3581
01:32:09.071 --> 01:32:10.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like Jesus,</v>

3582
01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:12.340
<v Speaker 2>that's like a welterweights left hook,</v>

3583
01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.260
<v Speaker 2>fat as fuck.</v>

3584
01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:17.800
<v Speaker 2>But he's hitting you like a nuclear weapon.</v>

3585
01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:21.160
<v Speaker 2>It's just a different kind of power on his punches,</v>

3586
01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:23.110
<v Speaker 2>a different kind of power in his body.</v>

3587
01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:25.330
<v Speaker 2>But he also has the ability to move fast,</v>

3588
01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:26.380
<v Speaker 2>like a smaller person.</v>

3589
01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time when you get a really powerful person,</v>

3590
01:32:29.201 --> 01:32:30.630
<v Speaker 2>there's some sort of compromise.</v>

3591
01:32:30.631 --> 01:32:31.341
<v Speaker 2>It has to be made,</v>

3592
01:32:31.341 --> 01:32:32.174
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3593
01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:32.550
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3594
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:33.390
<v Speaker 2>but what have you take?</v>

3595
01:32:33.670 --> 01:32:38.670
<v Speaker 2>What happens when a guy like Francis and Gansu you develop his wrestling so that</v>

3596
01:32:39.431 --> 01:32:42.190
<v Speaker 2>it's like a Cain Velasquez.</v>

3597
01:32:43.210 --> 01:32:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Did you though at 33 like that's,</v>

3598
01:32:45.491 --> 01:32:46.324
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>

3599
01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3600
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:47.680
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

3601
01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:48.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3602
01:32:48.011 --> 01:32:48.844
<v Speaker 2>and how much does he,</v>

3603
01:32:49.150 --> 01:32:50.650
<v Speaker 2>does he not like to wrestle?</v>

3604
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Because that was the word that I had heard is that he wasn't doing any</v>

3605
01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:54.720
<v Speaker 2>groundwork.</v>

3606
01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:57.040
<v Speaker 2>It was very little groundwork being done.</v>

3607
01:32:57.190 --> 01:32:58.780
<v Speaker 2>They were just trying to keep the fight standing.</v>

3608
01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:02.560
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is you can't just do what you like to do.</v>

3609
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:05.540
<v Speaker 2>You can't just do what you're awesome at.</v>

3610
01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:08.080
<v Speaker 2>He's already awesome it putting people in another dimension.</v>

3611
01:33:08.081 --> 01:33:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3612
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:10.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean he hits harder than anybody I've ever seen.</v>

3613
01:33:10.571 --> 01:33:14.800
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anybody that hits his heart is Francis and Ghana and that's that</v>

3614
01:33:14.801 --> 01:33:16.150
<v Speaker 2>power cube thing shows it.</v>

3615
01:33:16.650 --> 01:33:16.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3616
01:33:16.901 --> 01:33:20.230
<v Speaker 2>he got the highest registered punched Tyrone spawn was number two.</v>

3617
01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:25.210
<v Speaker 2>His Punch was something like 10,000 pounds more power or more than,</v>

3618
01:33:25.211 --> 01:33:26.470
<v Speaker 2>than Tyrone spawns,</v>

3619
01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:27.730
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy.</v>

3620
01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:30.550
<v Speaker 2>He's a machine to be allowed to hit people.</v>

3621
01:33:30.610 --> 01:33:31.480
<v Speaker 2>He's a monster.</v>

3622
01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:32.800
<v Speaker 2>He's so powerful.</v>

3623
01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:36.340
<v Speaker 2>But it's like all things balance out,</v>

3624
01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:36.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3625
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Like Steve Paige just said,</v>

3626
01:33:38.081 --> 01:33:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>

3627
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:42.310
<v Speaker 2>you're powerful for about five minutes and I'm not going to be there for those</v>

3628
01:33:42.311 --> 01:33:42.791
<v Speaker 2>five minutes.</v>

3629
01:33:42.791 --> 01:33:46.090
<v Speaker 2>I'll be over here and I'll be over here and I'll be ducking and getting the fuck</v>

3630
01:33:46.091 --> 01:33:46.924
<v Speaker 2>away from you.</v>

3631
01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:48.070
<v Speaker 2>He took a few,</v>

3632
01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:50.440
<v Speaker 2>it takes a guy like Steve Bay that can,</v>

3633
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:54.130
<v Speaker 2>is smart and fight smart and knows the game,</v>

3634
01:33:54.131 --> 01:33:56.440
<v Speaker 2>like knows like you can't keep this up with cane,</v>

3635
01:33:56.441 --> 01:33:58.060
<v Speaker 2>be able to do the same thing name you would expect.</v>

3636
01:33:58.061 --> 01:34:00.100
<v Speaker 2>So it cane young Kane for sure.</v>

3637
01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Like the cane to fuck check Congo.</v>

3638
01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:03.790
<v Speaker 2>The cane have fought.</v>

3639
01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3640
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Ben Rothwell that cane,</v>

3641
01:34:06.670 --> 01:34:08.170
<v Speaker 2>she's just Christ that came,</v>

3642
01:34:08.171 --> 01:34:09.340
<v Speaker 2>could have done that to anybody.</v>

3643
01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:14.730
<v Speaker 2>But I think what you deal with with Kane was like a mental strength that no</v>

3644
01:34:15.131 --> 01:34:17.260
<v Speaker 2>one's body can hold up to.</v>

3645
01:34:17.290 --> 01:34:18.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3646
01:34:18.130 --> 01:34:18.701
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3647
01:34:18.701 --> 01:34:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Like he just drove forward with so much tenacity that his body is like,</v>

3648
01:34:24.010 --> 01:34:28.870
<v Speaker 2>tires are flying off and bolts are breaking and it's just too much strength in</v>

3649
01:34:28.871 --> 01:34:29.704
<v Speaker 2>the mind.</v>

3650
01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:31.480
<v Speaker 2>When you say that I picture,</v>

3651
01:34:31.481 --> 01:34:34.090
<v Speaker 2>I see it in my head and I picture him moving forward a lot.</v>

3652
01:34:34.091 --> 01:34:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Like no Manga met off and lose a lot just with better striking and what people</v>

3653
01:34:38.561 --> 01:34:39.380
<v Speaker 2>keep forgetting.</v>

3654
01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Never go.</v>

3655
01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Madoff was injury written as well.</v>

3656
01:34:41.890 --> 01:34:44.250
<v Speaker 2>He was constantly plagued with a lot of guys at Ey.</v>

3657
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.680
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3658
01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:48.910
<v Speaker 2>you know I had three or four of my UFC fights because Josh Thompson got hurt.</v>

3659
01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:50.733
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3660
01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:51.311
<v Speaker 2>I can think of,</v>

3661
01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I can think of off the top of my head.</v>

3662
01:34:52.841 --> 01:34:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Two of them were where it was because Joshua was hurt and they,</v>

3663
01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:57.800
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about that?</v>

3664
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you</v>

3665
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:02.870
<v Speaker 3>think that they train too hard or do you think that that is just the way you</v>

3666
01:35:02.871 --> 01:35:03.880
<v Speaker 3>have to train if you,</v>

3667
01:35:03.881 --> 01:35:07.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean you look at World Class Fighters,</v>

3668
01:35:07.190 --> 01:35:09.200
<v Speaker 3>Aka is one of the top gyms in the world.</v>

3669
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:10.490
<v Speaker 3>Luke Rockhold,</v>

3670
01:35:10.491 --> 01:35:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Cormier,</v>

3671
01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Cain Velasquez,</v>

3672
01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:13.550
<v Speaker 3>Josh Thompson,</v>

3673
01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:15.170
<v Speaker 3>and you can keep going down the road.</v>

3674
01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:19.580
<v Speaker 3>There's a ton of like guys that people haven't heard of that are top level</v>

3675
01:35:19.581 --> 01:35:19.941
<v Speaker 3>Neuroma,</v>

3676
01:35:19.941 --> 01:35:20.390
<v Speaker 3>Madoff,</v>

3677
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:24.530
<v Speaker 3>obviously ton of guys also that a train and out of there that are super,</v>

3678
01:35:24.531 --> 01:35:25.490
<v Speaker 3>super high level.</v>

3679
01:35:25.491 --> 01:35:28.130
<v Speaker 3>There's a big fucking tank filled with sharks.</v>

3680
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Now do you look at their success and it's just undeniable.</v>

3681
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:37.310
<v Speaker 3>They have incredible ratio of success like world champions,</v>

3682
01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:39.260
<v Speaker 3>some of the best guys ever,</v>

3683
01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:41.330
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of injuries.</v>

3684
01:35:41.370 --> 01:35:43.700
<v Speaker 3>And was that just what happens when you get both things?</v>

3685
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.120
<v Speaker 3>I believe especially with those guys were those guys that concern.</v>

3686
01:35:47.121 --> 01:35:52.121
<v Speaker 3>It has to do with the number of quality guys that they have that a fighting at</v>

3687
01:35:52.251 --> 01:35:56.150
<v Speaker 3>the same time and only they only being so many hours in the day.</v>

3688
01:35:56.420 --> 01:36:00.350
<v Speaker 3>So they are in the gym at the same time having to do the work that they need to</v>

3689
01:36:00.351 --> 01:36:01.460
<v Speaker 3>do to prepare for a fight.</v>

3690
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.320
<v Speaker 3>But they're all on the same.</v>

3691
01:36:03.321 --> 01:36:05.030
<v Speaker 3>Matt and guys were running into each other,</v>

3692
01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:05.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3693
01:36:05.630 --> 01:36:06.463
<v Speaker 3>It's happening.</v>

3694
01:36:06.610 --> 01:36:09.740
<v Speaker 3>So Glueck is over here and Khabib is over here,</v>

3695
01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:13.610
<v Speaker 3>but they've got five different guys rotating for them.</v>

3696
01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:18.940
<v Speaker 3>And one of those five guys is is the reason that no mag amount of gets hurt?</v>

3697
01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:20.280
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3698
01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:21.170
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem,</v>

3699
01:36:21.171 --> 01:36:21.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3700
01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Like that doesn't have an,</v>

3701
01:36:22.770 --> 01:36:26.230
<v Speaker 3>and you never see worldclass boxers sparring in the same ring as other world</v>

3702
01:36:26.231 --> 01:36:27.350
<v Speaker 3>costs bar same time,</v>

3703
01:36:27.351 --> 01:36:27.801
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>

3704
01:36:27.801 --> 01:36:28.460
<v Speaker 3>It's stupid.</v>

3705
01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:29.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3706
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.000
<v Speaker 3>That's a size issue in terms of the gym size as definitely a thing in that,</v>

3707
01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:36.200
<v Speaker 3>in that regard.</v>

3708
01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3709
01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:39.200
<v Speaker 3>also the,</v>

3710
01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:41.450
<v Speaker 3>the layout of the gym,</v>

3711
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:42.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3712
01:36:42.261 --> 01:36:43.240
<v Speaker 3>like a boxing ring,</v>

3713
01:36:43.241 --> 01:36:45.170
<v Speaker 3>you could put them in a quartered off area.</v>

3714
01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3715
01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.540
<v Speaker 3>And nobody else could be involved.</v>

3716
01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:47.900
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3717
01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:48.120
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

3718
01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:49.550
<v Speaker 3>you section off the mats,</v>

3719
01:36:49.551 --> 01:36:51.320
<v Speaker 3>but then you have to have coaches in between.</v>

3720
01:36:51.321 --> 01:36:52.041
<v Speaker 3>People's will let,</v>

3721
01:36:52.041 --> 01:36:53.540
<v Speaker 3>when these guys starting to come together,</v>

3722
01:36:53.541 --> 01:36:54.201
<v Speaker 3>the coach comes in,</v>

3723
01:36:54.201 --> 01:36:55.970
<v Speaker 3>hey guys who start going back to your area.</v>

3724
01:36:56.250 --> 01:36:56.421
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3725
01:36:56.421 --> 01:36:56.960
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3726
01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:58.070
<v Speaker 3>there's just no,</v>

3727
01:36:58.310 --> 01:37:01.030
<v Speaker 3>no borders and without having borders and,</v>

3728
01:37:01.031 --> 01:37:02.550
<v Speaker 3>and a guy like Hector Lumbar,</v>

3729
01:37:02.551 --> 01:37:03.384
<v Speaker 3>I'd come in after me.</v>

3730
01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:04.131
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3731
01:37:04.131 --> 01:37:04.401
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3732
01:37:04.401 --> 01:37:04.641
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3733
01:37:04.641 --> 01:37:04.911
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3734
01:37:04.911 --> 01:37:05.810
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna move.</v>

3735
01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:06.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3736
01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.000
<v Speaker 3>In a crash into people.</v>

3737
01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:09.133
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3738
01:37:09.250 --> 01:37:09.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3739
01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:10.730
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a real good point.</v>

3740
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:12.380
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the level of talent,</v>

3741
01:37:12.710 --> 01:37:14.000
<v Speaker 3>the aggression in the room,</v>

3742
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:16.130
<v Speaker 3>the level of ambition in the room,</v>

3743
01:37:16.970 --> 01:37:17.803
<v Speaker 3>all of the above.</v>

3744
01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:20.720
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that they have that philosophy to just go hard.</v>

3745
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:21.763
<v Speaker 3>I mean they go hard.</v>

3746
01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:22.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3747
01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:26.060
<v Speaker 3>Like I talked to DC about and he's like sometimes Kane and I spar and sometimes</v>

3748
01:37:26.061 --> 01:37:26.750
<v Speaker 3>we fight.</v>

3749
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3750
01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:27.921
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3751
01:37:27.921 --> 01:37:28.970
<v Speaker 3>God damn.</v>

3752
01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:31.280
<v Speaker 3>You know you have a fight before the fight,</v>

3753
01:37:31.281 --> 01:37:32.240
<v Speaker 3>like legitimate,</v>

3754
01:37:32.241 --> 01:37:33.200
<v Speaker 3>full on,</v>

3755
01:37:33.710 --> 01:37:34.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3756
01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.430
<v Speaker 3>fights that happened or shots that happens.</v>

3757
01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:37.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3758
01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:38.950
<v Speaker 3>I remember being um,</v>

3759
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:43.990
<v Speaker 3>being underneath t bow trying to come to my feet and he stole big punches with</v>

3760
01:37:44.061 --> 01:37:44.900
<v Speaker 3>little gloves on.</v>

3761
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.240
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3762
01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:46.130
<v Speaker 3>We're wearing a little gloves,</v>

3763
01:37:46.131 --> 01:37:46.690
<v Speaker 3>spying and,</v>

3764
01:37:46.690 --> 01:37:49.130
<v Speaker 3>and make gloves and he's hitting me and hitting me in the face like three times</v>

3765
01:37:49.131 --> 01:37:49.964
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

3766
01:37:50.150 --> 01:37:51.650
<v Speaker 3>that's entirely too hot.</v>

3767
01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:53.061
<v Speaker 3>But if I don't get up,</v>

3768
01:37:53.061 --> 01:37:54.020
<v Speaker 3>he's just going to keep going.</v>

3769
01:37:55.890 --> 01:37:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3770
01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:57.750
<v Speaker 2>But like that's what it is,</v>

3771
01:37:57.751 --> 01:37:58.051
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3772
01:37:58.051 --> 01:38:00.690
<v Speaker 2>When you're in the gym there some guys that they just,</v>

3773
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:01.583
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

3774
01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:06.740
<v Speaker 2>they only have one speed and a lot of those guys are the guys that could perform</v>

3775
01:38:06.781 --> 01:38:08.670
<v Speaker 2>when it's time to step into the cage.</v>

3776
01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:09.121
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3777
01:38:09.121 --> 01:38:09.930
<v Speaker 2>who does the story?</v>

3778
01:38:09.930 --> 01:38:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Tj Dillashaw,</v>

3779
01:38:11.190 --> 01:38:13.020
<v Speaker 2>all the Alpha male guys were saying that Tj,</v>

3780
01:38:13.021 --> 01:38:16.590
<v Speaker 2>when he was bar would spar real hard and then when you would hurt him he tried</v>

3781
01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:17.250
<v Speaker 2>to kill you.</v>

3782
01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:17.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3783
01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:19.080
<v Speaker 2>You know just how we go.</v>

3784
01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:19.973
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>

3785
01:38:20.130 --> 01:38:22.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking world champion for a reason to time.</v>

3786
01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.380
<v Speaker 2>You know that that tenacity,</v>

3787
01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:26.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3788
01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:30.090
<v Speaker 2>that makes you a sometimes a problematic sparring partner.</v>

3789
01:38:30.450 --> 01:38:33.240
<v Speaker 2>That same mental strength and who knows who's telling the truth because this is</v>

3790
01:38:33.241 --> 01:38:34.350
<v Speaker 2>obviously alpha male.</v>

3791
01:38:34.351 --> 01:38:36.900
<v Speaker 2>They were a little salty after he left and you know,</v>

3792
01:38:36.901 --> 01:38:38.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're lying,</v>

3793
01:38:38.041 --> 01:38:38.874
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's two,</v>

3794
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:40.230
<v Speaker 2>two sides of the story.</v>

3795
01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:41.400
<v Speaker 2>There's two sides of the story.</v>

3796
01:38:41.401 --> 01:38:42.450
<v Speaker 2>And there's also,</v>

3797
01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:42.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3798
01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:45.270
<v Speaker 2>people accentuate their position.</v>

3799
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3800
01:38:46.471 --> 01:38:47.304
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you get,</v>

3801
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:49.860
<v Speaker 2>if you watch a video versus hearing two people,</v>

3802
01:38:49.861 --> 01:38:50.640
<v Speaker 2>they'll a story,</v>

3803
01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:50.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3804
01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:52.140
<v Speaker 2>You see three different things.</v>

3805
01:38:52.170 --> 01:38:52.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah Man,</v>

3806
01:38:52.771 --> 01:38:54.150
<v Speaker 2>I've had people tell me things like,</v>

3807
01:38:54.151 --> 01:38:54.391
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3808
01:38:54.391 --> 01:38:55.410
<v Speaker 2>you won't believe what happened.</v>

3809
01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:56.221
<v Speaker 2>And then I watched the video.</v>

3810
01:38:56.221 --> 01:38:56.491
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3811
01:38:56.491 --> 01:38:57.000
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

3812
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.410
<v Speaker 2>What did you think you saw?</v>

3813
01:38:58.800 --> 01:38:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Cause I didn't see that.</v>

3814
01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:00.300
<v Speaker 2>I saw it.</v>

3815
01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:01.650
<v Speaker 2>I saw something pretty reasonable.</v>

3816
01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:04.620
<v Speaker 2>But when these guys go back and watch fights and they're like,</v>

3817
01:39:04.650 --> 01:39:05.550
<v Speaker 2>I won that flight.</v>

3818
01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3819
01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3820
01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:07.373
<v Speaker 2>no you didn't.</v>

3821
01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:08.670
<v Speaker 2>That's a real problem.</v>

3822
01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3823
01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3824
01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:10.710
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

3825
01:39:10.710 --> 01:39:11.431
<v Speaker 2>some people,</v>

3826
01:39:11.431 --> 01:39:14.280
<v Speaker 2>and again those are really the same guise as the,</v>

3827
01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:15.690
<v Speaker 2>I can't catch a break guys.</v>

3828
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:19.110
<v Speaker 2>The ones who think they won when no one else thinks they won Washington like,</v>

3829
01:39:19.111 --> 01:39:19.531
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

3830
01:39:19.531 --> 01:39:20.670
<v Speaker 2>what fight are you watching?</v>

3831
01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Like you definitely didn't win.</v>

3832
01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Look at your,</v>

3833
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:25.230
<v Speaker 2>but your face.</v>

3834
01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3835
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:27.900
<v Speaker 2>the fucking judges man.</v>

3836
01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:30.330
<v Speaker 2>That that is really the number one problem.</v>

3837
01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:31.770
<v Speaker 2>If all the rules,</v>

3838
01:39:31.771 --> 01:39:32.700
<v Speaker 2>all of these different things,</v>

3839
01:39:32.701 --> 01:39:33.780
<v Speaker 2>those are all problem.</v>

3840
01:39:34.290 --> 01:39:36.780
<v Speaker 2>The judges or the biggest problem by far,</v>

3841
01:39:36.810 --> 01:39:37.590
<v Speaker 2>like every,</v>

3842
01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:39.000
<v Speaker 2>it seems like every UFC,</v>

3843
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:40.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm waiting to interview the fighter.</v>

3844
01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the cage in there reading the scorecards and I just go like every UFC</v>

3845
01:39:46.591 --> 01:39:48.870
<v Speaker 2>it's like one fight at least while I'm like,</v>

3846
01:39:48.871 --> 01:39:49.704
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3847
01:39:50.190 --> 01:39:54.090
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck did they just say 30 27 who?</v>

3848
01:39:54.630 --> 01:39:56.100
<v Speaker 2>How what?</v>

3849
01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Like it guys getting their asses kicked,</v>

3850
01:39:58.291 --> 01:39:59.310
<v Speaker 2>taken down,</v>

3851
01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:01.650
<v Speaker 2>getting fucked up on the feet and they're winning rounds.</v>

3852
01:40:01.651 --> 01:40:03.640
<v Speaker 2>30 27 yeah.</v>

3853
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.621
<v Speaker 2>Ten nine,</v>

3854
01:40:04.621 --> 01:40:05.910
<v Speaker 2>ten nine ten nine.</v>

3855
01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:07.560
<v Speaker 2>What the,</v>

3856
01:40:07.561 --> 01:40:08.640
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that I saw,</v>

3857
01:40:08.641 --> 01:40:10.650
<v Speaker 2>I saw a fight recently.</v>

3858
01:40:10.651 --> 01:40:11.640
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember what it was,</v>

3859
01:40:11.641 --> 01:40:12.031
<v Speaker 2>but when,</v>

3860
01:40:12.031 --> 01:40:13.530
<v Speaker 2>when the judging came up,</v>

3861
01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:14.461
<v Speaker 2>I heard 30,</v>

3862
01:40:14.461 --> 01:40:15.810
<v Speaker 2>27 and I was like,</v>

3863
01:40:15.811 --> 01:40:18.650
<v Speaker 2>there was no guarantee that any guy won any of those.</v>

3864
01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:19.643
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3865
01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:20.460
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

3866
01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:22.050
<v Speaker 2>There was a guarantee when I heard 30,</v>

3867
01:40:22.051 --> 01:40:24.030
<v Speaker 2>27 I thought this guy one because I'm like,</v>

3868
01:40:24.031 --> 01:40:25.110
<v Speaker 2>he won that round.</v>

3869
01:40:25.290 --> 01:40:26.700
<v Speaker 2>So they thought he will know that too,</v>

3870
01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:27.541
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3871
01:40:27.541 --> 01:40:29.130
<v Speaker 2>And then they gave it to the other guy and I'm like,</v>

3872
01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:30.301
<v Speaker 2>how does that,</v>

3873
01:40:30.301 --> 01:40:31.920
<v Speaker 2>how did he lose that one round?</v>

3874
01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:33.330
<v Speaker 2>It's full incompetence,</v>

3875
01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:33.870
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3876
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:35.190
<v Speaker 2>It's just fallen competence.</v>

3877
01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:35.641
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

3878
01:40:35.641 --> 01:40:37.200
<v Speaker 2>what is it like now when you are,</v>

3879
01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:42.380
<v Speaker 2>you're working for UFC and you're doing the Fox stuff like Fox coverage of UFC,</v>

3880
01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:44.033
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3881
01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:44.970

3882
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:49.620

3883
01:40:49.621 --> 01:40:50.880
<v Speaker 2>Like how often do you guys do it?</v>

3884
01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:52.073

3886
01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:55.540
<v Speaker 4>actually there were seven when I started.</v>

3887
01:40:55.541 --> 01:40:59.140
<v Speaker 4>I think there are more guys now in that rotation and um,</v>

3888
01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:01.720
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a set schedule.</v>

3889
01:41:02.050 --> 01:41:02.883
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3890
01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:03.730

<v Speaker 4>I'm is the Barbosa Lee fight.</v>

3899
01:41:15.850 --> 01:41:16.570
<v Speaker 4>Which one is that?</v>

3900
01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:18.280
<v Speaker 4>That's on the 21st of April.</v>

3901
01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:18.611
<v Speaker 4>April.</v>

3902
01:41:18.611 --> 01:41:18.970
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3903
01:41:18.970 --> 01:41:19.271
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3904
01:41:19.271 --> 01:41:21.880
<v Speaker 4>I think that's Atlantic city and hard.</v>

3905
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:22.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3906
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:26.040
<v Speaker 4>that's a Frankie Edgar's fighting who's hubs once cubs won.</v>

3907
01:41:27.670 --> 01:41:29.650
<v Speaker 4>So about that fight.</v>

3908
01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:33.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't like to fight.</v>

3909
01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:34.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3910
01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:35.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a problem with it.</v>

3911
01:41:35.831 --> 01:41:38.470
<v Speaker 4>Like I feel like Frankie just got knocked out.</v>

3912
01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:39.220
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

3913
01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:40.720
<v Speaker 4>And that's really soon to come back.</v>

3914
01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:43.330
<v Speaker 4>If anybody can bounce back from something like that.</v>

3915
01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:44.440
<v Speaker 4>It's a guy like Frankie,</v>

3916
01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:49.120
<v Speaker 4>but I felt the same way about Bisbing fighting after he didn't get knocked out</v>

3917
01:41:49.121 --> 01:41:51.700
<v Speaker 4>and get dropped by George and they got choked unconscious.</v>

3918
01:41:51.970 --> 01:41:52.361
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

3919
01:41:52.361 --> 01:41:52.481
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3920
01:41:52.481 --> 01:41:53.350
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't take that gas.</v>

3921
01:41:53.351 --> 01:41:54.080
<v Speaker 4>No fight so soon.</v>

3922
01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:54.580
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

3923
01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:55.413
<v Speaker 4>Completely agree.</v>

3924
01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:00.130
<v Speaker 4>And I feel that way about this flight because I feel like Frankie wants this</v>

3925
01:42:00.131 --> 01:42:02.590
<v Speaker 4>fight because he wants to get that taste out of his mouth.</v>

3926
01:42:03.110 --> 01:42:03.943
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3927
01:42:03.970 --> 01:42:04.870
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

3928
01:42:04.871 --> 01:42:06.100
<v Speaker 4>it's still going to taste the same.</v>

3929
01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:07.900
<v Speaker 4>Anytime you go back and watch that fight,</v>

3930
01:42:07.901 --> 01:42:09.580
<v Speaker 4>you still gonna have those feelings,</v>

3931
01:42:09.610 --> 01:42:10.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3932
01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:10.410
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

3933
01:42:10.410 --> 01:42:11.800
<v Speaker 4>you're going to win your next fight,</v>

3934
01:42:11.801 --> 01:42:13.600
<v Speaker 4>more than likely your Frankie Edgar,</v>

3935
01:42:14.250 --> 01:42:15.190
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to rush it.</v>

3936
01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:15.941
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3937
01:42:15.941 --> 01:42:18.120
<v Speaker 4>let your brain rest recover.</v>

3938
01:42:18.170 --> 01:42:19.480
<v Speaker 4>That's how I feel about it.</v>

3939
01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:22.210
<v Speaker 4>But that's only because I'm 41.</v>

3940
01:42:22.211 --> 01:42:22.710
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

3941
01:42:22.710 --> 01:42:23.060
<v Speaker 4>If I,</v>

3942
01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:23.980
<v Speaker 4>if I was 26,</v>

3943
01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:25.053
<v Speaker 4>maybe I would have been,</v>

3944
01:42:25.090 --> 01:42:26.650
<v Speaker 4>and I know Frankie's like 32,</v>

3945
01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:27.240
<v Speaker 4>33,</v>

3946
01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:28.073
<v Speaker 4>36,</v>

3947
01:42:28.150 --> 01:42:29.140
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] 36,</v>

3948
01:42:29.190 --> 01:42:30.090
<v Speaker 4>I think he's 36.</v>

3949
01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:31.840
<v Speaker 4>Find out for us.</v>

3950
01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:33.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure Frankie,</v>

3951
01:42:33.341 --> 01:42:34.120
<v Speaker 4>36.</v>

3952
01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:35.230
<v Speaker 4>But I'm like,</v>

3953
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:37.570
<v Speaker 4>you want to go out there and do it.</v>

3954
01:42:37.571 --> 01:42:42.571
<v Speaker 4>But when I think about brain trauma and your things that I forget,</v>

3955
01:42:43.871 --> 01:42:45.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm always like my cds flaring up.</v>

3956
01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:46.733
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3957
01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:47.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3958
01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3959
01:42:47.890 --> 01:42:48.723
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3960
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3961
01:42:49.781 --> 01:42:54.550
<v Speaker 2>he fought cub just a couple of years ago in Malden and got a last second</v>

3962
01:42:54.551 --> 01:42:55.384
<v Speaker 2>submission.</v>

3963
01:42:55.660 --> 01:42:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he just thinks,</v>

3964
01:42:56.711 --> 01:42:58.480
<v Speaker 2>look Danish fucking thing in the world.</v>

3965
01:42:58.481 --> 01:42:59.740
<v Speaker 2>This guy can do to stop me.</v>

3966
01:43:00.090 --> 01:43:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3967
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:01.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3968
01:43:01.110 --> 01:43:02.110
<v Speaker 2>I fucked him up before.</v>

3969
01:43:02.111 --> 01:43:03.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fuck him up again.</v>

3970
01:43:03.250 --> 01:43:03.851
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

3971
01:43:03.851 --> 01:43:04.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even going to get hit,</v>

3972
01:43:04.810 --> 01:43:05.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to get ahold of them.</v>

3973
01:43:05.681 --> 01:43:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Ragdoll I'm just like I did before.</v>

3974
01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:10.390
<v Speaker 2>But Cub Swanson King Crack,</v>

3975
01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:14.860
<v Speaker 2>he can crack and he's got a kid now and he's got a second kid along the way and</v>

3976
01:43:14.861 --> 01:43:15.730
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't quit,</v>

3977
01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:17.770
<v Speaker 2>does not quit and that makes dude's hungry.</v>

3978
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:23.070
<v Speaker 2>And that fight is probably a massive motivating factor for the cubs.</v>

3979
01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:24.070
<v Speaker 4>And He,</v>

3980
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:27.130
<v Speaker 4>there's a cub is cub is still around and cubs,</v>

3981
01:43:27.170 --> 01:43:31.390
<v Speaker 4>he's still number four because he tastes the lessons from these fights.</v>

3982
01:43:31.630 --> 01:43:33.490
<v Speaker 4>He learned something in that fight with Frankie.</v>

3983
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:35.380
<v Speaker 4>I can't see that fight going.</v>

3984
01:43:35.410 --> 01:43:38.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a part of me that can see that if I go in exactly the same the</v>

3985
01:43:38.441 --> 01:43:39.160
<v Speaker 4>same way,</v>

3986
01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:43.150
<v Speaker 4>but I can also see cub having made adjustments because of the lessons that he</v>

3987
01:43:43.151 --> 01:43:44.120
<v Speaker 4>learned from that or</v>

3988
01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:46.930
<v Speaker 2>am noon and he had to learn from the tiger fight as well.</v>

3989
01:43:47.090 --> 01:43:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Look at how we're taking a handled Frankie.</v>

3990
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:51.010
<v Speaker 2>He handled him very smart,</v>

3991
01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:52.220
<v Speaker 2>very creative,</v>

3992
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:53.600
<v Speaker 3>mean cub fight a different way.</v>

3993
01:43:53.601 --> 01:43:57.500
<v Speaker 3>COBB is more of an in and out guy and he explodes on Ya and you know,</v>

3994
01:43:57.501 --> 01:44:00.460
<v Speaker 3>he keeps his hands down low and sneak shots on you.</v>

3995
01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:02.930
<v Speaker 3>He does a lot of weird shit cubs.</v>

3996
01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.040
<v Speaker 3>He's real creative.</v>

3997
01:44:04.041 --> 01:44:05.570
<v Speaker 3>He's got to watch out for the take down.</v>

3998
01:44:05.571 --> 01:44:06.950
<v Speaker 3>And the wrestling control though,</v>

3999
01:44:06.951 --> 01:44:09.170
<v Speaker 3>cause that that's a big factor in the fight.</v>

4000
01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.010
<v Speaker 3>That was giant.</v>

4001
01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:11.120
<v Speaker 3>That's where he got controlled.</v>

4002
01:44:11.690 --> 01:44:13.820
<v Speaker 3>But I mean it's a great fight.</v>

4003
01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:14.683
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

4004
01:44:15.110 --> 01:44:15.531
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

4005
01:44:15.531 --> 01:44:15.891
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

4006
01:44:15.891 --> 01:44:17.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm just all about what's better,</v>

4007
01:44:17.451 --> 01:44:18.590
<v Speaker 3>what's better in the long run,</v>

4008
01:44:18.591 --> 01:44:19.010
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4009
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:19.460
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

4010
01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Well it's Toms River.</v>

4011
01:44:21.230 --> 01:44:25.220
<v Speaker 3>The problem is a New Jersey and this is going to be in Atlantic city and all the</v>

4012
01:44:25.221 --> 01:44:27.230
<v Speaker 3>boys are going to come down and yeah,</v>

4013
01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:30.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you 100% I would like to see this fight,</v>

4014
01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.660
<v Speaker 3>but I would like to see this fight in six months.</v>

4015
01:44:32.690 --> 01:44:33.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4016
01:44:33.230 --> 01:44:33.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4017
01:44:33.650 --> 01:44:34.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a good fight.</v>

4018
01:44:35.070 --> 01:44:37.610
<v Speaker 3>It's good funny for a Frankie could walk,</v>

4019
01:44:37.611 --> 01:44:41.750
<v Speaker 3>fought Frankie go in there and wipe them out or do exactly what he did last time</v>

4020
01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:44.060
<v Speaker 3>or it can be a battle and then nothing comes of it.</v>

4021
01:44:44.061 --> 01:44:44.960
<v Speaker 3>But it's just like,</v>

4022
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:48.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm like err on the side of caution and some good fights on this card man.</v>

4023
01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:49.220
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

4024
01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:51.260
<v Speaker 3>David Branch and Tiago Santos.</v>

4025
01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:51.591
<v Speaker 3>I'm the,</v>

4026
01:44:51.591 --> 01:44:56.591
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking forward to that one tricky fucking fight that Tiago Santos guy is a</v>

4027
01:44:56.751 --> 01:45:01.090
<v Speaker 3>marker that dye that dude crushes people and he um,</v>

4028
01:45:01.130 --> 01:45:02.890
<v Speaker 3>ever since has lost the spice Lee.</v>

4029
01:45:02.891 --> 01:45:03.680
<v Speaker 3>He's been like,</v>

4030
01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:05.000
<v Speaker 3>it seemed more focused.</v>

4031
01:45:05.001 --> 01:45:06.140
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking animal man.</v>

4032
01:45:06.170 --> 01:45:10.460
<v Speaker 3>Very dangerous striker and David Branch coming off of that performance against</v>

4033
01:45:10.461 --> 01:45:11.121
<v Speaker 3>Luke Rockhold.</v>

4034
01:45:11.121 --> 01:45:16.121
<v Speaker 3>He had Brock hold her know he had rock hold her and you know he wound up getting</v>

4035
01:45:16.431 --> 01:45:17.264
<v Speaker 3>dominated,</v>

4036
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:19.550
<v Speaker 3>wound up getting mounted and beaten down.</v>

4037
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:21.320
<v Speaker 3>Got his back taken and smashed.</v>

4038
01:45:21.321 --> 01:45:24.440
<v Speaker 3>But he learned a lesson in that flight too for sure.</v>

4039
01:45:24.710 --> 01:45:27.170
<v Speaker 3>You'll learn a lot about conditioning when you fight.</v>

4040
01:45:27.171 --> 01:45:32.171
<v Speaker 3>A guy like Rockhold to Rockhold is one of the best in the division at top</v>

4041
01:45:32.211 --> 01:45:32.960
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

4042
01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:35.300
<v Speaker 3>He gets on top of Dude's like what he did with Chris Weidman,</v>

4043
01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:37.460
<v Speaker 3>five minutes off stud wrestler.</v>

4044
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:41.020
<v Speaker 3>He gets on top of him and it's like he might as well how to building setting on</v>

4045
01:45:41.021 --> 01:45:41.150
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

4046
01:45:41.150 --> 01:45:44.080
<v Speaker 3>He has his body type is,</v>

4047
01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:44.540
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

4048
01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:49.310
<v Speaker 3>is something that high to deal with with just how long he is,</v>

4049
01:45:49.311 --> 01:45:53.360
<v Speaker 3>but how good he is at Jujitsu and the controls and positioning.</v>

4050
01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:54.770
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem man,</v>

4051
01:45:54.771 --> 01:45:55.070
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

4052
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:57.410
<v Speaker 3>because you have to make that extra effort,</v>

4053
01:45:57.710 --> 01:45:58.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4054
01:45:58.071 --> 01:45:59.480
<v Speaker 3>when you start hip escaping,</v>

4055
01:45:59.750 --> 01:46:00.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4056
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.290
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4057
01:46:00.290 --> 01:46:02.270
<v Speaker 3>and on a regular guy,</v>

4058
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:03.590
<v Speaker 3>the guy that you're comfortable with,</v>

4059
01:46:03.591 --> 01:46:04.424
<v Speaker 3>the size,</v>

4060
01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:04.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4061
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:07.820
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to make as the movements for as long.</v>

4062
01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:09.013
<v Speaker 3>But Luke,</v>

4063
01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:13.670
<v Speaker 3>his build and the way he is and his understanding of positioning,</v>

4064
01:46:13.850 --> 01:46:15.080
<v Speaker 3>that's a hard,</v>

4065
01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:16.940
<v Speaker 3>he's a hide out for a lot of guys.</v>

4066
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:17.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4067
01:46:17.271 --> 01:46:21.620
<v Speaker 3>he's got that Heidrick Gracie type body long strong.</v>

4068
01:46:21.670 --> 01:46:21.820
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

4069
01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:22.011
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4070
01:46:22.011 --> 01:46:22.641
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

4071
01:46:22.641 --> 01:46:23.630
<v Speaker 3>It's just different.</v>

4072
01:46:23.631 --> 01:46:26.860
<v Speaker 3>It's like when I first rolled with like those guys over the,</v>

4073
01:46:27.130 --> 01:46:29.360
<v Speaker 3>the judo guys like them Bursey Madigan,</v>

4074
01:46:29.361 --> 01:46:31.550
<v Speaker 3>Berrien and Carl and those guys,</v>

4075
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:33.320
<v Speaker 3>I roll with them and it's like there,</v>

4076
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:35.480
<v Speaker 3>they have this Jujitsu style that's like,</v>

4077
01:46:35.481 --> 01:46:39.890
<v Speaker 3>the timing is just off of beat somehow and the hitting all these cameras and</v>

4078
01:46:39.891 --> 01:46:40.251
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

4079
01:46:40.251 --> 01:46:40.700
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4080
01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:41.780
<v Speaker 3>it feels funky.</v>

4081
01:46:41.781 --> 01:46:46.280
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's how Rockhold his body has Cody Mckinsey was like that.</v>

4082
01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:47.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4083
01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:48.130
<v Speaker 3>when I thought Cody,</v>

4084
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:48.960
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4085
01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:50.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm really good at escaping</v>

4086
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:52.860
<v Speaker 5>back control and I peel them off and it's like,</v>

4087
01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:53.690
<v Speaker 5>fucking,</v>

4088
01:46:53.690 --> 01:46:55.140
<v Speaker 5>it's so how much leg do you have?</v>

4089
01:46:55.630 --> 01:46:56.010
<v Speaker 5>A,</v>

4090
01:46:56.010 --> 01:46:56.611
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

4091
01:46:56.611 --> 01:46:57.540
<v Speaker 5>It's just keeps going.</v>

4092
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:58.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4093
01:46:58.530 --> 01:46:58.921
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4094
01:46:58.921 --> 01:47:03.720
<v Speaker 5>Well that's what makes the Yoel Romero fight all the more impressive that your</v>

4095
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:05.650
<v Speaker 5>Merrill shut that shit down a tire.</v>

4096
01:47:05.651 --> 01:47:06.484
<v Speaker 5>Lee.</v>

4097
01:47:06.630 --> 01:47:08.010
<v Speaker 5>He's terrifying man.</v>

4098
01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:09.510
<v Speaker 5>But he's seen everything,</v>

4099
01:47:09.511 --> 01:47:09.960
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4100
01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:12.750
<v Speaker 5>Like wrestling all the best guys in the world.</v>

4101
01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:13.591
<v Speaker 5>Did you see the podcast?</v>

4102
01:47:13.591 --> 01:47:14.610
<v Speaker 5>I did with him and Joey Diaz.</v>

4103
01:47:14.630 --> 01:47:16.050
<v Speaker 5>I watched some of it and I,</v>

4104
01:47:16.230 --> 01:47:16.591
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

4105
01:47:16.591 --> 01:47:18.810
<v Speaker 5>I like to listen to your stuff when I'm going to bed,</v>

4106
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.980
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

4107
01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:21.740
<v Speaker 5>so it's all in my head sometimes when I fall it,</v>

4108
01:47:21.741 --> 01:47:23.610
<v Speaker 5>when I pass out and I was in Texas,</v>

4109
01:47:23.611 --> 01:47:24.870
<v Speaker 5>I was driving all the time.</v>

4110
01:47:24.871 --> 01:47:25.561
<v Speaker 5>So I would listen.</v>

4111
01:47:25.561 --> 01:47:26.120
<v Speaker 5>When I leave,</v>

4112
01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:27.870
<v Speaker 5>I leave Austin drive to Houston.</v>

4113
01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:30.750
<v Speaker 5>I would hear like two or three episodes because I can go in there and then</v>

4114
01:47:30.751 --> 01:47:33.900
<v Speaker 5>coming back I said three hours or two and a half hour drive each way right out</v>

4115
01:47:33.901 --> 01:47:34.111
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

4116
01:47:34.111 --> 01:47:35.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm not in the car as much,</v>

4117
01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:35.820
<v Speaker 5>so I,</v>

4118
01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:36.181
<v Speaker 5>I get,</v>

4119
01:47:36.181 --> 01:47:37.740

<v Speaker 2>It is exactly what it is.</v>

4155
01:48:24.210 --> 01:48:26.040
<v Speaker 2>It is capitalism inside of communism.</v>

4156
01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:27.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4157
01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:27.810
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4158
01:48:27.810 --> 01:48:28.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4159
01:48:28.370 --> 01:48:32.160
<v Speaker 2>But key people poor and hungry and like the best in the world,</v>

4160
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:34.080
<v Speaker 2>the best they can do is get three meals a day.</v>

4161
01:48:34.110 --> 01:48:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4162
01:48:34.770 --> 01:48:35.880
<v Speaker 2>And live in a better place.</v>

4163
01:48:36.190 --> 01:48:37.023
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

4164
01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:39.433
<v Speaker 2>how we got,</v>

4165
01:48:39.690 --> 01:48:40.740
<v Speaker 2>we got political.</v>

4166
01:48:40.890 --> 01:48:41.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4167
01:48:41.041 --> 01:48:42.740
<v Speaker 2>But it is political and it,</v>

4168
01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:43.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4169
01:48:43.650 --> 01:48:44.910
<v Speaker 2>people need motivation.</v>

4170
01:48:45.090 --> 01:48:47.040
<v Speaker 2>They need incentive for your actions.</v>

4171
01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:49.230
<v Speaker 2>People that think socialism is a good idea,</v>

4172
01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:50.820
<v Speaker 2>have never accomplished anything.</v>

4173
01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:52.650
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you've competed.</v>

4174
01:48:52.710 --> 01:48:53.543
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>

4175
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:57.060
<v Speaker 2>If you're a competitor and you understand the benefit and the value of</v>

4176
01:48:57.061 --> 01:48:57.571
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>

4177
01:48:57.571 --> 01:48:59.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about capitalism competitive,</v>

4178
01:48:59.730 --> 01:49:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about just actual competitive in anything.</v>

4179
01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4180
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Anything where you're trying to get a position and it's a very difficult</v>

4181
01:49:06.691 --> 01:49:07.051
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

4182
01:49:07.051 --> 01:49:08.650
<v Speaker 2>So you want to work harder than the other people around you.</v>

4183
01:49:08.651 --> 01:49:11.850
<v Speaker 2>You know about merit based performance.</v>

4184
01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:12.700
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

4185
01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:13.620
<v Speaker 2>like you should,</v>

4186
01:49:13.621 --> 01:49:18.621
<v Speaker 2>you should achieve based on your merit based on what you have actually shown to</v>

4187
01:49:19.081 --> 01:49:20.580
<v Speaker 2>like how much work you've put in,</v>

4188
01:49:20.850 --> 01:49:22.290
<v Speaker 2>what you've accomplished.</v>

4189
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:23.610
<v Speaker 2>You should benefit from that.</v>

4190
01:49:23.710 --> 01:49:26.910
<v Speaker 2>The idea that everybody should be paid equally and that everybody should just</v>

4191
01:49:26.911 --> 01:49:27.091
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

4192
01:49:27.091 --> 01:49:27.631
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

4193
01:49:27.631 --> 01:49:29.040
<v Speaker 2>we will just contribute.</v>

4194
01:49:29.041 --> 01:49:29.540
<v Speaker 2>And just,</v>

4195
01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:29.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4196
01:49:29.730 --> 01:49:30.301
<v Speaker 2>I'll give a little,</v>

4197
01:49:30.301 --> 01:49:33.540
<v Speaker 2>you give the little dose fucks never give their share.</v>

4198
01:49:33.770 --> 01:49:34.050
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

4199
01:49:34.050 --> 01:49:35.010
<v Speaker 2>they're never good.</v>

4200
01:49:35.011 --> 01:49:36.390
<v Speaker 2>They're never the best at what they do.</v>

4201
01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:37.860
<v Speaker 2>They never know how to compete.</v>

4202
01:49:38.250 --> 01:49:39.210
<v Speaker 2>They just don't.</v>

4203
01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:39.900
<v Speaker 2>They just don't.</v>

4204
01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:40.980
<v Speaker 2>It's not saying that you,</v>

4205
01:49:41.110 --> 01:49:45.000
<v Speaker 2>that there's not some aspects of a community where we should have some socialist</v>

4206
01:49:45.001 --> 01:49:45.451
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

4207
01:49:45.451 --> 01:49:47.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I believe in free education.</v>

4208
01:49:47.530 --> 01:49:50.350
<v Speaker 2>I believe that without a doubt,</v>

4209
01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:52.090
<v Speaker 2>our nation as wealthy as it is,</v>

4210
01:49:52.091 --> 01:49:53.830
<v Speaker 2>can afford to have better healthcare,</v>

4211
01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:54.971
<v Speaker 2>better education.</v>

4212
01:49:54.971 --> 01:49:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4213
01:49:55.210 --> 01:49:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Those two things I think are gigantic factors in just having a healthy</v>

4214
01:49:59.291 --> 01:50:00.124
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

4215
01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:01.750
<v Speaker 2>But if you want a quality of outcome,</v>

4216
01:50:01.751 --> 01:50:02.860
<v Speaker 2>you can suck my dick.</v>

4217
01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:04.120
<v Speaker 2>That's nonsense.</v>

4218
01:50:04.121 --> 01:50:08.170
<v Speaker 2>There's no such thing as equality of outcome because if you have real freedom,</v>

4219
01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:09.700
<v Speaker 2>real freedom,</v>

4220
01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:14.320
<v Speaker 2>you're always going to have inequality of outcome because the real freedom is a</v>

4221
01:50:14.321 --> 01:50:17.470
<v Speaker 2>guy like Jocko wants to get up at four 30 in the morning and work out every day,</v>

4222
01:50:17.650 --> 01:50:19.960
<v Speaker 2>whereas some people just want to sleep til noon.</v>

4223
01:50:20.170 --> 01:50:21.280
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather just lay in bed,</v>

4224
01:50:21.281 --> 01:50:21.581
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4225
01:50:21.581 --> 01:50:23.080
<v Speaker 2>I like to go to the beach and hang out.</v>

4226
01:50:23.230 --> 01:50:23.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

4227
01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:24.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in a hurry.</v>

4228
01:50:24.611 --> 01:50:25.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in a rush.</v>

4229
01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

4230
01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:27.760
<v Speaker 2>I hope you enjoy yourself.</v>

4231
01:50:27.850 --> 01:50:28.780
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

4232
01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:31.450
<v Speaker 2>But if you want the same amount of monies that motherfuckers up at four 30 in</v>

4233
01:50:31.451 --> 01:50:32.680
<v Speaker 2>the morning hustling,</v>

4234
01:50:32.770 --> 01:50:33.850
<v Speaker 2>constantly cranking out,</v>

4235
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:35.950
<v Speaker 2>I've got three different things in the air.</v>

4236
01:50:35.951 --> 01:50:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Three different things going on.</v>

4237
01:50:37.571 --> 01:50:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Projects constantly,</v>

4238
01:50:38.771 --> 01:50:40.120
<v Speaker 2>always in the middle of something,</v>

4239
01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:41.133
<v Speaker 2>always pushing,</v>

4240
01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:42.160
<v Speaker 2>always trying to improve.</v>

4241
01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Always look at himself,</v>

4242
01:50:43.271 --> 01:50:44.560
<v Speaker 2>always being self critical,</v>

4243
01:50:44.561 --> 01:50:46.720
<v Speaker 2>always analyzing what do I have to do to get better?</v>

4244
01:50:46.810 --> 01:50:47.643
<v Speaker 2>And you're not,</v>

4245
01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:49.720
<v Speaker 2>but you want the same outcome for [inaudible].</v>

4246
01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:51.233
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

4247
01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:53.260
<v Speaker 2>I completely</v>

4248
01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:54.070
<v Speaker 4>agree with that.</v>

4249
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:55.420
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there's this,</v>

4250
01:50:55.810 --> 01:50:56.643
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>

4251
01:50:56.690 --> 01:50:56.790
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4252
01:50:56.790 --> 01:51:00.910
<v Speaker 4>especially the country is in the best place when there are more people in the</v>

4253
01:51:00.911 --> 01:51:01.390
<v Speaker 4>middle,</v>

4254
01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:01.900
<v Speaker 4>when they're,</v>

4255
01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:02.390
<v Speaker 4>when they're,</v>

4256
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.661
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

4257
01:51:02.661 --> 01:51:04.090
<v Speaker 4>when there's these extremes.</v>

4258
01:51:04.091 --> 01:51:04.970
<v Speaker 4>And I feel like the Pete,</v>

4259
01:51:04.971 --> 01:51:06.220
<v Speaker 4>that people that were in the middle,</v>

4260
01:51:06.221 --> 01:51:09.850
<v Speaker 4>they've somehow been dragged further out to these extremes because yeah,</v>

4261
01:51:09.970 --> 01:51:10.803
<v Speaker 4>having,</v>

4262
01:51:11.010 --> 01:51:11.843
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4263
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:14.980
<v Speaker 4>like going far right with some things,</v>

4264
01:51:14.981 --> 01:51:15.310
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4265
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:16.143
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4266
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.631
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4267
01:51:16.631 --> 01:51:17.590
<v Speaker 4>you don't get anything.</v>

4268
01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:19.540
<v Speaker 4>You don't get this unless you work for it.</v>

4269
01:51:19.541 --> 01:51:19.931
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>

4270
01:51:19.931 --> 01:51:20.170
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4271
01:51:20.170 --> 01:51:20.591
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

4272
01:51:20.591 --> 01:51:21.311
<v Speaker 4>100%.</v>

4273
01:51:21.311 --> 01:51:21.431
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

4274
01:51:21.431 --> 01:51:21.661
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4275
01:51:21.661 --> 01:51:21.881
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4276
01:51:21.881 --> 01:51:24.370
<v Speaker 4>but like some of some of the things that go along with that.</v>

4277
01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:25.121
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4278
01:51:25.121 --> 01:51:25.691
<v Speaker 4>But then this,</v>

4279
01:51:25.691 --> 01:51:27.370
<v Speaker 4>everybody gets a trophy every like,</v>

4280
01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:27.851
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4281
01:51:27.851 --> 01:51:28.421
<v Speaker 4>everybody's in,</v>

4282
01:51:28.421 --> 01:51:29.550
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't get a trophy there.</v>

4283
01:51:29.551 --> 01:51:30.250
<v Speaker 4>There is like,</v>

4284
01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:35.250
<v Speaker 4>you should get a trophy if you are able to compete to the level that deserve,</v>

4285
01:51:35.471 --> 01:51:37.600
<v Speaker 4>that's deserving of a trophy and that's it.</v>

4286
01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:37.911
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4287
01:51:37.911 --> 01:51:39.340
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody shouldn't get one.</v>

4288
01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:40.570
<v Speaker 4>You lost.</v>

4289
01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:43.720
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't get the same thing that the guy that won got right.</v>

4290
01:51:43.721 --> 01:51:45.040
<v Speaker 4>You did well and you lost and you,</v>

4291
01:51:45.070 --> 01:51:48.250
<v Speaker 4>and there's a big competition with a big group and you did better than some of</v>

4292
01:51:48.251 --> 01:51:48.431
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

4293
01:51:48.431 --> 01:51:48.671
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4294
01:51:48.671 --> 01:51:49.720
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you get some of the,</v>

4295
01:51:49.721 --> 01:51:50.554
<v Speaker 4>some of the pie,</v>

4296
01:51:50.830 --> 01:51:52.300
<v Speaker 4>but like this whole thing of,</v>

4297
01:51:52.510 --> 01:51:52.840
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4298
01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:54.010
<v Speaker 4>everybody's equal.</v>

4299
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:54.600
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4300
01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:55.110
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4301
01:51:55.110 --> 01:51:55.931
<v Speaker 4>I disagree,</v>

4302
01:51:55.931 --> 01:51:56.764
<v Speaker 4>I feel like,</v>

4303
01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:58.030
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like there's,</v>

4304
01:51:58.031 --> 01:52:01.360
<v Speaker 4>there's aspects of everything that should be everywhere.</v>

4305
01:52:01.361 --> 01:52:02.141
<v Speaker 4>So when I say that,</v>

4306
01:52:02.141 --> 01:52:04.840
<v Speaker 4>what I mean is like capitalism,</v>

4307
01:52:04.841 --> 01:52:05.501
<v Speaker 4>like we saw,</v>

4308
01:52:05.501 --> 01:52:08.000
<v Speaker 4>we saw capitalism inside communism in that example.</v>

4309
01:52:08.010 --> 01:52:08.151
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4310
01:52:08.151 --> 01:52:08.540
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4311
01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:09.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4312
01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:09.281
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4313
01:52:09.281 --> 01:52:10.360
<v Speaker 4>inside capitalism,</v>

4314
01:52:10.361 --> 01:52:11.230
<v Speaker 4>there should be some,</v>

4315
01:52:11.231 --> 01:52:11.501
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

4316
01:52:11.501 --> 01:52:12.400
<v Speaker 4>some socialism,</v>

4317
01:52:12.630 --> 01:52:12.940
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4318
01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:13.241
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4319
01:52:13.241 --> 01:52:13.840
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4320
01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:14.440
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4321
01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:17.260
<v Speaker 4>let's look at the major league baseball,</v>

4322
01:52:17.290 --> 01:52:17.650
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4323
01:52:17.650 --> 01:52:18.280
<v Speaker 4>The Yankees,</v>

4324
01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:18.570
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

4325
01:52:18.570 --> 01:52:21.790
<v Speaker 4>they're in the playoffs every year because they can afford ever they get</v>

4326
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:23.260
<v Speaker 4>afforded by the bass player.</v>

4327
01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:24.020
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4328
01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:24.461
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>

4329
01:52:24.461 --> 01:52:24.790
<v Speaker 4>look at,</v>

4330
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:25.421
<v Speaker 4>look at Green Bay,</v>

4331
01:52:25.421 --> 01:52:25.961
<v Speaker 4>Wisconsin,</v>

4332
01:52:25.961 --> 01:52:27.010
<v Speaker 4>small market team,</v>

4333
01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.990
<v Speaker 4>they can win a Superbowl because of the,</v>

4334
01:52:28.991 --> 01:52:33.970
<v Speaker 4>of the revenue share because of the socialistic revenue sharing inside the NFL.</v>

4335
01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:34.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4336
01:52:34.930 --> 01:52:35.171
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4337
01:52:35.171 --> 01:52:35.411
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4338
01:52:35.411 --> 01:52:38.320
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird dynamic where there are things that,</v>

4339
01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:41.110
<v Speaker 4>that apply in different situations,</v>

4340
01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:46.310
<v Speaker 4>but like people can't compartmentalize enough so that these things can happen</v>

4341
01:52:46.311 --> 01:52:48.140
<v Speaker 4>and we can all make it work out.</v>

4342
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:49.250
<v Speaker 4>Like I feel like,</v>

4343
01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:51.820
<v Speaker 4>like you said about health and education.</v>

4344
01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:52.820
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4345
01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:53.001
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4346
01:52:53.001 --> 01:52:54.020
<v Speaker 4>Health care and education.</v>

4347
01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:56.420
<v Speaker 4>We have the funds for those things to be,</v>

4348
01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:58.100
<v Speaker 4>to be good across the board.</v>

4349
01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:00.770
<v Speaker 4>But why is it that the schools in this,</v>

4350
01:53:00.771 --> 01:53:04.490
<v Speaker 4>in this rich area always better.</v>

4351
01:53:04.491 --> 01:53:06.230
<v Speaker 4>They always have the better scores,</v>

4352
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:07.670
<v Speaker 4>but then when you take that same,</v>

4353
01:53:07.671 --> 01:53:09.800
<v Speaker 4>you take the same type of um,</v>

4354
01:53:10.130 --> 01:53:12.530
<v Speaker 4>effort and you put that somewhere in a poor area,</v>

4355
01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:13.940
<v Speaker 4>their scores come up and,</v>

4356
01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:15.140
<v Speaker 4>and they can compete,</v>

4357
01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:15.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4358
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:20.030
<v Speaker 4>If they have the same effort from the faculty and the staff and whatnot.</v>

4359
01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:20.840
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

4360
01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:21.500
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4361
01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:23.270
<v Speaker 4>and same thing with like law enforcement,</v>

4362
01:53:23.271 --> 01:53:24.031
<v Speaker 4>law enforcement is,</v>

4363
01:53:24.031 --> 01:53:24.221
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

4364
01:53:24.221 --> 01:53:26.480
<v Speaker 4>is better in these areas where like,</v>

4365
01:53:26.481 --> 01:53:29.180
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's no crime here then this is where all the rich people live and</v>

4366
01:53:29.181 --> 01:53:29.540
<v Speaker 4>this and that.</v>

4367
01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:29.661
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4368
01:53:29.661 --> 01:53:30.021
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4369
01:53:30.021 --> 01:53:30.960
<v Speaker 4>But like if it,</v>

4370
01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:33.020
<v Speaker 4>because they also have better law enforcement,</v>

4371
01:53:33.070 --> 01:53:33.531
<v Speaker 4>they're a kid.</v>

4372
01:53:33.531 --> 01:53:36.170
<v Speaker 4>There were police patrolling that area in a different fashion.</v>

4373
01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:36.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4374
01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:37.370
<v Speaker 4>like it's,</v>

4375
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:40.370
<v Speaker 4>it's this weird thing where it's not equal,</v>

4376
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:45.230
<v Speaker 4>it's not equal and it doesn't like those things should be equal.</v>

4377
01:53:45.290 --> 01:53:45.770
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

4378
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:48.950
<v Speaker 4>but as far as these people live in a poor area now,</v>

4379
01:53:48.951 --> 01:53:50.480
<v Speaker 4>and these people are,</v>

4380
01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:50.740
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

4381
01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:51.201
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

4382
01:53:51.201 --> 01:53:54.440
<v Speaker 4>they have a lot of money because of a family wealth,</v>

4383
01:53:54.441 --> 01:53:55.700
<v Speaker 4>because of work ethic.</v>

4384
01:53:55.701 --> 01:53:56.600
<v Speaker 4>Because of all of that.</v>

4385
01:53:56.630 --> 01:53:57.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4386
01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:58.100
<v Speaker 4>Like every,</v>

4387
01:53:58.101 --> 01:53:59.780
<v Speaker 4>but everybody deserves to be safe.</v>

4388
01:53:59.810 --> 01:54:02.780
<v Speaker 4>Everybody deserves to have that at the very least.</v>

4389
01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:03.530
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4390
01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:04.011
<v Speaker 4>So let's,</v>

4391
01:54:04.011 --> 01:54:08.600
<v Speaker 4>let's enforce the laws and in patrol and do those things in this area just as</v>

4392
01:54:08.601 --> 01:54:10.040
<v Speaker 4>much as we do for this area.</v>

4393
01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:10.880
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4394
01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:11.421
<v Speaker 4>And put the,</v>

4395
01:54:11.421 --> 01:54:14.480
<v Speaker 4>put the money into that because that's a community thing now.</v>

4396
01:54:14.481 --> 01:54:16.400
<v Speaker 4>And we're talking about what they have.</v>

4397
01:54:16.401 --> 01:54:17.300
<v Speaker 4>They have nicer pools.</v>

4398
01:54:17.301 --> 01:54:17.421
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4399
01:54:17.421 --> 01:54:19.130
<v Speaker 4>they pay higher taxes and they do this thing,</v>

4400
01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:19.551
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4401
01:54:19.551 --> 01:54:20.510
<v Speaker 4>well if you want that,</v>

4402
01:54:20.511 --> 01:54:21.470
<v Speaker 4>you've now that you,</v>

4403
01:54:21.471 --> 01:54:24.110
<v Speaker 4>you're safe enough and your education is where it is.</v>

4404
01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:26.180
<v Speaker 4>Let's start reinvested in that community.</v>

4405
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.760
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4406
01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:27.201
<v Speaker 4>let's not,</v>

4407
01:54:27.201 --> 01:54:28.040
<v Speaker 4>let's not get,</v>

4408
01:54:28.041 --> 01:54:30.860
<v Speaker 4>get to the point where we can afford to be here.</v>

4409
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:32.390
<v Speaker 4>So we go there.</v>

4410
01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:32.811
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4411
01:54:32.811 --> 01:54:35.240
<v Speaker 4>like we can afford to be there and um,</v>

4412
01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:39.350
<v Speaker 4>but let's US try reinvesting in this community to make this community more like</v>

4413
01:54:39.351 --> 01:54:39.891
<v Speaker 4>that one.</v>

4414
01:54:39.891 --> 01:54:42.860
<v Speaker 4>But if we have the protections to do that,</v>

4415
01:54:42.861 --> 01:54:45.950
<v Speaker 4>then I feel more comfortable reinvesting in this community.</v>

4416
01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:46.470
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4417
01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:47.600
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird,</v>

4418
01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:50.360
<v Speaker 4>all these things are all over the place and you got to put them together.</v>

4419
01:54:50.630 --> 01:54:50.841
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4420
01:54:50.841 --> 01:54:53.930
<v Speaker 2>we don't treat our country as if it's a giant community.</v>

4421
01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:54.231
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4422
01:54:54.231 --> 01:54:56.600
<v Speaker 2>If it was a giant community where everybody's equal,</v>

4423
01:54:56.601 --> 01:54:58.670
<v Speaker 2>we would look at all the problem spots and say,</v>

4424
01:54:58.671 --> 01:54:59.390
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4425
01:54:59.390 --> 01:55:04.100
<v Speaker 2>well there these crime ridden poverty stricken communities that can't seem to</v>

4426
01:55:04.101 --> 01:55:04.934
<v Speaker 2>catch a break.</v>

4427
01:55:04.970 --> 01:55:06.350
<v Speaker 2>So the people that come out of that,</v>

4428
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:07.430
<v Speaker 2>even though we're saying,</v>

4429
01:55:07.431 --> 01:55:07.671
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4430
01:55:07.671 --> 01:55:08.150
<v Speaker 2>you have a,</v>

4431
01:55:08.150 --> 01:55:09.620
<v Speaker 2>there's an open playing field to compete.</v>

4432
01:55:09.621 --> 01:55:10.430
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

4433
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:10.611
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4434
01:55:10.611 --> 01:55:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Because they're coming at it with a massive different disadvantage from the jump</v>

4435
01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:18.260
<v Speaker 2>at the education disadvantage and environmental disadvantage in what they see</v>

4436
01:55:18.261 --> 01:55:19.370
<v Speaker 2>around them all the time.</v>

4437
01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:20.211
<v Speaker 2>They're around a lot of,</v>

4438
01:55:20.211 --> 01:55:21.500
<v Speaker 2>I can't catch a break dudes.</v>

4439
01:55:21.501 --> 01:55:21.770
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4440
01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:22.690
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of trap,</v>

4441
01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:23.780
<v Speaker 2>a lot of criminals,</v>

4442
01:55:23.781 --> 01:55:24.890
<v Speaker 2>a lot of bullshit,</v>

4443
01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:26.990
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different ways you could go wrong.</v>

4444
01:55:26.991 --> 01:55:30.590
<v Speaker 2>A lot of things that could set you down a terrible path in life and it's around</v>

4445
01:55:30.591 --> 01:55:31.424
<v Speaker 2>you all the time.</v>

4446
01:55:31.730 --> 01:55:35.660
<v Speaker 2>And if we tried to engineer society,</v>

4447
01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:36.830
<v Speaker 2>so say well how do we,</v>

4448
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:40.040
<v Speaker 2>how do we have less people that are disadvantaged?</v>

4449
01:55:40.041 --> 01:55:41.480
<v Speaker 2>How do we have less losers?</v>

4450
01:55:41.630 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>What's the best way when you got to to the problem spots,</v>

4451
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:46.440
<v Speaker 2>all the problem spots we should be dumping money in.</v>

4452
01:55:46.710 --> 01:55:47.543
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

4453
01:55:47.730 --> 01:55:51.240
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying that we shouldn't do anything overseas because I think a lot</v>

4454
01:55:51.241 --> 01:55:55.230
<v Speaker 2>of the things that we do overseas probably help and protect us over here.</v>

4455
01:55:55.231 --> 01:55:55.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4456
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:58.590
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of shit we don't have to do and that shit,</v>

4457
01:55:58.591 --> 01:56:00.720
<v Speaker 2>we could take that money and just fix cities.</v>

4458
01:56:00.930 --> 01:56:04.590
<v Speaker 2>Just go in and throw a ton of money and compassion.</v>

4459
01:56:04.591 --> 01:56:09.390
<v Speaker 2>And education and community centers and make places safe for people to learn how</v>

4460
01:56:09.391 --> 01:56:10.224
<v Speaker 2>to be an adult.</v>

4461
01:56:11.010 --> 01:56:13.380
<v Speaker 2>You know what the u s military budget is?</v>

4462
01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:14.413
<v Speaker 2>You're sane.</v>

4463
01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:15.301
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

4464
01:56:15.301 --> 01:56:16.110
<v Speaker 2>You have any idea?</v>

4465
01:56:16.110 --> 01:56:16.471
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4466
01:56:16.471 --> 01:56:16.980
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

4467
01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:18.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like 600 billion.</v>

4468
01:56:21.210 --> 01:56:22.050
<v Speaker 2>I think it's higher than that.</v>

4469
01:56:22.051 --> 01:56:22.771
<v Speaker 2>It's higher than that.</v>

4470
01:56:22.771 --> 01:56:23.604
<v Speaker 2>It's in the trillions.</v>

4471
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:25.680
<v Speaker 2>The guys in the trillion that's like that.</v>

4472
01:56:25.890 --> 01:56:27.120
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy.</v>

4473
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.541
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

4474
01:56:27.541 --> 01:56:29.010
<v Speaker 2>that I kind of takes me,</v>

4475
01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:34.440
<v Speaker 2>let's guess you say 696 I say one point 3 trillion.</v>

4476
01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4477
01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:35.791
<v Speaker 2>I'm crazy though,</v>

4478
01:56:35.791 --> 01:56:36.060
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

4479
01:56:36.060 --> 01:56:36.900
<v Speaker 2>600 billion.</v>

4480
01:56:36.930 --> 01:56:39.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what one point 3 trillion looks like.</v>

4481
01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4482
01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:40.833
<v Speaker 2>What is it</v>

4483
01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:42.641
<v Speaker 2>don?</v>

4484
01:56:42.641 --> 01:56:43.474
<v Speaker 2>Don.</v>

4485
01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Luckily both.</v>

4486
01:56:45.490 --> 01:56:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Technically both.</v>

4487
01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:46.671
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4488
01:56:46.671 --> 01:56:46.780
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4489
01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:47.590
<v Speaker 6>the thing that when you put,</v>

4490
01:56:47.590 --> 01:56:48.423
<v Speaker 6>when I googled it,</v>

4491
01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:48.730
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4492
01:56:48.730 --> 01:56:53.730
<v Speaker 6>the last one that was reported I suppose was 2015 it was 579 five nine 7</v>

4493
01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:54.310
<v Speaker 6>billion.</v>

4494
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:55.460
<v Speaker 6>What's Year 21?</v>

4495
01:56:55.490 --> 01:57:00.490
<v Speaker 6>2015 the new one that Trump just signed that was approved is for one point 3</v>

4496
01:57:02.290 --> 01:57:02.530
<v Speaker 6>trillion.</v>

4497
01:57:02.530 --> 01:57:03.730
<v Speaker 2>That's must be where I heard it.</v>

4498
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:05.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>

4499
01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:06.310
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of cash.</v>

4500
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:07.240
<v Speaker 2>That's much for education,</v>

4501
01:57:07.241 --> 01:57:08.074
<v Speaker 2>Mr. Trump.</v>

4502
01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:09.840
<v Speaker 2>We don't need no stinking books.</v>

4503
01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:11.040
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4504
01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:14.480
<v Speaker 6>I think that's actually the whole bill that's 700 billion of that is for the</v>

4505
01:57:14.481 --> 01:57:15.020
<v Speaker 6>military.</v>

4506
01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:15.201
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4507
01:57:15.201 --> 01:57:16.910
<v Speaker 6>what's the rest of it for everything else?</v>

4508
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:18.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4509
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:22.260
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine if someone just said 700 billion for schools,</v>

4510
01:57:22.261 --> 01:57:22.641
<v Speaker 2>he'd be like,</v>

4511
01:57:22.641 --> 01:57:23.120
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

4512
01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:23.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4513
01:57:23.331 --> 01:57:23.630
<v Speaker 2>we're fine.</v>

4514
01:57:23.630 --> 01:57:24.710
<v Speaker 2>We're not fucking around anymore.</v>

4515
01:57:24.730 --> 01:57:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4516
01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:25.970
<v Speaker 2>We're ready to take over.</v>

4517
01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:29.930
<v Speaker 2>We're going to invest 10 years with $700 billion a year in a school system.</v>

4518
01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:30.793
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

4519
01:57:30.910 --> 01:57:31.190
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

4520
01:57:31.190 --> 01:57:32.090
<v Speaker 2>that sounds nice.</v>

4521
01:57:32.091 --> 01:57:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

4522
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.571
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4523
01:57:32.571 --> 01:57:35.690
<v Speaker 2>What do you think the education budget is for the country?</v>

4524
01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:36.890
<v Speaker 2>If you had to guess,</v>

4525
01:57:37.070 --> 01:57:42.020
<v Speaker 2>what's the overall public education budget in the United States?</v>

4526
01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Primary through high school.</v>

4527
01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:44.600
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about it.</v>

4528
01:57:44.601 --> 01:57:45.170
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

4529
01:57:45.170 --> 01:57:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4530
01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:48.440
<v Speaker 2>if we go at 600 billion for the military,</v>

4531
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:49.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go with,</v>

4532
01:57:51.220 --> 01:57:51.690
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4533
01:57:51.690 --> 01:57:52.650
<v Speaker 2>100 billion.</v>

4534
01:57:53.070 --> 01:57:54.420
<v Speaker 2>I'll go 100 million.</v>

4535
01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:55.820
<v Speaker 2>$100 million,</v>

4536
01:57:55.821 --> 01:57:56.080
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4537
01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:56.430
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4538
01:57:56.430 --> 01:57:59.880
<v Speaker 6>as of 2011 discretionary budget was 70 billion.</v>

4539
01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:01.020
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

4540
01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:03.270
<v Speaker 6>That's up from education budget.</v>

4541
01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:03.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4542
01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:05.760
<v Speaker 6>2006 it was 56 billion.</v>

4543
01:58:07.130 --> 01:58:10.480
<v Speaker 2>So it's higher than it has been in the past.</v>

4544
01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:12.460
<v Speaker 2>70 billion.</v>

4545
01:58:12.461 --> 01:58:13.390
<v Speaker 2>And what does that cover?</v>

4546
01:58:14.060 --> 01:58:15.050
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4547
01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:17.650
<v Speaker 6>there's two more fucking people that I wouldn't say that what it covers,</v>

4548
01:58:18.410 --> 01:58:20.690
<v Speaker 6>what it's supposed to cover and what actually covers is a different thing.</v>

4549
01:58:20.770 --> 01:58:21.603
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4550
01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:22.790
<v Speaker 6>what's it supposed to cover?</v>

4551
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:24.920
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to have to look deep into that.</v>

4552
01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4553
01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:28.550
<v Speaker 2>You just said there's too many people to so many people.</v>

4554
01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:29.413
<v Speaker 2>So check this out.</v>

4555
01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4556
01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:30.021
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

4557
01:58:30.021 --> 01:58:30.410
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

4558
01:58:30.410 --> 01:58:31.430
<v Speaker 2>I think the same thing,</v>

4559
01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:31.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4560
01:58:31.850 --> 01:58:32.300
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

4561
01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:34.340
<v Speaker 2>I did some slight research,</v>

4562
01:58:35.330 --> 01:58:40.330
<v Speaker 2>1955 I think it was guest with the population of the planet was,</v>

4563
01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:41.891
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4564
01:58:41.891 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 2>we</v>

4565
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:42.731
<v Speaker 5>did that the other day.</v>

4566
01:58:42.731 --> 01:58:43.660
<v Speaker 5>It was like 2 billion,</v>

4567
01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:44.553
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4568
01:58:44.610 --> 01:58:44.920
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4569
01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:45.370
<v Speaker 5>200.</v>

4570
01:58:45.370 --> 01:58:46.060
<v Speaker 5>Two and a half.</v>

4571
01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:46.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4572
01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:47.230
<v Speaker 5>two and a half billion.</v>

4573
01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:49.750
<v Speaker 5>And now we're at seven and a half billion.</v>

4574
01:58:49.751 --> 01:58:50.440
<v Speaker 5>When we went with him,</v>

4575
01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:51.460
<v Speaker 5>when I was in high school,</v>

4576
01:58:51.490 --> 01:58:52.990
<v Speaker 5>we went with like 85,</v>

4577
01:58:52.991 --> 01:58:54.700
<v Speaker 5>I think it was 5 billion.</v>

4578
01:58:55.570 --> 01:58:59.290
<v Speaker 5>So just since 1985 to today,</v>

4579
01:58:59.590 --> 01:59:00.610
<v Speaker 5>it's gone up,</v>

4580
01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:05.700
<v Speaker 5>doubled from almost from this fifties and now we've added another half to that</v>

4581
01:59:05.891 --> 01:59:06.970
<v Speaker 5>50% of that.</v>

4582
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:07.960
<v Speaker 5>So many people.</v>

4583
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.561
<v Speaker 5>But like,</v>

4584
01:59:08.561 --> 01:59:11.740
<v Speaker 5>like I was thinking about that and I'm like looking at it and like if we're,</v>

4585
01:59:11.741 --> 01:59:13.090
<v Speaker 5>if it's exponential,</v>

4586
01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:14.433
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4587
01:59:14.650 --> 01:59:18.880
<v Speaker 5>In 50 years we will have nearly 20 billion people on this planet.</v>

4588
01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:19.843
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4589
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:21.183
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>

4590
01:59:21.190 --> 01:59:22.000
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

4591
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:22.241
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4592
01:59:22.241 --> 01:59:24.460
<v Speaker 5>Everybody or everywhere is going to look like Los Angeles.</v>

4593
01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:29.330
<v Speaker 5>Like imagine if there was still like I think in like 18 in the 18 hundreds they</v>

4594
01:59:29.331 --> 01:59:31.690
<v Speaker 5>were like still millions of people on the planet.</v>

4595
01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:32.081
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>

4596
01:59:32.081 --> 01:59:32.980
<v Speaker 5>not billions.</v>

4597
01:59:33.130 --> 01:59:38.130
<v Speaker 5>Herod is right near the president's 2017 budget provides 69.4 billion in</v>

4598
01:59:38.681 --> 01:59:39.880
<v Speaker 5>discretionary funding.</v>

4599
01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:41.530
<v Speaker 5>Is that but that's education.</v>

4600
01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:42.100
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4601
01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:46.870
<v Speaker 5>This is for the education bill 139.7 billion in new mandatory funding for the u</v>

4602
01:59:46.871 --> 01:59:48.040
<v Speaker 5>s department of Education.</v>

4603
01:59:48.041 --> 01:59:51.730
<v Speaker 5>The budget supports implementation of every student succeeds act,</v>

4604
01:59:51.731 --> 01:59:55.150
<v Speaker 5>which embraces many of the reforms in the administration along has long</v>

4605
01:59:55.160 --> 01:59:57.910
<v Speaker 5>supported to improve outcomes for all students.</v>

4606
01:59:57.911 --> 02:00:02.410
<v Speaker 5>That also makes crucial investments that build the administration's work to</v>

4607
02:00:02.411 --> 02:00:07.411
<v Speaker 5>advance educational equity and excellence support teachers and school leaders</v>

4608
02:00:08.801 --> 02:00:11.200
<v Speaker 5>promote college affordability and completion.</v>

4609
02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:12.070
<v Speaker 5>These include,</v>

4610
02:00:12.070 --> 02:00:13.210
<v Speaker 5>I think college should be free.</v>

4611
02:00:13.900 --> 02:00:15.640
<v Speaker 5>I think we could figure out how to make college free.</v>

4612
02:00:15.670 --> 02:00:16.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm with Bernie Sanders on that.</v>

4613
02:00:16.871 --> 02:00:17.650
<v Speaker 5>It's a rare thing.</v>

4614
02:00:17.650 --> 02:00:20.650
<v Speaker 5>I just don't think you should be in fucking debt up to your ass hall by the time</v>

4615
02:00:20.651 --> 02:00:21.281
<v Speaker 5>you get out of school.</v>

4616
02:00:21.281 --> 02:00:22.240
<v Speaker 5>I think it's crazy.</v>

4617
02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:24.790
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucked up way to start your life and people are like,</v>

4618
02:00:24.791 --> 02:00:27.760
<v Speaker 5>well you want to make a lump district separates the people that really want it</v>

4619
02:00:27.761 --> 02:00:29.560
<v Speaker 5>and the people that know bull shit.</v>

4620
02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:33.160
<v Speaker 5>You get stuck in debt and you can't even get out of that debt.</v>

4621
02:00:33.161 --> 02:00:34.290
<v Speaker 5>It's not even regular debt.</v>

4622
02:00:34.291 --> 02:00:35.260
<v Speaker 5>It's blood debt.</v>

4623
02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:37.180
<v Speaker 5>Some weird debt but doesn't,</v>

4624
02:00:37.181 --> 02:00:39.280
<v Speaker 5>doesn't have a more educated society.</v>

4625
02:00:39.281 --> 02:00:40.540
<v Speaker 5>Help everybody.</v>

4626
02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:42.040
<v Speaker 5>Everybody in the long run,</v>

4627
02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:42.903
<v Speaker 5>sure</v>

4628
02:00:44.670 --> 02:00:45.503
<v Speaker 5>we'll make more money.</v>

4629
02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:48.200
<v Speaker 5>Everybody would make more money like I don't get that users,</v>

4630
02:00:48.970 --> 02:00:53.950
<v Speaker 5>but you would have to like make sure that whoever the fuck is teaching these</v>

4631
02:00:53.951 --> 02:00:54.784
<v Speaker 5>kids,</v>

4632
02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:59.470
<v Speaker 5>like you'd have to be real stringent with what you're letting get pushed through</v>

4633
02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:01.120
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to throw that much money on it.</v>

4634
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:03.370
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of shit bag and teachers out there.</v>

4635
02:01:03.610 --> 02:01:04.960
<v Speaker 5>We'd have to clean that up.</v>

4636
02:01:05.290 --> 02:01:05.621
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4637
02:01:05.621 --> 02:01:06.670
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people,</v>

4638
02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:09.340
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of shitbag teachers out there and now they want to give him gun.</v>

4639
02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:11.950
<v Speaker 5>That's the dumbest shit of all time.</v>

4640
02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:13.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

4641
02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:14.013
<v Speaker 5>I was the dumbest shit.</v>

4642
02:01:14.230 --> 02:01:15.700
<v Speaker 5>That is the dumbest shit of all time.</v>

4643
02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:18.010
<v Speaker 5>You can't expect teachers to become soldiers.</v>

4644
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:18.670
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

4645
02:01:18.670 --> 02:01:19.503
<v Speaker 5>That's not what they do.</v>

4646
02:01:19.630 --> 02:01:20.020
<v Speaker 5>They're not,</v>

4647
02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:20.853
<v Speaker 5>they're not warriors.</v>

4648
02:01:21.190 --> 02:01:22.090
<v Speaker 5>They shouldn't be out there.</v>

4649
02:01:22.210 --> 02:01:24.250
<v Speaker 5>Have a firefights with pilled up,</v>

4650
02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:24.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4651
02:01:24.970 --> 02:01:25.803
<v Speaker 5>formal,</v>

4652
02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:27.190
<v Speaker 5>former high school students.</v>

4653
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:27.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4654
02:01:27.850 --> 02:01:28.690
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking insane.</v>

4655
02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:30.940
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the solution to that is.</v>

4656
02:01:30.941 --> 02:01:31.774
<v Speaker 5>Honestly,</v>

4657
02:01:32.230 --> 02:01:33.640
<v Speaker 5>I do not know what the solution is.</v>

4658
02:01:34.090 --> 02:01:34.301
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4659
02:01:34.301 --> 02:01:36.640
<v Speaker 5>the NRA thinks it's having guns everywhere.</v>

4660
02:01:36.850 --> 02:01:38.020
<v Speaker 5>The anti second amendment.</v>

4661
02:01:38.021 --> 02:01:39.920
<v Speaker 5>People think it's getting all guns away.</v>

4662
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:40.820
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4663
02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:42.200
<v Speaker 5>but you're not going to get all the guns away.</v>

4664
02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:43.213
<v Speaker 5>The thing about life,</v>

4665
02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:44.480
<v Speaker 5>people say guns don't kill people.</v>

4666
02:01:44.481 --> 02:01:45.500
<v Speaker 5>People kill people.</v>

4667
02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:46.101
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

4668
02:01:46.101 --> 02:01:46.281
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4669
02:01:46.281 --> 02:01:47.540
<v Speaker 5>People with guns kill people.</v>

4670
02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:51.080
<v Speaker 5>They definitely do hear exactly how much the government would have to spend to</v>

4671
02:01:51.081 --> 02:01:53.510
<v Speaker 5>make public college tuition free.</v>

4672
02:01:53.511 --> 02:01:55.070
<v Speaker 5>How much do you think it is?</v>

4673
02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:55.520
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

4674
02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:56.353
<v Speaker 5>let me guess.</v>

4675
02:01:57.050 --> 02:01:58.040
<v Speaker 5>1 trillion a year.</v>

4676
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:59.361
<v Speaker 5>Wait way,</v>

4677
02:01:59.361 --> 02:02:00.194
<v Speaker 5>way less.</v>

4678
02:02:00.290 --> 02:02:00.921
<v Speaker 5>Way less.</v>

4679
02:02:00.921 --> 02:02:01.191
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4680
02:02:01.191 --> 02:02:03.530
<v Speaker 5>I would say orange,</v>

4681
02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:04.373
<v Speaker 5>this article.</v>

4682
02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:04.641
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4683
02:02:04.641 --> 02:02:05.970
<v Speaker 5>What does it say about it?</v>

4684
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.740
<v Speaker 5>But what is,</v>

4685
02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:07.820
<v Speaker 5>what is the website?</v>

4686
02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:09.320
<v Speaker 5>The Atlantic Atlantic.</v>

4687
02:02:09.530 --> 02:02:09.801
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4688
02:02:09.801 --> 02:02:11.140
<v Speaker 5>That's a left leaning website,</v>

4689
02:02:11.190 --> 02:02:12.570
<v Speaker 5>but it cannot ridiculous.</v>

4690
02:02:12.571 --> 02:02:12.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4691
02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:13.620
<v Speaker 6>Dated this,</v>

4692
02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:18.620
<v Speaker 6>the article says 62 point $6 billion a mere 62 but there's updates on the bottom</v>

4693
02:02:20.171 --> 02:02:20.921
<v Speaker 6>of the article that said,</v>

4694
02:02:20.921 --> 02:02:24.760
<v Speaker 6>that's some readers say that's an addition to what they already spend.</v>

4695
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:26.260
<v Speaker 6>So that makes it maybe double,</v>

4696
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.791
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4697
02:02:26.791 --> 02:02:27.624
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4698
02:02:27.690 --> 02:02:29.880
<v Speaker 5>one way they make it really fucking cheap,</v>

4699
02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:32.820
<v Speaker 5>have it available for free online.</v>

4700
02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:36.000
<v Speaker 5>Everybody should be able to get an education online.</v>

4701
02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:39.240
<v Speaker 5>That's what I really firmly believe that I think they should have courses that</v>

4702
02:02:39.241 --> 02:02:42.420
<v Speaker 5>you could just sign up and take them like a regular college course.</v>

4703
02:02:42.421 --> 02:02:44.190
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to be in a physical location anymore.</v>

4704
02:02:44.191 --> 02:02:45.210
<v Speaker 5>That's so retro.</v>

4705
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:47.580
<v Speaker 5>That's so unnecessary.</v>

4706
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:50.820
<v Speaker 5>Get in your car and get the traffic and go to UCLA.</v>

4707
02:02:50.940 --> 02:02:52.200
<v Speaker 5>The only thing good about that,</v>

4708
02:02:52.201 --> 02:02:55.230
<v Speaker 5>as you're in the room with someone like a Jordan Peterson or some really good</v>

4709
02:02:55.231 --> 02:02:57.920
<v Speaker 5>professor that's really inspirational and you're in there with him,</v>

4710
02:02:57.930 --> 02:02:59.280
<v Speaker 5>they talked to you and you're like,</v>

4711
02:02:59.310 --> 02:02:59.691
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4712
02:02:59.691 --> 02:03:00.031
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

4713
02:03:00.031 --> 02:03:02.550
<v Speaker 5>And you get to like be in their presence and see like,</v>

4714
02:03:02.580 --> 02:03:02.731
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4715
02:03:02.731 --> 02:03:05.730
<v Speaker 5>this guy was probably like my age one day and he figured all this shit down and</v>

4716
02:03:05.731 --> 02:03:05.941
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4717
02:03:05.941 --> 02:03:06.640
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4718
02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:07.980
<v Speaker 5>maybe some extra juice to that</v>

4719
02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:09.320
<v Speaker 6>to have a bookmark saved.</v>

4720
02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:10.610
<v Speaker 6>I think it was Harvard.</v>

4721
02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:10.900
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4722
02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:15.830
<v Speaker 6>it was a long list of us recorded lectures that were from any class.</v>

4723
02:03:15.831 --> 02:03:18.320
<v Speaker 6>I think there's probably was a limit to what they were doing.</v>

4724
02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:20.270
<v Speaker 6>It's definitely not accessible anymore,</v>

4725
02:03:20.271 --> 02:03:21.530
<v Speaker 6>especially for the public.</v>

4726
02:03:21.531 --> 02:03:22.940
<v Speaker 6>But it was fully accessible.</v>

4727
02:03:23.150 --> 02:03:23.901
<v Speaker 6>Anybody that wanted,</v>

4728
02:03:23.901 --> 02:03:24.734
<v Speaker 6>that's why I had it saved.</v>

4729
02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:25.280
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

4730
02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:26.110
<v Speaker 5>Oh no Joe.</v>

4731
02:03:26.110 --> 02:03:27.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean when I think about that,</v>

4732
02:03:27.321 --> 02:03:28.250
<v Speaker 5>like I said earlier,</v>

4733
02:03:28.251 --> 02:03:30.290
<v Speaker 5>like all these formulas fit into different things.</v>

4734
02:03:30.890 --> 02:03:34.250
<v Speaker 5>You say that and it's like you can be at home while you're looking in her mind,</v>

4735
02:03:34.251 --> 02:03:38.870
<v Speaker 5>his screen and I'm learning versus being in the same room.</v>

4736
02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:40.010
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

4737
02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:40.640
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4738
02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:44.840
<v Speaker 5>but like you could also go to a strip club and watch strippers dance or he can</v>

4739
02:03:44.841 --> 02:03:48.390
<v Speaker 5>be at home watching them porn and when you're at home watching him,</v>

4740
02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:49.191
<v Speaker 5>you're going to pull it out.</v>

4741
02:03:49.191 --> 02:03:49.850
<v Speaker 5>Rip One.</v>

4742
02:03:49.850 --> 02:03:50.600
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

4743
02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:51.380
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

4744
02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:52.213
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4745
02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:53.720
<v Speaker 5>So you're saying,</v>

4746
02:03:53.721 --> 02:03:54.171
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

4747
02:03:54.171 --> 02:03:54.620
<v Speaker 5>and he's like,</v>

4748
02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:55.453
<v Speaker 5>if you're at home,</v>

4749
02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:56.623
<v Speaker 5>you're just going to beat off.</v>

4750
02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:01.170
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

4751
02:04:01.170 --> 02:04:02.150
<v Speaker 5>that's a real problem.</v>

4752
02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:02.821
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

4753
02:04:02.821 --> 02:04:03.200
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4754
02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:05.090
<v Speaker 5>Louis C K was saying once that,</v>

4755
02:04:05.210 --> 02:04:05.660
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4756
02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:07.790
<v Speaker 5>he has a computer that he writes on.</v>

4757
02:04:07.791 --> 02:04:11.210
<v Speaker 5>It's not connected to the Internet because you just can't get distracted,</v>

4758
02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:12.230
<v Speaker 5>forced himself to,</v>

4759
02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:14.180
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what I'm saying.</v>

4760
02:04:14.181 --> 02:04:16.100
<v Speaker 5>The problem is the distraction with having,</v>

4761
02:04:16.101 --> 02:04:18.260
<v Speaker 5>having access to everything right there.</v>

4762
02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:18.850
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

4763
02:04:18.850 --> 02:04:19.480
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4764
02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:21.190
<v Speaker 5>but when you open the window with the teacher,</v>

4765
02:04:21.380 --> 02:04:21.801
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

4766
02:04:21.801 --> 02:04:22.634
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

4767
02:04:22.730 --> 02:04:23.850
<v Speaker 5>that's the process part.</v>

4768
02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:24.651
<v Speaker 5>It's discipline,</v>

4769
02:04:24.651 --> 02:04:25.431
<v Speaker 5>it's discipline.</v>

4770
02:04:25.431 --> 02:04:25.901
<v Speaker 5>And that,</v>

4771
02:04:25.901 --> 02:04:27.230
<v Speaker 5>that goes back to what I believe.</v>

4772
02:04:27.231 --> 02:04:30.290
<v Speaker 5>That ties back into what I was saying before about all this entertainment out</v>

4773
02:04:30.291 --> 02:04:30.441
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

4774
02:04:30.441 --> 02:04:31.020
<v Speaker 5>Everybody,</v>

4775
02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:31.400
<v Speaker 5>everybody's,</v>

4776
02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:33.110
<v Speaker 5>it is always like scratching at you.</v>

4777
02:04:33.111 --> 02:04:33.321
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

4778
02:04:33.321 --> 02:04:33.921
<v Speaker 5>hey day,</v>

4779
02:04:33.921 --> 02:04:34.731
<v Speaker 5>pay attention to me.</v>

4780
02:04:34.731 --> 02:04:35.630
<v Speaker 5>Give me something to do.</v>

4781
02:04:36.350 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 5>So this was some online</v>

4782
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:39.810
<v Speaker 3>learning.harvard.edu.</v>

4783
02:04:40.050 --> 02:04:43.350
<v Speaker 3>So they allow you to study the pyramids of Giza,</v>

4784
02:04:43.410 --> 02:04:45.150
<v Speaker 3>ancient Egyptian art and archeology.</v>

4785
02:04:45.151 --> 02:04:45.790
<v Speaker 3>And it's free.</v>

4786
02:04:45.790 --> 02:04:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4787
02:04:45.890 --> 02:04:47.000
<v Speaker 3>this is a whole course on it for,</v>

4788
02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:47.701
<v Speaker 3>so that's nice.</v>

4789
02:04:47.701 --> 02:04:48.534
<v Speaker 3>It's a bunch of them.</v>

4790
02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:50.790
<v Speaker 3>How many courses do they have that available for free?</v>

4791
02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:51.451
<v Speaker 3>Tons.</v>

4792
02:04:51.451 --> 02:04:54.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that that's one that looked interesting to excellence.</v>

4793
02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:55.410
<v Speaker 3>They have a methadone.</v>

4794
02:04:55.411 --> 02:04:56.244
<v Speaker 3>Oh medicine.</v>

4795
02:04:58.380 --> 02:04:58.801
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4796
02:04:58.801 --> 02:04:59.730
<v Speaker 3>what are you giving people?</v>

4797
02:04:59.870 --> 02:05:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Get Methadone on what courses you could take.</v>

4798
02:05:02.370 --> 02:05:03.061
<v Speaker 3>Oh that's nice.</v>

4799
02:05:03.061 --> 02:05:03.420
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>

4800
02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:04.380
<v Speaker 3>Then you'll get credentialed.</v>

4801
02:05:04.410 --> 02:05:06.210
<v Speaker 3>So if somebody wants you to have a job for it,</v>

4802
02:05:06.211 --> 02:05:08.700
<v Speaker 3>you can't show them like I took this frequency and passed it.</v>

4803
02:05:08.701 --> 02:05:13.500
<v Speaker 3>But that seems to be less and less of a factor in in the future.</v>

4804
02:05:13.530 --> 02:05:17.640
<v Speaker 3>I think having a degree is going to mean less than it means now.</v>

4805
02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:19.800
<v Speaker 3>I think so I feel like um,</v>

4806
02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:21.920
<v Speaker 3>with the Internet,</v>

4807
02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:23.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah you can't,</v>

4808
02:05:23.221 --> 02:05:25.050
<v Speaker 3>if you have the right guidance,</v>

4809
02:05:25.051 --> 02:05:26.620
<v Speaker 3>you got the syllabus from,</v>

4810
02:05:26.630 --> 02:05:26.970
<v Speaker 3>from a,</v>

4811
02:05:26.970 --> 02:05:31.970
<v Speaker 3>from a college course and you have the Internet without getting the paper that</v>

4812
02:05:32.461 --> 02:05:33.061
<v Speaker 3>says you,</v>

4813
02:05:33.061 --> 02:05:34.050
<v Speaker 3>you done it.</v>

4814
02:05:34.350 --> 02:05:38.100
<v Speaker 3>You can literally learn which you would learn in a classroom.</v>

4815
02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:39.900
<v Speaker 3>It's like a test for the job.</v>

4816
02:05:39.901 --> 02:05:43.650
<v Speaker 3>You do like say if you're a car stereo installation person,</v>

4817
02:05:43.770 --> 02:05:48.000
<v Speaker 3>you should have a real deep knowledge of the electrical systems in an automobile</v>

4818
02:05:48.001 --> 02:05:51.990
<v Speaker 3>and what electronics sync up with that and how it works well and what makes them</v>

4819
02:05:51.991 --> 02:05:52.441
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

4820
02:05:52.441 --> 02:05:53.850
<v Speaker 3>And how does a radar detector work?</v>

4821
02:05:54.030 --> 02:05:55.500
<v Speaker 3>How does this CD player work?</v>

4822
02:05:55.501 --> 02:05:56.550
<v Speaker 3>How does you,</v>

4823
02:05:56.551 --> 02:05:59.760
<v Speaker 3>should we have to take a test based on whatever the job it is you're interested</v>

4824
02:05:59.761 --> 02:06:00.510
<v Speaker 3>in?</v>

4825
02:06:00.510 --> 02:06:00.781
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4826
02:06:00.781 --> 02:06:02.010
<v Speaker 3>and if you want to be a doctor,</v>

4827
02:06:02.011 --> 02:06:04.050
<v Speaker 3>obviously we're talking about different ball of wax,</v>

4828
02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:04.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4829
02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:06.630
<v Speaker 3>then you should have a full understanding of humans.</v>

4830
02:06:06.631 --> 02:06:09.030
<v Speaker 3>You're cutting people open and drain their shins and shit.</v>

4831
02:06:09.530 --> 02:06:10.363
<v Speaker 3>He should,</v>

4832
02:06:11.060 --> 02:06:11.760
<v Speaker 3>he should,</v>

4833
02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:15.120
<v Speaker 3>he should have a real deep understanding of the human body.</v>

4834
02:06:15.121 --> 02:06:17.280
<v Speaker 3>But like how does it do you any good?</v>

4835
02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:20.430
<v Speaker 3>If you want to be a mechanic or if you want to be,</v>

4836
02:06:20.431 --> 02:06:21.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4837
02:06:21.180 --> 02:06:22.830
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck you do for a living,</v>

4838
02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:24.990
<v Speaker 3>there should be a way where you could,</v>

4839
02:06:25.110 --> 02:06:26.820
<v Speaker 3>like if you're an advertising executive,</v>

4840
02:06:27.150 --> 02:06:30.270
<v Speaker 3>you should take a test to find out how much you know about the advertising</v>

4841
02:06:30.271 --> 02:06:34.530
<v Speaker 3>business and there's a lot of shit that you don't need to know that you went</v>

4842
02:06:34.531 --> 02:06:36.120
<v Speaker 3>school for their degree.</v>

4843
02:06:36.121 --> 02:06:36.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4844
02:06:36.331 --> 02:06:36.541
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

4845
02:06:36.541 --> 02:06:38.520
<v Speaker 3>there's some weird things that go along with that though.</v>

4846
02:06:38.521 --> 02:06:39.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4847
02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:39.873
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4848
02:06:40.140 --> 02:06:42.250
<v Speaker 3>you have all these things that you have to,</v>

4849
02:06:42.330 --> 02:06:44.640
<v Speaker 3>to take these courses to graduate.</v>

4850
02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:46.500
<v Speaker 3>Just getting general education.</v>

4851
02:06:46.530 --> 02:06:46.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4852
02:06:46.771 --> 02:06:48.060
<v Speaker 3>You have to get a general education,</v>

4853
02:06:48.061 --> 02:06:48.721
<v Speaker 3>which is a good thing,</v>

4854
02:06:48.721 --> 02:06:48.961
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4855
02:06:48.961 --> 02:06:51.270
<v Speaker 3>You want people to understand what understand the world,</v>

4856
02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:51.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4857
02:06:51.930 --> 02:06:52.201
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

4858
02:06:52.201 --> 02:06:53.034
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4859
02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:55.770
<v Speaker 3>there are things that are more important and can take that back to high school.</v>

4860
02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:58.980
<v Speaker 3>And we could talk about like everybody knows the Pythagorean theorem in high</v>

4861
02:06:58.981 --> 02:06:59.311
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

4862
02:06:59.311 --> 02:07:00.131
<v Speaker 3>but he can't fit you.</v>

4863
02:07:00.131 --> 02:07:01.730
<v Speaker 3>You can do your taxes and you,</v>

4864
02:07:02.300 --> 02:07:03.210
<v Speaker 3>you start working,</v>

4865
02:07:03.211 --> 02:07:04.770
<v Speaker 3>most people start working at like 16.</v>

4866
02:07:04.771 --> 02:07:08.550
<v Speaker 3>When you start working at Mcdonald's or a gap or something at 1617,</v>

4867
02:07:08.730 --> 02:07:10.470
<v Speaker 3>you're still paying taxes at the end of the year.</v>

4868
02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:11.041
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4869
02:07:11.041 --> 02:07:12.180
<v Speaker 3>So having,</v>

4870
02:07:12.181 --> 02:07:16.320
<v Speaker 3>having had doing that in February and March in school,</v>

4871
02:07:16.350 --> 02:07:17.370
<v Speaker 3>in your math classes,</v>

4872
02:07:17.371 --> 02:07:19.680
<v Speaker 3>how is that not something that happens?</v>

4873
02:07:20.100 --> 02:07:20.910
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4874
02:07:20.910 --> 02:07:21.743
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4875
02:07:22.110 --> 02:07:22.681
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

4876
02:07:22.681 --> 02:07:27.681
<v Speaker 3>it's one of these weird situations where the education is important,</v>

4877
02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:29.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4878
02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:33.600
<v Speaker 3>But let's learn the things that actually apply to life.</v>

4879
02:07:34.170 --> 02:07:36.190
<v Speaker 3>I feel like you should get out of high school</v>

4880
02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:38.920
<v Speaker 2>with a basic understanding of most things.</v>

4881
02:07:38.921 --> 02:07:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4882
02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4883
02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Like general education.</v>

4884
02:07:41.171 --> 02:07:42.160
<v Speaker 2>High school makes sense.</v>

4885
02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4886
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:45.250
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like once you get into college,</v>

4887
02:07:45.490 --> 02:07:47.620
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck you're trying to pursue,</v>

4888
02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:49.840
<v Speaker 2>well it should be very specified,</v>

4889
02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:52.330
<v Speaker 2>very specific to whatever the fuck you're,</v>

4890
02:07:52.331 --> 02:07:52.870
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

4891
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:53.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4892
02:07:53.530 --> 02:07:54.550
<v Speaker 2>your business is,</v>

4893
02:07:54.820 --> 02:07:56.380
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to take gender studies class,</v>

4894
02:07:56.381 --> 02:08:00.760
<v Speaker 2>but also you probably don't necessarily need all the textbook knowledge because</v>

4895
02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:01.361
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>

4896
02:08:01.361 --> 02:08:02.194
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4897
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4898
02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:07.680
<v Speaker 2>there especially there's certain jobs that actual experience matters more than</v>

4899
02:08:08.201 --> 02:08:09.070
<v Speaker 2>the textbook knowledge.</v>

4900
02:08:09.071 --> 02:08:09.190
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

4901
02:08:09.190 --> 02:08:10.023
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4902
02:08:10.410 --> 02:08:10.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4903
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:12.700
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't tell you exactly which ones.</v>

4904
02:08:12.730 --> 02:08:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4905
02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:15.730
<v Speaker 2>how about with Jamie does is a problem with Jackson job.</v>

4906
02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:18.430
<v Speaker 2>He went to school to be an audio engineer,</v>

4907
02:08:18.431 --> 02:08:21.010
<v Speaker 2>but all that shit that you use back then,</v>

4908
02:08:21.330 --> 02:08:22.510
<v Speaker 2>but that shit's all useless.</v>

4909
02:08:22.511 --> 02:08:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4910
02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:23.800
<v Speaker 2>How much of is useless?</v>

4911
02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:27.890
<v Speaker 6>I mean the hardest test I think I took was after we were all done was a for a</v>

4912
02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:28.331
<v Speaker 6>pro tool.</v>

4913
02:08:28.331 --> 02:08:31.540
<v Speaker 6>It's basically for a computer program to get certified that you know,</v>

4914
02:08:31.541 --> 02:08:32.680
<v Speaker 6>this program very well.</v>

4915
02:08:32.681 --> 02:08:33.460
<v Speaker 6>Like what's almost most,</v>

4916
02:08:33.460 --> 02:08:36.790
<v Speaker 6>you were explaining that program is like version six of the program.</v>

4917
02:08:36.791 --> 02:08:38.470
<v Speaker 6>It was back then.</v>

4918
02:08:38.471 --> 02:08:40.570
<v Speaker 6>I think they're updating it maybe once every two years.</v>

4919
02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:43.150
<v Speaker 6>It's been updated like four times this year probably.</v>

4920
02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:44.860
<v Speaker 6>And they're on level like 11 now.</v>

4921
02:08:44.861 --> 02:08:47.060
<v Speaker 6>So it's like completely useless that I know all of that.</v>

4922
02:08:47.290 --> 02:08:47.991
<v Speaker 6>They've updated all,</v>

4923
02:08:47.991 --> 02:08:50.920
<v Speaker 6>all of the limits are completely like unlimited things now.</v>

4924
02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:52.800
<v Speaker 6>So it doesn't even matter that you know all that.</v>

4925
02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:56.510
<v Speaker 2>So someone getting out of school with just the education that you got in school</v>

4926
02:08:56.511 --> 02:08:57.890
<v Speaker 2>literally can't do it today.</v>

4927
02:08:58.200 --> 02:08:59.580
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to go back and do it again.</v>

4928
02:08:59.581 --> 02:08:59.940
<v Speaker 6>Sort of.</v>

4929
02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:00.990
<v Speaker 6>They offer that at the school.</v>

4930
02:09:00.991 --> 02:09:02.330
<v Speaker 6>Like you can go back and um,</v>

4931
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:03.330
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4932
02:09:03.330 --> 02:09:03.960
<v Speaker 6>refresher,</v>

4933
02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:04.171
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4934
02:09:04.171 --> 02:09:04.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4935
02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:04.921
<v Speaker 6>For free.</v>

4936
02:09:04.921 --> 02:09:08.430
<v Speaker 6>That's part of the benefit of going to this school I would say,</v>

4937
02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:12.390
<v Speaker 6>but like to have the time and the ability to go back to Florida and stay there</v>

4938
02:09:12.391 --> 02:09:12.901
<v Speaker 6>for a month.</v>

4939
02:09:12.901 --> 02:09:14.130
<v Speaker 6>So I could go take that class,</v>

4940
02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:16.530
<v Speaker 6>like can't take a month off of this to do it and like,</v>

4941
02:09:16.531 --> 02:09:19.050
<v Speaker 6>who's going to pay for my apartment down there and here?</v>

4942
02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:20.790
<v Speaker 6>It's a really tough situation.</v>

4943
02:09:20.791 --> 02:09:21.980
<v Speaker 6>You put yourself in this.</v>

4944
02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:23.620
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot with a lot of,</v>

4945
02:09:23.621 --> 02:09:24.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4946
02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:25.840
<v Speaker 2>anything that has to do with technology,</v>

4947
02:09:25.841 --> 02:09:26.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4948
02:09:26.170 --> 02:09:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Where it's constantly moving,</v>

4949
02:09:27.790 --> 02:09:28.630
<v Speaker 2>changing and,</v>

4950
02:09:28.700 --> 02:09:30.250
<v Speaker 2>and thing about technology.</v>

4951
02:09:30.251 --> 02:09:32.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like if there's some savant in that,</v>

4952
02:09:32.711 --> 02:09:33.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4953
02:09:33.041 --> 02:09:33.611
<v Speaker 2>Pete there,</v>

4954
02:09:33.611 --> 02:09:37.390
<v Speaker 2>these kids and these people that pick up on technology and they understand it so</v>

4955
02:09:37.391 --> 02:09:42.070
<v Speaker 2>well and they have no formal education with no real format education.</v>

4956
02:09:42.071 --> 02:09:42.251
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4957
02:09:42.251 --> 02:09:44.620
<v Speaker 2>The technology's one of those things that I especially,</v>

4958
02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:48.550
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's the most apparent thing where you don't have to go to school,</v>

4959
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:52.960
<v Speaker 2>you have to have the experience and you have to be engrossed in whatever the</v>

4960
02:09:52.961 --> 02:09:53.531
<v Speaker 2>subject is.</v>

4961
02:09:53.531 --> 02:09:54.364
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4962
02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4963
02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:55.900
<v Speaker 2>But then again,</v>

4964
02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:57.820
<v Speaker 2>it comes back to what we're talking about with discipline.</v>

4965
02:09:57.821 --> 02:10:01.720
<v Speaker 2>Like how much time do you want to spend to work on things and look that's</v>

4966
02:10:01.721 --> 02:10:03.160
<v Speaker 2>applicable to finding like you,</v>

4967
02:10:03.161 --> 02:10:08.161
<v Speaker 2>you knew so many people in the gym that just did not put the time into drilling</v>

4968
02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:13.030
<v Speaker 2>techniques and learning them and really getting a fully comprehensive</v>

4969
02:10:13.031 --> 02:10:15.400
<v Speaker 2>understanding of why you're supposed to do something a certain way.</v>

4970
02:10:15.790 --> 02:10:17.580
<v Speaker 2>And they just kind of like listened a little bit,</v>

4971
02:10:17.590 --> 02:10:21.280
<v Speaker 2>worked out kind of hard and maybe they had a little bit of athletic talent and</v>

4972
02:10:21.281 --> 02:10:22.390
<v Speaker 2>then they would come back in.</v>

4973
02:10:22.391 --> 02:10:27.220
<v Speaker 2>But the guys who would stay and drill and think and learn and take notes,</v>

4974
02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:29.200
<v Speaker 2>those guys always moved past.</v>

4975
02:10:29.410 --> 02:10:29.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4976
02:10:29.710 --> 02:10:30.790
<v Speaker 2>They always moved further.</v>

4977
02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 2>And it also the guys that we're willing</v>

4978
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.210
<v Speaker 5>to do what was uncomfortable going to do,</v>

4979
02:10:36.211 --> 02:10:37.580
<v Speaker 5>the things that they're not good at.</v>

4980
02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:38.210
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

4981
02:10:38.210 --> 02:10:39.043
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4982
02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:40.363
<v Speaker 5>I didn't,</v>

4983
02:10:40.370 --> 02:10:41.120
<v Speaker 5>I didn't like it.</v>

4984
02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:41.390
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4985
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.901
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>

4986
02:10:41.901 --> 02:10:42.591
<v Speaker 5>I don't like getting hit.</v>

4987
02:10:42.591 --> 02:10:43.610
<v Speaker 5>I didn't like getting hit.</v>

4988
02:10:43.670 --> 02:10:44.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4989
02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:45.620
<v Speaker 5>I accept that as a part of the job,</v>

4990
02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:48.800
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't like it when I first started training.</v>

4991
02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:51.140
<v Speaker 5>I probably feel like my first 10,</v>

4992
02:10:51.141 --> 02:10:51.980
<v Speaker 5>15 fights,</v>

4993
02:10:52.370 --> 02:10:56.720
<v Speaker 5>I was like showing up late to practice because boxing was first.</v>

4994
02:10:57.230 --> 02:10:58.220
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want a spa.</v>

4995
02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:00.760
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to get hit like I,</v>

4996
02:11:01.190 --> 02:11:02.720
<v Speaker 5>and so I was like,</v>

4997
02:11:02.721 --> 02:11:02.931
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4998
02:11:02.931 --> 02:11:03.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't like getting hit.</v>

4999
02:11:03.890 --> 02:11:04.970
<v Speaker 5>I got to avoid getting hit,</v>

5000
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.930
<v Speaker 5>but I gotta be,</v>

5001
02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:09.170
<v Speaker 5>I gotta have studying things coming in and meet us to learn how to avoid that.</v>

5002
02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:10.160
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

5003
02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:11.630
<v Speaker 5>So I would,</v>

5004
02:11:11.631 --> 02:11:12.050
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

5005
02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:13.160
<v Speaker 5>I started showing up on time.</v>

5006
02:11:13.161 --> 02:11:15.470
<v Speaker 5>I started doing more boxing and they started doing more boxing.</v>

5007
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:16.280
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

5008
02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:16.371
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5009
02:11:16.371 --> 02:11:17.204
<v Speaker 5>this is fun.</v>

5010
02:11:17.450 --> 02:11:17.781
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

5011
02:11:17.781 --> 02:11:18.500
<v Speaker 5>I like this.</v>

5012
02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:19.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm enjoying this.</v>

5013
02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:20.540
<v Speaker 5>Same thing with wrestling.</v>

5014
02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:21.740
<v Speaker 5>I know how to sprawl.</v>

5015
02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:23.870
<v Speaker 5>I knew how to shoot a double,</v>

5016
02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:25.010
<v Speaker 5>a basic double,</v>

5017
02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:25.401
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5018
02:11:25.401 --> 02:11:25.581
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

5019
02:11:25.581 --> 02:11:26.780
<v Speaker 5>the 1990s double.</v>

5020
02:11:27.110 --> 02:11:27.351
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

5021
02:11:27.351 --> 02:11:28.070
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5022
02:11:28.070 --> 02:11:29.390
<v Speaker 5>then I started training with Tyron,</v>

5023
02:11:29.460 --> 02:11:33.170
<v Speaker 5>then I started treating with Steve Brown and Dan [inaudible] and Jordan lean and</v>

5024
02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:33.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5025
02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:33.940
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

5026
02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:37.790
<v Speaker 5>these dd one wrestlers and starting to learn all the other aspects of wrestling.</v>

5027
02:11:38.090 --> 02:11:39.950
<v Speaker 5>There was something I did in the fight with stout.</v>

5028
02:11:39.951 --> 02:11:41.460
<v Speaker 5>Where is that ankle breaker?</v>

5029
02:11:41.580 --> 02:11:42.413
<v Speaker 5>I tried to,</v>

5030
02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:42.861
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

5031
02:11:42.861 --> 02:11:44.240
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't actually breaking my ankle.</v>

5032
02:11:44.241 --> 02:11:47.990
<v Speaker 5>It's just the name of the technique where you actually watched the tape and you,</v>

5033
02:11:48.050 --> 02:11:49.220
<v Speaker 5>you call it like a standing,</v>

5034
02:11:49.221 --> 02:11:51.680
<v Speaker 5>he'll hook right where I have his ankle,</v>

5035
02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:52.693
<v Speaker 5>single leg.</v>

5036
02:11:52.730 --> 02:11:54.710
<v Speaker 5>And I tried to trip him and crank his leg down.</v>

5037
02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:55.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5038
02:11:55.310 --> 02:11:57.020
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

5039
02:11:57.021 --> 02:12:01.580
<v Speaker 5>I would've never done that if I hadn't been wrestling with these kids and</v>

5040
02:12:01.581 --> 02:12:02.540
<v Speaker 5>learning these things.</v>

5041
02:12:02.541 --> 02:12:03.320
<v Speaker 5>And there's so much,</v>

5042
02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:06.110
<v Speaker 5>so much about it and it just became a whole lot of fun now.</v>

5043
02:12:06.290 --> 02:12:07.610
<v Speaker 5>Like I used to hate wrestling.</v>

5044
02:12:07.611 --> 02:12:09.620
<v Speaker 5>I used to not want to do it at all now.</v>

5045
02:12:09.621 --> 02:12:12.630
<v Speaker 5>Like it's all kind of like all I want to do you see that with</v>

5046
02:12:12.850 --> 02:12:13.420
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

5047
02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:15.640
<v Speaker 2>You see that with Jujitsu guys getting into striking,</v>

5048
02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:19.500
<v Speaker 2>she would is getting into the ground game wrestlers getting in the striking.</v>

5049
02:12:19.550 --> 02:12:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5050
02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:21.160
<v Speaker 2>They just don't want to do it.</v>

5051
02:12:21.190 --> 02:12:24.340
<v Speaker 2>They just don't and they also particularly don't want to get involved in</v>

5052
02:12:24.341 --> 02:12:25.930
<v Speaker 2>something they're not really good at.</v>

5053
02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:28.150
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're a monster at one thing,</v>

5054
02:12:28.151 --> 02:12:29.500
<v Speaker 2>like if you're a monster on the ground,</v>

5055
02:12:29.860 --> 02:12:31.000
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be a white belt,</v>

5056
02:12:31.001 --> 02:12:32.200
<v Speaker 2>a kid kickboxing.</v>

5057
02:12:32.201 --> 02:12:32.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5058
02:12:32.411 --> 02:12:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Your legs chewed up and get your nose bloodied every time you spar and you,</v>

5059
02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:38.080
<v Speaker 2>you're covering up in the corner and be like,</v>

5060
02:12:38.081 --> 02:12:41.080
<v Speaker 2>I can just grab this guy and making my bitch and you can't even,</v>

5061
02:12:41.230 --> 02:12:42.670
<v Speaker 2>you got to just eat shots.</v>

5062
02:12:42.730 --> 02:12:43.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5063
02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:44.320
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants that.</v>

5064
02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:49.620
<v Speaker 2>He saw that a lot with kickboxers in particular that would go into Jujitsu class</v>

5065
02:12:50.170 --> 02:12:53.140
<v Speaker 2>and just did not like how they would get humbled.</v>

5066
02:12:53.170 --> 02:12:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

5067
02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:56.530
<v Speaker 2>They did not like it at all because they were literally starting from scratch.</v>

5068
02:12:56.531 --> 02:12:59.830
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have a grappling background and you go in there and get some black</v>

5069
02:12:59.831 --> 02:13:00.700
<v Speaker 2>belts and killers,</v>

5070
02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:02.350
<v Speaker 2>they make you feel helpless.</v>

5071
02:13:02.370 --> 02:13:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5072
02:13:02.650 --> 02:13:03.700
<v Speaker 2>They make you feel like you,</v>

5073
02:13:03.701 --> 02:13:04.111
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

5074
02:13:04.111 --> 02:13:06.160
<v Speaker 2>you are not safe ever.</v>

5075
02:13:06.250 --> 02:13:08.110
<v Speaker 2>All they have to do is grab you and it's over.</v>

5076
02:13:08.350 --> 02:13:10.180
<v Speaker 2>You're 100% getting choked.</v>

5077
02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:12.610
<v Speaker 2>That's too fucked up for some people.</v>

5078
02:13:12.611 --> 02:13:13.810
<v Speaker 2>They can't handle that shit.</v>

5079
02:13:14.380 --> 02:13:15.213
<v Speaker 2>They feel like,</v>

5080
02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.840
<v Speaker 2>and then that's the case also with like a slow plodding grappler that fights</v>

5081
02:13:19.841 --> 02:13:22.930
<v Speaker 2>like a dynamic striker and then you have to stand up like whoa.</v>

5082
02:13:23.170 --> 02:13:27.130
<v Speaker 2>And you get leg kicked it down by Edson Barboza fuck all that.</v>

5083
02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

5084
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 2>I've been leg kicked</v>

5085
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:32.873
<v Speaker 3>to death,</v>

5086
02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:39.030
<v Speaker 3>but I've taken two or three from Tiago in a practice when I first started</v>

5087
02:13:39.031 --> 02:13:41.040
<v Speaker 3>training in American top team and I was like,</v>

5088
02:13:41.090 --> 02:13:41.380
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5089
02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:43.530
<v Speaker 3>I feel good about checking kicks in.</v>

5090
02:13:43.610 --> 02:13:44.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm comfortable there.</v>

5091
02:13:44.551 --> 02:13:45.540
<v Speaker 3>But he landed a couple,</v>

5092
02:13:45.541 --> 02:13:45.811
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

5093
02:13:45.811 --> 02:13:45.931
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5094
02:13:45.931 --> 02:13:46.531
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>

5095
02:13:46.531 --> 02:13:47.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

5096
02:13:47.610 --> 02:13:51.840
<v Speaker 3>so I would work with Tiago a lot and I feel comfortable now checking kicks.</v>

5097
02:13:51.841 --> 02:13:54.090
<v Speaker 3>You might get one might get two off,</v>

5098
02:13:54.150 --> 02:13:54.660
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

5099
02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:55.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to let,</v>

5100
02:13:56.230 --> 02:13:58.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm get letting you do that to me.</v>

5101
02:13:58.021 --> 02:13:59.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't want good whipping.</v>

5102
02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:00.351
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5103
02:14:00.351 --> 02:14:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Lung.</v>

5104
02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5105
02:14:01.110 --> 02:14:02.400
<v Speaker 3>He would whip it in there.</v>

5106
02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:03.293
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5107
02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:04.110
<v Speaker 3>like his,</v>

5108
02:14:04.110 --> 02:14:07.230
<v Speaker 3>his kick was like super textbook man when he,</v>

5109
02:14:07.231 --> 02:14:08.670
<v Speaker 3>especially when he was in his prime,</v>

5110
02:14:09.150 --> 02:14:11.010
<v Speaker 3>he would throw that jab one.</v>

5111
02:14:11.130 --> 02:14:12.390
<v Speaker 3>He was either just throw a one,</v>

5112
02:14:12.391 --> 02:14:16.370
<v Speaker 3>two or a jab and then just slammed that right leg in there.</v>

5113
02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:18.090
<v Speaker 3>He's hopping into it.</v>

5114
02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:18.990
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

5115
02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:22.770
<v Speaker 3>Like that's how I feel like as in my boss is like the 2.0 with Tiago ovens,</v>

5116
02:14:22.771 --> 02:14:23.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5117
02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:24.480
<v Speaker 3>he's a little faster.</v>

5118
02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:24.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5119
02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:25.950
<v Speaker 3>It's in stunning.</v>

5120
02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:30.330
<v Speaker 3>Like especially that switch kick he throws that switch kick and you're like,</v>

5121
02:14:30.331 --> 02:14:31.164
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

5122
02:14:31.590 --> 02:14:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5123
02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:36.180
<v Speaker 3>his left leg switch Gig is probably the fastest kick I've ever seen anybody</v>

5124
02:14:36.181 --> 02:14:37.800
<v Speaker 3>throw from that stance.</v>

5125
02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:39.960
<v Speaker 3>I love to see like something lined up where you,</v>

5126
02:14:39.961 --> 02:14:42.480
<v Speaker 3>you time like in a regular person,</v>

5127
02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:43.393
<v Speaker 3>a south paws,</v>

5128
02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:44.200
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

5129
02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:45.030
<v Speaker 3>Kick,</v>

5130
02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:46.490
<v Speaker 3>left kick and you,</v>

5131
02:14:46.491 --> 02:14:48.900
<v Speaker 3>you time his switch kick to that.</v>

5132
02:14:49.260 --> 02:14:51.990
<v Speaker 3>We'll also put his up against somebody else's switch kick.</v>

5133
02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:55.600
<v Speaker 3>He's got like a [inaudible] world championship caliber switched care.</v>

5134
02:14:55.630 --> 02:14:55.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5135
02:14:55.950 --> 02:14:58.230
<v Speaker 3>Like you see like a real high level Thai boxer.</v>

5136
02:14:58.231 --> 02:14:59.820
<v Speaker 3>They've got that same kind of speed to it.</v>

5137
02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:01.110
<v Speaker 3>You watch it and you're like,</v>

5138
02:15:01.170 --> 02:15:03.600
<v Speaker 3>there's no comparison in the octagon.</v>

5139
02:15:03.630 --> 02:15:04.690
<v Speaker 3>You're not countering that.</v>

5140
02:15:04.710 --> 02:15:04.980
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

5141
02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:07.060
<v Speaker 3>you'd be lucky to react to react in time.</v>

5142
02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:08.280
<v Speaker 3>You just taking it,</v>

5143
02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:11.100
<v Speaker 3>just taking it real quick.</v>

5144
02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:12.360
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

5145
02:15:12.361 --> 02:15:14.850
<v Speaker 3>we go back to that normal Grumet I'll fight as good as he was.</v>

5146
02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:15.930
<v Speaker 3>He got fucking mauled.</v>

5147
02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:16.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5148
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.840
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

5149
02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:20.490
<v Speaker 3>that's what's really crazy because he didn't get mauled in the Ferguson fight.</v>

5150
02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:21.750
<v Speaker 3>It was a good fight.</v>

5151
02:15:22.050 --> 02:15:22.741
<v Speaker 3>It was a good fight.</v>

5152
02:15:22.741 --> 02:15:23.640
<v Speaker 3>Ferguson was winning.</v>

5153
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:27.250
<v Speaker 3>It was a good fight until Tony caught him with the doors and sunk that choke</v>

5154
02:15:27.251 --> 02:15:27.960
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

5155
02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:28.441
<v Speaker 3>But then again,</v>

5156
02:15:28.441 --> 02:15:29.640
<v Speaker 3>that's a few years too.</v>

5157
02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:30.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5158
02:15:30.630 --> 02:15:30.991
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

5159
02:15:30.991 --> 02:15:31.830
<v Speaker 3>It saves them Barboza.</v>

5160
02:15:31.831 --> 02:15:32.101
<v Speaker 3>It might be,</v>

5161
02:15:32.101 --> 02:15:32.934
<v Speaker 3>they better,</v>

5162
02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:34.770
<v Speaker 3>everybody should be bad.</v>

5163
02:15:34.771 --> 02:15:36.660
<v Speaker 3>All three of those guys should be getting it better at this point.</v>

5164
02:15:36.661 --> 02:15:37.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5165
02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:38.133
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5166
02:15:38.220 --> 02:15:39.053
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5167
02:15:39.450 --> 02:15:39.841
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

5168
02:15:39.841 --> 02:15:40.051
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

5169
02:15:40.051 --> 02:15:40.884
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

5170
02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:42.091
<v Speaker 3>it's dangerous.</v>

5171
02:15:42.091 --> 02:15:42.181
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

5172
02:15:42.181 --> 02:15:42.401
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

5173
02:15:42.401 --> 02:15:43.440
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see,</v>

5174
02:15:44.010 --> 02:15:44.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5175
02:15:44.350 --> 02:15:44.930
<v Speaker 3>Barbosa,</v>

5176
02:15:44.930 --> 02:15:46.740
<v Speaker 3>he's shown improvement after that.</v>

5177
02:15:46.741 --> 02:15:48.240
<v Speaker 3>After every loss that he had,</v>

5178
02:15:48.241 --> 02:15:50.040
<v Speaker 3>he showed improvement after the Tony loss,</v>

5179
02:15:50.041 --> 02:15:50.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5180
02:15:50.580 --> 02:15:52.320
<v Speaker 3>so this fight with Kevin Lee,</v>

5181
02:15:52.830 --> 02:15:53.640
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>

5182
02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:55.860
<v Speaker 3>that's right into the fucking hot of things too.</v>

5183
02:15:56.370 --> 02:15:58.700
<v Speaker 3>Like right out of the frying pan into the fire.</v>

5184
02:15:58.701 --> 02:16:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Like for both guys though.</v>

5185
02:16:00.420 --> 02:16:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>

5186
02:16:00.970 --> 02:16:01.711
<v Speaker 3>For those guys.</v>

5187
02:16:01.711 --> 02:16:02.001
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5188
02:16:02.001 --> 02:16:02.834
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda crazy.</v>

5189
02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:04.320
<v Speaker 3>Kinda crazy.</v>

5190
02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Lee might get beat up in that one.</v>

5191
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:06.421
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

5192
02:16:06.421 --> 02:16:08.000
<v Speaker 3>man might get wheeled care act.</v>

5193
02:16:08.060 --> 02:16:08.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5194
02:16:08.450 --> 02:16:08.760
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5195
02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:10.620
<v Speaker 3>he might get Terry Adams remember that fine.</v>

5196
02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

5197
02:16:11.060 --> 02:16:11.710
<v Speaker 3>And the crazy,</v>

5198
02:16:11.710 --> 02:16:14.610
<v Speaker 3>that was the first time a wheel kick ever landed in a UFC fight.</v>

5199
02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:15.860
<v Speaker 3>First Wheel Cafe,</v>

5200
02:16:15.861 --> 02:16:16.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5201
02:16:16.650 --> 02:16:17.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5202
02:16:17.190 --> 02:16:20.010
<v Speaker 3>I think Seth Petra Zellie landed a wheel kick,</v>

5203
02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:21.900
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't knock anybody out with it.</v>

5204
02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:23.820
<v Speaker 3>You need someone with that kind of speed though.</v>

5205
02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:25.273
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>

5206
02:16:25.580 --> 02:16:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Because the game has changed,</v>

5207
02:16:27.150 --> 02:16:27.811
<v Speaker 3>but then you know,</v>

5208
02:16:27.811 --> 02:16:29.190
<v Speaker 3>Vituro landed on rock.</v>

5209
02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:31.060
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of people have landed wheel kick since then.</v>

5210
02:16:31.100 --> 02:16:31.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5211
02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:34.240
<v Speaker 3>But that one wheel kick was so crazy.</v>

5212
02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:35.920
<v Speaker 3>It was so perfect.</v>

5213
02:16:35.930 --> 02:16:40.120
<v Speaker 3>Atlanta ride on the jaw and just shut the lights out and he went down like a</v>

5214
02:16:40.121 --> 02:16:40.780
<v Speaker 3>tree.</v>

5215
02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:41.081
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5216
02:16:41.081 --> 02:16:42.460
<v Speaker 3>he was out going down.</v>

5217
02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:42.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5218
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:43.750
<v Speaker 3>That was in Brazil.</v>

5219
02:16:45.250 --> 02:16:45.560
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>

5220
02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:47.320
<v Speaker 3>but both is a fun guy to watch.</v>

5221
02:16:47.321 --> 02:16:47.591
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

5222
02:16:47.591 --> 02:16:47.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

5223
02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:50.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited to be on the desk for that one.</v>

5224
02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:51.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5225
02:16:51.260 --> 02:16:51.851
<v Speaker 3>it's a good fight.</v>

5226
02:16:51.851 --> 02:16:53.080
<v Speaker 3>Especially those two fights.</v>

5227
02:16:53.140 --> 02:16:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5228
02:16:53.710 --> 02:16:54.280
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

5229
02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:56.140
<v Speaker 3>I love watching cub and Frankie fight.</v>

5230
02:16:56.170 --> 02:16:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Like I still feel the same way about,</v>

5231
02:16:58.300 --> 02:16:59.133
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

5232
02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:01.150
<v Speaker 3>I think I would love to see that later.</v>

5233
02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:02.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm not necessarily giving love to see,</v>

5234
02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:08.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm not crazy about the fight in the sense that I've seen it once and it could</v>

5235
02:17:08.141 --> 02:17:09.160
<v Speaker 3>go that way again.</v>

5236
02:17:09.370 --> 02:17:12.270
<v Speaker 3>But I am excited to see the improvements that if,</v>

5237
02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:15.280
<v Speaker 3>if cub is be able to make any adjustments and going into that one.</v>

5238
02:17:15.700 --> 02:17:16.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5239
02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:19.450
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a necessary thing.</v>

5240
02:17:19.451 --> 02:17:20.650
<v Speaker 3>There some fights that I don't,</v>

5241
02:17:20.710 --> 02:17:23.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't like them just for the mathematics of the fight.</v>

5242
02:17:23.471 --> 02:17:24.041
<v Speaker 3>Like God,</v>

5243
02:17:24.041 --> 02:17:26.110
<v Speaker 3>Dustin [inaudible] I love Dustin.</v>

5244
02:17:26.110 --> 02:17:26.943
<v Speaker 3>He's my boy.</v>

5245
02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:27.670
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5246
02:17:27.670 --> 02:17:31.870
<v Speaker 3>But I don't like it because Dustin and addy,</v>

5247
02:17:31.871 --> 02:17:32.990
<v Speaker 3>the fight with Dustin and Eddie,</v>

5248
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:34.270
<v Speaker 3>the fight was going one way.</v>

5249
02:17:34.271 --> 02:17:35.104
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

5250
02:17:36.510 --> 02:17:38.800
<v Speaker 3>was it called a no contest for disqualification.</v>

5251
02:17:39.060 --> 02:17:39.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm like that.</v>

5252
02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with that.</v>

5253
02:17:41.890 --> 02:17:42.970
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm biased,</v>

5254
02:17:42.971 --> 02:17:47.770
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like my argument is strong in that the ref herb came back to the</v>

5255
02:17:47.771 --> 02:17:51.880
<v Speaker 3>locker rooms and he explained to us that we're using the old rules.</v>

5256
02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.920
<v Speaker 3>So if by the old rules,</v>

5257
02:17:53.950 --> 02:17:55.990
<v Speaker 3>all three of those needs were illegal.</v>

5258
02:17:56.350 --> 02:17:56.591
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5259
02:17:56.591 --> 02:17:58.300
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if it was intentional.</v>

5260
02:17:58.301 --> 02:17:59.380
<v Speaker 3>It matters if it's illegal.</v>

5261
02:17:59.410 --> 02:17:59.711
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

5262
02:17:59.711 --> 02:18:00.770
<v Speaker 3>that's the way I understand it.</v>

5263
02:18:00.771 --> 02:18:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5264
02:18:00.970 --> 02:18:01.461
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

5265
02:18:01.461 --> 02:18:02.141
<v Speaker 3>so that's my thing.</v>

5266
02:18:02.141 --> 02:18:04.600
<v Speaker 3>I feel it should be disqualified and she'd be lost.</v>

5267
02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5268
02:18:05.100 --> 02:18:05.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5269
02:18:05.690 --> 02:18:06.250
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5270
02:18:06.250 --> 02:18:06.611
<v Speaker 3>coming.</v>

5271
02:18:06.611 --> 02:18:08.980
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a real good argument.</v>

5272
02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:10.510
<v Speaker 3>So real good argument.</v>

5273
02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:13.240
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think Getty's a dirty fighter.</v>

5274
02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:13.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5275
02:18:13.630 --> 02:18:16.990
<v Speaker 3>but I do think Dustin was winning that fight up until those moments.</v>

5276
02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5277
02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:18.101
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

5278
02:18:18.101 --> 02:18:21.910
<v Speaker 3>He had heard Eddie and it stunned him on several occasions to Eddie came back</v>

5279
02:18:21.911 --> 02:18:22.744
<v Speaker 3>and cracked him.</v>

5280
02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:24.430
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot going on in that fight.</v>

5281
02:18:24.431 --> 02:18:25.180
<v Speaker 3>But those,</v>

5282
02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:28.990
<v Speaker 3>those needs where they're supposed to be a disqualification for something like</v>

5283
02:18:28.991 --> 02:18:29.081
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

5284
02:18:29.081 --> 02:18:29.231
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5285
02:18:29.231 --> 02:18:31.510
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the whole idea is about doing something illegal.</v>

5286
02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:33.670
<v Speaker 3>You do something illegal and the guy gets really hurt from it.</v>

5287
02:18:33.730 --> 02:18:34.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5288
02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:35.410
<v Speaker 3>That's illegal.</v>

5289
02:18:35.411 --> 02:18:36.490
<v Speaker 3>You weren't supposed to do it.</v>

5290
02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:37.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a disqualification.</v>

5291
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:39.100
<v Speaker 3>I think using the heat of the moment,</v>

5292
02:18:39.101 --> 02:18:40.990
<v Speaker 3>you probably didn't even know whether it was legal or not really.</v>

5293
02:18:40.991 --> 02:18:42.130
<v Speaker 3>It was just trying to land knees.</v>

5294
02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:42.581
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5295
02:18:42.581 --> 02:18:47.581
<v Speaker 3>Who knows he's been rocked when you've got to put that into account as well.</v>

5296
02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:49.810
<v Speaker 3>He got hurt real bad in that fight.</v>

5297
02:18:49.811 --> 02:18:50.800
<v Speaker 3>Dustin cracked him.</v>

5298
02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:51.813
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5299
02:18:51.940 --> 02:18:52.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5300
02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:54.730
<v Speaker 3>Like a mathematically,</v>

5301
02:18:54.731 --> 02:18:55.900
<v Speaker 3>would you like to see the rematch?</v>

5302
02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:57.460
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see the rematch.</v>

5303
02:18:57.760 --> 02:18:58.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5304
02:18:58.360 --> 02:18:58.931
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

5305
02:18:58.931 --> 02:18:59.711
<v Speaker 3>I mean Dustin was,</v>

5306
02:18:59.711 --> 02:19:02.800
<v Speaker 3>was lobbying for the rematch also and then on top of that,</v>

5307
02:19:02.980 --> 02:19:07.660
<v Speaker 3>mathematically I feel like it doesn't make sense because Eddie just beat bkg.</v>

5308
02:19:08.140 --> 02:19:08.650
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5309
02:19:08.650 --> 02:19:10.810
<v Speaker 3>So like it's like it's a good point.</v>

5310
02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:15.070
<v Speaker 3>This disqualification happened and this one guy got to step up the ladder.</v>

5311
02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:16.600
<v Speaker 3>But you've now,</v>

5312
02:19:16.630 --> 02:19:17.710
<v Speaker 3>if you want to step up the ladder,</v>

5313
02:19:17.711 --> 02:19:19.000
<v Speaker 3>you have to do exactly what he did.</v>

5314
02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:19.480
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5315
02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:20.230
<v Speaker 3>Those are good point.</v>

5316
02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:20.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5317
02:19:20.860 --> 02:19:21.431
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>

5318
02:19:21.431 --> 02:19:25.510
<v Speaker 3>Well that essentially is solidifying the position as a no contest.</v>

5319
02:19:25.511 --> 02:19:26.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5320
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Cause you're making,</v>

5321
02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:28.160
<v Speaker 3>you think he should have won.</v>

5322
02:19:28.670 --> 02:19:33.440
<v Speaker 2>I tend to agree with you and you think that he should have a better position.</v>

5323
02:19:34.580 --> 02:19:34.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5324
02:19:34.821 --> 02:19:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I think a rematch would be the way to go,</v>

5325
02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:37.730
<v Speaker 2>but I still want to see that fight.</v>

5326
02:19:37.820 --> 02:19:38.440
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest with you.</v>

5327
02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:38.940
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

5328
02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:40.730
<v Speaker 2>I lie as a fight fan.</v>

5329
02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5330
02:19:41.230 --> 02:19:41.521
<v Speaker 2>Gates,</v>

5331
02:19:41.521 --> 02:19:42.354
<v Speaker 2>he boy a</v>

5332
02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:44.211
<v Speaker 2>cage.</v>

5333
02:19:44.211 --> 02:19:45.080
<v Speaker 2>He's an interesting guy.</v>

5334
02:19:45.350 --> 02:19:45.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5335
02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Tough motherfucker.</v>

5336
02:19:46.550 --> 02:19:49.280
<v Speaker 2>And he throws leg kicks from like a foot away from you.</v>

5337
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:51.170
<v Speaker 2>He's like right on top of you.</v>

5338
02:19:51.171 --> 02:19:51.511
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

5339
02:19:51.511 --> 02:19:54.110
<v Speaker 2>he swivels his hips and chops down with that leg.</v>

5340
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:57.290
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't care about getting ran over with a takedown either.</v>

5341
02:19:58.360 --> 02:19:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5342
02:19:58.700 --> 02:19:59.690
<v Speaker 2>he's a very good wrestler.</v>

5343
02:19:59.750 --> 02:20:00.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5344
02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:01.131
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>

5345
02:20:01.131 --> 02:20:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Rest of the chooses to stand and bang,</v>

5346
02:20:03.530 --> 02:20:03.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5347
02:20:03.801 --> 02:20:05.680
<v Speaker 2>and just breaks guys with his will done.</v>

5348
02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:06.560
<v Speaker 2>Michael Johnson fight.</v>

5349
02:20:06.561 --> 02:20:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

5350
02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

5351
02:20:09.980 --> 02:20:11.810
<v Speaker 2>And when you stop and think about that right after I said that,</v>

5352
02:20:11.811 --> 02:20:12.021
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5353
02:20:12.021 --> 02:20:12.531
<v Speaker 2>God damn.</v>

5354
02:20:12.531 --> 02:20:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Michael Johnson's been in some fucking wars.</v>

5355
02:20:14.601 --> 02:20:15.434
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5356
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:17.090
<v Speaker 2>He's been in some wars</v>

5357
02:20:17.850 --> 02:20:18.683
<v Speaker 5>with um,</v>

5358
02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:20.100
<v Speaker 5>with Ferguson.</v>

5359
02:20:20.130 --> 02:20:20.361
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5360
02:20:20.361 --> 02:20:20.581
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

5361
02:20:20.581 --> 02:20:21.780
<v Speaker 5>he beat up Tony a bit.</v>

5362
02:20:22.170 --> 02:20:22.830
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5363
02:20:22.830 --> 02:20:24.540
<v Speaker 5>but Johnson Johnson is one of those guys.</v>

5364
02:20:24.541 --> 02:20:25.351
<v Speaker 5>You can't count out.</v>

5365
02:20:25.351 --> 02:20:26.011
<v Speaker 5>Either don't,</v>

5366
02:20:26.011 --> 02:20:26.610
<v Speaker 5>but he,</v>

5367
02:20:26.610 --> 02:20:27.443
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

5368
02:20:27.780 --> 02:20:29.730
<v Speaker 5>his inconsistencies with throws me off.</v>

5369
02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:30.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5370
02:20:30.580 --> 02:20:31.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5371
02:20:31.390 --> 02:20:33.460
<v Speaker 2>it's oftentimes very good luck in the port.</v>

5372
02:20:33.461 --> 02:20:35.330
<v Speaker 2>A fight when he knocked out Dustin's,</v>

5373
02:20:35.350 --> 02:20:36.020
<v Speaker 2>he's very good,</v>

5374
02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:37.930
<v Speaker 2>not fight and you know,</v>

5375
02:20:37.931 --> 02:20:40.330
<v Speaker 2>and then he's had his moments,</v>

5376
02:20:40.360 --> 02:20:41.860
<v Speaker 2>but then Elkins just take some towns,</v>

5377
02:20:41.861 --> 02:20:42.430
<v Speaker 2>strangles him.</v>

5378
02:20:42.430 --> 02:20:42.701
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

5379
02:20:42.701 --> 02:20:43.534
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

5380
02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:45.950
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if that cut had anything to do with it,</v>

5381
02:20:45.951 --> 02:20:46.784
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

5382
02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Did he get cut in that fight?</v>

5383
02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:49.031
<v Speaker 2>The weight cut?</v>

5384
02:20:49.031 --> 02:20:49.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

5385
02:20:49.330 --> 02:20:49.661
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5386
02:20:49.661 --> 02:20:49.991
<v Speaker 2>the weight.</v>

5387
02:20:49.991 --> 02:20:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Just making 45 for the first time could very well be mean.</v>

5388
02:20:53.051 --> 02:20:54.520
<v Speaker 2>He looked real lean,</v>

5389
02:20:54.790 --> 02:20:55.331
<v Speaker 2>real lean.</v>

5390
02:20:55.331 --> 02:20:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Who knows how he felt doing it for the first time.</v>

5391
02:20:58.541 --> 02:20:59.560
<v Speaker 2>It's probably real hard.</v>

5392
02:20:59.600 --> 02:20:59.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5393
02:20:59.731 --> 02:21:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Is he doing it again or is he going to go back up to 55?</v>

5394
02:21:02.470 --> 02:21:03.161
<v Speaker 5>I have not.</v>

5395
02:21:03.161 --> 02:21:04.120
<v Speaker 5>I have not heard.</v>

5396
02:21:04.121 --> 02:21:05.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean it may be out there,</v>

5397
02:21:05.261 --> 02:21:05.830
<v Speaker 5>but I have,</v>

5398
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:09.250
<v Speaker 5>I haven't heard anything about it as far as if he's going back to 55 and not,</v>

5399
02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:10.360
<v Speaker 5>what's the most you ever cut?</v>

5400
02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.730
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5401
02:21:12.730 --> 02:21:16.390
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know what I was doing the first time I made one 54 to five room and the</v>

5402
02:21:16.391 --> 02:21:18.730
<v Speaker 5>Sato I thought I caught 17 pounds in a day.</v>

5403
02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:19.550
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

5404
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:20.383
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5405
02:21:20.470 --> 02:21:21.520
<v Speaker 5>that was ridiculous.</v>

5406
02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Did you have to fight day of or day after next day after?</v>

5407
02:21:25.330 --> 02:21:27.940
<v Speaker 2>How'd you rehydrate ivy bags?</v>

5408
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.580
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5409
02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:29.480
<v Speaker 5>I didn't.</v>

5410
02:21:29.481 --> 02:21:30.680
<v Speaker 5>I drank pedialyte.</v>

5411
02:21:31.250 --> 02:21:32.210
<v Speaker 5>Did it work?</v>

5412
02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:33.471
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

5413
02:21:33.471 --> 02:21:34.880
<v Speaker 5>The fight didn't last very long.</v>

5414
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:35.390
<v Speaker 5>It's on,</v>

5415
02:21:35.390 --> 02:21:37.730
<v Speaker 5>it's on fight pass and it's,</v>

5416
02:21:37.731 --> 02:21:38.541
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to see.</v>

5417
02:21:38.541 --> 02:21:40.430
<v Speaker 5>But as a fight happens,</v>

5418
02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:42.740
<v Speaker 5>I throw a jab and I hit Sato was,</v>

5419
02:21:42.741 --> 02:21:43.574
<v Speaker 5>he's coming in,</v>

5420
02:21:43.610 --> 02:21:46.490
<v Speaker 5>I turned his head over and bang,</v>

5421
02:21:46.491 --> 02:21:51.140
<v Speaker 5>as he's coming in we clash heads and I go to my knees and I get up and I grabbed</v>

5422
02:21:51.141 --> 02:21:53.960
<v Speaker 5>the ropes and I'm just holding on to the ropes and the ref is like screaming at</v>

5423
02:21:53.961 --> 02:21:54.021
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

5424
02:21:54.021 --> 02:21:54.531
<v Speaker 5>slap my ass,</v>

5425
02:21:54.531 --> 02:21:56.540
<v Speaker 5>telling me to get off the ropes and I'm just looking at him like,</v>

5426
02:21:56.570 --> 02:21:57.470
<v Speaker 5>what are you talking about?</v>

5427
02:21:57.471 --> 02:22:00.900
<v Speaker 5>And then he jumps on my back and he starts choking and I'm fighting and I'm,</v>

5428
02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:05.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm falling back and one of the ropes peels my hands off and he just thinks in,</v>

5429
02:22:05.311 --> 02:22:07.670
<v Speaker 5>the joke all happens in like 20 seconds.</v>

5430
02:22:07.730 --> 02:22:08.300
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

5431
02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:11.600
<v Speaker 5>But like I like after learning about rehydration,</v>

5432
02:22:11.601 --> 02:22:11.760
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

5433
02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:12.650
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know anything.</v>

5434
02:22:12.651 --> 02:22:14.460
<v Speaker 5>This is like 1999 right now.</v>

5435
02:22:14.750 --> 02:22:15.401
<v Speaker 5>I have to learn.</v>

5436
02:22:15.401 --> 02:22:17.030
<v Speaker 5>And this is the first time I fought a 55,</v>

5437
02:22:17.410 --> 02:22:18.243
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5438
02:22:18.620 --> 02:22:21.200
<v Speaker 5>after learning about rehydration and the brain and all that,</v>

5439
02:22:21.201 --> 02:22:22.034
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

5440
02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:22.371
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

5441

<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

5443
02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:25.383
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

5444
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 5>this was when</v>

5445
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:26.521
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid.</v>

5446
02:22:26.521 --> 02:22:28.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't care anymore about the result,</v>

5447
02:22:28.530 --> 02:22:29.251
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>

5448
02:22:29.251 --> 02:22:30.150
<v Speaker 3>was I out?</v>

5449
02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:30.510

5453
02:22:33.421 --> 02:22:35.730
<v Speaker 3>but I watch it on tape and I see it and I know what happens,</v>

5454
02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:37.890
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

5455

5456
02:22:38.551 --> 02:22:41.130

5457
02:22:41.131 --> 02:22:41.780
<v Speaker 3>quick fight.</v>

5458
02:22:41.780 --> 02:22:43.320
<v Speaker 3>You get a chance to assess how your body,</v>

5459
02:22:43.410 --> 02:22:45.090
<v Speaker 3>how did you feel like walking to the ring?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Do you remember?</v>

5461

5487
02:23:15.990 --> 02:23:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Damn Bra fights.</v>

5488
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:21.780
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that v Tours debut against John Hess.</v>

5489
02:23:21.900 --> 02:23:22.430
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

5490
02:23:22.430 --> 02:23:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

5491
02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:25.060
<v Speaker 3>Shaq was in the audience members.</v>

5492
02:23:25.070 --> 02:23:25.940
<v Speaker 3>Shaq jumps out.</v>

5493
02:23:26.580 --> 02:23:28.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember that veto or lit.</v>

5494
02:23:28.351 --> 02:23:29.410
<v Speaker 3>John has stopped.</v>

5495
02:23:30.090 --> 02:23:33.420
<v Speaker 3>That's when John House was like one of the last remaining bullshit artists.</v>

5496
02:23:33.620 --> 02:23:34.890
<v Speaker 3>He was a safta guy.</v>

5497
02:23:35.250 --> 02:23:36.660
<v Speaker 3>Like street combat,</v>

5498
02:23:36.661 --> 02:23:38.700
<v Speaker 3>like one of those guys poking people in the eyes and shit.</v>

5499
02:23:38.701 --> 02:23:39.900
<v Speaker 3>And that's what he basically did.</v>

5500
02:23:40.170 --> 02:23:41.640
<v Speaker 3>And his UFC debut,</v>

5501
02:23:41.641 --> 02:23:43.590
<v Speaker 3>he poked the shit out of some guy he fought.</v>

5502
02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:46.290
<v Speaker 3>So he fought some short guy and poked him in the eyes.</v>

5503
02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:46.891
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

5504
02:23:46.891 --> 02:23:47.810
<v Speaker 3>this is Victoria.</v>

5505
02:23:47.970 --> 02:23:49.680
<v Speaker 3>This is back up a little bit.</v>

5506
02:23:50.810 --> 02:23:51.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5507
02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:53.850
<v Speaker 3>But just back up a little bit because this is right before the fight starts.</v>

5508
02:23:53.890 --> 02:23:54.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5509
02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:55.193
<v Speaker 3>Let it go here.</v>

5510
02:23:55.530 --> 02:23:56.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5511
02:23:56.030 --> 02:23:57.270
<v Speaker 3>it starts with a beating.</v>

5512
02:23:57.710 --> 02:23:58.830
<v Speaker 3>It was a weird video.</v>

5513
02:23:59.160 --> 02:23:59.371
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You to her.</v>

5523
02:24:05.281 --> 02:24:06.510

5524
02:24:06.600 --> 02:24:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5527
02:24:08.850 --> 02:24:12.480
<v Speaker 3>That's when I was at Carlson Gracie's on Hawthorne is right down the street from</v>

5528
02:24:12.481 --> 02:24:13.141
<v Speaker 3>the comedy store.</v>

5529
02:24:13.141 --> 02:24:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

5530
02:24:13.530 --> 02:24:17.810
<v Speaker 3>I was so jealous to veto and that UFC Brazil when he fought Vandelay cause that</v>

5531
02:24:17.811 --> 02:24:19.170
<v Speaker 3>was like this kid my age.</v>

5532
02:24:19.171 --> 02:24:19.920
<v Speaker 3>I agree with the saint.</v>

5533
02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:20.940
<v Speaker 3>Were born the same year,</v>

5534
02:24:20.941 --> 02:24:21.930
<v Speaker 3>I guess it was like he's my,</v>

5535
02:24:21.970 --> 02:24:23.040
<v Speaker 3>he's already in the UFC.</v>

5536
02:24:23.310 --> 02:24:24.960
<v Speaker 3>I wish I was 200 pounds.</v>

5537
02:24:25.230 --> 02:24:29.040
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember Rod Woodson was this safety for,</v>

5538
02:24:29.041 --> 02:24:31.260
<v Speaker 3>for the Pittsburgh Steelers and I was like,</v>

5539
02:24:31.410 --> 02:24:33.330
<v Speaker 3>he's five [inaudible] nine 200 pounds cause I,</v>

5540
02:24:33.331 --> 02:24:33.790
<v Speaker 3>that would be,</v>

5541
02:24:33.790 --> 02:24:35.640
<v Speaker 3>they will only two weight classes back then.</v>

5542
02:24:35.690 --> 02:24:37.350
<v Speaker 3>And this is when he tried telling me,</v>

5543
02:24:37.410 --> 02:24:37.690
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5544
02:24:37.690 --> 02:24:38.360
<v Speaker 3>he fought.</v>

5545
02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:39.750
<v Speaker 3>He was only 200 pounds back then.</v>

5546
02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

5547
02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:43.820
<v Speaker 3>when he fought in his UFC debut and he beat the shit out of Scott for Ozo and it</v>

5548
02:24:43.821 --> 02:24:48.821
<v Speaker 3>was only 200 pounds and he was shout readed just shredded was fast.</v>

5549
02:24:50.670 --> 02:24:52.760
<v Speaker 3>Was It v against Vandelay telegram?</v>

5550
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:55.410
<v Speaker 3>Telegram was his debut froze are right here.</v>

5551
02:24:55.411 --> 02:24:56.700
<v Speaker 3>That was the second fight of the night.</v>

5552
02:24:56.820 --> 02:25:00.540
<v Speaker 3>This is the first fight that I worked in Alabama in 1997.</v>

5553
02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:04.500
<v Speaker 3>When did he fight Vandelay and Vandelay and nice six?</v>

5554
02:25:04.940 --> 02:25:05.340
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5555
02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:06.390
<v Speaker 3>98 I think.</v>

5556
02:25:07.290 --> 02:25:08.123
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

5557
02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:10.080
<v Speaker 3>ultimate ultimate buzz Brazil.</v>

5558
02:25:10.620 --> 02:25:12.120
<v Speaker 3>This is how he fought tank Abbott.</v>

5559
02:25:12.270 --> 02:25:14.820
<v Speaker 3>This was when [inaudible] was getting bigger,</v>

5560
02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:16.350
<v Speaker 3>but he was still,</v>

5561
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:17.910
<v Speaker 3>it was still fast.</v>

5562
02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:22.560
<v Speaker 3>He was like probably like two 15 or two 20 then and then he fucked up tank</v>

5563
02:25:22.561 --> 02:25:23.394
<v Speaker 3>Abbott.</v>

5564
02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:24.393
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5565
02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:26.560
<v Speaker 2>but then as he got older,</v>

5566
02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:31.420
<v Speaker 2>not older but later and see like here he's still pretty jacked.</v>

5567
02:25:31.690 --> 02:25:33.140
<v Speaker 2>But then when he fought Randy coture,</v>

5568
02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:33.510
<v Speaker 2>he got,</v>

5569
02:25:33.510 --> 02:25:34.840
<v Speaker 2>remember this is Joe Charles.</v>

5570
02:25:35.140 --> 02:25:37.930
<v Speaker 2>That might've been effects ever see that fight.</v>

5571
02:25:38.210 --> 02:25:39.310
<v Speaker 2>He didn't throw any punches.</v>

5572
02:25:39.311 --> 02:25:43.360
<v Speaker 2>They were friends and they just scrap and got him in an arm bar that was like,</v>

5573
02:25:43.361 --> 02:25:44.500
<v Speaker 2>they kind of had a deal.</v>

5574
02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:46.000
<v Speaker 2>Here's the Vandelay fight.</v>

5575
02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:46.860
<v Speaker 2>You got to meet the,</v>

5576
02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:51.160
<v Speaker 2>remember the Vandelay fight was when he had slimmed down cause after Randy had</v>

5577
02:25:51.161 --> 02:25:52.000
<v Speaker 2>already fucked him up.</v>

5578
02:25:52.530 --> 02:25:53.111
<v Speaker 2>It was after,</v>

5579
02:25:53.111 --> 02:25:53.261
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5580
02:25:53.261 --> 02:25:53.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5581
02:25:53.591 --> 02:25:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5582
02:25:54.010 --> 02:25:55.240
<v Speaker 2>Well when Randy fought him,</v>

5583
02:25:55.241 --> 02:25:58.180
<v Speaker 2>veto was two 40 and he looked like a lion.</v>

5584
02:25:58.181 --> 02:25:58.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5585
02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:00.220
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even look like a person.</v>

5586
02:26:00.610 --> 02:26:02.530
<v Speaker 2>See if he could find veto.</v>

5587
02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:03.393
<v Speaker 2>This is pride</v>

5588
02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:05.140
<v Speaker 4>picture of that a couple of weeks,</v>

5589
02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:09.220
<v Speaker 4>a couple months ago about Vitola at that point before the Randy fight.</v>

5590
02:26:09.890 --> 02:26:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5591
02:26:10.500 --> 02:26:12.110
<v Speaker 2>because he had no known weaknesses.</v>

5592
02:26:12.500 --> 02:26:12.861
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5593
02:26:12.861 --> 02:26:13.671
<v Speaker 2>That's what it said.</v>

5594
02:26:13.671 --> 02:26:14.780
<v Speaker 2>No known weaknesses.</v>

5595
02:26:14.781 --> 02:26:16.430
<v Speaker 2>He lost a sock or rob in this fight.</v>

5596
02:26:16.431 --> 02:26:17.270
<v Speaker 2>He hurt his hand,</v>

5597
02:26:17.930 --> 02:26:18.770
<v Speaker 2>broke his hand early.</v>

5598
02:26:18.771 --> 02:26:19.850
<v Speaker 2>And this is also,</v>

5599
02:26:19.851 --> 02:26:23.750
<v Speaker 2>this is Vito or after is his sister got kidnapped and murdered.</v>

5600
02:26:24.470 --> 02:26:25.700
<v Speaker 2>He was a different guy then.</v>

5601
02:26:26.420 --> 02:26:29.040
<v Speaker 2>Sakharov was so fucking tough too man.</v>

5602
02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:31.250
<v Speaker 2>Sakkara but just knew how to survive.</v>

5603
02:26:31.970 --> 02:26:34.280
<v Speaker 2>See if you could find Vituro versus Randy couture.</v>

5604
02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's the crazy one when you just look at his build.</v>

5605
02:26:37.250 --> 02:26:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5606
02:26:37.700 --> 02:26:39.260
<v Speaker 2>he was so big man.</v>

5607
02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:42.880
<v Speaker 4>It's like his traps were coming up to his ears.</v>

5608
02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:43.171
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5609
02:26:43.171 --> 02:26:44.110
<v Speaker 2>here it is right here.</v>

5610
02:26:45.370 --> 02:26:46.660
<v Speaker 2>This is him versus Randy.</v>

5611
02:26:48.140 --> 02:26:50.480
<v Speaker 2>So this might be says young Vitor Belfort.</v>

5612
02:26:50.481 --> 02:26:52.320
<v Speaker 2>So it's probably only going to show you the good stuff.</v>

5613
02:26:52.340 --> 02:26:53.173
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5614
02:26:53.310 --> 02:26:54.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5615
02:26:54.050 --> 02:26:55.910
<v Speaker 2>He was so thick back then,</v>

5616
02:26:57.170 --> 02:26:59.570
<v Speaker 2>but the thing I remember is like how big his neck was.</v>

5617
02:26:59.610 --> 02:27:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Like it started at the top of his head and worked its way down sideways,</v>

5618
02:27:03.380 --> 02:27:04.610
<v Speaker 2>a 40 degree angle.</v>

5619
02:27:06.170 --> 02:27:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Those are the wild west days,</v>

5620
02:27:07.581 --> 02:27:08.270
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5621
02:27:08.270 --> 02:27:08.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5622
02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:09.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5623
02:27:09.141 --> 02:27:10.790
<v Speaker 2>how many guys did you fight where you're like,</v>

5624
02:27:10.820 --> 02:27:11.601
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>

5625
02:27:11.601 --> 02:27:12.560
<v Speaker 2>this dude's definitely on the,</v>

5626
02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:13.513
<v Speaker 2>on the juice.</v>

5627
02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:15.700
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even think about juice back down,</v>

5628
02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:16.580
<v Speaker 4>even know what it was.</v>

5629
02:27:16.670 --> 02:27:17.091
<v Speaker 4>I saw it.</v>

5630
02:27:17.091 --> 02:27:17.871
<v Speaker 4>I thought there's a,</v>

5631
02:27:17.871 --> 02:27:19.130
<v Speaker 4>there's a video on youtube.</v>

5632
02:27:19.131 --> 02:27:20.210
<v Speaker 4>I fought this guy,</v>

5633
02:27:20.510 --> 02:27:23.270
<v Speaker 4>so bas Rutten was coming to Texas and I was like,</v>

5635
02:27:25.250 --> 02:27:25.731
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

5636
02:27:25.731 --> 02:27:26.960
<v Speaker 4>he told my coach who's was coming,</v>

5637
02:27:26.961 --> 02:27:28.190
<v Speaker 4>I emailed my coach,</v>

5640
02:27:31.311 --> 02:27:34.040

5641
02:27:34.041 --> 02:27:34.610
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

5642

<v Speaker 5>That type of stuff.</v>

5737
02:29:20.931 --> 02:29:25.550
<v Speaker 5>Like Josh Thomson posted a picture a couple of days ago of him and Hermes and</v>

5738
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:26.750
<v Speaker 5>Hermes Franco.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I forgot about that dude.</v>

5741
02:29:28.490 --> 02:29:28.820
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

5742
02:29:28.820 --> 02:29:29.091

02:29:29.091 --> 02:29:29.901
<v Speaker 5>that was a good fight.</v>

5744
02:29:29.901 --> 02:29:31.550
<v Speaker 5>I remember watching that and thinking like,</v>

5745
02:29:31.551 --> 02:29:31.901
<v Speaker 5>Josh,</v>

5746
02:29:31.901 --> 02:29:35.390
<v Speaker 5>has he posted something about that fight should have made him the number one guy</v>

5747
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:37.940
<v Speaker 5>because like we were the guys at that point.</v>

5748
02:29:37.970 --> 02:29:38.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5749
02:29:38.210 --> 02:29:41.060
<v Speaker 5>Armies and Josh and when he beat Hermes,</v>

5750
02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:41.840
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

5751
02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:43.100
<v Speaker 5>I got to fight these guys.</v>

5752
02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:44.810
<v Speaker 5>These are the guys I want to fight.</v>

5753
02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:46.850
<v Speaker 5>And then I fought Hermes and then it was like,</v>

5754
02:29:46.851 --> 02:29:47.330
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

5755
02:29:47.330 --> 02:29:49.370
<v Speaker 5>It's just Josh and I,</v>

5756
02:29:49.371 --> 02:29:50.240
<v Speaker 5>we got to do this,</v>

5757
02:29:50.720 --> 02:29:51.290

<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5759
02:29:52.250 --> 02:29:55.350
<v Speaker 5>that highlight kick that you landed on him to his work,</v>

5760
02:29:55.370 --> 02:30:00.370
<v Speaker 5>one of those UFC preflight video highlight reel thing.</v>

5761
02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:01.340
<v Speaker 5>They would play with that.</v>

5762
02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:03.020

5765
02:30:05.811 --> 02:30:08.990
<v Speaker 5>And then you would land that jumping roundhouse kick to the neck.</v>

5766
02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:11.450
<v Speaker 5>That was a crazy highlight reel.</v>

02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:37.410
<v Speaker 2>I think he just needed money,</v>

5870
02:32:37.411 --> 02:32:37.830
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5871
02:32:37.830 --> 02:32:39.540
<v Speaker 2>I think he just needed tax money,</v>

5872
02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:40.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5873
02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:44.160
<v Speaker 2>and it was at a point in my life where I was just dumb enough to do it.</v>

5874
02:32:44.220 --> 02:32:45.053
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5875
02:32:45.090 --> 02:32:45.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll do this.</v>

5876
02:32:46.330 --> 02:32:46.801
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

5877
02:32:46.801 --> 02:32:46.981
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5878
02:32:46.981 --> 02:32:47.251
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>

5879
02:32:47.251 --> 02:32:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Got Tapped out by Andy Dick wet.</v>

5880
02:32:50.370 --> 02:32:52.620
<v Speaker 2>I got tickled out this,</v>

5881
02:32:52.621 --> 02:32:54.600
<v Speaker 2>that tickling doesn't work right?</v>

5882
02:32:54.650 --> 02:32:54.950
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5883
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Never done that in a fight.</v>

5884
02:32:56.071 --> 02:32:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Like you even feel it in a fight.</v>

5885
02:32:58.560 --> 02:32:59.580
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't even feel it.</v>

5886
02:32:59.890 --> 02:33:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone like wasted time,</v>

5887
02:33:01.471 --> 02:33:02.450
<v Speaker 2>like Kumu,</v>

5888
02:33:02.480 --> 02:33:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Kumu,</v>

5889
02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:05.040
<v Speaker 2>you just hit him right in the mouth.</v>

5890
02:33:06.390 --> 02:33:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if someone like was so ticklish that you could open up a submission,</v>

5891
02:33:10.500 --> 02:33:13.170
<v Speaker 2>like a ticklish ticklish tennis could open up a submission.</v>

5892
02:33:13.560 --> 02:33:14.220
<v Speaker 2>That's hard.</v>

5893
02:33:14.220 --> 02:33:14.801
<v Speaker 2>You know what you,</v>

5894
02:33:14.801 --> 02:33:15.810
<v Speaker 2>you might be like,</v>

5895
02:33:15.811 --> 02:33:17.850
<v Speaker 2>if someone's turtled up knowing you're going back,</v>

5896
02:33:17.851 --> 02:33:19.200
<v Speaker 2>you can hit that rib tickle.</v>

5897
02:33:19.240 --> 02:33:19.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5898
02:33:19.870 --> 02:33:22.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try that in the gym and the gym.</v>

5899
02:33:22.351 --> 02:33:23.250
<v Speaker 2>It might work.</v>

5900
02:33:23.570 --> 02:33:26.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna try to rip decal so many in the gym when I get them back next time.</v>

5901
02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:27.151
<v Speaker 2>Is Anybody,</v>

5902
02:33:27.151 --> 02:33:27.900
<v Speaker 2>here's a question.</v>

5903
02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody ever knocked the guy out where someone's on your back and you hit</v>

5904
02:33:31.441 --> 02:33:32.700
<v Speaker 2>on with one of these and knock them out?</v>

5905
02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:33.780
<v Speaker 2>I have never seen that.</v>

5906
02:33:33.810 --> 02:33:34.710
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen it either,</v>

5907
02:33:35.100 --> 02:33:36.930
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen people keep trying it.</v>

5908
02:33:37.230 --> 02:33:38.220
<v Speaker 2>They keep trying it.</v>

5909
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5910
02:33:39.990 --> 02:33:42.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody's ever knocked anybody out with that.</v>

5911
02:33:42.541 --> 02:33:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Like can you practice that?</v>

5912
02:33:43.950 --> 02:33:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Like could you get a guide to do ride your back with the pads on and he would</v>

5913
02:33:48.691 --> 02:33:50.400
<v Speaker 2>hold up pads and you had fucking,</v>

5914
02:33:52.820 --> 02:33:54.240
<v Speaker 2>it sounds dumb as shit.</v>

5915
02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Sounds dumb as shit.</v>

5916
02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5917
02:33:55.650 --> 02:33:56.483
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5918
02:33:56.880 --> 02:33:57.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5919
02:33:57.220 --> 02:33:57.930
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

5920
02:33:57.930 --> 02:33:58.763
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do that.</v>

5921
02:33:58.800 --> 02:33:59.191
<v Speaker 2>I should know.</v>

5922
02:33:59.191 --> 02:34:01.830
<v Speaker 2>What does work that you can't do headbutting.</v>

5923
02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5924
02:34:02.940 --> 02:34:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Like if a guy's on your back and if you've got risk control and you smash your</v>

5925
02:34:06.691 --> 02:34:07.550
<v Speaker 2>head into his head,</v>

5926
02:34:07.551 --> 02:34:09.420
<v Speaker 2>that is a legitimate technique.</v>

5927
02:34:09.660 --> 02:34:12.240
<v Speaker 2>You're smashing the back of your head and knew his nose.</v>

5928
02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:13.253
<v Speaker 2>That's legit.</v>

5929
02:34:13.260 --> 02:34:13.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5930
02:34:13.860 --> 02:34:14.693
<v Speaker 2>that's legit.</v>

5931
02:34:15.750 --> 02:34:18.220
<v Speaker 2>But it's a headbutts headbutts illegal,</v>

5932
02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:20.470
<v Speaker 5>but it opens up a rear naked.</v>

5933
02:34:21.100 --> 02:34:21.933
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5934
02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:23.440
<v Speaker 5>But it's a good,</v>

5935
02:34:23.590 --> 02:34:25.420
<v Speaker 5>it's not the best defense.</v>

5936
02:34:25.421 --> 02:34:27.600
<v Speaker 5>The best defense is proper Jujitsu defense.</v>

5937
02:34:27.630 --> 02:34:31.840
<v Speaker 5>But there's something to headbutting someone who's got your back that it's</v>

5938
02:34:31.841 --> 02:34:33.130
<v Speaker 5>another thing they have to think about.</v>

5939
02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:33.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5940
02:34:33.940 --> 02:34:35.890
<v Speaker 5>But if you lot headbutts,</v>

5941
02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:39.370
<v Speaker 5>then you would allow the ultimate move from the runic a choke position,</v>

5942
02:34:39.371 --> 02:34:41.320
<v Speaker 5>which is him elbow and you in the back of the head.</v>

5943
02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:42.820
<v Speaker 5>That's the ultimate move.</v>

5944
02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:43.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5945
02:34:43.390 --> 02:34:45.040
<v Speaker 5>That changes the whole position.</v>

5946
02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:45.611
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5947
02:34:45.611 --> 02:34:50.140
<v Speaker 5>But also headbutts changed the guard position to remember Mark Coleman when he</v>

5948
02:34:50.141 --> 02:34:54.130
<v Speaker 5>fought Maury Smith and those old days Coleman would get on top of guys and just</v>

5949
02:34:54.131 --> 02:34:55.980
<v Speaker 5>smash his fucking head right into your nose.</v>

5950
02:34:55.990 --> 02:34:56.361
<v Speaker 5>It was a,</v>

5951
02:34:56.361 --> 02:35:00.820
<v Speaker 5>there was an event on it from Australia from way back in the day from I think</v>

5952
02:35:00.821 --> 02:35:02.020
<v Speaker 5>the late nineties where this guy,</v>

5953
02:35:02.021 --> 02:35:05.020
<v Speaker 5>one one and one of one of his fights in the tournament and maybe a couple of</v>

5954
02:35:05.021 --> 02:35:05.770
<v Speaker 5>fights,</v>

5955
02:35:05.770 --> 02:35:06.603
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5956
02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:08.380
<v Speaker 5>from inside the guide head buddy.</v>

5957
02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:09.100
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

5958
02:35:09.100 --> 02:35:09.911
<v Speaker 5>And then I remember that,</v>

5959
02:35:09.911 --> 02:35:13.000
<v Speaker 5>I remember the guy who put his chin in the guy's eye socket marker.</v>

5960
02:35:13.420 --> 02:35:14.020
<v Speaker 5>That was Kurt.</v>

5961
02:35:14.020 --> 02:35:14.650
<v Speaker 5>Kurt did that.</v>

5962
02:35:14.650 --> 02:35:15.190
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5963
02:35:15.190 --> 02:35:17.860
<v Speaker 5>Dan mobish fought Dan Boba fish,</v>

5964
02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:19.030
<v Speaker 5>got on top of them,</v>

5965
02:35:19.031 --> 02:35:20.140
<v Speaker 5>got the back of his head,</v>

5966
02:35:20.141 --> 02:35:23.440
<v Speaker 5>stuffed his chin and his eye socket and lifted up the back of his head,</v>

5967
02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:26.740
<v Speaker 5>crushed his chin into his eyeball Ui.</v>

5968
02:35:26.770 --> 02:35:27.603
<v Speaker 5>That's gross.</v>

5969
02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:29.080
<v Speaker 5>That's as gross as it gets.</v>

5970
02:35:29.170 --> 02:35:30.003
<v Speaker 5>It's horrible.</v>

5971
02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:30.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah man.</v>

5972
02:35:30.680 --> 02:35:31.010
<v Speaker 5>You see,</v>

5973
02:35:31.010 --> 02:35:31.811
<v Speaker 5>I seen a lot of,</v>

5974
02:35:31.811 --> 02:35:33.130
<v Speaker 5>I've seen a lot of those,</v>

6012
02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:19.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6013
02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:22.630
<v Speaker 5>He's a talented guy and he's like one of the baddest Swat cops on the force</v>

6014
02:36:22.631 --> 02:36:22.990
<v Speaker 5>right here.</v>

6015
02:36:22.990 --> 02:36:23.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6016
02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:25.630
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine he was a talented guy.</v>

6017
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:26.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6018
02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:28.120
<v Speaker 5>He was the guy that I was Kinda surprised,</v>

6019
02:36:28.121 --> 02:36:28.990
<v Speaker 5>didn't go further.</v>

6020
02:36:29.500 --> 02:36:32.770
<v Speaker 5>Wilson was one of those guys who I believe</v>

6021
02:36:34.510 --> 02:36:39.510
<v Speaker 5>couldn't put it together inside the octagon as well as he could in the gym and</v>

6022
02:36:40.991 --> 02:36:42.990
<v Speaker 5>also had a little bit,</v>

6023
02:36:42.991 --> 02:36:45.730
<v Speaker 5>he could have put more effort into preparing.</v>

6024
02:36:47.020 --> 02:36:48.640
<v Speaker 5>Well that's oftentimes the case.</v>

6025
02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:53.980
<v Speaker 5>The difference between someone who just does fantastic and someone who just</v>

6026
02:36:53.981 --> 02:36:56.260
<v Speaker 5>doesn't quite just someone who falls off short.</v>

6027
02:36:56.390 --> 02:36:56.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6028
02:36:56.890 --> 02:36:58.810
<v Speaker 5>I think it also comes from like,</v>

6029
02:36:58.840 --> 02:36:59.261
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6030
02:36:59.261 --> 02:36:59.700
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

6031
02:36:59.700 --> 02:37:00.850
<v Speaker 5>the way you come up in the sport.</v>

6032
02:37:01.140 --> 02:37:01.660
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6033
02:37:01.660 --> 02:37:02.321
<v Speaker 5>some of these guys,</v>

6034
02:37:02.321 --> 02:37:04.060
<v Speaker 5>they come up and they're the best guy in their,</v>

6035
02:37:04.061 --> 02:37:05.380
<v Speaker 5>in their area for a long time.</v>

6036
02:37:05.710 --> 02:37:06.180
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

6037
02:37:06.180 --> 02:37:07.013
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6038
02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:10.270
<v Speaker 5>you kind of get this attitude or this,</v>

6039
02:37:10.630 --> 02:37:12.340
<v Speaker 5>you started developing this persona of like,</v>

6040
02:37:12.341 --> 02:37:14.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to do all that work because like I,</v>

6041
02:37:14.570 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even doing that much and I'm</v>

6042
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.810
<v Speaker 2>still smashing everybody in here.</v>

6043
02:37:18.260 --> 02:37:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Well that's where it's crazy about the garlic.</v>

6044
02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:20.513
<v Speaker 2>John Jones.</v>

6045
02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:21.740
<v Speaker 2>He actually can do that.</v>

6046
02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6047
02:37:22.420 --> 02:37:23.220
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

6048
02:37:23.220 --> 02:37:26.540
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the rare guys that actually can do that.</v>

6049
02:37:26.541 --> 02:37:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

6050
02:37:27.170 --> 02:37:28.003
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

6051
02:37:28.340 --> 02:37:31.150
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how much money he's left on the table with,</v>

6052
02:37:31.151 --> 02:37:32.240
<v Speaker 2>with all these problems,</v>

6053
02:37:32.241 --> 02:37:36.980
<v Speaker 2>especially with the tension that Khan has brought to the sport and a guy like</v>

6054
02:37:36.981 --> 02:37:37.940
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones.</v>

6055
02:37:37.970 --> 02:37:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6056
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:39.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6057
02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:44.320
<v Speaker 2>I know it's good as he is good as he is and I feel like for the longest time</v>

6058
02:37:45.441 --> 02:37:45.661
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

6059
02:37:45.661 --> 02:37:49.460
<v Speaker 2>he was trying to push this goody two shoes image and everybody was like,</v>

6060
02:37:49.461 --> 02:37:50.294
<v Speaker 2>well that's not you.</v>

6061
02:37:50.540 --> 02:37:51.380
<v Speaker 2>This is fake.</v>

6062
02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:55.490
<v Speaker 2>And then all of his problems sort of forced him to just be himself and then</v>

6063
02:37:55.491 --> 02:37:55.851
<v Speaker 2>people were like,</v>

6064
02:37:55.851 --> 02:37:56.870
<v Speaker 2>we like you worn out.</v>

6065
02:37:57.500 --> 02:38:00.260
<v Speaker 2>And then he winds up testing positive for something else,</v>

6066
02:38:00.470 --> 02:38:01.640
<v Speaker 2>which I believe him,</v>

6067
02:38:01.730 --> 02:38:02.990
<v Speaker 2>it was accidental.</v>

6068
02:38:03.260 --> 02:38:06.140
<v Speaker 2>I believe that it was accidental in this,</v>

6069
02:38:06.141 --> 02:38:06.681
<v Speaker 2>in this case,</v>

6070
02:38:06.681 --> 02:38:08.960
<v Speaker 2>because it doesn't make any sense any other way.</v>

6071
02:38:09.230 --> 02:38:14.150
<v Speaker 2>Because if you look at how he tested positive in what he tested positive for and</v>

6072
02:38:14.151 --> 02:38:18.500
<v Speaker 2>how recently tested negative before that and how recently afterwards he tested</v>

6073
02:38:18.501 --> 02:38:19.160
<v Speaker 2>negative,</v>

6074
02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:22.430
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about something that was a such a minuscule trace amount,</v>

6075
02:38:22.431 --> 02:38:25.730
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you can consider taking something like that and having it to have</v>

6076
02:38:25.731 --> 02:38:27.950
<v Speaker 2>some sort of positive effect,</v>

6077
02:38:28.430 --> 02:38:29.540
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing effect.</v>

6078
02:38:29.570 --> 02:38:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Now was that the substance?</v>

6079
02:38:32.991 --> 02:38:33.824
<v Speaker 2>Is it oral?</v>

6080
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Is it can be taken away or it can be taken orally.</v>

6081
02:38:36.170 --> 02:38:37.580
<v Speaker 2>So I've heard,</v>

6082
02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:38.121
<v Speaker 2>I've heard,</v>

6083
02:38:38.121 --> 02:38:39.650
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know how true this is,</v>

6084
02:38:39.710 --> 02:38:41.930
<v Speaker 2>I would expect it to be somewhat true,</v>

6085
02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:43.340
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard like in boxing,</v>

6086
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:44.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6087
02:38:44.091 --> 02:38:44.351
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

6088
02:38:44.351 --> 02:38:45.030
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

6089
02:38:45.030 --> 02:38:45.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6090
02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:46.550
<v Speaker 2>main vendors,</v>

6091
02:38:46.700 --> 02:38:47.450
<v Speaker 2>they've had these,</v>

6092
02:38:47.450 --> 02:38:49.490
<v Speaker 2>these issues where they would only,</v>

6093
02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:52.970
<v Speaker 2>they would provide their own food because they don't trust the staff for</v>

6094
02:38:52.971 --> 02:38:53.541
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

6095
02:38:53.541 --> 02:38:54.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6096
02:38:54.260 --> 02:38:55.430
<v Speaker 2>spiking their food with something.</v>

6097
02:38:55.430 --> 02:38:56.263
<v Speaker 2>So they test.</v>

6098
02:38:56.570 --> 02:38:58.370
<v Speaker 2>So I don't,</v>

6099
02:38:58.371 --> 02:38:58.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6100
02:38:58.730 --> 02:39:00.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean that sounds far fetched,</v>

6101
02:39:00.561 --> 02:39:03.290
<v Speaker 2>but it also sounds to some degree reasonable.</v>

6102
02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:04.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6103
02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:07.820
<v Speaker 2>his position was weakened by his testimony in the California State Athletic</v>

6104
02:39:07.821 --> 02:39:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Commission hearing because,</v>

6105
02:39:09.390 --> 02:39:09.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6106
02:39:09.980 --> 02:39:10.371
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

6107
02:39:10.371 --> 02:39:14.720
<v Speaker 2>he said that Malki had forged his signature on one of the documents on one of</v>

6108
02:39:14.721 --> 02:39:16.460
<v Speaker 2>the things that he was supposed to have gone over.</v>

6109
02:39:16.461 --> 02:39:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Like what you can and can't,</v>

6110
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.721
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6111
02:39:17.721 --> 02:39:18.201
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a,</v>

6112
02:39:18.201 --> 02:39:21.920
<v Speaker 2>you saw the paperwork or maybe it was California state athletic,</v>

6113
02:39:21.980 --> 02:39:23.960
<v Speaker 2>mentioned commissioned paperwork.</v>

6114
02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6115
02:39:24.770 --> 02:39:29.770
<v Speaker 2>he apparently admitted that his manager forge a signature and they asked him,</v>

6116
02:39:30.951 --> 02:39:32.600
<v Speaker 2>have you ever considered getting a new manager?</v>

6117
02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:34.070
<v Speaker 2>And he joked around,</v>

6118
02:39:34.071 --> 02:39:34.401
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

6119
02:39:34.401 --> 02:39:34.940
<v Speaker 2>he has.</v>

6120
02:39:34.940 --> 02:39:35.241
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

6121
02:39:35.241 --> 02:39:35.361
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6122
02:39:35.361 --> 02:39:36.194
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kidding.</v>

6123
02:39:36.530 --> 02:39:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6124
02:39:36.830 --> 02:39:38.720
<v Speaker 2>but that's not good.</v>

6125
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:43.750
<v Speaker 2>And then there was a bunch of stuff in like what he provided as a possible</v>

6126
02:39:45.171 --> 02:39:47.000
<v Speaker 2>source of that stuff.</v>

6127
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.841
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6128
02:39:47.841 --> 02:39:48.674
<v Speaker 2>like he didn't,</v>

6129
02:39:48.980 --> 02:39:51.770
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have in these a lot of the things that he provided as a source of</v>

6130
02:39:51.810 --> 02:39:54.260
<v Speaker 2>stuff in his list of stuff that he had taken.</v>

6131
02:39:54.370 --> 02:39:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6132
02:39:54.800 --> 02:39:55.633
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6133
02:39:55.970 --> 02:39:57.170
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot going on there,</v>

6134
02:39:57.171 --> 02:39:57.471
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6135
02:39:57.471 --> 02:40:00.530
<v Speaker 2>But the real problem is like John at one point and Thomas being represented by</v>

6136
02:40:00.531 --> 02:40:01.364
<v Speaker 2>Nike.</v>

6137
02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:03.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was representing Nike.</v>

6138
02:40:03.441 --> 02:40:03.801
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

6139
02:40:03.801 --> 02:40:05.510
<v Speaker 2>he had a huge Nike contract.</v>

6140
02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:06.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6141
02:40:06.340 --> 02:40:06.771
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

6142
02:40:06.771 --> 02:40:07.610
<v Speaker 2>and that's huge.</v>

6143
02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:10.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean damn that was giant cause that was pre Reebok too.</v>

6144
02:40:11.090 --> 02:40:14.160
<v Speaker 2>That was the pre pre Reebok days where he would have got all the juice.</v>

6145
02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:15.210
<v Speaker 3>He would've got it all.</v>

6146
02:40:15.630 --> 02:40:18.350
<v Speaker 3>And you know what can the have,</v>

6147
02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:22.590
<v Speaker 3>should have a shit goes on forever and on top of the top of that of um,</v>

6148
02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:28.280
<v Speaker 3>the Coulda woulda Shoulda of that being pre Reebok and it being Nike with</v>

6149
02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:30.330
<v Speaker 3>everything that comes to the sport sends.</v>

6150
02:40:30.331 --> 02:40:32.210
<v Speaker 3>Then imagine if John like he could like,</v>

6151
02:40:32.211 --> 02:40:33.044
<v Speaker 3>he could have done it,</v>

6152
02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:35.040

6164
02:40:48.750 --> 02:40:48.991
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>John Coming up to heavyweight.</v>

6171
02:40:57.960 --> 02:40:58.321
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6172
02:40:58.321 --> 02:41:00.750
<v Speaker 3>it's a huge fight with DC coming up to heavyweight.</v>

6173
02:41:00.751 --> 02:41:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

6174
02:41:01.170 --> 02:41:01.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6177
02:41:05.780 --> 02:41:06.330
<v Speaker 3>k owed him.</v>

6178
02:41:06.330 --> 02:41:06.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6179
02:41:06.810 --> 02:41:07.201
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6180
02:41:07.201 --> 02:41:08.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean he hit him with that left high kick.</v>

6181
02:41:08.941 --> 02:41:10.650
<v Speaker 3>That's that DC said,</v>

6182
02:41:10.651 --> 02:41:11.970
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to hit me with that left kick.</v>

6183
02:41:12.210 --> 02:41:12.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6184
02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Literally said that because he was saying he exposes some tendencies like,</v>

6185
02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:16.201
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

6186
02:41:16.201 --> 02:41:17.034
<v Speaker 3>you mean the left care,</v>

6187
02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:19.770
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to hit me with that left hot kick and then boom,</v>

6188
02:41:19.771 --> 02:41:21.030
<v Speaker 3>he lands a left high kick.</v>

6189
02:41:21.270 --> 02:41:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Is that like the titanic a little bit like,</v>

6190
02:41:24.090 --> 02:41:24.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

6191
02:41:24.510 --> 02:41:26.070
<v Speaker 3>It only saying because they said it wouldn't.</v>

6192
02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:26.581
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6193
02:41:26.581 --> 02:41:27.414
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

6194
02:41:27.510 --> 02:41:27.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

6195
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:29.130
<v Speaker 3>but that's kind of crazy.</v>

6196
02:41:29.210 --> 02:41:30.043
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6197
02:41:30.150 --> 02:41:31.890
<v Speaker 3>We are a couple,</v>

6198
02:41:31.891 --> 02:41:34.830
<v Speaker 3>a couple of weeks ago I saw you at the comedy store and you ask me about your</v>

6199
02:41:34.831 --> 02:41:35.880
<v Speaker 3>boy Brendan.</v>

6200
02:41:36.180 --> 02:41:36.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6201
02:41:36.780 --> 02:41:39.180
<v Speaker 3>And like you,</v>

6202
02:41:39.181 --> 02:41:40.410
<v Speaker 3>you had asked me about you,</v>

6203
02:41:40.420 --> 02:41:41.200
<v Speaker 3>you were to explain,</v>

6204
02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:43.660
<v Speaker 3>explain the whole thing to people that don't know the story.</v>

6205
02:41:43.710 --> 02:41:48.710
<v Speaker 3>Brendan said something where he was talking about UFC tonight,</v>

6206
02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:50.391
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

6207
02:41:50.391 --> 02:41:50.491
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

6208
02:41:50.491 --> 02:41:51.300
<v Speaker 3>you'll see tonight,</v>

6209
02:41:51.300 --> 02:41:51.571
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

6210
02:41:51.571 --> 02:41:56.520
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about the pat of the Fox Paddle Fox panel and he said something</v>

6211
02:41:56.521 --> 02:41:57.030
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

6212
02:41:57.030 --> 02:41:57.840
<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>

6213
02:41:57.840 --> 02:41:58.411
<v Speaker 3>Fox,</v>

6214
02:41:58.411 --> 02:41:59.580
<v Speaker 3>you're not racist.</v>

6215
02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:03.030
<v Speaker 3>Like saying that you have a bunch of black people on it.</v>

6216
02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:03.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6217
02:42:03.430 --> 02:42:03.801
<v Speaker 3>Fell off,</v>

6218
02:42:03.801 --> 02:42:06.720
<v Speaker 3>fell broadcasts and because they're not racist,</v>

6219
02:42:06.780 --> 02:42:07.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6220
02:42:07.350 --> 02:42:08.240
<v Speaker 3>myself tiring.</v>

6221
02:42:08.241 --> 02:42:08.471
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

6222
02:42:08.471 --> 02:42:10.980
<v Speaker 3>and Karen Bryant with the three that were on the desk that day,</v>

6223
02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:14.580
<v Speaker 3>but also a lot of times we're shod a lot of times DC.</v>

6224
02:42:15.290 --> 02:42:16.123
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6225
02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:18.210
<v Speaker 3>and so it was like,</v>

6226
02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:20.750
<v Speaker 3>I bet are you checking off boxes because the,</v>

6227
02:42:20.751 --> 02:42:23.100
<v Speaker 3>are these the best brains in the best speakers for this,</v>

6228
02:42:23.101 --> 02:42:23.934
<v Speaker 3>for the job.</v>

6229
02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:24.833
<v Speaker 3>And it was like,</v>

6230
02:42:25.080 --> 02:42:26.250
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

6231
02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:26.890
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6232
02:42:26.890 --> 02:42:31.170
<v Speaker 3>some people see the point that he was trying to make the point that he claims</v>

6233
02:42:31.171 --> 02:42:32.040
<v Speaker 3>that he was trying to make.</v>

6234
02:42:32.340 --> 02:42:33.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6235
02:42:33.030 --> 02:42:33.811
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is,</v>

6236
02:42:33.811 --> 02:42:34.201
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

6237
02:42:34.201 --> 02:42:35.100
<v Speaker 3>when you start,</v>

6238
02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:37.140
<v Speaker 3>when you start in on this race thing,</v>

6239
02:42:37.350 --> 02:42:40.650
<v Speaker 3>you're saying effectively that these,</v>

6240
02:42:40.770 --> 02:42:45.660
<v Speaker 3>there's a person or a group of these people are only there because of the color</v>

6241
02:42:45.661 --> 02:42:46.494
<v Speaker 3>of their skin.</v>

6242
02:42:46.620 --> 02:42:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6243
02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6244
02:42:47.700 --> 02:42:48.031
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

6245
02:42:48.031 --> 02:42:49.860
<v Speaker 3>you could say all of that without,</v>

6246
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:51.120
<v Speaker 3>without the whole,</v>

6247
02:42:51.121 --> 02:42:51.541
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

6248
02:42:51.541 --> 02:42:52.351
<v Speaker 3>You're not racist,</v>

6249
02:42:52.351 --> 02:42:54.450
<v Speaker 3>you're are you checking off boxes or whatever.</v>

6250
02:42:54.750 --> 02:42:55.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6251
02:42:55.110 --> 02:42:57.990
<v Speaker 3>Because if that doesn't matter to the question,</v>

6252
02:42:57.991 --> 02:42:59.580
<v Speaker 3>that was the point that you're trying to make them.</v>

6253
02:42:59.581 --> 02:43:00.350
<v Speaker 3>Why bring it up,</v>

6254
02:43:00.350 --> 02:43:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Brian?</v>

6255
02:43:00.770 --> 02:43:01.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6256
02:43:01.230 --> 02:43:01.890
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

6257
02:43:01.890 --> 02:43:04.440
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I know Brendan very well.</v>

6258
02:43:04.470 --> 02:43:05.190
<v Speaker 3>I love him.</v>

6259
02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:06.390
<v Speaker 3>He's one of my best friends.</v>

6260
02:43:06.450 --> 02:43:07.740
<v Speaker 3>He's definitely not a racist,</v>

6261
02:43:07.741 --> 02:43:09.180
<v Speaker 3>but he definitely talks too much.</v>

6262
02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:09.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6263
02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:11.410
<v Speaker 3>And I don't mean that in a bad way.</v>

6264
02:43:11.411 --> 02:43:11.980
<v Speaker 3>Like he talks</v>

6265
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:12.371
<v Speaker 2>too much.</v>

6266
02:43:12.371 --> 02:43:12.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6267
02:43:12.641 --> 02:43:16.450
<v Speaker 2>like he says his too many podcasts and too many things and you say things and</v>

6268
02:43:16.451 --> 02:43:16.781
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

6269
02:43:16.781 --> 02:43:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm 100% guilty of this.</v>

6270
02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:20.410
<v Speaker 2>He say things and you're like,</v>

6271
02:43:20.411 --> 02:43:21.340
<v Speaker 2>why don't even say that?</v>

6272
02:43:21.550 --> 02:43:23.910
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden you're defending it and then you're,</v>

6273
02:43:23.940 --> 02:43:24.773
<v Speaker 2>you're caught up in,</v>

6274
02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:25.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6275
02:43:25.750 --> 02:43:30.750
<v Speaker 2>just like a wave of just trying to sort out what you're saying without someone</v>

6276
02:43:31.961 --> 02:43:33.010
<v Speaker 2>being there to say,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6298
02:44:00.821 --> 02:44:01.960
<v Speaker 2>you have just,</v>

6299
02:44:01.961 --> 02:44:06.430
<v Speaker 2>they're just elite top of the food chain fighters and analysts.</v>

6300
02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:09.400
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a bad path to go down.</v>

6301
02:44:09.430 --> 02:44:10.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it made sense.</v>

6302
02:44:11.620 --> 02:44:12.430
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

6303
02:44:12.430 --> 02:44:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I think he thought it made sense in his head when he was saying it.</v>

6304
02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.310
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe he was trying to be controversial.</v>

6305
02:44:19.300 --> 02:44:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Maybe just,</v>

6306
02:44:20.710 --> 02:44:21.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6307
02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:21.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6308
02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:22.750
<v Speaker 2>it didn't make sense to me.</v>

6309
02:44:22.820 --> 02:44:23.091
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6310
02:44:23.091 --> 02:44:24.350
<v Speaker 4>It didn't make sense to me though.</v>

6311
02:44:24.351 --> 02:44:25.041
<v Speaker 4>But like my,</v>

6312
02:44:25.041 --> 02:44:27.650
<v Speaker 4>my thing about it wasn't okay,</v>

6313
02:44:27.651 --> 02:44:28.820
<v Speaker 4>you're being racist.</v>

6314
02:44:28.910 --> 02:44:29.330
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

6315
02:44:29.330 --> 02:44:29.870
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6316
02:44:29.870 --> 02:44:30.231
<v Speaker 4>like it's,</v>

6317
02:44:30.231 --> 02:44:32.000
<v Speaker 4>it's a thing when you bring race into the,</v>

6318
02:44:32.210 --> 02:44:33.230
<v Speaker 4>to the situation too.</v>

6319
02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:33.861
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6320
02:44:33.861 --> 02:44:35.000
<v Speaker 4>But my thing wasn't,</v>

6321
02:44:35.240 --> 02:44:36.860
<v Speaker 4>you're racist because you say this.</v>

6322
02:44:37.010 --> 02:44:41.930
<v Speaker 4>My thing was you're saying that I'm in this position because I'm not good</v>

6323
02:44:41.931 --> 02:44:42.440
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>

6324
02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:42.740
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6325
02:44:42.740 --> 02:44:46.430
<v Speaker 4>You're saying that I'm only here because of affirmative action or whatever you</v>

6326
02:44:46.431 --> 02:44:47.264
<v Speaker 4>want to call it,</v>

6327
02:44:47.390 --> 02:44:47.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6328
02:44:47.930 --> 02:44:48.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

6329
02:44:48.250 --> 02:44:51.110
<v Speaker 4>there's not a quality to my work and that's where I'm like,</v>

6330
02:44:51.111 --> 02:44:51.710
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

6331
02:44:51.710 --> 02:44:52.281
<v Speaker 4>fuck that.</v>

6332
02:44:52.281 --> 02:44:52.461
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

6333
02:44:52.461 --> 02:44:53.151
<v Speaker 4>that's not the case.</v>

6334
02:44:53.151 --> 02:44:53.570
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

6335
02:44:53.570 --> 02:44:54.500
<v Speaker 4>I know that I'm good at,</v>

6336
02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:56.220
<v Speaker 4>I know that I'm good at the sport,</v>

6337
02:44:56.250 --> 02:44:59.510
<v Speaker 4>I understand the sport and I'm good at explaining what I see.</v>

6338
02:44:59.750 --> 02:44:59.990

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6345
02:45:07.551 --> 02:45:08.290
<v Speaker 4>On the GIG.</v>

6346
02:45:08.290 --> 02:45:08.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6347
02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:09.560
<v Speaker 4>Like who's,</v>

6348
02:45:09.660 --> 02:45:11.690

6349
02:45:11.870 --> 02:45:12.111
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6350
02:45:12.111 --> 02:45:14.810
<v Speaker 4>Who's not getting the job though as they're like someone who's like,</v>

6351
02:45:14.811 --> 02:45:15.051
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

6352
02:45:15.051 --> 02:45:16.340
<v Speaker 4>this guy really speaks really well,</v>

6353
02:45:16.341 --> 02:45:17.690
<v Speaker 4>but they're holding them down because he's white.</v>

6354
02:45:18.540 --> 02:45:19.610
<v Speaker 4>Has that even happened?</v>

6355
02:45:20.060 --> 02:45:20.421
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6356
02:45:20.421 --> 02:45:22.100
<v Speaker 4>Some people they would probably be like that to happen,</v>

6357
02:45:22.101 --> 02:45:23.480
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that's actually happened.</v>

6358
02:45:23.510 --> 02:45:23.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6359
02:45:23.890 --> 02:45:24.270
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

6360
02:45:24.270 --> 02:45:25.580
<v Speaker 4>I agree completely,</v>

6361
02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:26.360
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

6362
02:45:26.360 --> 02:45:27.200
<v Speaker 4>so we kind of,</v>

6363
02:45:27.320 --> 02:45:28.370
<v Speaker 4>we kind of went through that.</v>

6364
02:45:28.371 --> 02:45:28.761
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6365
02:45:28.761 --> 02:45:29.031
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

02:45:29.031 --> 02:45:29.570

02:45:30.591 --> 02:45:32.630
<v Speaker 4>he apologized about that and I was like,</v>

6369
02:45:32.631 --> 02:45:33.140
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

6370
02:45:33.140 --> 02:45:36.200
<v Speaker 4>Like my thing was not about the race thing.</v>

6371
02:45:36.201 --> 02:45:37.100

6373
02:45:42.981 --> 02:45:44.480

6374
02:45:44.510 --> 02:45:47.690
<v Speaker 2>You're insinuating that a group of people that you belong to.</v>

6375
02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:47.931
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6377
02:45:49.210 --> 02:45:49.690
<v Speaker 4>So that,</v>

6378
02:45:49.690 --> 02:45:50.060
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

6379
02:45:50.060 --> 02:45:51.740

6382
02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:56.960

6383
02:45:57.050 --> 02:45:57.950
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>10 minutes and then the dude just hanging out behind us and I'm just like,</v>

6442
02:47:00.580 --> 02:47:01.391
<v Speaker 4>that's all I got man.</v>

6443
02:47:01.391 --> 02:47:02.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm going back to my seat.</v>

6444
02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:04.120
<v Speaker 4>When the guy jumped in,</v>

6445
02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:05.260
<v Speaker 4>the guy jumps right back in.</v>

6446
02:47:05.320 --> 02:47:06.460
<v Speaker 4>That's the extent of it.</v>

6447
02:47:06.461 --> 02:47:08.290
<v Speaker 4>I've seen him at different places beyond that.</v>

6448
02:47:08.291 --> 02:47:08.501
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6449
02:47:08.501 --> 02:47:09.430
<v Speaker 4>Brian and I are cool.</v>

6450
02:47:09.431 --> 02:47:11.260
<v Speaker 4>So I've seen him sometimes when I seen Brian,</v>

6451
02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:12.580
<v Speaker 4>but like we're not boys.</v>

6452
02:47:12.581 --> 02:47:13.810
<v Speaker 4>We don't know each other like that.</v>

6453
02:47:13.811 --> 02:47:13.991
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

6454
02:47:13.991 --> 02:47:14.890
<v Speaker 4>and like she,</v>

6455
02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:16.690
<v Speaker 4>and you're not a psychologist,</v>

6456
02:47:16.691 --> 02:47:17.620
<v Speaker 4>you're not a psychiatrist,</v>

6457
02:47:17.621 --> 02:47:19.840
<v Speaker 4>so you're not qualified to be speaking on my mental state.</v>

6458
02:47:20.130 --> 02:47:20.280
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

6459
02:47:20.280 --> 02:47:21.060
<v Speaker 2>That he said that.</v>

6460
02:47:21.060 --> 02:47:23.130
<v Speaker 2>I feel like now that I'm remembering it,</v>

6461
02:47:23.131 --> 02:47:25.320
<v Speaker 2>you might've brought that up at the comedy store the other night.</v>

6462
02:47:25.380 --> 02:47:26.460
<v Speaker 2>It didn't make any sense.</v>

6463
02:47:26.580 --> 02:47:27.340
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any I,</v>

6464
02:47:27.340 --> 02:47:30.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm Brendan's friend and I can't defend them on that cause it doesn't make any</v>

6465
02:47:30.331 --> 02:47:30.810
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

6466
02:47:30.810 --> 02:47:31.643
<v Speaker 2>It just didn't,</v>

6467
02:47:33.060 --> 02:47:34.110
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

6468
02:47:34.270 --> 02:47:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6469
02:47:34.590 --> 02:47:35.910
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes he says,</v>

6470
02:47:35.911 --> 02:47:36.121
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

6471
02:47:36.121 --> 02:47:36.841
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make sense.</v>

6472
02:47:36.841 --> 02:47:38.580
<v Speaker 2>And maybe if you were in the room with them,</v>

6473
02:47:38.730 --> 02:47:39.750
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't have said it.</v>

6474
02:47:39.870 --> 02:47:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe he would have said it better.</v>

6475
02:47:41.790 --> 02:47:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe he would have,</v>

6476
02:47:43.030 --> 02:47:43.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6477
02:47:43.310 --> 02:47:43.561
<v Speaker 2>set.</v>

6478
02:47:43.561 --> 02:47:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Are these really the best minds?</v>

6479
02:47:45.060 --> 02:47:46.110
<v Speaker 2>But here's the argument.</v>

6480
02:47:46.290 --> 02:47:46.981
<v Speaker 2>If they're not,</v>

6481
02:47:46.981 --> 02:47:48.750
<v Speaker 2>who are like,</v>

6482
02:47:48.751 --> 02:47:49.201
<v Speaker 2>you really,</v>

6483
02:47:49.201 --> 02:47:49.771
<v Speaker 2>if you say,</v>

6484
02:47:49.771 --> 02:47:51.060
<v Speaker 2>are these really the best minds,</v>

6485
02:47:51.061 --> 02:47:52.980
<v Speaker 2>you really should provide better alternatives.</v>

6486
02:47:53.070 --> 02:47:54.630
<v Speaker 2>So who are the better alternatives?</v>

6487
02:47:55.180 --> 02:47:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Who is a better alternative?</v>

6488
02:47:56.521 --> 02:47:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

6489
02:47:57.090 --> 02:47:58.650
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of really good guys online.</v>

6490
02:47:58.650 --> 02:48:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Brendan Dorman does some really good stuff.</v>

6491
02:48:00.271 --> 02:48:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Lawrence Kenshin does some really good stuff about analyzing stuff.</v>

6492
02:48:02.641 --> 02:48:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how good they are on camera.</v>

6493
02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:05.580
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of people like,</v>

6494
02:48:05.581 --> 02:48:06.414
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6495
02:48:07.020 --> 02:48:10.620
<v Speaker 2>you know that the do good Robin black does some real good breakdowns and stuff</v>

6496
02:48:10.621 --> 02:48:11.041
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

6497
02:48:11.041 --> 02:48:13.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe there's an argument that he would do a great job,</v>

6498
02:48:13.771 --> 02:48:14.940
<v Speaker 2>but something like that for sure.</v>

6499
02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:17.340
<v Speaker 2>But you got to provide,</v>

6500
02:48:17.470 --> 02:48:22.470
<v Speaker 2>if it's not like there's like some overwhelming absence of the best guys where</v>

6501
02:48:23.761 --> 02:48:24.331
<v Speaker 2>they're saying,</v>

6502
02:48:24.331 --> 02:48:24.900
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

6503
02:48:24.900 --> 02:48:28.860
<v Speaker 2>why are you going with these black guys instead of going with the best guys?</v>

6504
02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you have blah blah blah,</v>

6505
02:48:30.540 --> 02:48:31.201
<v Speaker 2>there's no blah blah,</v>

6506
02:48:31.201 --> 02:48:31.620
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

6507
02:48:31.620 --> 02:48:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no guy out there.</v>

6508
02:48:32.731 --> 02:48:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6509
02:48:33.330 --> 02:48:33.811
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6510
02:48:33.811 --> 02:48:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Like who would that guy be?</v>

6511
02:48:35.480 --> 02:48:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6512
02:48:35.700 --> 02:48:36.540
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

6513
02:48:36.541 --> 02:48:37.680
<v Speaker 4>But there's also a formula.</v>

6514
02:48:37.710 --> 02:48:42.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean like you and Jimmy Smith kind of other exception to the formula and the</v>

6515
02:48:43.291 --> 02:48:44.400
<v Speaker 4>formula is to have,</v>

6516
02:48:44.610 --> 02:48:44.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6517
02:48:44.941 --> 02:48:45.221
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

6518
02:48:45.221 --> 02:48:47.810
<v Speaker 4>the color guy in the play by play guy in the play by play guy.</v>

6519
02:48:47.811 --> 02:48:49.890
<v Speaker 4>He's usually the one with the actual experience.</v>

6520
02:48:49.910 --> 02:48:50.130
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

6521
02:48:50.130 --> 02:48:51.510
<v Speaker 4>You've been doing it so long,</v>

6522
02:48:51.630 --> 02:48:53.510
<v Speaker 4>you're as close to having the experiences.</v>

6523
02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:54.370
<v Speaker 4>Anybody can write</v>

6524
02:48:54.430 --> 02:48:55.330
<v Speaker 2>without having it.</v>

6525
02:48:55.670 --> 02:48:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Mel and Jimmy's right there next to you in that was more experienced than me</v>

6526
02:48:59.381 --> 02:49:00.250
<v Speaker 2>cause he's fought MMA,</v>

6527
02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:00.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6528
02:49:00.510 --> 02:49:00.781
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6529
02:49:00.781 --> 02:49:01.591
<v Speaker 4>He had some,</v>

6530
02:49:01.591 --> 02:49:02.910
<v Speaker 4>he's had a couple of fights.</v>

6531
02:49:02.930 --> 02:49:03.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6532
02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:03.330
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

6533
02:49:03.330 --> 02:49:07.590
<v Speaker 4>Not at that level but he understands Robin black has had like two or three</v>

6534
02:49:07.591 --> 02:49:08.424
<v Speaker 4>fights also,</v>

6535
02:49:08.820 --> 02:49:09.420
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

6536
02:49:09.420 --> 02:49:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6537
02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:12.390
<v Speaker 2>so that's the formula though.</v>

6538
02:49:12.450 --> 02:49:13.283
<v Speaker 2>You know I'm,</v>

6539
02:49:13.290 --> 02:49:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Karen is on the other side of that.</v>

6540
02:49:14.941 --> 02:49:18.420
<v Speaker 2>Karen just her role is similar to Goldie's.</v>

6541
02:49:18.421 --> 02:49:19.254
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6542
02:49:19.650 --> 02:49:24.650
<v Speaker 2>she is the person that that asks the questions that has an idea but doesn't have</v>

6543
02:49:25.021 --> 02:49:27.600
<v Speaker 2>the experience right now and she represents,</v>

6544
02:49:27.601 --> 02:49:29.580
<v Speaker 2>she represents the fan for the most part.</v>

6545
02:49:29.581 --> 02:49:31.650
<v Speaker 2>She does it in a non robotic way.</v>

6546
02:49:31.651 --> 02:49:31.951
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6547
02:49:31.951 --> 02:49:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Very important to like for the person watching.</v>

6548
02:49:34.860 --> 02:49:39.300
<v Speaker 2>If you've got some guy who's like a radio DJ coming out to those people,</v>

6549
02:49:39.301 --> 02:49:43.080
<v Speaker 2>they know how to say the right words and they can do it and seem professional</v>

6550
02:49:43.380 --> 02:49:44.213
<v Speaker 2>but you don't,</v>

6551
02:49:44.220 --> 02:49:45.420
<v Speaker 2>it's your not smooth.</v>

6552
02:49:45.421 --> 02:49:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Karen knows how to be fun and she can be loose and she's non robotic</v>

6553
02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:52.230
<v Speaker 2>while she be knowledge professional.</v>

6554
02:49:52.580 --> 02:49:54.240
<v Speaker 2>She has a knowledge of the sport.</v>

6555
02:49:54.241 --> 02:49:55.970
<v Speaker 2>To some degree and a cushion for it.</v>

6556
02:49:56.200 --> 02:49:56.731
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

6557
02:49:56.731 --> 02:49:59.850
<v Speaker 2>The Passion is what makes it makes it even more out of her.</v>

6558
02:49:59.851 --> 02:50:00.240
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

6559
02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:02.700
<v Speaker 2>I was watching NFL the other day and I was watching.</v>

6560
02:50:02.701 --> 02:50:02.941
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

6561
02:50:02.941 --> 02:50:03.241
<v Speaker 2>it was with,</v>

6562
02:50:03.241 --> 02:50:05.160
<v Speaker 2>you were whatever it was where I was like,</v>

6563
02:50:05.161 --> 02:50:09.030
<v Speaker 2>does that girl really the best person to be interviewing these fucking giants?</v>

6564
02:50:09.270 --> 02:50:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't you?</v>

6565
02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:10.530
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

6566
02:50:10.530 --> 02:50:11.363
<v Speaker 2>is that girl?</v>

6567
02:50:11.830 --> 02:50:12.600
<v Speaker 2>But she's hot.</v>

6568
02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:13.680
<v Speaker 2>She's hot as fuck.</v>

6569
02:50:13.681 --> 02:50:13.951
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

6570
02:50:13.951 --> 02:50:15.930
<v Speaker 2>does she really know about football?</v>

6571
02:50:15.931 --> 02:50:18.780
<v Speaker 2>Or she is just a gig because she wants to be famous.</v>

6572
02:50:18.781 --> 02:50:19.201
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

6573
02:50:19.201 --> 02:50:20.070
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of those.</v>

6574
02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you would say,</v>

6575
02:50:21.181 --> 02:50:21.960
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

6576
02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:24.540
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be someone out there that's better,</v>

6577
02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:27.060
<v Speaker 2>who really understands the game,</v>

6578
02:50:27.150 --> 02:50:31.020
<v Speaker 2>who could get in there and ask questions to this dude and find out why,</v>

6579
02:50:31.050 --> 02:50:32.520
<v Speaker 2>why they chose that play,</v>

6580
02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:33.810
<v Speaker 2>what went wrong?</v>

6581
02:50:33.900 --> 02:50:35.160
<v Speaker 2>What was he thinking when this happened?</v>

6582
02:50:35.161 --> 02:50:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Like someone who really is a fan of it.</v>

6583
02:50:37.770 --> 02:50:39.360
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want to see with fighting,</v>

6584
02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:40.261
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

6585
02:50:40.261 --> 02:50:40.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6586
02:50:40.740 --> 02:50:41.610
<v Speaker 2>that to me,</v>

6587
02:50:41.611 --> 02:50:44.160
<v Speaker 2>fighting is so much more personal,</v>

6588
02:50:44.161 --> 02:50:45.510
<v Speaker 2>so much more intense.</v>

6589
02:50:45.930 --> 02:50:50.520
<v Speaker 2>When I see someone that's interviewing someone,</v>

6590
02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:53.670
<v Speaker 2>I want to see someone who really fucking cares because I know there's a lot of</v>

6591
02:50:53.671 --> 02:50:55.350
<v Speaker 2>people who do care and I care.</v>

6592
02:50:55.650 --> 02:50:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Like if I'm interviewing someone after a fight,</v>

6593
02:50:57.720 --> 02:51:02.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying my best to figure out like what was happening in their head.</v>

6594
02:51:02.041 --> 02:51:05.250
<v Speaker 2>There's some critical moments I want to know was this there?</v>

6595
02:51:05.251 --> 02:51:06.270
<v Speaker 2>Was this a plan?</v>

6596
02:51:06.330 --> 02:51:07.800
<v Speaker 2>Did you see this in advance?</v>

6597
02:51:07.801 --> 02:51:10.050
<v Speaker 2>Does something you saw in training when you're watching tapes?</v>

6598
02:51:10.210 --> 02:51:13.020
<v Speaker 2>I've questioned it's like fan questions.</v>

6599
02:51:13.140 --> 02:51:15.420
<v Speaker 2>So I do my best to relay those.</v>

6600
02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:16.500
<v Speaker 2>That's what I do my best.</v>

6601
02:51:16.650 --> 02:51:21.650
<v Speaker 2>If I feel like someone phoning it in or this isn't a job they're interested in</v>

6602
02:51:21.871 --> 02:51:22.980
<v Speaker 2>or they really just want to be.</v>

6603
02:51:22.980 --> 02:51:23.900
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

6604
02:51:23.910 --> 02:51:24.743
<v Speaker 2>some other sport,</v>

6605
02:51:24.750 --> 02:51:27.000
<v Speaker 2>they really wanted to be a fucking baseball commentator,</v>

6606
02:51:27.001 --> 02:51:27.834
<v Speaker 2>but there was no gig.</v>

6607
02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6608
02:51:28.400 --> 02:51:29.940
<v Speaker 2>they're just fucking half ass in it,</v>

6609
02:51:30.120 --> 02:51:30.540
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

6610
02:51:30.540 --> 02:51:31.020
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

6611
02:51:31.020 --> 02:51:31.350
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

6612
02:51:31.350 --> 02:51:32.140
<v Speaker 2>it's weak,</v>

6613
02:51:32.140 --> 02:51:32.840
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible.</v>

6614
02:51:32.840 --> 02:51:33.980
<v Speaker 2>I one thing I love,</v>

6615
02:51:33.981 --> 02:51:35.370
<v Speaker 2>the one thing I always tried to do,</v>

6616
02:51:35.550 --> 02:51:36.640
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to make,</v>

6617
02:51:36.730 --> 02:51:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I tried to make you laugh every post fight,</v>

6618
02:51:39.151 --> 02:51:39.460
<v Speaker 2>interview,</v>

6619
02:51:39.460 --> 02:51:40.290
<v Speaker 2>any time.</v>

6620
02:51:40.290 --> 02:51:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Like it was like I won.</v>

6621
02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Have knock out.</v>

6622
02:51:42.510 --> 02:51:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6623
02:51:43.080 --> 02:51:43.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to talk to Jill.</v>

6624
02:51:43.970 --> 02:51:44.251
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

6625
02:51:44.251 --> 02:51:45.090
<v Speaker 2>let's see what he gives me.</v>

6626
02:51:45.091 --> 02:51:45.901
<v Speaker 2>See if he gives me something,</v>

6627
02:51:45.901 --> 02:51:46.734
<v Speaker 2>I could try to make it.</v>

6628
02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I came with something set up,</v>

6629
02:51:49.860 --> 02:51:50.251
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

6630
02:51:50.251 --> 02:51:51.660
<v Speaker 2>there's one time I forget who it was.</v>

6631
02:51:51.661 --> 02:51:53.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a Jeremy Stephens and um,</v>

6632
02:51:53.980 --> 02:51:57.090
<v Speaker 2>you had asked me to take you through the replay and I was literally watching it</v>

6633
02:51:57.390 --> 02:51:58.340
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

6634
02:51:58.620 --> 02:52:01.260
<v Speaker 2>you had asked me question and I wasn't even paying attention to you,</v>

6635
02:52:01.530 --> 02:52:03.030
<v Speaker 2>but so it worked out perfectly.</v>

6636
02:52:03.470 --> 02:52:04.310
<v Speaker 2>You would like to,</v>

6637
02:52:04.410 --> 02:52:05.200
<v Speaker 2>I was like jobs.</v>

6638
02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:06.070
<v Speaker 2>I was watching that</v>

6639
02:52:06.460 --> 02:52:08.710
<v Speaker 5>and I was going to ask you to ask the question again and it hit me.</v>

6640
02:52:08.711 --> 02:52:09.544
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

6641
02:52:09.700 --> 02:52:10.780
<v Speaker 5>and I was just thinking,</v>

6642
02:52:10.810 --> 02:52:11.141
<v Speaker 5>damn,</v>

6643
02:52:11.141 --> 02:52:11.974
<v Speaker 5>I'm smooth</v>

6644
02:52:14.570 --> 02:52:16.240
<v Speaker 5>and I got that reaction out of you.</v>

6645
02:52:16.270 --> 02:52:17.103
<v Speaker 5>So that was fun.</v>

6646
02:52:17.120 --> 02:52:18.630
<v Speaker 5>That would be the actual reaction.</v>

6647
02:52:18.680 --> 02:52:23.050
<v Speaker 5>He said that I also like helping the Gar celebrate,</v>

6648
02:52:23.080 --> 02:52:23.331
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6649
02:52:23.331 --> 02:52:27.550
<v Speaker 5>like there's moments like when someone does something where someone almost has</v>

6650
02:52:27.551 --> 02:52:29.950
<v Speaker 5>to tell you like how amazing that was.</v>

6651
02:52:29.980 --> 02:52:30.131
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

6652
02:52:30.131 --> 02:52:30.491
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6653
02:52:30.491 --> 02:52:31.121
<v Speaker 5>it was amazing,</v>

6654
02:52:31.121 --> 02:52:31.610
<v Speaker 5>but I want to,</v>

6655
02:52:31.610 --> 02:52:33.160
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to let you feel it even more.</v>

6656
02:52:33.161 --> 02:52:33.994
<v Speaker 5>I want you to,</v>

6657
02:52:34.030 --> 02:52:34.301

02:52:34.301 --> 02:52:34.840
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

6659
02:52:34.840 --> 02:52:35.680
<v Speaker 5>like when rose,</v>

6660
02:52:35.681 --> 02:52:37.180
<v Speaker 5>Nama Eunice beat you,</v>

6661
02:52:37.181 --> 02:52:42.010
<v Speaker 5>Ana like dad to me it's like one of my favorite all time post fight interviews</v>

6662
02:52:42.310 --> 02:52:42.821
<v Speaker 5>cause she's like,</v>

6663
02:52:42.821 --> 02:52:43.990
<v Speaker 5>y'all just be a good person.</v>

6664
02:52:44.180 --> 02:52:45.250
<v Speaker 5>It's about don't mean shit.</v>

6665
02:52:48.010 --> 02:52:49.780
<v Speaker 5>Damn rose is out there.</v>

6666
02:52:50.050 --> 02:52:50.501
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6667
02:52:50.501 --> 02:52:51.760
<v Speaker 5>she's so unusual.</v>

6668
02:52:51.970 --> 02:52:56.970
<v Speaker 5>And to have her walk through it like this impossible underdog coming in and even</v>

6669
02:52:57.341 --> 02:52:57.911
<v Speaker 5>if she wanted,</v>

6670
02:52:57.911 --> 02:52:59.350
<v Speaker 5>but he thought she went by submission.</v>

6671
02:52:59.630 --> 02:53:02.260
<v Speaker 5>I didn't think she'd just stepped in and cracker with a left hook and then</v>

6672
02:53:02.270 --> 02:53:03.100
<v Speaker 5>dropper.</v>

6673
02:53:03.100 --> 02:53:03.933
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

6674
02:53:04.240 --> 02:53:05.170
<v Speaker 5>That was crazy.</v>

6675
02:53:05.230 --> 02:53:07.180
<v Speaker 5>Like watching that fight was crazy.</v>

6676
02:53:08.920 --> 02:53:10.260
<v Speaker 5>Here's a good one for you on it.</v>

6677
02:53:10.261 --> 02:53:11.500
<v Speaker 5>On an another big fight.</v>

6678
02:53:11.501 --> 02:53:14.020
<v Speaker 5>I feel like there is a moment right in a fight,</v>

6679
02:53:14.021 --> 02:53:18.250
<v Speaker 5>especially when you get a finish sometimes is a moment that comes just before</v>

6680
02:53:18.251 --> 02:53:21.460
<v Speaker 5>the finish that you recognize this opportunities there and you jump on it.</v>

6681
02:53:21.880 --> 02:53:22.510
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6682
02:53:22.510 --> 02:53:25.300
<v Speaker 5>and then there are times when like before the moment happens,</v>

6683
02:53:25.301 --> 02:53:28.420
<v Speaker 5>it's like before the shot comes just like this guy's about to fill this right</v>

6684
02:53:28.421 --> 02:53:31.510
<v Speaker 5>hand and I know I'm going to slip it and drop and drop my right on top of it.</v>

6685
02:53:31.810 --> 02:53:32.160
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

6686
02:53:32.160 --> 02:53:32.590
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6687
02:53:32.590 --> 02:53:34.360
<v Speaker 5>but then there are times when you hit a guy and it's like,</v>

6688
02:53:34.450 --> 02:53:35.860
<v Speaker 5>oh this is my chance.</v>

6689
02:53:36.040 --> 02:53:36.290
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

6690
02:53:36.290 --> 02:53:38.350
<v Speaker 5>Jump on him and you know,</v>

6691
02:53:38.351 --> 02:53:42.850
<v Speaker 5>the end is near and all that rush when the referee steps that,</v>

6692
02:53:42.851 --> 02:53:43.870
<v Speaker 5>that's the moment.</v>

6693
02:53:43.871 --> 02:53:47.140
<v Speaker 5>That's the biggest moment when the referee stops the fight,</v>

6694
02:53:47.320 --> 02:53:48.153
<v Speaker 5>that's when you come.</v>

6695
02:53:48.580 --> 02:53:49.413
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

6696
02:53:49.510 --> 02:53:54.510
<v Speaker 5>So like if you can figure out how to ask that question because getting good,</v>

6697
02:53:57.160 --> 02:53:59.980
<v Speaker 5>getting someone to explain that moment is,</v>

6698
02:54:00.070 --> 02:54:02.770
<v Speaker 5>is if they can translate that.</v>

6699
02:54:02.771 --> 02:54:03.551
<v Speaker 5>That's so sweet.</v>

6700
02:54:03.551 --> 02:54:05.920
<v Speaker 5>Cause like I like I can think of what my lab,</v>

6701
02:54:05.980 --> 02:54:09.790
<v Speaker 5>one of my last vice when it was Steven's like when I hit him I didn't,</v>

6702
02:54:09.820 --> 02:54:13.120
<v Speaker 5>I knew what I was doing and I knew I was going to land the punch.</v>

6703
02:54:13.700 --> 02:54:14.620
<v Speaker 5>Then as he went down,</v>

6704
02:54:14.621 --> 02:54:15.454
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

6705
02:54:15.640 --> 02:54:16.420
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit,</v>

6706
02:54:16.420 --> 02:54:19.030
<v Speaker 5>here's that moment when you jump on it,</v>

6707
02:54:19.060 --> 02:54:19.893
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6708
02:54:20.260 --> 02:54:21.400
<v Speaker 5>being able to beat,</v>

6709
02:54:21.460 --> 02:54:21.810
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

6710
02:54:21.810 --> 02:54:24.040
<v Speaker 5>that's what the best thing to get out of guys.</v>

6711
02:54:24.040 --> 02:54:24.311
<v Speaker 5>And you,</v>

6712
02:54:24.311 --> 02:54:25.330
<v Speaker 5>you asked that question.</v>

6713
02:54:25.331 --> 02:54:25.870
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

6714
02:54:25.870 --> 02:54:27.910
<v Speaker 5>but also if you,</v>

6715
02:54:28.010 --> 02:54:28.390
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

6716
02:54:28.390 --> 02:54:29.830
<v Speaker 5>if they can see it coming,</v>

6717
02:54:30.280 --> 02:54:30.581
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

6718
02:54:30.581 --> 02:54:31.600
<v Speaker 5>seeing that coming,</v>

6719
02:54:32.560 --> 02:54:33.101
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing.</v>

6720
02:54:33.101 --> 02:54:33.934
<v Speaker 5>That's when he's like,</v>

6721
02:54:34.330 --> 02:54:36.100
<v Speaker 5>this chick is hot and I know I'm going to get it.</v>

6722
02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:39.220
<v Speaker 5>It's that moment when it's like,</v>

6723
02:54:39.250 --> 02:54:39.491
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

6724
02:54:39.491 --> 02:54:40.630
<v Speaker 5>this is actually happening.</v>

6725
02:54:40.660 --> 02:54:42.130
<v Speaker 5>What do you miss the most about fighting?</v>

6726
02:54:43.750 --> 02:54:44.950
<v Speaker 5>Like what don't I miss?</v>

6727
02:54:45.370 --> 02:54:46.203
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

6728
02:54:46.810 --> 02:54:48.280
<v Speaker 5>I love that challenge man.</v>

6729
02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:50.760
<v Speaker 5>Like that's why I still like training and whatnot,</v>

6730
02:54:50.770 --> 02:54:51.250
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

6731
02:54:51.250 --> 02:54:52.930
<v Speaker 5>but the actual fight itself,</v>

6732
02:54:53.110 --> 02:54:54.880
<v Speaker 5>it's because everything's on the line.</v>

6733
02:54:55.030 --> 02:54:57.970
<v Speaker 5>They already thought about doing grappling competitions or anything where it's</v>

6734
02:54:57.971 --> 02:54:58.870
<v Speaker 5>no striking.</v>

6735
02:55:00.010 --> 02:55:00.670
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

6736
02:55:00.670 --> 02:55:01.930
<v Speaker 5>I have not.</v>

6737
02:55:02.250 --> 02:55:02.650
<v Speaker 5>I've been,</v>

6738
02:55:02.650 --> 02:55:04.040
<v Speaker 5>I thought it once or twice,</v>

6739
02:55:04.041 --> 02:55:05.810
<v Speaker 5>but not been committed to doing it.</v>

6740
02:55:06.070 --> 02:55:06.350
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6741
02:55:06.350 --> 02:55:08.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm starting to train more now again.</v>

6742
02:55:08.900 --> 02:55:09.590
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6743
02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:10.310
<v Speaker 5>I had some,</v>

6744
02:55:10.310 --> 02:55:12.680
<v Speaker 5>some things happening in life that were changing for me.</v>

6745
02:55:12.681 --> 02:55:15.410
<v Speaker 5>I just moved out here and I didn't have the,</v>

6746
02:55:15.411 --> 02:55:16.244
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6747
02:55:16.850 --> 02:55:18.380
<v Speaker 5>the team,</v>

6748
02:55:18.410 --> 02:55:19.610
<v Speaker 5>the foundation behind me.</v>

6749
02:55:19.850 --> 02:55:20.681
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have the,</v>

6750
02:55:20.681 --> 02:55:22.640
<v Speaker 5>the group that I was with all the time anymore.</v>

6751
02:55:22.641 --> 02:55:23.474
<v Speaker 5>I had to find a,</v>

6752
02:55:23.930 --> 02:55:24.561
<v Speaker 5>find a new group,</v>

6753
02:55:24.561 --> 02:55:27.560
<v Speaker 5>started building new group and now that we have this group,</v>

6754
02:55:27.890 --> 02:55:28.400
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6755
02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:29.450
<v Speaker 5>I feel more comfortable.</v>

6756
02:55:29.451 --> 02:55:30.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm back in the gym more,</v>

6757
02:55:30.681 --> 02:55:35.681
<v Speaker 5>I'm able to do more like that and like I'm still in good shape and yeah,</v>

6758
02:55:35.780 --> 02:55:38.210
<v Speaker 5>I feel like maybe I want to compete again,</v>

6759
02:55:38.390 --> 02:55:39.500
<v Speaker 5>but just for the fun of it,</v>

6760
02:55:39.530 --> 02:55:39.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6761
02:55:39.831 --> 02:55:42.090
<v Speaker 5>not for it not to try and be a world champion.</v>

6762
02:55:42.110 --> 02:55:43.750
<v Speaker 5>Anything as uh,</v>

6763
02:55:43.910 --> 02:55:46.400
<v Speaker 5>in MMA or compete in Jujitsu.</v>

6764
02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:48.860
<v Speaker 5>I still love him and May,</v>

6765
02:55:49.460 --> 02:55:50.570
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't make sense.</v>

6766
02:55:50.571 --> 02:55:51.404
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

6767

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6768

<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6769
02:55:52.900 --> 02:55:57.220

6770
02:55:57.221 --> 02:55:57.710
<v Speaker 5>have had.</v>

<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

6778
02:56:07.790 --> 02:56:08.251
<v Speaker 5>Like the,</v>

6779
02:56:08.251 --> 02:56:08.490
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

6780
02:56:08.490 --> 02:56:09.530
<v Speaker 5>the pride tournament.</v>

6781
02:56:09.980 --> 02:56:12.260
<v Speaker 5>I would have loved to fight everybody in that tournament.</v>

6782
02:56:12.590 --> 02:56:13.010
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

6783
02:56:13.010 --> 02:56:15.470
<v Speaker 5>every individual I find hats and that was fun.</v>

6784
02:56:15.830 --> 02:56:16.700
<v Speaker 5>He smelled like ass.</v>

6785
02:56:16.701 --> 02:56:17.534
<v Speaker 5>But that was fun.</v>

6786
02:56:17.940 --> 02:56:18.590
<v Speaker 5>It was horrible.</v>

6787
02:56:18.590 --> 02:56:19.670
<v Speaker 5>Do you think he did it on purpose?</v>

6788
02:56:19.810 --> 02:56:20.390
<v Speaker 5>One of those?</v>

6789
02:56:20.390 --> 02:56:20.871
<v Speaker 5>He does that.</v>

6790
02:56:20.871 --> 02:56:22.610
<v Speaker 5>Every fight just doesn't smell.</v>

6791
02:56:22.920 --> 02:56:23.661
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't wash her.</v>

6792
02:56:23.661 --> 02:56:24.800

6797
02:56:27.561 --> 02:56:29.540
<v Speaker 5>I like fights like that,</v>

6798
02:56:29.541 --> 02:56:30.374
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

6799
02:56:30.380 --> 02:56:31.213
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6800
02:56:31.700 --> 02:56:33.290
<v Speaker 5>but like now there's,</v>

6801
02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:34.490
<v Speaker 5>there's still some guys,</v>

6802
02:56:34.680 --> 02:56:35.513
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I have a lot of respect for.</v>

6804
02:56:37.011 --> 02:56:37.221
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

6805
02:56:37.221 --> 02:56:38.810
<v Speaker 5>I talked to Joel Lozan about it.</v>

6806
02:56:38.811 --> 02:56:39.081
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

6807
02:56:39.081 --> 02:56:39.261
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

6808
02:56:39.261 --> 02:56:40.970
<v Speaker 5>I'd love to fight a guy like Joe on,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

6810
02:56:41.900 --> 02:56:42.470

<v Speaker 5>There's almost four.</v>

6817
02:56:52.130 --> 02:56:52.850
<v Speaker 5>Almost four.</v>

6818
02:56:52.850 --> 02:56:57.740
<v Speaker 5>November before feel it seems like longer for some strange reason because you</v>

6819
02:56:57.741 --> 02:56:58.850
<v Speaker 5>just missed me till I do.</v>

6820
02:56:59.020 --> 02:56:59.580
<v Speaker 5>You just miss it,</v>

6821
02:56:59.580 --> 02:56:59.781
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

6822
02:56:59.781 --> 02:57:00.190
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

6823
02:57:00.190 --> 02:57:01.580
<v Speaker 5>You just miss seeing that right leg,</v>

6824
02:57:01.610 --> 02:57:02.443
<v Speaker 5>left leg kick.</v>

6825
02:57:02.800 --> 02:57:03.633
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

6826
02:57:03.650 --> 02:57:03.870
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

6827
02:57:03.870 --> 02:57:04.703
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

6828
02:57:04.790 --> 02:57:06.980
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those things where you,</v>

6829
02:57:06.981 --> 02:57:07.820
<v Speaker 5>you love it so much.</v>

6830
02:57:07.821 --> 02:57:09.080
<v Speaker 5>There are times when I'm watching fights,</v>

6831
02:57:09.081 --> 02:57:09.500
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

6832
02:57:09.500 --> 02:57:12.170
<v Speaker 5>and there's some guys that are like just outside the top 15.</v>

6833
02:57:12.500 --> 02:57:14.180
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't tell you any names right now,</v>

6834
02:57:14.181 --> 02:57:15.014
<v Speaker 5>but let me like,</v>

6835
02:57:15.020 --> 02:57:15.291
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

6836
02:57:15.291 --> 02:57:15.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6837
02:57:15.530 --> 02:57:17.750
<v Speaker 5>like Jake Matthews when he was a 55.</v>

6838
02:57:18.500 --> 02:57:18.800
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

6839
02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:21.080
<v Speaker 5>I feel like this kid is good and he's awesome.</v>

6840
02:57:21.370 --> 02:57:21.860
<v Speaker 5>He's all set.</v>

6841
02:57:21.860 --> 02:57:23.750
<v Speaker 5>They're much bigger than they were back in my day.</v>

6842
02:57:23.751 --> 02:57:24.584
<v Speaker 5>But it's still,</v>

6843
02:57:24.620 --> 02:57:25.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

6844
02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:26.040
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

6845
02:57:26.040 --> 02:57:27.680
<v Speaker 5>sometimes I watch fights and I'm like,</v>

6846
02:57:27.681 --> 02:57:28.071
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

6847
02:57:28.071 --> 02:57:29.390
<v Speaker 5>you mother fuckers is so lucky.</v>

6848
02:57:29.391 --> 02:57:31.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm not 25 just because of the fees,</v>

6849
02:57:31.911 --> 02:57:32.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6850
02:57:32.370 --> 02:57:33.730
<v Speaker 5>now know.</v>

6851
02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:35.270
<v Speaker 5>But isn't that the thing?</v>

6852
02:57:35.300 --> 02:57:35.630
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

6853
02:57:35.630 --> 02:57:39.920
<v Speaker 5>The older fighters have way more knowledge and understanding of what to do,</v>

6854
02:57:39.921 --> 02:57:41.510
<v Speaker 5>but their body doesn't respond that way anymore.</v>

6855
02:57:41.511 --> 02:57:44.960
<v Speaker 5>And that's sort of the balance of it all is that the young fighters have all the</v>

6856
02:57:44.961 --> 02:57:49.190
<v Speaker 5>piss and vinegar and fast twitch muscle fibers and they don't know that much.</v>

6857
02:57:49.340 --> 02:57:49.790
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

6858
02:57:49.790 --> 02:57:50.601
<v Speaker 5>for me,</v>

6859
02:57:50.601 --> 02:57:51.171
<v Speaker 5>I feel,</v>

6860
02:57:51.171 --> 02:57:53.120
<v Speaker 5>cause I still move around and still sparse this morning.</v>

6861
02:57:53.121 --> 02:57:54.840
<v Speaker 5>We're like Joe and Mickey and those guys and I,</v>

6862
02:57:54.841 --> 02:57:55.311
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

6863
02:57:55.311 --> 02:57:58.550
<v Speaker 5>I can do a lot of the things that I've always been able to do.</v>

6864
02:57:59.000 --> 02:57:59.780
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

6865
02:57:59.780 --> 02:58:01.290
<v Speaker 5>it has to do with,</v>

6866
02:58:01.350 --> 02:58:02.220
<v Speaker 5>for the most part,</v>

6867
02:58:02.221 --> 02:58:02.700
<v Speaker 5>for me,</v>

6868
02:58:02.700 --> 02:58:03.570
<v Speaker 5>the recovery.</v>

6869
02:58:04.020 --> 02:58:05.310
<v Speaker 5>Like the next day,</v>

6870
02:58:05.640 --> 02:58:06.960
<v Speaker 5>if I go hard today,</v>

6871
02:58:07.260 --> 02:58:08.400
<v Speaker 5>I can't go hard tomorrow.</v>

6872
02:58:08.460 --> 02:58:08.851
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>

6873
02:58:08.851 --> 02:58:10.560
<v Speaker 5>I can't go hard four days a week anymore.</v>

6874
02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:11.220
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6875
02:58:11.220 --> 02:58:14.790
<v Speaker 5>I could go hide once or twice a week and as I get in better shape,</v>

6876
02:58:14.820 --> 02:58:17.160
<v Speaker 5>like the twice will be more consistent.</v>

6877
02:58:17.550 --> 02:58:18.000
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

6878
02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:18.833
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6879
02:58:18.930 --> 02:58:23.930
<v Speaker 5>the recovery I can still move very close to just as fast as I've always been.</v>

6880
02:58:24.570 --> 02:58:26.460
<v Speaker 5>Like I think that will go away at some point,</v>

6881
02:58:26.461 --> 02:58:27.390
<v Speaker 5>but I still have it.</v>

6882
02:58:27.700 --> 02:58:28.140
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6883
02:58:28.140 --> 02:58:29.760
<v Speaker 5>and I can't take it like I used to.</v>

6884
02:58:29.830 --> 02:58:30.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6885
02:58:30.250 --> 02:58:31.860
<v Speaker 5>You know that that's a difference.</v>

6886
02:58:32.170 --> 02:58:33.003
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6887
02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:35.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't like in the gym I can still,</v>

6888
02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:37.740
<v Speaker 5>like I still walk through some things,</v>

6889
02:58:38.070 --> 02:58:40.360
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know about in competition when,</v>

6890
02:58:40.361 --> 02:58:41.340
<v Speaker 5>when it's all in line.</v>

6891
02:58:41.341 --> 02:58:41.851
<v Speaker 5>Cause again,</v>

6892
02:58:41.851 --> 02:58:43.500
<v Speaker 5>I think your brain kind of,</v>

6893
02:58:43.830 --> 02:58:45.240
<v Speaker 5>you're in a different mindset,</v>

6894
02:58:45.540 --> 02:58:45.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6895
02:58:45.900 --> 02:58:49.260
<v Speaker 5>think about that when you're sparring right now because you really don't have a</v>

6896
02:58:49.261 --> 02:58:50.370
<v Speaker 5>need to write.</v>

6897
02:58:50.970 --> 02:58:51.803
<v Speaker 5>I um,</v>

6898
02:58:52.200 --> 02:58:54.000
<v Speaker 5>I still love sparring.</v>

6899
02:58:54.030 --> 02:58:54.630
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

6900
02:58:54.630 --> 02:58:56.580
<v Speaker 5>I don't do it nearly as much as I used to.</v>

6901
02:58:56.970 --> 02:58:57.421
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

6902
02:58:57.421 --> 02:58:58.680
<v Speaker 5>I do think about that.</v>

6903
02:58:59.010 --> 02:58:59.843
<v Speaker 5>So fun though.</v>

6904
02:58:59.910 --> 02:59:01.050
<v Speaker 5>It's so much fun.</v>

6905
02:59:01.590 --> 02:59:02.070
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6906
02:59:02.070 --> 02:59:02.903
<v Speaker 5>and I'm like,</v>

6907
02:59:03.300 --> 02:59:04.133
<v Speaker 5>you only got one,</v>

6908
02:59:04.310 --> 02:59:04.960
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

6909
02:59:04.960 --> 02:59:05.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6910
02:59:05.420 --> 02:59:06.210
<v Speaker 5>You got one.</v>

6911
02:59:06.210 --> 02:59:06.511
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

6912
02:59:06.511 --> 02:59:06.811
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

6913
02:59:06.811 --> 02:59:07.630
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be,</v>

6914
02:59:07.630 --> 02:59:10.080
<v Speaker 5>want to live the last 20 of that one drooling,</v>

6915
02:59:10.140 --> 02:59:11.160
<v Speaker 5>shitting your pants.</v>

6916
02:59:11.390 --> 02:59:12.223
<v Speaker 5>Word Mark.</v>

6917
02:59:12.720 --> 02:59:13.501
<v Speaker 5>I don't want that.</v>

6918
02:59:13.501 --> 02:59:16.620
<v Speaker 5>So I try to exercise my brain as much as I can.</v>

6919
02:59:16.621 --> 02:59:17.550
<v Speaker 5>But what do you do?</v>

6920
02:59:18.090 --> 02:59:18.481
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6921
02:59:18.481 --> 02:59:19.314
<v Speaker 5>reading,</v>

6922
02:59:19.320 --> 02:59:20.310
<v Speaker 5>I do a lot of,</v>

6923
02:59:20.340 --> 02:59:21.840
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the cognitive,</v>

6924
02:59:21.841 --> 02:59:22.350
<v Speaker 5>not co,</v>

6925
02:59:22.350 --> 02:59:24.180
<v Speaker 5>but brain cognitive games like,</v>

6926
02:59:24.181 --> 02:59:24.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6927
02:59:24.510 --> 02:59:24.781
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6928
02:59:24.781 --> 02:59:27.650
<v Speaker 5>a lot of things with numbers and crosswords and,</v>

6929
02:59:27.651 --> 02:59:27.841
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

6930
02:59:27.841 --> 02:59:28.130
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

6931
02:59:28.130 --> 02:59:28.350
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

6932
02:59:28.350 --> 02:59:29.310
<v Speaker 5>and I just,</v>

6933
02:59:30.600 --> 02:59:34.470
<v Speaker 5>that's a hard thing for me to not do something because if I'm not,</v>

6934
02:59:34.500 --> 02:59:36.960
<v Speaker 5>if I'm awake and I'm not occupied,</v>

6935
02:59:37.320 --> 02:59:38.550
<v Speaker 5>my thoughts are just going.</v>

6936
02:59:38.610 --> 02:59:40.350
<v Speaker 5>So that's something else I've been doing.</v>

6937
02:59:40.351 --> 02:59:40.650
<v Speaker 5>I've been,</v>

6938
02:59:40.650 --> 02:59:41.970
<v Speaker 5>I've started to write things down.</v>

6939
02:59:42.210 --> 02:59:44.580
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing like some stunt work acting,</v>

6940
02:59:44.850 --> 02:59:45.121
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

6941
02:59:45.121 --> 02:59:46.680
<v Speaker 5>So I've been,</v>

6942
02:59:46.710 --> 02:59:51.000
<v Speaker 5>lately I've been watching old shows and just watching it for the acting and,</v>

6943
02:59:51.001 --> 02:59:51.601
<v Speaker 5>and I'll,</v>

6944
02:59:51.601 --> 02:59:55.110
<v Speaker 5>I'll find a script and I'll stand in front of a mirror by myself and do some,</v>

6945
02:59:55.230 --> 02:59:57.810
<v Speaker 5>do some things and tried to pay some things out.</v>

6946
02:59:57.810 --> 02:59:58.050
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

6947
02:59:58.050 --> 02:59:58.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm just like,</v>

6948
02:59:58.800 --> 02:59:59.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm just,</v>

6949
02:59:59.260 --> 03:00:00.480
<v Speaker 5>I was just going through all of it.</v>

6950
03:00:00.481 --> 03:00:00.811
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

6951
03:00:00.811 --> 03:00:01.260
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6952
03:00:01.260 --> 03:00:01.830
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>

6953
03:00:01.830 --> 03:00:02.663
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>

6954
03:00:02.820 --> 03:00:03.810
<v Speaker 5>I did a small move.</v>

6955
03:00:03.811 --> 03:00:05.320
<v Speaker 5>They're doing a movie about nick knew well.</v>

6956
03:00:05.490 --> 03:00:06.030
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

6957
03:00:06.030 --> 03:00:06.371
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

6958
03:00:06.371 --> 03:00:06.900
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6959
03:00:06.900 --> 03:00:07.711
<v Speaker 5>I f I,</v>

6960
03:00:07.711 --> 03:00:08.750
<v Speaker 5>so I fight the cat.</v>

6961
03:00:08.760 --> 03:00:12.840
<v Speaker 5>The guy that's played nick knew well and one scene early in his career was the</v>

6962
03:00:12.841 --> 03:00:13.890
<v Speaker 5>fighter has one our,</v>

6963
03:00:14.020 --> 03:00:15.180
<v Speaker 5>cause the guy in the movie,</v>

6964
03:00:15.181 --> 03:00:15.871
<v Speaker 5>everyone armor as well.</v>

6965
03:00:15.871 --> 03:00:16.231
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

6966
03:00:16.231 --> 03:00:16.561
<v Speaker 5>but he,</v>

6967
03:00:16.561 --> 03:00:17.460
<v Speaker 5>they greenscreen it.</v>

6968
03:00:17.610 --> 03:00:18.290
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

6969
03:00:18.290 --> 03:00:19.081
<v Speaker 5>I'm so,</v>

6970
03:00:19.081 --> 03:00:19.680
<v Speaker 5>so he's,</v>

6971
03:00:19.680 --> 03:00:23.790
<v Speaker 5>he's the whole time he has his green sleeve over his arm and he has it out here</v>

6972
03:00:23.791 --> 03:00:24.541
<v Speaker 5>and he's moving it.</v>

6973
03:00:24.541 --> 03:00:25.680
<v Speaker 5>And we have,</v>

6974
03:00:25.681 --> 03:00:30.030
<v Speaker 5>we choreograph the fight and we have to kind of address a account for all of</v>

6975
03:00:30.031 --> 03:00:33.680
<v Speaker 5>that in the choreography with the green screen and all that are all low.</v>

6976
03:00:34.020 --> 03:00:35.490
<v Speaker 5>But I got a couple of lines.</v>

6977
03:00:35.491 --> 03:00:38.220
<v Speaker 5>I did some lines in the first time I did lines with Kevin Pollak.</v>

6978
03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:39.430
<v Speaker 5>So that was cool for her.</v>

6979
03:00:39.780 --> 03:00:40.290
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6980
03:00:40.290 --> 03:00:41.160

6981
03:00:41.161 --> 03:00:41.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6982
03:00:41.940 --> 03:00:42.331
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

6983
03:00:42.331 --> 03:00:42.690
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6984
03:00:42.690 --> 03:00:44.880
<v Speaker 5>and then I did an episode of ballers for the next season,</v>

6985
03:00:45.600 --> 03:00:46.560
<v Speaker 5>so that was cool.</v>

6986
03:00:46.860 --> 03:00:47.940
<v Speaker 5>Did you work with the Rock?</v>

6987
03:00:48.030 --> 03:00:48.451
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

6988
03:00:48.451 --> 03:00:49.111

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

7185
03:04:53.390 --> 03:04:54.830
<v Speaker 5>It seems a lot easier than it is.</v>

7186
03:04:55.070 --> 03:04:56.240
<v Speaker 5>It's not easy at all.</v>

7187
03:04:56.280 --> 03:04:56.710
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

7188
03:04:56.710 --> 03:04:57.500
<v Speaker 5>Seems like it.</v>

7189
03:04:57.500 --> 03:04:58.550
<v Speaker 5>It's not easy at all.</v>

7190
03:04:58.570 --> 03:04:59.403
<v Speaker 5>Just talking.</v>

7191
03:04:59.840 --> 03:05:00.673
<v Speaker 5>How could that be hard?</v>

7192
03:05:00.920 --> 03:05:01.461
<v Speaker 5>But see,</v>

7193
03:05:01.461 --> 03:05:02.090
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing.</v>

7194
03:05:02.090 --> 03:05:02.960
<v Speaker 5>It's like people like,</v>

7195
03:05:02.961 --> 03:05:03.161
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

7196
03:05:03.161 --> 03:05:03.370
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

7197
03:05:03.370 --> 03:05:04.510
<v Speaker 5>you fought in an octagon.</v>

7198
03:05:04.590 --> 03:05:05.960
<v Speaker 5>You fucking moon means people.</v>

7199
03:05:05.961 --> 03:05:06.381
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that?</v>

7200
03:05:06.381 --> 03:05:06.771
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

7201
03:05:06.771 --> 03:05:06.921
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

7202
03:05:06.921 --> 03:05:08.300
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not looking at them.</v>

7203
03:05:08.450 --> 03:05:08.661
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

7204
03:05:08.661 --> 03:05:09.381
<v Speaker 5>the thing is to,</v>

7205
03:05:09.381 --> 03:05:11.290
<v Speaker 5>all new things are difficult.</v>

7206
03:05:11.330 --> 03:05:12.920
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter what difficult things you do.</v>

7207
03:05:12.921 --> 03:05:14.720
<v Speaker 5>Try taking up chest for the first time.</v>

7208
03:05:15.080 --> 03:05:16.820
<v Speaker 5>It's difficult to try anything.</v>

7209
03:05:16.850 --> 03:05:19.500
<v Speaker 5>Everything that's hard to do is difficult.</v>

7210
03:05:19.500 --> 03:05:21.290
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter how many difficult things you've done.</v>

7211
03:05:21.680 --> 03:05:25.490
<v Speaker 5>You might have a better understanding of how to perform under under pressure</v>

7212
03:05:25.950 --> 03:05:26.751
<v Speaker 5>than other people do.</v>

7213
03:05:26.751 --> 03:05:28.160
<v Speaker 5>But it's still going to be hard.</v>

7214
03:05:28.590 --> 03:05:28.820
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

7215

03:05:29.721 --> 03:05:32.600
<v Speaker 5>nothing worth doing is easy because it was easy.</v>

7218
03:05:32.601 --> 03:05:33.434
<v Speaker 5>Everybody would do it.</v>

7219

7302
03:07:27.360 --> 03:07:28.080
<v Speaker 2>That's how it goes.</v>

7303
03:07:28.080 --> 03:07:28.471
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

7304
03:07:28.471 --> 03:07:29.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7305
03:07:29.040 --> 03:07:29.341

<v Speaker 2>Thank you for,</v>

7307
03:07:29.820 --> 03:07:31.980
<v Speaker 2>do we need to say anything more about the Brendan Schaub thing?</v>

7308
03:07:31.981 --> 03:07:34.080
<v Speaker 2>Did we cover it enough man,</v>

7309
03:07:34.140 --> 03:07:35.730
<v Speaker 2>as far as it goes,</v>

7310
03:07:36.540 --> 03:07:37.470
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

7311
03:07:38.600 --> 03:07:39.740
<v Speaker 2>that's where we,</v>

7312
03:07:39.900 --> 03:07:40.650
<v Speaker 2>we like,</v>

7313
03:07:40.650 --> 03:07:42.320
<v Speaker 2>we need to talk him and hit you,</v>

7314
03:07:42.380 --> 03:07:42.960
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

7315
03:07:42.960 --> 03:07:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7316
03:07:43.410 --> 03:07:46.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's a weird situation for me because I love the guy and he's one of my best</v>

7317
03:07:46.591 --> 03:07:50.820
<v Speaker 2>friends and also I can't defend what he said cause it doesn't totally make</v>

7318
03:07:50.821 --> 03:07:51.150
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

7319
03:07:51.150 --> 03:07:51.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7320
03:07:51.690 --> 03:07:53.400
<v Speaker 2>And so like what I'm saying,</v>

7321
03:07:53.401 --> 03:07:54.840
<v Speaker 2>when I said he talks too much,</v>

7322
03:07:54.900 --> 03:07:55.733
<v Speaker 2>I do too.</v>

7323
03:07:56.070 --> 03:07:57.000
<v Speaker 2>I say stupid shit.</v>

7324
03:07:57.150 --> 03:07:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to say stupid shit.</v>

7325
03:07:58.260 --> 03:07:59.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't say that stupid.</v>

7326
03:07:59.570 --> 03:08:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

7327
03:08:00.120 --> 03:08:01.260
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say that thing.</v>

7328
03:08:01.320 --> 03:08:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say it like that.</v>

7329
03:08:02.220 --> 03:08:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7330
03:08:02.640 --> 03:08:04.170
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes you say things,</v>

7331
03:08:05.040 --> 03:08:06.690
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know why the fuck you're saying it.</v>

7332
03:08:06.720 --> 03:08:07.081
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

7333
03:08:07.081 --> 03:08:09.720
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of it also was loss,</v>

7334
03:08:09.730 --> 03:08:11.940
<v Speaker 2>like just ranting.</v>

7335
03:08:12.060 --> 03:08:12.511
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

7336
03:08:12.511 --> 03:08:15.780
<v Speaker 2>you're going to these rants and you say shit and then you like see if you can</v>

7337
03:08:15.781 --> 03:08:17.130
<v Speaker 2>back it up once you said it.</v>

7338
03:08:17.220 --> 03:08:17.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7339
03:08:17.581 --> 03:08:19.350
<v Speaker 2>Like just don't revisit dumb shit.</v>

7340
03:08:19.410 --> 03:08:20.243
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

7341
03:08:20.310 --> 03:08:21.330
<v Speaker 2>it was insensitive.</v>

7342
03:08:21.690 --> 03:08:25.680
<v Speaker 2>It didn't make sense and it was an insensitive and I bet he regrets it.</v>

7343
03:08:27.240 --> 03:08:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

7344
03:08:27.750 --> 03:08:28.583
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

7345
03:08:29.100 --> 03:08:29.933
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

7346
03:08:30.060 --> 03:08:31.320
<v Speaker 2>That's an assumption we're making,</v>

7347
03:08:31.321 --> 03:08:31.501
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

7348
03:08:31.501 --> 03:08:31.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7349
03:08:31.751 --> 03:08:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad I know the guy.</v>

7350
03:08:34.020 --> 03:08:35.160
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm saying it.</v>

7351
03:08:35.220 --> 03:08:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7352
03:08:35.700 --> 03:08:38.310
<v Speaker 2>He's not a bad guy and you stretch the imagination.</v>

7353
03:08:38.311 --> 03:08:39.000
<v Speaker 2>He's awesome.</v>

7354
03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:39.350
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

7355
03:08:39.350 --> 03:08:40.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a of the of the,</v>

7356
03:08:41.040 --> 03:08:42.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm not the guy saying like,</v>

7357
03:08:42.220 --> 03:08:43.290
<v Speaker 4>you're racist saying this,</v>

7358
03:08:43.300 --> 03:08:44.910
<v Speaker 4>like that's like my,</v>

7359
03:08:44.911 --> 03:08:47.450
<v Speaker 4>my thing is when you're talking about the,</v>

7360
03:08:47.451 --> 03:08:48.001
<v Speaker 4>the first,</v>

7361
03:08:48.001 --> 03:08:48.840
<v Speaker 4>the initial part of it,</v>

7362
03:08:48.841 --> 03:08:50.310
<v Speaker 4>and I conveyed this to him,</v>

7363
03:08:50.520 --> 03:08:51.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

7364
03:08:51.240 --> 03:08:54.930
<v Speaker 4>was you're saying me or my brother or my sister aren't good enough to be here.</v>

7365
03:08:54.990 --> 03:08:55.950
<v Speaker 4>So like that's,</v>

7366
03:08:55.960 --> 03:08:59.580
<v Speaker 4>that's disrespectful because I fully believe that we all are and that,</v>

7367
03:08:59.581 --> 03:08:59.821
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

7368
03:08:59.821 --> 03:09:00.060
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

7369
03:09:00.060 --> 03:09:02.730
<v Speaker 4>so that part and he apologized for that and we're cool there,</v>

7370
03:09:03.030 --> 03:09:03.421
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

7371
03:09:03.421 --> 03:09:04.320
<v Speaker 4>And then then,</v>

7372
03:09:04.321 --> 03:09:04.860
<v Speaker 4>then why you,</v>

7373
03:09:04.860 --> 03:09:06.060
<v Speaker 4>why are you talking about like,</v>

7374
03:09:06.390 --> 03:09:08.610
<v Speaker 4>this is what I see in myself because no dog,</v>

7375
03:09:08.640 --> 03:09:09.151
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>

7376
03:09:09.151 --> 03:09:10.200
<v Speaker 4>that's not how it is.</v>

7377
03:09:11.280 --> 03:09:11.731
<v Speaker 4>You're not,</v>

7378
03:09:11.731 --> 03:09:12.960
<v Speaker 4>you're not a psychologist,</v>

7379
03:09:13.050 --> 03:09:13.980
<v Speaker 4>not a psychiatrist.</v>

7380
03:09:13.981 --> 03:09:18.470
<v Speaker 4>You have no qualifications to to speak on my mental state.</v>

7381
03:09:18.510 --> 03:09:18.780
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

7382
03:09:18.780 --> 03:09:20.900
<v Speaker 2>like let's just weird too that you guys haven't,</v>

7383
03:09:21.900 --> 03:09:22.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7384
03:09:22.110 --> 03:09:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I think he's on know that's things out.</v>

7385
03:09:25.220 --> 03:09:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes someone says something instead of just straight up saying they fucked</v>

7386
03:09:29.071 --> 03:09:29.700
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

7387
03:09:29.700 --> 03:09:30.780
<v Speaker 2>They say I fucked up.</v>

7388
03:09:30.990 --> 03:09:32.820
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

7389
03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:33.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7390
03:09:33.391 --> 03:09:33.861
<v Speaker 2>I fucked it up.</v>

7391
03:09:33.861 --> 03:09:34.441
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

7392
03:09:34.441 --> 03:09:35.274
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

7393
03:09:35.310 --> 03:09:37.690
<v Speaker 2>his issue is because of this or you know,</v>

7394
03:09:37.800 --> 03:09:39.810
<v Speaker 2>something else is going on with him.</v>

7395
03:09:39.811 --> 03:09:41.670
<v Speaker 2>It's making him react this way.</v>

7396
03:09:42.240 --> 03:09:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7397
03:09:42.660 --> 03:09:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7398
03:09:43.340 --> 03:09:43.950
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

7399
03:09:43.950 --> 03:09:45.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm more concerned with his pants,</v>

7400
03:09:45.390 --> 03:09:49.290
<v Speaker 2>those shred it up pants and wears those disturbing way more than what he said.</v>

7401
03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:49.830
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

7402
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:50.850
<v Speaker 2>can't defend either one.</v>

7403
03:09:51.300 --> 03:09:51.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7405
03:09:54.280 --> 03:09:55.150
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they're women's.</v>

03:09:59.081 --> 03:10:01.390
<v Speaker 5>We went through that at the beginning of the show and they have holding them.</v>

7408
03:10:01.420 --> 03:10:02.590
<v Speaker 5>It depends on how many holes,</v>

7409
03:10:02.620 --> 03:10:03.453
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

7410

7411
03:10:05.400 --> 03:10:05.560
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

03:10:05.560 --> 03:10:06.670

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

7421
03:10:13.830 --> 03:10:14.663

03:10:19.420 --> 03:10:20.253
<v Speaker 5>that's okay.</v>

7427
03:10:20.380 --> 03:10:21.280
<v Speaker 5>You earn those holes.</v>

7428
03:10:21.310 --> 03:10:22.420
<v Speaker 5>You wore your jeans out.</v>

7429
03:10:22.570 --> 03:10:23.800
<v Speaker 5>They started ripping in places.</v>

7430
03:10:23.980 --> 03:10:24.640
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

7432
03:10:25.030 --> 03:10:26.350
<v Speaker 5>You can't afford to buy some new ones,</v>

7433
03:10:26.440 --> 03:10:29.200
<v Speaker 5>but if you paid a lot of mine for pants that are already fucked up,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you saw that shit in a magazine somewhere.</v>

03:10:31.870 --> 03:10:33.580
<v Speaker 5>That's what bothers me about Brendan</v>

7436
03:10:35.140 --> 03:10:35.973
<v Speaker 5>fucking pants.</v>

7437

7438
03:10:37.691 --> 03:10:39.970
<v Speaker 5>but I w what really bothers me,</v>

7443
03:10:43.990 --> 03:10:47.080
<v Speaker 5>And I said that very early on when you first started doing it.</v>

7444
03:10:47.140 --> 03:10:49.360
<v Speaker 5>I remember I tweeted it or something.</v>

7445
03:10:49.420 --> 03:10:50.050
<v Speaker 5>I actually,</v>

7446
03:10:50.050 --> 03:10:51.140
<v Speaker 5>and you said it to me too,</v>

7447
03:10:51.141 --> 03:10:51.881
<v Speaker 5>the last time I was here,</v>

7448
03:10:51.881 --> 03:10:53.490
<v Speaker 5>I was in Joe and I came to do a glory,</v>

7449
03:10:53.690 --> 03:10:54.700
<v Speaker 5>a companion with you.</v>

7450
03:10:55.250 --> 03:10:56.110
<v Speaker 5>And I remember,</v>

7451
03:10:56.111 --> 03:10:56.801
<v Speaker 5>I remember that.</v>

7452
03:10:56.801 --> 03:10:58.390
<v Speaker 5>I remember everything you say Joe.</v>

7453
03:10:58.450 --> 03:10:59.950
<v Speaker 5>Like even even when did,</v>

7454
03:10:59.960 --> 03:11:00.793
<v Speaker 5>cause I don't,</v>

7455
03:11:01.360 --> 03:11:04.780
<v Speaker 5>especially when it's about me because there was a time when you were like,</v>

7456
03:11:04.810 --> 03:11:05.471
<v Speaker 5>I look at Josh,</v>

7457
03:11:05.471 --> 03:11:07.360
<v Speaker 5>he's so strong how he just gets right back up.</v>

7458
03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:08.140
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

7459
03:11:08.140 --> 03:11:08.621
<v Speaker 5>and he's just,</v>

7460
03:11:08.621 --> 03:11:09.490
<v Speaker 5>he's the strongest guy.</v>

7461
03:11:09.550 --> 03:11:10.510
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

7462
03:11:11.320 --> 03:11:12.340
<v Speaker 5>I remember that.</v>

7463
03:11:12.580 --> 03:11:13.210
<v Speaker 5>I remember that.</v>

7464
03:11:13.210 --> 03:11:16.090
<v Speaker 5>I love it because there's a couple of times when,</v>

7465
03:11:16.091 --> 03:11:16.510
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

7466
03:11:16.510 --> 03:11:18.760
<v Speaker 5>you're not like disparaging of either fighter,</v>

7467
03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:19.541
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

7468
03:11:19.541 --> 03:11:20.890
<v Speaker 5>there's a couple of times when you,</v>

7469
03:11:20.891 --> 03:11:23.880
<v Speaker 5>you start seeing the strength in another guy and,</v>

7470
03:11:24.320 --> 03:11:27.850
<v Speaker 5>and there's two fights for me where that happened and I was able to just clip</v>

7471
03:11:27.851 --> 03:11:29.890
<v Speaker 5>him right as you're giving the other guy some praise.</v>

7472
03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:30.431
<v Speaker 5>Perfect.</v>

7473
