1
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very sorry for the late start here,</v>

2
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:09.651
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately I'm the only one that's </v>

3
00:00:09.651 --> 00:00:09.651
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:09.651 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Brian and Eddie and Ari have not shown </v>
<v Speaker 1>up yet.</v>

5
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Brian's not showing up because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>he was eating some yogurt and he bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>down on his spoon and broke his fucking,</v>

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.940
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>one of the dumbest things I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard in my life.</v>

9
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.080
<v Speaker 1>So he's not going to be here and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck in traffic because it's raining in</v>

10
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:35.091
<v Speaker 1>La and when it rains in la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody freaks out and are stuck in </v>

11
00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:37.170
<v Speaker 1>traffic as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the story.</v>

12
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Let me shut this off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got this.</v>

13
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>The Guru from gang starr died yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

14
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>very sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite rap bands ever.</v>

15
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tutors,</v>

16
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>only 43 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you stay.</v>

17
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>That's only a year older than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

18
00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

19
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.620
<v Speaker 1>dying of cancer and shit used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>

20
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Now he's dead and that's life </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>

21
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:12.591
<v Speaker 1>But the good thing is we still got this </v>
<v Speaker 1>music life carries on and uh,</v>

22
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe somewhere cooler right now,</v>

23
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows,</v>

24
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>right ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen?</v>

25
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.050
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.090
<v Speaker 1>since I'm starting Solo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get started with a bunch of shit </v>

27
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>that's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

28
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>this fucking strikeforce thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.760
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why the strikeforce </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is so fucked up is because they </v>

30
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.411
<v Speaker 1>haven't really done it that many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't done these big CBS shows </v>

31
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:43.161
<v Speaker 1>that many times and they made a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>big mistakes and the big brawl that </v>

32
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>happened afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

33
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.030
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone was criticizing mayhem and </v>

34
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>everyone was saying that may have fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and made him like cost CBS.</v>

35
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 1>They're deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright first of all may have,</v>

36
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have even been allowed to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into that octagon if that was the UFC.</v>

37
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>They have security at the stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have security at the top.</v>

38
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just walk into the octagon.</v>

39
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Well the fights are going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's literally not possible.</v>

40
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.640
<v Speaker 1>You can't have that many teammates in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

41
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>in the octagon as well when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>when Jake shields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after his fight,</v>

43
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 1>he had like seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six or seven of his buddies in the cage.</v>

44
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Trainers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

45
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>You can't have that many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The UFC does not allow the UFC,</v>

46
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>I believe you're allowed to have three </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they regulate it all and that's what</v>

47
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 1>you supposed to do as far as mayhem </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something that was inappropriate.</v>

48
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he definitely did something </v>

49
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.350
<v Speaker 1>disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

50
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Jake shields is in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest victory of his life.</v>

51
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Just beads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn fucking Henderson and dominates </v>

52
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.660
<v Speaker 1>them for four rounds after we got fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up for the first round.</v>

53
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.461
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge emotional victory for him </v>

54
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:46.461
<v Speaker 1>and for his teammates.</v>

55
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>His teammates rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>this is a gigantic fight and he pulled </v>
<v Speaker 1>it off.</v>

57
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>emotions were running very high and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayhem stepped in and,</v>

59
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>and Bogart at the attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not.</v>

60
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>But it was a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:06.271
<v Speaker 1>he went in there to try to hype up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight the same way they would do in the </v>

62
00:03:06.271 --> 00:03:06.271
<v Speaker 1>UFC the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

63
00:03:06.271 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>the famous George St Pierre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not impressed with your performance.</v>

64
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he went in there when Matt Hughes </v>

65
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.420
<v Speaker 1>had just one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit happens to build up </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>

67
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this wasn't planned,</v>

68
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strikeforce didn't know what was going </v>

69
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.130
<v Speaker 1>to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may have thought about it last minute.</v>

70
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>He just wanted a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.500
<v Speaker 1>who was hyped up because he had one </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier than [inaudible] 91 or to </v>

72
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.560
<v Speaker 1>rematch with jake shields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he runs into the octagon and uh,</v>

73
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start pushing them out of the way </v>

74
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.870
<v Speaker 1>and then chaos erupts.</v>

75
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>He should've never been allowed to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the octagon.</v>

76
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 1>And if he was allowed to get into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage,</v>

77
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.230
<v Speaker 1>they should have had it regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should have been a situation where </v>

78
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.230
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.880
<v Speaker 1>they would let jake shields speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ask them all the questions are </v>

80
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ask him totally respectfully.</v>

81
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>He gets his chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets his moment to say what he has to</v>

82
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank his teammates.</v>

83
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Then after all that's done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then mayhem comes in.</v>

84
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>If that's what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's a fight,</v>

85
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:07.111
<v Speaker 1>they're hyping up next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows what their plans </v>

86
00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:07.111
<v Speaker 1>were?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

87
00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:10.351
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their plans might not be a mayhem fight </v>

88
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:10.351
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it should have been up to them a,</v>

89
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.400
<v Speaker 1>they should have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have regulated the cage.</v>

90
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.460
<v Speaker 1>They should have made sure he didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there as far as like what the Diaz </v>

91
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>brothers did and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Gilbert Melendez,</v>

92
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.190
<v Speaker 1>those guys have backing up there buddy.</v>

93
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are like brothers.</v>

94
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:27.901
<v Speaker 1>You know those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all a bunch of fucking psychos </v>

95
00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:30.421
<v Speaker 1>and savages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're their buddy just wins the </v>

96
00:04:30.421 --> 00:04:33.301
<v Speaker 1>strikeforce middleweight title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some pushing goes on there down to get </v>

97
00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the way they are,</v>

98
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Diaz brothers,</v>

99
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people always criticize them,</v>

100
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:43.651
<v Speaker 1>but I think first of all I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting they shit way more interesting </v>

101
00:04:43.651 --> 00:04:47.940
<v Speaker 1>when you've got someone like nate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz that they don't give a fuck.</v>

102
00:04:47.941 --> 00:04:52.941
<v Speaker 1>Like they really don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not just pretending to not </v>

103
00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 1>give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll do really don't give a fuck.</v>

104
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 1>They will fight in a brawl on CBS on </v>
<v Speaker 1>prime time.</v>

105
00:04:57.941 --> 00:05:02.941
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really knew what was going on and </v>

106
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:02.941
<v Speaker 1>they still stepped in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did that.</v>

107
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.640
<v Speaker 1>You can't just have them all together </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and let anybody in that you </v>

108
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:09.190
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

109
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like I used to have pit bulls and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get a bunch of pit bulls in the</v>

110
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:17.731
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get mad at the pit bulls if </v>

111
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>they fight each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just what they do and these kinds</v>

112
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>of professional mixed martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters and in mixed martial arts,</v>

113
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.930
<v Speaker 1>definitely there's a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect to it that's a huge component of </v>

114
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 1>of fighting and whether or not you win </v>
<v Speaker 1>or lose and these guys have this </v>

115
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.830
<v Speaker 1>psychological edge over their opponents </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're so aggressive because </v>

116
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.400
<v Speaker 1>they're so down to fight at any moment's</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice.</v>

117
00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not afraid.</v>

118
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>They're ready to throw down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because of that,</v>

119
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:48.781
<v Speaker 1>that's a significant advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a significant tactic when it comes </v>

120
00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:53.431
<v Speaker 1>to fighting and they're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>relinquish that just because they're on </v>

121
00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:57.091
<v Speaker 1>national television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if someone gets some other boys' </v>

122
00:05:57.091 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 1>faces and disrespects them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of fight.</v>

123
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just what's going to happen.</v>

124
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>So what I blame is I think mayhem </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly made an error,</v>

125
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.590
<v Speaker 1>but you should've never been allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get into the position to make that </v>

126
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.590
<v Speaker 1>error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was completely,</v>

127
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.731
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on strikeforce or the committee or </v>

128
00:06:12.731 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 1>whoever the fuck is supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching that cage,</v>

129
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who's responsible for that.</v>

130
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 1>The UFC takes care of all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never have to think about it.</v>

131
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>But whoever was responsible for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a god disaster.</v>

132
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.720
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

133
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 1>that's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my opinion on that.</v>

134
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 1>And as far as like the commentary goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if people were talking about how bad</v>

135
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 1>the commentary is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm think about that I like</v>

136
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:38.171
<v Speaker 1>frank shamrock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked Francek frank shamrock as a </v>

137
00:06:38.171 --> 00:06:38.171
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy them.</v>

138
00:06:38.171 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>I think he's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

139
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind this commentary at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those other two dudes.</v>

140
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>So like my mom said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have anything nice to say,</v>

141
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.940
<v Speaker 1>don't say anything at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not gonna say Shit because I </v>

142
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.110
<v Speaker 1>think those guys need work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 1>it's not as easy as it looks and you got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a fan of the sport.</v>

144
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:56.810
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that the main guys a fan of</v>

145
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 1>the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to mention his fucking</v>

146
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

147
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:01.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we are,</v>

148
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:02.680
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

149
00:07:02.681 --> 00:07:07.681
<v Speaker 1>the four slash 20 episodes of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and what we'll do is I'll just </v>

150
00:07:07.681 --> 00:07:10.560
<v Speaker 1>ramble until everybody gets here already</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

151
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 1>He should be here within probably 15 to </v>
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes depending on what the traffic</v>

152
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 1>looks like and when they get here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll jump off.</v>

153
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:21.560
<v Speaker 1>So between now and then I'll just take </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

154
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>If you see my office here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you notice it's things have changed.</v>

155
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I got rid of some shit here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move something out and I'm going to put </v>

156
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.800
<v Speaker 1>a green screen behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

157
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:33.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the next ustream stream podcasts,</v>

158
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully the next one if not the next </v>

159
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:38.900
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one after that I'll be in space.</v>

160
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 1>So the way we're going to have it set up</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we're going to have a podcast,</v>

161
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:45.740
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I'm going to have a green screen,</v>

162
00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:50.741
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a total space background and then I'll </v>

163
00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:55.241
<v Speaker 1>have couches and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that it'll look like </v>

164
00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:58.241
<v Speaker 1>couches flying through space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that should be pretty </v>

165
00:07:58.241 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole thing is,</v>

166
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:03.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started out this podcast sort of just </v>

167
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:03.520
<v Speaker 1>kind of as a roof and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.990
<v Speaker 1>I just thought it'd be an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do.</v>

169
00:08:04.991 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I'd always wanted to do something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

170
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.500
<v Speaker 1>I always enjoyed radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

171
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I kind of never got off my ass to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I've done it.</v>

172
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I think this is like the twelfth or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>13th week in a row.</v>

173
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.700
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

174
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 1>we've been real consistent and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a lot of fun.</v>

175
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>And now it's number eight on the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>section of Itunes,</v>

176
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.120
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy because the audio part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just sort of an afterthought to </v>

177
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.181
<v Speaker 1>throw that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And ustream one is getting plenty of </v>

178
00:08:31.181 --> 00:08:31.181
<v Speaker 1>it's and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

179
00:08:31.181 --> 00:08:35.570
<v Speaker 1>it's good fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fun way to supplement,</v>

180
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

181
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.160
<v Speaker 1>And I'm speaking academy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got one Gig,</v>

182
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Friday night and Sacramento,</v>

183
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:47.351
<v Speaker 1>but it's already sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be doing the color </v>

184
00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>commentary for a joe say Aldo versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>Uriah Faber.</v>

185
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

186
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:50.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

187
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're literally not even referring to </v>

188
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:55.600
<v Speaker 1>it as the WEC.</v>

189
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 1>They're just referring to it as although</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus favor,</v>

190
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

191
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:05.440
<v Speaker 1>you know for now because it's because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the preliminary is going to be on spike </v>

192
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>TV lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot,</v>

193
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:10.881
<v Speaker 1>a lot of corporate shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what's going on.</v>

194
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I got a bunch of stuff to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

195
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 1>this fucking volcano over Iceland is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuts.</v>

196
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:24.590
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't noticed that there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife had no idea what was going on </v>

197
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 1>because she doesn't pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit except for gossip.</v>

198
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.530
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

199
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.380
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a giant volcano in Iceland.</v>

200
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:33.120
<v Speaker 1>It literally is erupting through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ice.</v>

201
00:09:33.121 --> 00:09:38.121
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We look at some of the video footage </v>

202
00:09:38.121 --> 00:09:38.121
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you google it,</v>

203
00:09:38.121 --> 00:09:41.640
<v Speaker 1>it's really pretty intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You seeing like molten lava squirting up</v>

204
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:46.641
<v Speaker 1>through the ice is really wild and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>volcanic ash has gotten so bad that they</v>

205
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:51.300
<v Speaker 1>have canceled all the air flight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

206
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.500
<v Speaker 1>over Europe for days and days.</v>

207
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our spheres here.</v>

208
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.090
<v Speaker 1>How'd you get in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

209

<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right for this place out.</v>

210
00:10:01.211 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

211
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.410
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's here.</v>

212
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo shouldn't be moments behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he's very close.</v>

213
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Could even ring the doorbell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

214
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:11.900
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even hear it.</v>

215
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Not so much a rambling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the,</v>

216
00:10:14.371 --> 00:10:17.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Iceland volcano and you know that.</v>

217
00:10:17.621 --> 00:10:20.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can fly anywhere today.</v>

218
00:10:20.351 --> 00:10:23.440
<v Speaker 1>They just lifted it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't fucking fly it fully.</v>

219
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lifted the air,</v>

220
00:10:24.701 --> 00:10:29.701
<v Speaker 1>the air band over Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's because it's costing them </v>

221
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:29.701
<v Speaker 1>$200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars a day.</v>

222
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:30.850
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many is that?</v>

223
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.920
<v Speaker 1>The airline industry in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

224
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.130
<v Speaker 1>It's all crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$200.</v>

225
00:10:39.131 --> 00:10:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Million dollars a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

226
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 1>How fragile is this world and any little</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing can happen and things closed down </v>

227
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.480
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these businesses there,</v>

228
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:54.730
<v Speaker 1>they run so on the edge that just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple days off work and they to come </v>

229
00:10:54.971 --> 00:10:55.930
<v Speaker 1>close to being bankrupt.</v>

230
00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I like people like fucking hurls doors </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his full carrier can't fly home.</v>

231
00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:00.970
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

232
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:05.980
<v Speaker 1>We could've had all life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White people have no idea what volcanoes</v>

233
00:11:10.661 --> 00:11:14.140
<v Speaker 1>are all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Volcanoes have reshaped this earth.</v>

234
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

235
00:11:16.161 --> 00:11:21.161
<v Speaker 1>if you ever got the line yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've gone over the volcano and a </v>

236
00:11:21.161 --> 00:11:21.161
<v Speaker 1>helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the fucking coolest thing ever.</v>

237
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the big island and we took a </v>

238
00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.261
<v Speaker 1>trip on a helicopter and we flew over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the volcano and you're flying over this </v>

239
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:32.670
<v Speaker 1>active volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're watching the lava bubble up </v>

240
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:32.670
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see the fucking line,</v>

241
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.620
<v Speaker 1>you can see it and you could see it roll</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the ocean.</v>

242
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Like we fly over to where it rolls in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean.</v>

243
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.170
<v Speaker 1>It's moving four inches every year </v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to Japan,</v>

244
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.900
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's another island,</v>

245
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:50.050
<v Speaker 1>there's another island in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean that hasn't quite popped up </v>

246
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:50.050
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's on its way.</v>

247
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.000
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be the next island and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaiian islands underneath on its way.</v>

248
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:58.230
<v Speaker 1>It's building up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole area is just one gigantic </v>

249
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.640
<v Speaker 1>stuff comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just draws your eyes and it becomes </v>

250
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes rock and then it breaks down </v>

251
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.580
<v Speaker 1>and becomes dirt and plants grow on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

252
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean it literally is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what Hawaii is.</v>

253
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:13.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a volcano and it just came out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground and,</v>

254
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:18.170
<v Speaker 1>and created islands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could see the fucking volcano </v>

255
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:22.440
<v Speaker 1>and they have all these different photos</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could buy there and videos you </v>

256
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.391
<v Speaker 1>could watch out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of towns that were </v>

257
00:12:27.391 --> 00:12:29.701
<v Speaker 1>completely wiped out on the big island </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they'll show you where the town </v>

258
00:12:29.701 --> 00:12:33.100
<v Speaker 1>used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lava just came rolling in like the </v>

259
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.250
<v Speaker 1>fifties and just crush the entire town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it happened in the 18 bullets.</v>

260
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see any of that,</v>

261
00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:40.180
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure there must be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

262
00:12:40.181 --> 00:12:43.240
<v Speaker 1>most of the stuff just gets smushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lot of that comes down.</v>

263
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:48.241
<v Speaker 1>It's just literally annihilates any </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence whatsoever that anything was </v>

264
00:12:48.241 --> 00:12:51.601
<v Speaker 1>there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't realize is that she just </v>

265
00:12:51.601 --> 00:12:52.680
<v Speaker 1>happened so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

266
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:57.750
<v Speaker 1>this world has changed so many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in the last few million years.</v>

267
00:12:59.370 --> 00:12:59.950
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

268
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.500
<v Speaker 1>the best place to find mega donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>skeletons.</v>

269
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.290

271
00:13:06.311 --> 00:13:11.311
<v Speaker 1>ancient prehistoric sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like fucking way bigger than </v>

272
00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:11.311
<v Speaker 1>great wines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

273
00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:15.720
<v Speaker 1>the best place to find their teeth is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana recovers.</v>

274
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:21.060
<v Speaker 1>It used to be the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How fucking fucking crazy Montana used </v>

275
00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:23.980
<v Speaker 1>to be under water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:25.810
<v Speaker 1>so many parts of let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

277
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.540
<v Speaker 1>just like 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

278
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:33.630
<v Speaker 1>half of North America was under a mile </v>
<v Speaker 1>high sheet of ice just 10,000</v>

279
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:34.810
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

280
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.090
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing.</v>

281
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Ten thousand years is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten thousand years ago they were saber </v>

282
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:42.310
<v Speaker 1>tooth tigers and woolly mammoths because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

283
00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:44.320
<v Speaker 1>that just 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

284
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:47.230
<v Speaker 1>fucking Saber Tooth Tigers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

285
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.870
<v Speaker 1>years isn't shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people around them.</v>

286
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.440
<v Speaker 1>What was the $10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that?</v>

287
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.280
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten thousand years before that.</v>

288
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:55.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of human civilization.</v>

289
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.700
<v Speaker 1>It's all who the fuck knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

290
00:13:57.701 --> 00:14:01.720
<v Speaker 1>we know that the big extinction was 65 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million years ago.</v>

291
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.830
<v Speaker 1>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

292
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.840
<v Speaker 1>the one that hit the Yucatan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big meteor or girl that wiped out </v>

293
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.241
<v Speaker 1>supposedly wiped out everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So small mammals and anything bigger </v>

294
00:14:12.241 --> 00:14:17.011
<v Speaker 1>than like a fucking hamster was go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why were they figured out a way to </v>

295
00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:19.740
<v Speaker 1>burrow underground and hardy rats and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit like that,</v>

296
00:14:19.741 --> 00:14:21.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rats or some party animals,</v>

297
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're like the descendants of </v>

298
00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.670
<v Speaker 1>anything that survived 65 million years </v>
<v Speaker 1>while the rest will,</v>

299
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.080
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

300
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:34.470
<v Speaker 1>and some birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just dinosaurs are direct to set </v>

301
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.470
<v Speaker 1>or birds or direct descendant of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs.</v>

302
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some birds survive,</v>

303
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.300
<v Speaker 1>but literally most of the life on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet was wiped the fuck out.</v>

304
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.960
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the super volcanoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men super volcanoes and been wiping out </v>

305
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.420
<v Speaker 1>things on this continent for millions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and millions of years.</v>

306
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Every six to 800,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of yellowstone blows up and </v>

307
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.911
<v Speaker 1>literally wipes out the whole continent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kills everything whenever we started </v>

308
00:14:57.911 --> 00:15:02.850
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's been 2000 earthquakes in </v>

309
00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:03.980
<v Speaker 1>yellowstone national park since January </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this year</v>

310
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.430
<v Speaker 2>of earthquakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how there's so many more now.</v>

311
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

312
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.360
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same.</v>

313
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Just happened to big cities.</v>

314
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

315
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.320
<v Speaker 1>So there's the same amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a hitting places where people.</v>

316
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it happens,</v>

317
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you had an earthquake in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bakersfield,</v>

318
00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:22.970
<v Speaker 2>as long as the damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we get it on the corner of sunset and</v>

319
00:15:22.971 --> 00:15:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Fairfax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be tremendous,</v>

320
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

321
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.730
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like there's so many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

322
00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.640
<v Speaker 1>They seemed like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that because of,</v>

323
00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:32.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news,</v>

324
00:15:32.641 --> 00:15:35.010
<v Speaker 1>like there's more access to information </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

325
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Last year was the year of celebrity </v>
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>

326
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:39.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>

327
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.160
<v Speaker 2>know it never had before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just keeps happening.</v>

328
00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.400
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have done it last year with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jackson.</v>

329
00:15:45.401 --> 00:15:47.230

<v Speaker 2>You want a woman that has a fatter ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want her to take tests,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Those are all like dessert,</v>

367
00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:00.140
<v Speaker 2>but those things are good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's why those things are there.</v>

368
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.570
<v Speaker 2>That traffic tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why they're attractive,</v>

369
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:06.110
<v Speaker 2>it's like actions</v>

370
00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.380
<v Speaker 1>because that's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's obese.</v>

371
00:19:08.381 --> 00:19:11.260
<v Speaker 1>That's unhealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a little bit of fat is good.</v>

372
00:19:11.261 --> 00:19:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Like a little fat fast.</v>

373
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.650
<v Speaker 1>That's not good because they can't move </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.950
<v Speaker 1>underneath your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still it makes you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think they look real nice,</v>

<v Speaker 2>The model with the book there shirt,</v>

420
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:36.320

<v Speaker 2>I'm sure the vaginas just done.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

425
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:47.710

<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

426
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 2>There's no more periods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 when you had 15,</v>

427
00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.980
<v Speaker 2>that's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No more periods.</v>

428
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
<v Speaker 2>That means you're not oscillating means </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not really able to have babies </v>

429
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.360
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body starts to fuck off.</v>

430
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:03.870
<v Speaker 2>You're just shooting loads into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cemetery and shooting those into a </v>

431
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:04.660
<v Speaker 2>casket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got that in there.</v>

432
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:10.250
<v Speaker 2>It's still it's intelligent trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might as well be fucking a rubber </v>

433
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.141
<v Speaker 2>doll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're having sex with a person </v>

434
00:22:13.141 --> 00:22:15.100
<v Speaker 2>that's all well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as far as like you shooting a load </v>

435
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:15.100
<v Speaker 2>inside of her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a total waste of time,</v>

436
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.680
<v Speaker 1>but we don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that,</v>

437
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.640
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying like for nature it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Jew.</v>

438
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean the only reason why sex feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>good is to trick you into fucking so </v>

439
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.750
<v Speaker 1>that you make</v>

440
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.410
<v Speaker 2>would say with a Jewish mystical theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what he wants to know when you </v>

441
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:37.440
<v Speaker 2>pull out or when you masturbate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your semen is said to have been pregnant</v>

442
00:22:37.781 --> 00:22:42.781
<v Speaker 2>at some demon will make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're like appearance right </v>

00:22:42.781 --> 00:22:46.020
<v Speaker 2>here and she just fucking you as your </v>
<v Speaker 2>last rating redness.</v>

444
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Then when you get to heaven or 40 of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in this purgatory level,</v>

445
00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.420
<v Speaker 2>you have to face all your kids and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

446
00:22:52.421 --> 00:22:57.421

<v Speaker 2>Why couldn't we be born real people and </v>

447
00:22:57.421 --> 00:22:58.000
<v Speaker 2>they're all like formed and mangled and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to answer all of them.</v>

448
00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

449
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.620
<v Speaker 1>That might be the greatest story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come on?</v>

450
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.880

<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm turning this into a real studio.</v>

461
00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Did a solo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took like 12 hours.</v>

462
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.520
<v Speaker 1>I did have people help me get rid of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>desk.</v>

463
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever heard of a volcano,</v>

464
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:48.740
<v Speaker 1>you know what a volcano is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A volcano is a vaporizing device and </v>

465
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:54.491
<v Speaker 1>what a vaporizer and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big argument about thc about </v>

466
00:23:54.491 --> 00:23:56.780
<v Speaker 1>marijuana in general is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't smoke and the smoke is bad for</v>

467
00:23:56.781 --> 00:23:57.680
<v Speaker 1>your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

468
00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can eat it,</v>

469
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.960
<v Speaker 1>but eating is very tricky because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get too fucked up because when </v>

470
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.801
<v Speaker 1>you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's processed by the liver and it </v>

471
00:24:08.801 --> 00:24:08.930
<v Speaker 1>creates something called 11 hydroxy </v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolite,</v>

472
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.050
<v Speaker 1>which is four times more psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 1>than thc.</v>

473
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:14.000
<v Speaker 1>And it's really a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

474
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why people get freaked out.</v>

475
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.260
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

476
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a lot of you have seen that </v>
<v Speaker 1>video where that dude,</v>

477
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.570
<v Speaker 1>he's a cop and he calls up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

478
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:28.150
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11 and says that he thinks </v>

479
00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:30.761
<v Speaker 1>he's dying because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he and his girlfriend aid some </v>

480
00:24:30.761 --> 00:24:31.630
<v Speaker 1>pot brownies and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

481
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.940
<v Speaker 1>time was moving really slow and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks he's dying.</v>

482
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

483
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:37.290
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen.</v>

484
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:38.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

485
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.610
<v Speaker 1>to get the office cleaned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This mother Fucker,</v>

486
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:47.650
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got rid of the desk and I'm turning </v>

487
00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:47.650
<v Speaker 1>this thing into a school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

488
00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:48.380
<v Speaker 1>we live right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's over 2000 people.</v>

489
00:24:48.381 --> 00:24:51.270
<v Speaker 1>This is the biggest crowd we've ever had</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else.</v>

490
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a vaporizers and vaporizers </v>
<v Speaker 1>please gentlemen,</v>

491
00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.340
<v Speaker 1>it blows into this plastic bag and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like,</v>

492
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.420
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a</v>

493
00:24:59.550 --> 00:24:59.780
<v Speaker 3>no</v>

494
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Saran wrap or some shit and you just get</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure thc vapor.</v>

495
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:10.660
<v Speaker 1>And what it does is it heats up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>little crystals on the thd and releases </v>

496
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.860
<v Speaker 1>them and it comes out like missed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no smoke at all.</v>

497
00:25:12.861 --> 00:25:16.910
<v Speaker 1>So there's no argument anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no negative health effects.</v>

498
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:26.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have two dedicated cameras </v>
<v Speaker 1>in here and this is going to be a green </v>

499
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:31.250
<v Speaker 1>screen and we're going to be in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I set this up within two weeks.</v>

500
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.620
<v Speaker 1>This will all be green behind us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what we'll watch,</v>

501
00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:38.690
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be like we're flying to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe on a couch because every </v>

502
00:25:38.991 --> 00:25:43.670
<v Speaker 1>episode is a different person than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in Africa.</v>

503
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.740
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

504
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.160
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went over volcanoes.</v>

505
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:51.500
<v Speaker 1>We went over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went over strikeforce.</v>

506
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:53.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've got any opinion </v>
<v Speaker 1>on strikeforce.</v>

507
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I said the whole reason why that brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>took place is because they didn't,</v>

508
00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.750
<v Speaker 1>they didn't guard the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't do a good job of making sure</v>

509
00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:00.800
<v Speaker 1>that nobody got in there.</v>

510
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.340
<v Speaker 1>That was the finance was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go this bottom,</v>

511
00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:06.620
<v Speaker 1>like this spice done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over and over one.</v>

512
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what may have went in there and </v>

513
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.950
<v Speaker 1>talked with jake shields was in the cage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

514
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay,</v>

515
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:16.921
<v Speaker 1>but am I getting the rematch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gilbert Melendez push made him out of </v>

516
00:26:16.921 --> 00:26:16.921
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Diaz brothers jumped,</v>

517
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:17.640
<v Speaker 1>may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

518
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.010
<v Speaker 1>may have pushed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumped in.</v>

519
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.150
<v Speaker 1>It was a brawl to lose kicking him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was down,</v>

520
00:26:23.151 --> 00:26:24.590
<v Speaker 1>it was like four people on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

521
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Eric Apple took jake shields and got </v>
<v Speaker 1>them out of there and push them over to </v>

522
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:30.260

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:54.510
<v Speaker 2>I trained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

576
00:28:54.511 --> 00:28:55.800
<v Speaker 2>if you want to come down and roll with </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

577
00:28:55.801 --> 00:29:00.801
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's challenging guys to roll with </v>

578
00:29:00.801 --> 00:29:04.851
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he trades like Gus Johnson on the </v>

579
00:29:04.851 --> 00:29:04.880
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

580
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.660
<v Speaker 2>Mike Russell on the Internet yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

581
00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.170
<v Speaker 2>it's too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can pull the scores but it.</v>

582
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:15.290
<v Speaker 2>But we put close to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is there's three of us here </v>

583
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.650
<v Speaker 2>can read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't read it.</v>

584
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.900
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could just talk.</v>

585
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.370
<v Speaker 2>We got to pay attention to the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

586
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:29.450
<v Speaker 2>but you can't pay attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience and keep a conversation going </v>

587
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.450
<v Speaker 2>at the same time.</v>

588
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:32.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not really questioning.</v>

589
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Lumped it all.</v>

590
00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:40.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have be great if like if the dea busted.</v>

591
00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.610
<v Speaker 2>We're all legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have prescription.</v>

592
00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were legal and I wouldn't mind some are </v>

593
00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:58.270
<v Speaker 2>crackers back up and I'll fill the bag </v>
<v Speaker 2>up again more seriously though.</v>

594
00:29:58.871 --> 00:30:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's the 4:20</v>

595
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:05.670
<v Speaker 2>episodes we should be allowed to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>like order pizza during the show.</v>

596
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.010
<v Speaker 2>It's for 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're getting high,</v>

597
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:14.670
<v Speaker 2>like snacking on shit that fucks up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flux of the conversation.</v>

598
00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Never had a great conversation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating pizza.</v>

599
00:30:17.411 --> 00:30:22.411
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people are watching this </v>

600
00:30:22.411 --> 00:30:22.411
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This conversation is like a show,</v>

601
00:30:22.411 --> 00:30:25.280
<v Speaker 2>but I'm talking about how it all </v>
<v Speaker 2>started.</v>

602
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you just go walk into my </v>

603
00:30:31.241 --> 00:30:36.241
<v Speaker 2>kitchen and just go scrounge around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way we've got a show to do something </v>

604
00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:41.980
<v Speaker 2>where people order pizza pizza later and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea will be the pizza comes right </v>

605
00:30:45.341 --> 00:30:46.190
<v Speaker 2>before we killed this now.</v>

606
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dare you motherfuckers.</v>

607
00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:51.220
<v Speaker 2>So I'm artist telling us something </v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious.</v>

608
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Listen to this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

609
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to be focusing on show sun.</v>

610
00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.310
<v Speaker 2>Ra was telling us that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ancient Jewish,</v>

611
00:31:00.311 --> 00:31:02.650
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish mystical thought.</v>

612
00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.250
<v Speaker 2>There's a waste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The waste statement.</v>

613
00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:06.660
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

614
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.360
<v Speaker 2>they say when you pull out and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>really math,</v>

615
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.790
<v Speaker 2>reading your fucking woman was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like a ghost.</v>

616
00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:17.680
<v Speaker 2>And when you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go through a place,</v>

617
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.170
<v Speaker 2>all your kids would have been born in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the real life.</v>

618
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Even a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

619
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:29.770
<v Speaker 2>like why did you pull out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want him to be born real boys.</v>

620
00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have any kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got a building.</v>

621
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:45.730
<v Speaker 2>You've got a billion monster babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's per load.</v>

622
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.320
<v Speaker 2>You're like fucking one Venus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

623
00:31:52.321 --> 00:31:57.190
<v Speaker 2>So how many games do you think you got?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dammit,</v>

624
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:04.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a much more efficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>set up here as well with this gentleman </v>

625
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.890
<v Speaker 2>when we get back on an average day for </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>

626
00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:15.190
<v Speaker 2>My belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since you shouldn't six loads a week,</v>

627
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.520
<v Speaker 2>sometimes more than one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever feel like a loser when you </v>

628
00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.140
<v Speaker 2>get to live?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I jerk off more than once a day that </v>

629
00:32:28.691 --> 00:32:30.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm just obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad.</v>

630
00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.590
<v Speaker 2>That's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>

631
00:32:32.591 --> 00:32:34.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not morning already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerked off.</v>

632
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why?</v>

633
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just sit there like a monkey?</v>

634
00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:43.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While you're fucking.</v>

635
00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd be bad at reading,</v>

636
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.220
<v Speaker 4>spreading the seed that's ready to seed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're jerking off into a Napkin.</v>

637
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:55.170
<v Speaker 4>Vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then if there was a good job to do,</v>

638
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.360
<v Speaker 4>no one has ever said no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather just check off.</v>

639
00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:01.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

640
00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Telling you that masturbation is so bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're fucking.</v>

641
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:10.760
<v Speaker 2>That's like the worst case scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're having sex with the demon and </v>

642
00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.761
<v Speaker 2>make it half demon babies that are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be waiting for you when you die to </v>

643
00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:17.391
<v Speaker 2>scream and yell at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is because the institution of </v>

644
00:33:17.391 --> 00:33:17.620
<v Speaker 2>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want that.</v>

645
00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:22.670
<v Speaker 2>That helps religion people making units </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's amazing though.</v>

646
00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do they give a fuck?</v>

647
00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:31.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you give a fuck if you </v>

648
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:31.760
<v Speaker 2>masturbate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

649
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.550
<v Speaker 2>what is it about masturbation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>About no masturbation,</v>

650
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:37.780
<v Speaker 2>you know that somehow or another equates</v>
<v Speaker 2>to them having more control over you </v>

651
00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:38.070
<v Speaker 2>with the more you don't have to pay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you want.</v>

652
00:33:38.071 --> 00:33:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

653
00:33:39.631 --> 00:33:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Women face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the results of Vegas,</v>

654
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:47.630
<v Speaker 2>the morning mass with Less Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's got to be example why the </v>

655
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Catholic Church doesn't want you to any </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth control too,</v>

656
00:33:48.301 --> 00:33:48.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

657
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

658
00:33:49.921 --> 00:33:54.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's definitely way for someone </v>

659
00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:54.921
<v Speaker 2>when they have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel that myself.</v>

660
00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:57.060
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm easier to control now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have kids,</v>

661
00:33:57.061 --> 00:34:02.061
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have kids and you want </v>

662
00:34:02.061 --> 00:34:02.061
<v Speaker 2>everything to be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you want everything to be easy.</v>

663
00:34:02.061 --> 00:34:03.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't want any drama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You fucking a demon and you make babies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are half demon and they're waiting </v>

668
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:22.650
<v Speaker 2>for you when you die.</v>

<v Speaker 4>why stop?</v>

671
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.990
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the time we figured that out,</v>

672
00:34:27.991 --> 00:34:32.991
<v Speaker 4>you've already checked off like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand times 50,000</v>

675
00:34:41.491 --> 00:34:46.491
<v Speaker 4>the other demons to make up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's got to be like,</v>

676
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:49.760
<v Speaker 4>what if you let it lie at 12 babies you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know with,</v>

677

<v Speaker 4>I already got $75,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>recruiting religion ever.</v>

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:32.390
<v Speaker 4>your old tests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're like chapter.</v>

691
00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.700
<v Speaker 4>It is the Torah.</v>

692
00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.910
<v Speaker 2>Fairly decent study that took like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours a,</v>

693
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:42.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember when David was the king of </v>

694
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:43.890
<v Speaker 2>the Jews are so powerful that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't allow any conversions.</v>

695
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were like no one's doing cameras </v>

696
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:50.580
<v Speaker 2>get that's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you guys,</v>

697
00:35:50.581 --> 00:35:52.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

698
00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:57.510
<v Speaker 2>what do you guys think of Jesus that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a real person,</v>

699
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.920
<v Speaker 2>spoke about things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

700
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.840
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a sort of a wise man,</v>

701
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:08.870
<v Speaker 2>but they went off the deep end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they look down on Christianity for </v>

702
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:11.760
<v Speaker 2>choosing Jesus as their savior and Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

703
00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:13.860
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're excited that none of those other</v>

704
00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.500
<v Speaker 2>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny how they're all sort of,</v>

705
00:36:16.501 --> 00:36:19.450
<v Speaker 2>kind of connected like Judaism just </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorta,</v>

706
00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Kinda connected with Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 2>included.</v>

707
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.800
<v Speaker 2>That's why the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

708
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:28.040
<v Speaker 2>all the really conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalist Christians wanted to </v>

709
00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.791
<v Speaker 2>control Israel and support Israel to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in the rapture and they believed</v>

710
00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:36.810
<v Speaker 2>that when the shit goes down best place </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be like you have to protect them,</v>

711
00:36:36.811 --> 00:36:38.550
<v Speaker 2>but they believe that they're wrong.</v>

712
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Even though the Bible says that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>the chosen people,</v>

713
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.570
<v Speaker 2>the Christians to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

714
00:36:42.571 --> 00:36:43.980
<v Speaker 2>but you guys kept the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucked up.</v>

715
00:36:43.981 --> 00:36:48.981
<v Speaker 2>We got it right and don't be an awesome </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing for the Jews.</v>

716
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:54.780
<v Speaker 2>If it came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jesus actually never existed.</v>

717
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

718
00:36:55.651 --> 00:36:57.420
<v Speaker 2>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never even existed.</v>

719
00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:00.550
<v Speaker 2>That would have been crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Christian truth.</v>

720
00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Do they have that Jesus documents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

721
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.630
<v Speaker 2>and apparently that's very much a debate</v>
<v Speaker 2>very much in debate.</v>

722
00:37:07.631 --> 00:37:12.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of scholars to do not </v>

723
00:37:12.631 --> 00:37:14.241
<v Speaker 2>believe he was an actual person because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they believe that Jesus existed but just</v>

724
00:37:16.051 --> 00:37:21.051
<v Speaker 2>wasn't mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews believe that Jesus existed and he </v>

725
00:37:21.051 --> 00:37:22.410
<v Speaker 2>was mad and it would make it would </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit their costs because they'll kill</v>

726
00:37:22.411 --> 00:37:25.890
<v Speaker 2>each other if slicing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you weren't their religion.</v>

727
00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I believe that they were the former Rep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great rabbis would talk about what </v>

728
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:35.020
<v Speaker 2>we will do it that makes me think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

729
00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.430
<v Speaker 2>even though there isn't that much proof </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he actually wants to live in,</v>

730
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of holes and that went bed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the guy that never was all that </v>

731
00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:42.440
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

732
00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:42.510
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come?</v>

733
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:45.210
<v Speaker 2>How come the Jews and the Muslims don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>jump on that?</v>

734
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ never existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

735
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:51.170
<v Speaker 2>I exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that makes me think damn.</v>

736
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.160
<v Speaker 2>He probably was a man who was a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>

737
00:37:53.161 --> 00:37:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

738
00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.050
<v Speaker 2>But the issue is you can't send false </v>
<v Speaker 2>prophets.</v>

739
00:37:57.051 --> 00:38:00.900
<v Speaker 2>They said there's many way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy existed for sure.</v>

740
00:38:00.901 --> 00:38:02.580
<v Speaker 2>He didn't walk on water and come back </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the dead.</v>

741
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:07.910
<v Speaker 2>That was like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>like someone thinking Bruce Lee could </v>

742
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.120
<v Speaker 2>really beat up 50 people like Bruce Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real guy,</v>

743
00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.970
<v Speaker 2>and Bruce Lee the superstar to different</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

744
00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:17.060
<v Speaker 2>But it's how many people think their </v>
<v Speaker 2>life on some story that would not make </v>

745
00:38:17.101 --> 00:38:18.720
<v Speaker 2>any fucking sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You told it today,</v>

746
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:24.030
<v Speaker 2>like if you told that story today and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said there was a dude who walked on </v>

747
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:24.570
<v Speaker 2>water and came back from dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wouldn't go.</v>

748
00:38:24.571 --> 00:38:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Just shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous,</v>

749
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.640
<v Speaker 2>but because it's 2000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's like,</v>

750
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:30.660
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

751
00:38:30.661 --> 00:38:35.661
<v Speaker 2>you could be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like anything like rational </v>

752
00:38:35.661 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 2>people that you talk to that would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a</v>

753
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.570
<v Speaker 1>guy that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're doing fear factor,</v>

754
00:38:37.571 --> 00:38:38.170
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

755
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.200
<v Speaker 1>we did a family fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We came to people's houses and made him </v>

756
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:43.450
<v Speaker 1>do things and we traveled all across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

757
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.540
<v Speaker 1>This dude was a teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a fucking math teacher and he was</v>

758
00:38:46.541 --> 00:38:51.541
<v Speaker 1>telling me like scientifically that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Jesus existed because you can prove</v>

759
00:38:52.001 --> 00:38:52.830
<v Speaker 1>it because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

760
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:56.890
<v Speaker 1>they've looked at molecules that are too</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex to just occurred naturally.</v>

761
00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.340
<v Speaker 1>This is a super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a ridiculous argument and this is</v>

762
00:39:00.341 --> 00:39:01.780
<v Speaker 1>super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super smart guy.</v>

763
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.210
<v Speaker 1>And I was listening to them talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

764
00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:08.240
<v Speaker 1>supposedly super smart guy and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this guy talking like how </v>

765
00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.370
<v Speaker 1>it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy can't see that.</v>

766
00:39:09.371 --> 00:39:14.371
<v Speaker 1>He believes in some reason you can say </v>
<v Speaker 1>any courses assistant because something </v>

767
00:39:14.371 --> 00:39:17.820
<v Speaker 1>is too amazing to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>National debt does not.</v>

768
00:39:17.821 --> 00:39:22.821
<v Speaker 1>It's not true system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I draw a picture of Jesus and with the </v>

769
00:39:22.821 --> 00:39:22.821
<v Speaker 1>capture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Jesus.</v>

770
00:39:22.821 --> 00:39:22.821
<v Speaker 1>That's better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

771
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.450
<v Speaker 1>but you can never say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can exist naturally.</v>

772
00:39:25.451 --> 00:39:28.600
<v Speaker 1>You don't know the power of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature is absolutely ridiculous.</v>

773
00:39:28.601 --> 00:39:33.601
<v Speaker 1>Completely unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's subatomic particles that blink </v>

774
00:39:33.601 --> 00:39:35.740
<v Speaker 1>in and out of existence all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They appeared in two places at once.</v>

775
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:37.540
<v Speaker 1>This is science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real shit.</v>

776
00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:42.541
<v Speaker 1>We know that exists in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the whole pattern of nature is </v>

777
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:47.670
<v Speaker 1>gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The FIBONACCI sequence that you see in </v>

778
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Pine cones and pineapples and all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of different plants and existence,</v>

779
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:55.170
<v Speaker 1>human facial features,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is like a mathematical code to </v>

780
00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:59.461
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that there's a fucking </v>

781
00:39:59.461 --> 00:40:02.281
<v Speaker 1>dude pressing the button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might mean that the whole thing is </v>

782
00:40:02.281 --> 00:40:05.260
<v Speaker 1>just super complicated and conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did press in the but that there's a</v>

783
00:40:05.261 --> 00:40:06.420
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a duke.</v>

784
00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.130
<v Speaker 1>We would want to break it down to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like us.</v>

785
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:13.020
<v Speaker 1>We want to like make a super version of </v>
<v Speaker 1>us that's running for.</v>

786
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about that.</v>

787
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:19.230
<v Speaker 1>The old man with the beard and the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus every.</v>

788
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:24.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

789
00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

790
00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:31.690
<v Speaker 1>I know of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sounded like you were saying that</v>

791
00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:36.780
<v Speaker 1>you were describing how wonderful the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities and the FIBONACCI theories </v>

792
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:42.030
<v Speaker 1>and how it's all like this code and </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure it to be a doctor like.</v>

793
00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:48.660
<v Speaker 1>To me that was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an intelligent other side that </v>

794
00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:52.070
<v Speaker 1>is way too complex for us to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I don't think it is.</v>

795
00:40:52.071 --> 00:40:57.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean it could be that everything has </v>
<v Speaker 1>an intelligence about what it is as a </v>

796
00:40:57.071 --> 00:41:01.441
<v Speaker 1>single entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's much more likely than an </v>

797
00:41:01.441 --> 00:41:05.490
<v Speaker 1>interconnected thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We totally gray slacks like ocean when </v>

798
00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:06.610
<v Speaker 1>the ocean and then we're like little </v>
<v Speaker 1>water molecules,</v>

799
00:41:06.611 --> 00:41:08.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all.</v>

800
00:41:08.351 --> 00:41:13.351
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what psychedelic experiences we </v>

801
00:41:13.351 --> 00:41:15.691
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like you're in the ocean </v>

802
00:41:15.691 --> 00:41:16.891
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like you're all connected all </v>

803
00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:17.650
<v Speaker 1>around you to something that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see those mushrooms.</v>

804
00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I never told you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't find myself on a fucking </v>

805
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Thursday night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided to a party by myself.</v>

806
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took all those fucking mushrooms.</v>

807
00:41:26.921 --> 00:41:31.921
<v Speaker 1>I got pictures and everything and from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing,</v>

808
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.050
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't five grands.</v>

809
00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:34.640
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

810
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.080
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't five.</v>

811
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.480
<v Speaker 5>I've got five grams before that was like</v>
<v Speaker 5>three and a half,</v>

812
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:43.100
<v Speaker 5>so I did them all myself and I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to let you know.</v>

813
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.500
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty fucking insane.</v>

814
00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.610
<v Speaker 5>It was insane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not as intense is.</v>

815
00:41:49.611 --> 00:41:52.550
<v Speaker 5>It would have been five brands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty intense,</v>

816
00:41:52.551 --> 00:41:57.551
<v Speaker 5>but the five grants was like dnt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five grams really is that threshold </v>

817
00:41:57.551 --> 00:41:57.930
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>

818
00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:03.400
<v Speaker 5>That was about a year and a half ago </v>
<v Speaker 5>when I did the five grams and fucking I </v>

819
00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.630
<v Speaker 5>was at a zoo and I just woke up in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>zoo.</v>

820
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.150
<v Speaker 5>I thought doing mushrooms at the zoo </v>
<v Speaker 5>would be fucking awesome.</v>

821
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:09.890
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Outdoors.</v>

822
00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.500
<v Speaker 5>You did mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go out in nature zoo,</v>

823
00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:15.530
<v Speaker 5>but that is like anti nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

824
00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.110
<v Speaker 5>I freaked the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get the fuck out.</v>

825
00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:22.460
<v Speaker 5>You feel like you were in prison if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>were watching their sorrow for sure.</v>

826
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.480
<v Speaker 5>Like we just had to get the fog out.</v>

827
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Super negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

828
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:33.251
<v Speaker 1>I feel terrible when I go to the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not like it at all and it makes me </v>

829
00:42:33.251 --> 00:42:36.581
<v Speaker 1>feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to enjoy it because I used to </v>

830
00:42:36.581 --> 00:42:38.450
<v Speaker 1>enjoy caring for the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then one time I went one time when I</v>

831
00:42:38.451 --> 00:42:43.340
<v Speaker 1>was super baked and when I did what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did when I was super vague,</v>

832
00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I got really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt terrible.</v>

833
00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:49.640
<v Speaker 1>I got really sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a terrible,</v>

834
00:42:49.641 --> 00:42:53.360
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing to do or doing was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking these animals and shoving them in</v>

835
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:56.090
<v Speaker 1>these cages and they don't even get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it and they just pace.</v>

836
00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:01.380
<v Speaker 5>Had a polar bear at the La Zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He'll just pace back and forth by that </v>

837
00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.520
<v Speaker 5>back door,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just waiting for that fucking back white</v>

838
00:43:03.521 --> 00:43:07.680
<v Speaker 5>door,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like fake ice and then a white dog,</v>

839
00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:11.440
<v Speaker 5>white dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

840
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:13.710
<v Speaker 5>That's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

841
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.960
<v Speaker 5>Mad and I freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Went out to the parking lot and this </v>

842
00:43:20.861 --> 00:43:25.861
<v Speaker 5>chick I was with me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we did the exact same thing and we saw </v>

843
00:43:25.861 --> 00:43:27.030
<v Speaker 5>the exact same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We looked at the mountains.</v>

844
00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:29.850
<v Speaker 5>We would stop in the middle of a parking</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot because everything was connected.</v>

845
00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.630
<v Speaker 5>It was all connected to look at this </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>

846
00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:36.850
<v Speaker 5>This guy were dancing before and as tech</v>
<v Speaker 5>writing,</v>

847
00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:39.910
<v Speaker 5>we look at the mountains in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>distance,</v>

848
00:43:39.911 --> 00:43:44.911
<v Speaker 5>like miles away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like passively in the mountains and all </v>

849
00:43:44.911 --> 00:43:44.911
<v Speaker 5>of a sudden Aztec pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The former,</v>

850
00:43:44.911 --> 00:43:45.600
<v Speaker 5>the Aztec pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

851
00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:51.110
<v Speaker 5>what are you seeing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you seeing as the Aztec </v>

852
00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:51.700
<v Speaker 5>patterns?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dense look at stuff.</v>

853
00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:56.930
<v Speaker 5>The clouds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the clouds are in their spot for a </v>

854
00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.210
<v Speaker 5>second and then they formed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I remember connor telling me,</v>

855
00:43:58.211 --> 00:44:01.840
<v Speaker 5>because congress is the one who turned </v>
<v Speaker 5>me onto the dude who had him.</v>

00:44:10.111 --> 00:44:12.690
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even pay attention to that </v>
<v Speaker 5>really badly.</v>

861
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.090
<v Speaker 5>We get in the fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Swear to God.</v>

862
00:44:16.091 --> 00:44:18.400
<v Speaker 5>I was driving on the freeway freaking </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

863
00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:20.500
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know if there was cars next to </v>
<v Speaker 5>me on the side of me,</v>

864
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:23.950
<v Speaker 5>but it really did look like as I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>driving on the freeway,</v>

865
00:44:23.951 --> 00:44:28.951
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it wasn't like I was in the what </v>

<v Speaker 5>dreams may come.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember that Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I was driving on the and it</v>

868
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:37.010
<v Speaker 4>was like rose petals and like bushes </v>
<v Speaker 4>would form in front of my car.</v>

869
00:44:37.231 --> 00:44:39.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm driving really rose pedals and </v>
<v Speaker 4>bushes.</v>

870
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:46.520
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking insane by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to encourage.</v>

871
00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:51.820
<v Speaker 4>I just wanted to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just trying to get home with terrible </v>

872
00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.080
<v Speaker 4>mistake.</v>

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.780
<v Speaker 4>life show because that night's show was </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking insane.</v>

875
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:05.220
<v Speaker 4>The twirling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you just kind of explain it.</v>

876
00:45:05.221 --> 00:45:06.990
<v Speaker 4>It's just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's all I want.</v>

877
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:12.370
<v Speaker 4>I want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think that you see certain </v>

878
00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:15.291
<v Speaker 4>like religious symbolism and Hindu shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and food an I got it from.</v>

879
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:20.490
<v Speaker 4>You think that's where they must be </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing mushrooms since the dawn of time.</v>

880
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:25.640
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when I looked at him like that's </v>

881
00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:25.640
<v Speaker 4>where all this shit comes from.</v>

882
00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.180
<v Speaker 4>Alex Grey Shit telling you that's where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's coming from.</v>

883
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:33.620
<v Speaker 4>These old like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know those things that I have in my </v>

884
00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:34.560
<v Speaker 4>office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Gouda those birds,</v>

885
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:36.270
<v Speaker 4>you know those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm talking about.</v>

886
00:45:36.271 --> 00:45:40.280
<v Speaker 4>And the media room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I noticed there's crazy psychedelic furs</v>

887
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:43.140
<v Speaker 4>and when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I did the DMT ones much,</v>

888
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:48.170
<v Speaker 4>I saw those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw like that imagery and then when I </v>

889
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 4>went to a store and saw them for sale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

890
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.350
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoever created that thing,</v>

891
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.510
<v Speaker 4>like was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they had to have seen that.</v>

892
00:45:54.511 --> 00:45:56.870
<v Speaker 4>Like you could see that first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could say,</v>

893
00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.050
<v Speaker 4>well why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

894
00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:02.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it something that's already there?</v>

895
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.970
<v Speaker 4>We just can't tune into it until we take</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics?</v>

896
00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:09.900
<v Speaker 4>Or is it the same hallucination happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>to every person that takes a drug.</v>

897
00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.240
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

898
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's just,</v>

899
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:21.740
<v Speaker 4>it opens up your sense that somehow to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this other dimension or all these </v>

900
00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.980
<v Speaker 4>dimensions that are all around us and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're,</v>

901
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:27.480
<v Speaker 4>we're in a radio and we're only tuned </v>
<v Speaker 4>into 97 point one.</v>

902
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:32.510
<v Speaker 4>It has an infinite number of stations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just going into another space </v>

903
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:33.670
<v Speaker 4>where that's possible is that I think it</v>
<v Speaker 4>just fucks with the branding.</v>

904
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:37.200
<v Speaker 4>Two things were possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

905
00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:39.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't personally think that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that.</v>

906
00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the shit that I'm seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

907
00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.120
<v Speaker 4>Interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the shit that with five grand,</v>

908
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.910
<v Speaker 4>five grand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the chicken,</v>

909
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:49.980
<v Speaker 4>what you is for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>

910
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:55.010
<v Speaker 4>It seems impossible for me to bring that</v>
<v Speaker 4>up in my brain like it's just the most </v>

911
00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:01.400
<v Speaker 4>beautifully constructed flowing shapes </v>
<v Speaker 4>of random and you don't really.</v>

912
00:47:04.571 --> 00:47:09.571
<v Speaker 4>You're not high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You close your eyes and see like random </v>

913
00:47:09.571 --> 00:47:11.160
<v Speaker 4>blackness and there's no pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like we might see who lit type</v>

914
00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:13.860
<v Speaker 4>flashes of light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you close your eyes,</v>

915
00:47:13.861 --> 00:47:17.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden there's this show that's</v>

916
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.380
<v Speaker 4>about a thousand times more complex than</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

917
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:24.381
<v Speaker 4>Visualize it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got an item and that's pretty </v>

918
00:47:24.381 --> 00:47:24.381
<v Speaker 4>fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That visualized.</v>

919
00:47:24.381 --> 00:47:28.750
<v Speaker 4>It's in that same vein but a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 4>times more complex way more complex and </v>

920
00:47:29.231 --> 00:47:29.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

921
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm not designing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not controlling this.</v>

922
00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.490
<v Speaker 1>There's someone else controlling someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else's making this shit,</v>

923
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:41.730
<v Speaker 1>not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like that's definitely one </v>

924
00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:44.311
<v Speaker 1>option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but another option is that stuff </v>

925
00:47:44.311 --> 00:47:46.910
<v Speaker 1>supercharges your perceptions and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes your imagination more </v>

926
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:51.451
<v Speaker 1>hypersensitive and it makes your brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>go wild because it reacts with,</v>

927
00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the size that you use to see things as a</v>

928
00:47:55.361 --> 00:47:55.870
<v Speaker 1>parasite.</v>

929
00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.240
<v Speaker 2>It lives in the sewers and it only feeds</v>
<v Speaker 2>on cat springs.</v>

930
00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:02.780
<v Speaker 2>So what it does is it took a worm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

931
00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it lets.</v>

932
00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:09.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm a rat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ethan and the at Burlington the brain </v>

933
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:12.861
<v Speaker 2>and the only thing that changes the wrap</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the church and their behavior at all </v>

934
00:48:12.861 --> 00:48:12.920
<v Speaker 2>except it takes their way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their fear of cats.</v>

935
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:18.750
<v Speaker 2>So they will get eaten by a cab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything else saying they gave and </v>

936
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:19.310
<v Speaker 2>when they see a capital like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

937
00:48:19.311 --> 00:48:20.630
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing major.</v>

938
00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Cat kills it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

939
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.590
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

940
00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:25.970
<v Speaker 2>And that's his brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

941
00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Totally fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this one on the show.</v>

942
00:48:28.541 --> 00:48:32.000
<v Speaker 1>The other one that they do where there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a worm that gets inside of grasshopper,</v>

943
00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:37.010
<v Speaker 1>convinced the grasshopper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he commit suicide so that it can hatch </v>

944
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:40.111
<v Speaker 1>out of the spot it grows and how it gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>it teaches the grasshopper to jump into </v>

945
00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:42.460
<v Speaker 1>the water and kill itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an aquatic warm,</v>

946
00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:46.360
<v Speaker 1>so it has to be hatched in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>water or things like that.</v>

947
00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:51.340
<v Speaker 1>That's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just like existing on a whole new</v>

948
00:48:51.341 --> 00:48:56.341
<v Speaker 1>level of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that alone right there is so </v>

949
00:48:56.341 --> 00:48:58.810
<v Speaker 1>fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so amazing.</v>

950
00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:00.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just another like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

951
00:49:00.911 --> 00:49:05.080
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started growing up I think.</v>

952
00:49:05.081 --> 00:49:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Well there's definitely something going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

953
00:49:06.371 --> 00:49:09.940
<v Speaker 1>but I think our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our idea that our culture is based on,</v>

954
00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:12.820
<v Speaker 1>it's just that we wanted to be close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

955
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:15.580
<v Speaker 1>We want it to be like a super version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

956
00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:19.060
<v Speaker 1>which is why would a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is like a super version of a human,</v>

957
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:21.820
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all these rules and God is,</v>

958
00:49:21.821 --> 00:49:26.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking kind of addictive and gets </v>

959
00:49:26.821 --> 00:49:29.281
<v Speaker 1>pissed at you if you fuck up and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of religions is willing to kill you if </v>

960
00:49:29.281 --> 00:49:29.870
<v Speaker 1>you don't listen to them.</v>

961
00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want it like a super version of box,</v>

962
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:37.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's much more possible that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing is just connected to </v>

963
00:49:37.661 --> 00:49:39.540
<v Speaker 1>something that you can't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

964
00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:43.560
<v Speaker 1>some big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful thing that feeds off itself.</v>

965
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:44.430
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

966
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:49.500
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This world has a role and plays a part </v>

967
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.470
<v Speaker 1>in this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just we're used to it.</v>

968
00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:55.620
<v Speaker 1>We don't realize how funny it really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking is because we're used to it </v>

969
00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.250
<v Speaker 1>because it's just a normal part of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and people get used to anything.</v>

970
00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:02.400
<v Speaker 1>People in Africa have giant plates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stick in their lips and all the </v>

971
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.490
<v Speaker 1>girls do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're used to it.</v>

972
00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:08.550
<v Speaker 1>We just get used to stupid shit and once</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're used to something then </v>

973
00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:09.310
<v Speaker 1>everything's become spine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we think that there's some sort</v>

974
00:50:09.311 --> 00:50:10.660
<v Speaker 1>of a grand order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things,</v>

975
00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:12.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

976
00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:15.900
<v Speaker 1>it's really getting weirder and weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I got older,</v>

977
00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:18.360
<v Speaker 1>as I got older and I look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

978
00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:21.090
<v Speaker 1>our culture and I look at life on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

979
00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I look at my own mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

980
00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:24.840
<v Speaker 1>the fact that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

981
00:50:24.841 --> 00:50:27.930
<v Speaker 1>the next half of my life is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>half of my life were.</v>

982
00:50:27.931 --> 00:50:29.750
<v Speaker 1>My buddies will work good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

983
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:32.810
<v Speaker 1>that's just the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting close to dying.</v>

984
00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:36.050
<v Speaker 1>You know you're going to have health </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues if you don't watch your diet,</v>

985
00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:38.330
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to make sure you get the proper</v>

986
00:50:38.331 --> 00:50:42.290
<v Speaker 1>sleep or you might get heart attacks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit like things start going wrong.</v>

987
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Even when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you really start assessing this </v>

988
00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:47.650
<v Speaker 1>whole big picture of what this really is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

989
00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.720
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I feel I've been flying </v>

990
00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:53.420
<v Speaker 1>without a manual for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just operating my life.</v>

991
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Not really having any idea how to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly just but learning from my fuck</v>

992
00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.700
<v Speaker 1>ups starting from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We look.</v>

993
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:07.900
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a way better way to </v>

994
00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.901
<v Speaker 1>learn life than the way we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is there a time you can get yourself </v>

995
00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:15.110
<v Speaker 1>and your own personality figured out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're rolling the way he interacts with</v>

996
00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:15.740
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out.</v>

997
00:51:15.741 --> 00:51:17.870
<v Speaker 1>By the time you get that figured out so </v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

998
00:51:17.871 --> 00:51:18.740
<v Speaker 1>you're already dying</v>

999
00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:21.870
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>

1000
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I know what I do now,</v>

1001
00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:25.990
<v Speaker 1>and I go back to that age and you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>laid so much.</v>

1002
00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1003
00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:29.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look like you were 34,</v>

1004
00:51:29.471 --> 00:51:32.010
<v Speaker 4>like 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1005
00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:37.110
<v Speaker 4>Let we figured that shit on now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More advancement.</v>

1006
00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Skincare for men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you're not supposed to </v>

1007
00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:47.041
<v Speaker 1>live long enough to figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the reason why turtles </v>

1008
00:51:47.041 --> 00:51:50.671
<v Speaker 1>live to be a thousand years old and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people live to be 100 is because we're </v>

1009
00:51:50.671 --> 00:51:52.730
<v Speaker 1>not supposed to have a thousand years </v>
<v Speaker 1>toward us.</v>

1010
00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the funding,</v>

1011
00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:02.010
<v Speaker 4>little geographic today,</v>

1012
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:09.490
<v Speaker 1>thousand years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they literally lived like back when </v>

1013
00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:12.830
<v Speaker 1>people were writing fucking what was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand year old kid?</v>

1014
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:14.530
<v Speaker 4>They should put like little black box</v>

1015
00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:22.100
<v Speaker 1>you to write everything out on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written out a thousand years ago.</v>

1016
00:52:22.471 --> 00:52:24.630
<v Speaker 1>They might've been doing on animal skins</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a lot.</v>

1017
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:28.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

1018
00:52:28.051 --> 00:52:33.051
<v Speaker 1>You know like the Dead Sea Scrolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit was all written on animal </v>

1019
00:52:33.051 --> 00:52:35.601
<v Speaker 1>skins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those motherfuckers didn't even know </v>

1020
00:52:35.601 --> 00:52:36.510
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even have paper back.</v>

1021
00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.110
<v Speaker 1>There could be a dead sea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scroll on a fucking turtle.</v>

1022
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.260
<v Speaker 4>I wish I knew for sure who's</v>

1023
00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:49.770
<v Speaker 1>telling the truth about the Dead Sea </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrolls because I don't have enough time</v>

1024
00:52:49.771 --> 00:52:52.080
<v Speaker 1>to learn ancient Hebrew or what does an </v>
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>

1025
00:52:52.081 --> 00:52:57.081
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go back and read the Dead Sea </v>

1026
00:52:57.081 --> 00:52:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Scrolls and decipher for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's all this dispute on what the</v>

1027
00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Dead Sea Scrolls actually means and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say that it contains all kinds of</v>

1028
00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:05.980
<v Speaker 1>nutty shit like fucking Ufo shows and </v>
<v Speaker 1>flying saucers and I mean there's,</v>

1029
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:08.250
<v Speaker 1>there's guys who have decided from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dead Sea Scrolls,</v>

1030
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:11.700
<v Speaker 1>like the John Marco Lego guy says it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all about mushrooms.</v>

1031
00:53:11.701 --> 00:53:16.701
<v Speaker 1>You said it was about was them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the them scary mushroom and </v>

1032
00:53:16.701 --> 00:53:19.440
<v Speaker 1>fertility rituals and he breaks it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>down like the origins of the words,</v>

1033
00:53:19.441 --> 00:53:23.580
<v Speaker 1>but people argue against him and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know who's right.</v>

1034
00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:28.790
<v Speaker 1>It's too fucking live there on ABC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all the best scientists on the </v>

1035
00:53:29.311 --> 00:53:31.260
<v Speaker 1>planet and all the best linguists they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get together.</v>

1036
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:36.380
<v Speaker 4>That should be important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's discipleship in front of the </v>

1037
00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:36.870
<v Speaker 4>world as a satellite feed from fucking</v>

1038
00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:41.120
<v Speaker 1>allegro passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Guy who wrote that book,</v>

1039
00:53:41.121 --> 00:53:46.121
<v Speaker 1>but he was the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the one of the head guys for the </v>

1040
00:53:46.121 --> 00:53:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Dead Sea Scrolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You worked on it for 14 years and he was</v>

1041
00:53:48.171 --> 00:53:50.600
<v Speaker 1>the only agnostic in the group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1042
00:53:50.601 --> 00:53:55.601
<v Speaker 1>they had a bunch of people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordained ministers and they were to </v>

1043
00:53:55.601 --> 00:53:58.541
<v Speaker 1>decipher is then we're all religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and he started out a religious </v>

1044
00:53:58.541 --> 00:54:02.291
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you started studying theology </v>

1045
00:54:02.291 --> 00:54:04.510
<v Speaker 1>you realized somewhere along the line is</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously bullshit and she just became </v>

1046
00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:05.510
<v Speaker 1>agnostic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he looked at the whole,</v>

1047
00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:07.750
<v Speaker 1>the whole picture completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>than all the other guys.</v>

1048
00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:12.850
<v Speaker 1>So they all were refuted his findings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of people that say </v>

1049
00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:13.340
<v Speaker 1>he's right and a lot of people will say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1050
00:54:13.341 --> 00:54:16.030
<v Speaker 1>He was the head scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the number one dude.</v>

1051
00:54:16.031 --> 00:54:21.031
<v Speaker 1>If he was the guy who had it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was the guy who was looking at </v>

1052
00:54:21.031 --> 00:54:24.491
<v Speaker 1>it objectively and everybody else was </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it with a religious slant </v>

1053
00:54:24.491 --> 00:54:24.590
<v Speaker 1>because fucking guys thinks it was all </v>
<v Speaker 1>about mushrooms.</v>

1054
00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:27.440
<v Speaker 1>It was all about psychedelic mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would do it,</v>

1055
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:32.470
<v Speaker 1>hide these mushrooms from the Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would hide like what does the </v>

1056
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:34.160
<v Speaker 1>magic and with the mushrooms can do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they hid it from him,</v>

1057
00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stories.</v>

1058
00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:37.880
<v Speaker 1>And they didn't even write it down for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a thousand years.</v>

1059
00:54:37.881 --> 00:54:40.880
<v Speaker 1>They just told each other as a story for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand years,</v>

1060
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.870
<v Speaker 1>so it just became all fucked up and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>he breaks down like ancient words.</v>

1061
00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Keith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he broke down the word Christ.</v>

1062
00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:53.130
<v Speaker 1>He brought it back to an ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sumerian word that means a mushroom </v>

1063
00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:54.800
<v Speaker 1>covered in God's semen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

1064
00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they thought it was raining,</v>

1065
00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I was coming on the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why things would come up out of </v>

1066
00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:02.740
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like come wasn't bad debt.</v>

1067
00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:07.310
<v Speaker 1>So like when God would reign and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming on the earth,</v>

1068
00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:09.920
<v Speaker 1>these mushrooms would just appear </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't have microscopes,</v>

1069
00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:12.680
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know what a fucking lie a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spore is.</v>

1070
00:55:12.681 --> 00:55:16.250
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't see microscopic things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they didn't see any seed or anything.</v>

1071
00:55:16.251 --> 00:55:21.251
<v Speaker 1>And also these big mushrooms appeared </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the next day they grow quick and </v>

1072
00:55:21.251 --> 00:55:23.270
<v Speaker 1>they start eating them and they tripped </v>
<v Speaker 1>their fucking balls.</v>

1073
00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:25.160
<v Speaker 1>They don't want anybody else to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

1074
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:30.430
<v Speaker 1>So they tried to hide the information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were told either a high keeping it </v>

1075
00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:30.980
<v Speaker 1>from their enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1076
00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that nuts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Zurich it off.</v>

1077
00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they used to look at him or </v>

1078
00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:39.070
<v Speaker 1>did he pull out some guidance</v>

1079
00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:45.340
<v Speaker 4>somehow?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to figure out,</v>

1080
00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:46.840
<v Speaker 4>Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to</v>

1081
00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:53.490
<v Speaker 1>so good to have a baby right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about how good it feels to have a </v>

1082
00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:53.490
<v Speaker 1>baby right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing,</v>

1083
00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:56.610
<v Speaker 1>incredible feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most babies now,</v>

1084
00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.680
<v Speaker 1>they live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live to be grownups,</v>

1085
00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:04.740
<v Speaker 1>ups to be adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to worry about them </v>

1086
00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:05.600
<v Speaker 1>getting eaten by lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to worry about plague,</v>

1087
00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:10.770
<v Speaker 1>but the people that live back then had </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same love for the kids as we do now,</v>

1088
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.220
<v Speaker 1>but they couldn't help it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there were people were dying left and</v>

1089
00:56:14.221 --> 00:56:19.221
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing you can do to stop </v>

1090
00:56:19.221 --> 00:56:19.221
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must have been nuts,</v>

1091
00:56:19.221 --> 00:56:21.360
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must've been fucking horrifying.</v>

1092
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Having kids just got well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>must be why they had all these rituals.</v>

1093
00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.960
<v Speaker 1>It was fertility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rituals are so important.</v>

1094
00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:30.850
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to have as many kids as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

1095
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Roman times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 percent perhaps the people that have </v>

1096
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:40.120
<v Speaker 1>the damn before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1097
00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Adulthood that's can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only half of them make it turned out </v>

1098
00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:52.350
<v Speaker 1>that the condition he imagined what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was or something like that.</v>

1099
00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:54.130
<v Speaker 1>That was on discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>

1100
00:56:54.131 --> 00:56:56.160
<v Speaker 1>The history channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't quote me on that.</v>

1101
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Like oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

1102
00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it wasn't 50 percent,</v>

1103
00:57:00.491 --> 00:57:05.491
<v Speaker 1>it had to be a high number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they just didn't have someone </v>

1104
00:57:05.491 --> 00:57:05.800
<v Speaker 1>check that mortality rate and Roman </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

1105
00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 50 percent could be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1106
00:57:09.431 --> 00:57:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I've had two major surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both my knees reconstructed,</v>

1107
00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:17.890
<v Speaker 1>both acs and one more minor surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My meniscus surgery on my hand,</v>

1108
00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:19.920
<v Speaker 1>but if I lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1109
00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:21.610
<v Speaker 1>thousand years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be fucked,</v>

1110
00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.900
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be fucked.</v>

1111
00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.650
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be doing Jujitsu?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1112
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:26.590
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't have happened to run into </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1113
00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Plan to work it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learned have been a softball </v>

1114
00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:32.890
<v Speaker 1>champions.</v>

1115
00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Softball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I smashed my biggest.</v>

1116
00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:43.570
<v Speaker 1>There's guys out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking champions in softball.</v>

1117
00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Like they're the fucking Mark Mcguire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A softball.</v>

1118
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:49.480
<v Speaker 1>There's guys out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do this.</v>

1119
00:57:49.481 --> 00:57:53.110
<v Speaker 1>That create those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is the Hicks and Gracie to find that</v>

1120
00:57:53.111 --> 00:57:54.020
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been great.</v>

1121
00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:59.030
<v Speaker 1>So softball that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How accurate can you be when you whip </v>

1122
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.610
<v Speaker 1>that fucking thing around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks dope.</v>

1123
00:57:59.611 --> 00:58:02.190
<v Speaker 1>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then checks because it all.</v>

1124
00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever seen the chicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw that hard regular.</v>

1125
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen a chick throw it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly the right way to do it?</v>

1126
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did they throw into narrative that's</v>

1127
00:58:12.761 --> 00:58:14.070
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1128
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.180
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's like breaking the balls </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pool.</v>

1129
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.370
<v Speaker 1>You know how you try to break the balls </v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>

1130
00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:23.610
<v Speaker 1>She wants like a little person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have like a loose wrist and just </v>

1131
00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:26.520
<v Speaker 1>smash is like a timing to it where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just knowing exactly how to put </v>

1132
00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:26.680
<v Speaker 1>their weight into it and just not like.</v>

1133
00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:34.370
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Jujitsu should straighten things </v>

1134
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:34.540
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to techniques and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the more you do techniques,</v>

1135
00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:36.790
<v Speaker 1>the more those techniques just becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>grain,</v>

1136
00:58:36.791 --> 00:58:41.791
<v Speaker 1>the way your body moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body just gets really good at the </v>

1137
00:58:41.791 --> 00:58:42.940
<v Speaker 1>movement so you can teach your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>move,</v>

1138
00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:47.980
<v Speaker 1>which is like a j.</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows control and credible founder Dan </v>

1139
00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Henderson is a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took.</v>

1140
00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:53.350
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just impressed.</v>

1141
00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Fuck these first round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first round he got face planted.</v>

1142
00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:01.840
<v Speaker 1>He got bold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lasted like Henderson on the button.</v>

1143
00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1144
00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I erased it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I arranged it.</v>

1145
00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Henderson hit him on the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have erased it.</v>

1146
00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:11.940
<v Speaker 1>You get it online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can get it online.</v>

1147
00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Most will watch captured.</v>

1148
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Henderson faceplant face plants a field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so blindly die for it.</v>

1149
00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:27.580
<v Speaker 1>He got cracked and Dan Henderson hits </v>
<v Speaker 1>him again for hard upper cut to an end.</v>

1150
00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:32.940
<v Speaker 1>It goes down again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got fucked up and that first one </v>

1151
00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:36.010
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Danny came on strong in the second </v>

1152
00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:38.901
<v Speaker 1>round and the tennis shoes started fade </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit and jake shields started </v>

1153
00:59:38.901 --> 00:59:39.350
<v Speaker 1>taking them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking controlling them.</v>

1154
00:59:39.351 --> 00:59:40.820
<v Speaker 1>And they were saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1155
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:42.950
<v Speaker 1>that Henderson has been having problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his back.</v>

1156
00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:45.350
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked kind of stiff.</v>

1157
00:59:45.351 --> 00:59:47.270
<v Speaker 1>That could have been what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have been why couldn't,</v>

1158
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:49.640
<v Speaker 1>couldn't stuff that take job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pants,</v>

1159
00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:54.660
<v Speaker 1>shields a good total control mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a mountain of over and over </v>

1160
00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.420
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Henderson could not shake him,</v>

1161
00:59:57.410 --> 01:00:00.290
<v Speaker 1>couldn't finish them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and never went for one arm bar.</v>

1162
01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:03.770
<v Speaker 1>But that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sports is 100 point.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is ridiculous.</v>

1165
01:00:08.841 --> 01:00:12.020
<v Speaker 1>We're not supposed to do I for 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's time to order pizza.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They do though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is people listening to this on itunes to</v>

1169
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>at this point in time that already like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we allowed to go?</v>

1170
01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I bet no one says no one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1173
01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:42.480

<v Speaker 4>How come you haven't gotten an operation</v>

1176
01:00:54.261 --> 01:00:57.780
<v Speaker 4>that your eyeballs fixed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you guys.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Happy three 87.</v>

1178
01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come you haven't got your eyeballs?</v>

1179
01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Scared of that now and I'm not scared at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1180
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I just haven't done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you want to do with about you?</v>

1181
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Contrast is just so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't even know that I never even</v>

1182
01:01:15.331 --> 01:01:20.331
<v Speaker 1>got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they might contacts in three </v>

1183
01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:21.050
<v Speaker 1>or four days and shit I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to,</v>

1184
01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to get them fixed.</v>

1185
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Have the context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tells me that I'm making up little </v>

1186
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>things in your I now you can see better </v>
<v Speaker 1>how it is.</v>

1187
01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:37.660
<v Speaker 1>That means seeing is so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>important and you can fix it with a </v>

1188
01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.690
<v Speaker 1>little piece of plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did they figure that shit?</v>

1189
01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I didn't figure out contact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone figured that out.</v>

1190
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Jensen and to the counselor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say a documentary to think </v>

1191
01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.760
<v Speaker 1>about what all the shit that people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do right now.</v>

1192
01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.360
<v Speaker 1>It's getting so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is going to be the next </v>

1193
01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>big thing because no one saw the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet coming,</v>

1194
01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:08.660
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one ever thought it was going to </v>

1195
01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:10.311
<v Speaker 1>affect people the way it's affecting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human race right now because if they </v>

1196
01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would've never let it get out.</v>

1197
01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1198
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:17.440
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corporations would have ever wanted the </v>

1199
01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:17.440
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too tricky.</v>

1200
01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.930
<v Speaker 1>It was too hard to control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too.</v>

1201
01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:21.040
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is gonna be?</v>

1202
01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>The next thing is this isn't going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last day of the grantor.</v>

1203
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1204
01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Going to be like Hologram laptops where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to need like maybe a </v>

1205
01:02:33.841 --> 01:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>little little block and then it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>blows up or something.</v>

1206
01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:42.570
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be New Orleans just </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

1207
01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:47.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be neural implants</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the other idea that I had was not a </v>

1208
01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.221
<v Speaker 1>normal implant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that they figured out the frequency </v>

1209
01:02:52.221 --> 01:02:54.981
<v Speaker 1>of your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what if they beat your brain </v>

1210
01:02:54.981 --> 01:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>towards like a wifi signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if your brain,</v>

1211
01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:00.200
<v Speaker 1>like obviously you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>input comes into your brain in the form </v>

1212
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.431
<v Speaker 1>of hearing things and seeing things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these electrical impulses or wherever </v>

1213
01:03:04.431 --> 01:03:08.331
<v Speaker 1>the hell sight and sound is created and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you represent that stuff in your </v>

1214
01:03:08.331 --> 01:03:11.631
<v Speaker 1>head that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are like signals that are coming </v>

1215
01:03:11.631 --> 01:03:11.631
<v Speaker 1>in from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Your Eyes,</v>

1216
01:03:11.631 --> 01:03:14.670
<v Speaker 1>from your ordinance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if there's a way to get that signal</v>

1217
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:19.760
<v Speaker 1>out into the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of having to be directly </v>

1218
01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:22.410
<v Speaker 1>input into your brain with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1219
01:03:22.411 --> 01:03:23.730
<v Speaker 1>with just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1220
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:25.950
<v Speaker 1>with site signals and with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1221
01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:26.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1222
01:03:26.481 --> 01:03:27.920
<v Speaker 1>the signals that your ears giving.</v>

1223
01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:31.890
<v Speaker 1>What if there's a way to tune into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole mind like a Wifi,</v>

1224
01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:36.891
<v Speaker 1>but some sort of neural implant or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that activates a certain </v>

1225
01:03:36.891 --> 01:03:40.500
<v Speaker 1>portion of the brain and literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows your brain to tune in to everyone</v>

1226
01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:45.501
<v Speaker 1>else's brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we all like share a giant hard </v>

1227
01:03:45.501 --> 01:03:47.010
<v Speaker 1>drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that totally seems possible.</v>

1228
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:52.460
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me like they're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just have to figure out how that </v>

1229
01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:53.880
<v Speaker 1>would work and what kind of a frequency </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would operate under,</v>

1230
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000
<v Speaker 1>but if they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can introduce all sorts of things </v>

1231
01:03:59.000 --> 01:03:59.000
<v Speaker 1>in the people's brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

1232
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>they did an operation on him and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulated a part of his brain and he </v>

1233
01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.270
<v Speaker 1>started there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what they were trying to do.</v>

1234
01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.630
<v Speaker 1>It was this was an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in stimulating part of his brain,</v>

1235
01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.960
<v Speaker 1>he started remembering shit from his </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>

1236
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.720
<v Speaker 1>like in graphic detail.</v>

1237
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.530
<v Speaker 1>It was happening right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in front of them.</v>

1238
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Like they literally figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>charge and jumpstart your memories.</v>

1239
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:23.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I do shit like that,</v>

1240
01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:29.100
<v Speaker 1>but they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can introduce thoughts to people's </v>

1241
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:31.431
<v Speaker 1>minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can read vision that can revision </v>

1242
01:04:31.431 --> 01:04:33.561
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can put little things on your head </v>

1243
01:04:33.561 --> 01:04:36.830
<v Speaker 1>and you look at something and a computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>will show an image of what you're </v>

1244
01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:38.160
<v Speaker 1>looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

1245
01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good image.</v>

1246
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.930
<v Speaker 1>They haven't figured it out good yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you read letters,</v>

1247
01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:46.740
<v Speaker 1>you can see the letter and a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kathy.</v>

1248
01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not yet,</v>

1249
01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:50.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then there'll be able to figure out</v>

1250
01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.190
<v Speaker 1>like memories tariff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1251
01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Close to world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we've realized that,</v>

1252
01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:01.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memories are completely unpredictable.</v>

1253
01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:02.910
<v Speaker 1>That memories are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1254
01:05:02.911 --> 01:05:05.300
<v Speaker 1>they're so easy to scramble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1255
01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:10.310
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think about like how much of </v>

1256
01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:11.180
<v Speaker 1>human history was just written down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken on memories,</v>

1257
01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.340
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing with somebody about something.</v>

1258
01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Something happened and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what happened.</v>

1259
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:18.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1260
01:05:18.401 --> 01:05:23.401
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just remembering and I have no </v>

1261
01:05:23.401 --> 01:05:23.401
<v Speaker 4>idea if I'm the one that's wrong or they</v>
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

1262
01:05:23.401 --> 01:05:26.390
<v Speaker 4>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to say like,</v>

1263
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:27.150
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1264
01:05:27.151 --> 01:05:28.180
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're remembering it wrong,</v>

1265
01:05:28.181 --> 01:05:30.970
<v Speaker 4>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do I think I'm the one you gotta you</v>

1266
01:05:30.971 --> 01:05:31.840
<v Speaker 4>gotta be real careful</v>

1267
01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:37.040
<v Speaker 1>that I went back to my home where I grew</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in and I hadn't been there in like 10</v>

1268
01:05:37.081 --> 01:05:39.530
<v Speaker 1>years ago and I remembered everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

1269
01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget that my house look </v>

1270
01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:44.540
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking street looked different.</v>

1271
01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:48.741
<v Speaker 1>I thought this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought the staircase was on a </v>

1272
01:05:48.741 --> 01:05:48.960
<v Speaker 1>different side of the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had it all fucked up in my head.</v>

1273
01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:54.440
<v Speaker 1>That's where I went to the place that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived at when I was three and an </v>

1274
01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:54.440
<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then my dad got.</v>

1275
01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.810
<v Speaker 1>My mom was exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked with the numbers go.</v>

1276
01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Different places changed though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1277
01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:04.020
<v Speaker 1>knock down a building and changed it </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1278
01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:06.150
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That building was exactly the same.</v>

1279
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Like how old were you when you got three</v>
<v Speaker 1>year olds?</v>

1280
01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:14.930
<v Speaker 4>Maybe four images from three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's out of me.</v>

1281
01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:17.660
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the street look at the Safeway.</v>

1282
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:21.930
<v Speaker 4>Safeway used to be there at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're remembering having,</v>

1283
01:06:22.070 --> 01:06:25.180
<v Speaker 4>remember remembering the memory about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>year ago,</v>

1284
01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:30.181
<v Speaker 4>and then you remember the year that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember your memory of the</v>

1285
01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:36.790
<v Speaker 1>have those individual members for ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're thinking about one little thing </v>

1286
01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:38.730
<v Speaker 1>can throw you off and then it shifts </v>
<v Speaker 1>your idea of,</v>

1287
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what happened and this </v>

1288
01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.641
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden you see it </v>

1289
01:06:46.641 --> 01:06:48.201
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you were just committed to the way </v>

1290
01:06:48.201 --> 01:06:48.201
<v Speaker 1>you saw 10 seconds was the incorrect </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1291
01:06:48.201 --> 01:06:50.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not fucking reliable enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was thinking.</v>

1292
01:06:50.941 --> 01:06:55.941
<v Speaker 1>What does what I was thinking before </v>
<v Speaker 1>about like people like the reason why </v>

1293
01:06:55.941 --> 01:06:58.761
<v Speaker 1>turtles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turtles live to be 100 years and people </v>

1294
01:06:58.761 --> 01:07:01.111
<v Speaker 1>will live to be 100 is I don't think you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can keep our purpose going and keep us </v>

1295
01:07:02.131 --> 01:07:07.131
<v Speaker 1>living because the way society seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work best is if people don't live long </v>

1296
01:07:07.131 --> 01:07:07.890
<v Speaker 1>enough to figure out that it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>

1297
01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:09.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if they do,</v>

1298
01:07:09.391 --> 01:07:12.270
<v Speaker 1>then chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>restructuring,</v>

1299
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:16.920
<v Speaker 1>everything goes to a different way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the way that humans are going</v>

1300
01:07:16.921 --> 01:07:18.030
<v Speaker 1>right now and the way we're going.</v>

1301
01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:20.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like some sort of a global </v>
<v Speaker 1>domination thing,</v>

1302
01:07:20.731 --> 01:07:23.430
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a technological singularity</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1303
01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:25.140
<v Speaker 1>We're moving further and further and </v>
<v Speaker 1>further.</v>

1304
01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:30.310
<v Speaker 1>If we were able to step back and as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture get old enough to realize how </v>

1305
01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.600
<v Speaker 1>silly that all is and realized how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>better life would be if we all just </v>

1306
01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.320
<v Speaker 1>relaxed and shared resources and be nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>to each other and treat the world as if </v>

1307
01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.920
<v Speaker 1>it were friends and work this all out </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

1308
01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:46.070
<v Speaker 1>but nothing would ever get done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things get done because people are </v>

1309
01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:46.140
<v Speaker 1>competing when people competing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people hate the other people.</v>

1310
01:07:46.141 --> 01:07:51.141
<v Speaker 1>They're competing against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's countries or companies or </v>

1311
01:07:51.141 --> 01:07:51.830
<v Speaker 1>political parties or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when,</v>

1312
01:07:51.831 --> 01:07:53.310
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that kind of shit happens,</v>

1313
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:56.910
<v Speaker 1>that competition is why we made newer </v>
<v Speaker 1>and better things.</v>

1314
01:07:57.030 --> 01:08:02.030
<v Speaker 1>If there was no competition like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be the pressure to be the </v>

1315
01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:02.030
<v Speaker 1>best at everything.</v>

1316
01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:06.110
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't hate the other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't be this pressure to </v>

1317
01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:09.171
<v Speaker 1>dominate them and crush them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can live in a world like the Amazon </v>

1318
01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Indians can the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1319
01:08:11.061 --> 01:08:13.890
<v Speaker 1>there's some reason why those dudes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>still running around with fucking pieces</v>

1320
01:08:13.891 --> 01:08:18.891
<v Speaker 1>of animal flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Covering Dick is don't know if it's </v>

1321
01:08:18.891 --> 01:08:18.891
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1322
01:08:18.891 --> 01:08:19.580
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it is.</v>

1323
01:08:19.581 --> 01:08:21.270
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly an alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think.</v>

1324
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:26.630
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to look at human nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>as being natural and I think that if we </v>

1325
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:30.801
<v Speaker 1>look at everything else being natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look at the way you behave and the </v>

1326
01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:34.491
<v Speaker 1>way you know a monkey's behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We look at their simple lives as being </v>

1327
01:08:34.491 --> 01:08:38.571
<v Speaker 1>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we look at the course of humanity </v>

1328
01:08:38.571 --> 01:08:38.571
<v Speaker 1>is being natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're.</v>

1329
01:08:38.571 --> 01:08:40.470
<v Speaker 1>We're pretending that it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we all consciously control,</v>

1330
01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.690
<v Speaker 1>but if we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it so fucked up?</v>

1331
01:08:42.690 --> 01:08:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Still?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is there's so much political </v>

1332
01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:47.690
<v Speaker 1>corruption when we know there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>political corruption,</v>

1333
01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:50.250
<v Speaker 1>why are we still going to war?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we know?</v>

1334
01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:53.190
<v Speaker 1>We know that wars are ridiculous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that their only ways for profit.</v>

1335
01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Why do you keep continuing along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same lines?</v>

1336
01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Even though rationally we must know a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain point in time,</v>

1337
01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.590
<v Speaker 1>this is an insane way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1338
01:09:01.591 --> 01:09:03.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's because that's just the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>people live.</v>

1339
01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I believe we're moving towards with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1340
01:09:07.570 --> 01:09:11.190
<v Speaker 1>that this behavior pushes us toward </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1341
01:09:11.191 --> 01:09:15.420
<v Speaker 1>It pushes us towards creation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something global practice.</v>

1342
01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

1343
01:09:16.570 --> 01:09:20.220
<v Speaker 1>some end of wrong little worlds </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

1344
01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about us,</v>

1345
01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:23.130
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1346
01:09:23.131 --> 01:09:25.160
<v Speaker 1>whatever's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just like an end.</v>

1347
01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:30.170
<v Speaker 1>You're just producing an editor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zinc that's needs to collectively do </v>

1348
01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:34.071
<v Speaker 1>something world or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we got our labs and it goes to what </v>

1349
01:09:34.071 --> 01:09:35.220
<v Speaker 1>would our was Ari was saying about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>parent's side,</v>

1350
01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:40.490
<v Speaker 1>like think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the animal that this </v>

1351
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:42.960
<v Speaker 1>parasite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parasite lives and has no fucking </v>

1352
01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:42.960
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1353
01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.930
<v Speaker 1>they have no idea where to distance at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1354
01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:48.650
<v Speaker 1>That has no idea that cat has no idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>

1355
01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is bananas.</v>

1356
01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.760
<v Speaker 1>It's finance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all interconnected.</v>

1357
01:09:54.150 --> 01:09:54.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1358
01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Is it as possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So make those crazy cat ladies too.</v>

1359
01:09:57.870 --> 01:10:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Is it a few people aren't immune to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Paris.</v>

1360
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why there is a certain cap </v>
<v Speaker 1>parasite that is infected.</v>

1361
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
<v Speaker 1>A tremendous amount of the female </v>
<v Speaker 1>population in Brazil and a bunch of a </v>

1362
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.350
<v Speaker 1>bunch of other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is um,</v>

1363
01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:16.340
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1364
01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:19.400
<v Speaker 1>actual parasite that makes women more </v>
<v Speaker 1>docile.</v>

1365
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:20.070
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

1366
01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Probably the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a no fear.</v>

1367
01:10:24.651 --> 01:10:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I have to look that up because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that.</v>

1368
01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:27.700
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1369
01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:32.780
<v Speaker 1>it does sound like that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know why women in Brazil.</v>

1370
01:10:35.181 --> 01:10:37.260
<v Speaker 1>I have to find this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to Google this right now.</v>

1371
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:38.480

1374
01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Parasite in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cats,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got to find this fucking article,</v>

1376
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:59.460
<v Speaker 1>mood altering cat parasites make women </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly and manage the jerks.</v>

1377
01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Brazil jerks.</v>

1378
01:11:02.730 --> 01:11:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1379
01:11:03.881 --> 01:11:04.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many,</v>

<v Speaker 1>really friendly girls come from Brazil.</v>

1381
01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:10.420
<v Speaker 1>And how many super aggressive dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

1382

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look up what Google would,</v>

1383
01:11:13.411 --> 01:11:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I looked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1384
01:11:15.211 --> 01:11:15.870
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1385
01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:18.360
<v Speaker 1>you come up with a quite a few articles </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1386
01:11:18.361 --> 01:11:21.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a parasite that causes rats to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice himself to cats.</v>

1387
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:26.750
<v Speaker 1>May also change human behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making women more outgoing and warm </v>

1388
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:29.310
<v Speaker 1>hearted and men more jealous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicious.</v>

1389
01:11:29.670 --> 01:11:34.670
<v Speaker 1>The toxo plasma protest is a shed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shed and cat feces which are then </v>

1390
01:11:36.211 --> 01:11:41.211
<v Speaker 1>eaten by rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infected rasp become fearless and the </v>

1391
01:11:41.211 --> 01:11:42.300
<v Speaker 1>presence of cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes them easier to catch,</v>

1392
01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:45.060
<v Speaker 1>which in turn spreads the disease to new</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats.</v>

1393
01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes women nicer and it makes them </v>

1394
01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Douche bags.</v>

1395
01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:53.290
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature is totally rooting against us.</v>

1396
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Finding new ways to keep a fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that,</v>

1397
01:11:58.531 --> 01:11:59.850
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that?</v>

1398
01:11:59.851 --> 01:12:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Because men who are more douchey are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely to fuck a bunch of different</v>

1399
01:12:04.681 --> 01:12:08.880
<v Speaker 1>women and and impregnate them like fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're friends women and you know,</v>

1400
01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:10.920
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the more Douchey guy guidance,</v>

1401
01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:12.750
<v Speaker 1>the more he's got to do like creepy </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1402
01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Go get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the more likely that's gonna make </v>

1403
01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:17.780
<v Speaker 1>like excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some babies all over the place,</v>

1404
01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:22.230
<v Speaker 1>it's going to keep spreading the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a nature likes Douche bags.</v>

1405
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Well it's like it goes back to what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1406
01:12:25.531 --> 01:12:30.531
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like you don't really </v>

1407
01:12:30.531 --> 01:12:32.250
<v Speaker 1>achieve unless there's competition and </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition doesn't really mean anything</v>

1408
01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.080
<v Speaker 1>unless it's competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1409
01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.460
<v Speaker 1>like primal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1410
01:12:35.461 --> 01:12:40.461
<v Speaker 1>a man who hate to you hate him and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>hates you and it really forces you to </v>

1411
01:12:40.461 --> 01:12:40.461
<v Speaker 1>work hard.</v>

1412
01:12:40.461 --> 01:12:45.320
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why companies fucking hate each </v>

1413
01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.571
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Companies that compete against each </v>

1414
01:12:47.571 --> 01:12:47.670
<v Speaker 1>other or rarely friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fucking hate each other.</v>

1415
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the most efficient way to </v>

1416
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.790
<v Speaker 1>get things done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to light a fire under someone's</v>

1417
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:54.720
<v Speaker 1>ass in order to get the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity out of them.</v>

1418
01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Hey equals productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like your life would certainly be </v>

1419
01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:00.860
<v Speaker 1>better off if you didn't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1420
01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:01.830
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1421
01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:06.890
<v Speaker 1>that aspect too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you wouldn't be a successful aspect </v>

1422
01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:06.890
<v Speaker 1>to you though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1423
01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:10.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a fucked up shit like war,</v>

1424
01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:11.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it's supposed to happen.</v>

1425
01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:16.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrible conclusion to terrible</v>

1426
01:13:16.771 --> 01:13:20.160
<v Speaker 1>conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it might be that everything we do is</v>

1427
01:13:20.161 --> 01:13:24.240
<v Speaker 1>the way we're supposed to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a jealous for war.</v>

1428
01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do it,</v>

1429
01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.710
<v Speaker 1>but someone's gonna do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1430
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:33.570
<v Speaker 1>it's just the way they've been doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>business forever.</v>

1431
01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:38.570
<v Speaker 1>It's going to take way too long for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to settle down all these people that </v>

1432
01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.660
<v Speaker 1>promise that they're not going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>war anymore.</v>

1433
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:43.830
<v Speaker 1>But I've looked at Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he promised that he was going to stop </v>

1434
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:46.371
<v Speaker 1>all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to pull people out and just </v>

1435
01:13:46.371 --> 01:13:49.770
<v Speaker 1>more in the never George Bush playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>golf,</v>

1436
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:53.910

<v Speaker 1>Obama's or play more golf.</v>

1437
01:13:53.911 --> 01:13:56.850
<v Speaker 1>And George Bush has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the first term,</v>

1438
01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.810
<v Speaker 1>first year he played 33 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1439
01:13:59.811 --> 01:14:02.610
<v Speaker 1>George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of flack for 20th times.</v>

1440
01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Obama's a very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good speaker.</v>

1441
01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:11.070
<v Speaker 1>That's really all I all I have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>

1442
01:14:11.770 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm not</v>

1443
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:17.070
<v Speaker 4>seeing anything different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She stopped doing the things he said he </v>

1444
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:17.070
<v Speaker 4>would do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1445
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:21.781
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about the stimulus package.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's going really happen </v>

1446
01:14:21.781 --> 01:14:24.811
<v Speaker 4>with that or whether that's because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's too fucking complicated and no </v>

1447

<v Speaker 1>where do I put my attention?</v>

1451
01:14:39.681 --> 01:14:42.230
<v Speaker 1>How much time do I have in a day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I want to think about?</v>

1452

<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and already had a high guard.</v>

1600
01:22:32.491 --> 01:22:37.491
<v Speaker 4>Like he was like basically saying that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nino had my style of guard first when me</v>

1601
01:22:38.731 --> 01:22:41.280
<v Speaker 4>and Nina filed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guards are totally different.</v>

1602
01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.960
<v Speaker 4>They're nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing there.</v>

1603
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:47.880
<v Speaker 4>You're very difficult to often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we both play,</v>

1604
01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:52.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do own a blocks and stuff and I got </v>

1605
01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.741
<v Speaker 4>the job a blocker for him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the actual style of our guards are </v>

1606
01:22:54.741 --> 01:22:54.741
<v Speaker 4>very different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1607
01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:57.030
<v Speaker 4>obviously he doesn't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1608
01:22:57.150 --> 01:23:02.150
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hasn't really paid attention but </v>

1609
01:23:02.150 --> 01:23:02.150
<v Speaker 4>enough to know the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big fucking difference.</v>

1610
01:23:02.150 --> 01:23:04.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it says other stuff like,</v>

1611
01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:05.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1612
01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:09.410
<v Speaker 5>it's just a bunch of backhanded </v>
<v Speaker 5>compliments.</v>

1613
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:12.070
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I thought it was hilarious.</v>

1614
01:23:12.150 --> 01:23:12.910
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1615
01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:15.070
<v Speaker 1>so she knew about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1616
01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:16.730
<v Speaker 1>So the sheep knew about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1617
01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:17.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1618
01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:20.550
<v Speaker 1>He said a lot of good things about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks man.</v>

1619
01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Shit about me.</v>

1620
01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:26.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he likes me.</v>

1621
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:29.470
<v Speaker 5>I really can't say anything bad about </v>
<v Speaker 5>the recording.</v>

1622
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:31.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even fucking know.</v>

1623
01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1624
01:23:32.221 --> 01:23:32.940
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1625
01:23:32.941 --> 01:23:37.941
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that don't know </v>

1626
01:23:37.941 --> 01:23:39.981
<v Speaker 1>you and you have a polarizing effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're so controversial because,</v>

1627
01:23:40.190 --> 01:23:42.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the way you look,</v>

1628
01:23:42.541 --> 01:23:43.950
<v Speaker 1>the way you act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1629
01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:47.350
<v Speaker 1>your behavior is very controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1630
01:23:47.351 --> 01:23:49.440
<v Speaker 1>what you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most Jujitsu people,</v>

1631
01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:54.441
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu instructors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not like wild musician </v>

1632
01:23:54.441 --> 01:23:57.810
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that or come up with Jujitsu </v>

1633
01:23:57.810 --> 01:23:58.770
<v Speaker 1>moves because they're high on weed like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1634
01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:03.830
<v Speaker 1>That fucks up with their whole dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their whole view of what you know Jitsu </v>

1635
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:04.730
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if they,</v>

1636
01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:09.800
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of dudes don't know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where the controversy </v>

1637
01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:10.320
<v Speaker 1>comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they got to know.</v>

1638
01:24:10.321 --> 01:24:15.321
<v Speaker 1>You then realize that you're just sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of completely openminded dude who's </v>

1639
01:24:15.321 --> 01:24:17.190
<v Speaker 1>willing to accept techniques from </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere and gives people credit all the</v>

1640
01:24:17.191 --> 01:24:21.960
<v Speaker 1>time and you invent moves or you teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>moves based on people's names,</v>

1641
01:24:21.961 --> 01:24:26.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the doodle or did you know </v>

1642
01:24:26.961 --> 01:24:27.840
<v Speaker 1>different types of needs that you've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jacques sweep that you got from each</v>

1643
01:24:27.841 --> 01:24:28.300
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

1644
01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.390
<v Speaker 1>You give them all credit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't.</v>

1645
01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:31.560
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1646
01:24:31.561 --> 01:24:34.050
<v Speaker 1>they see you getting all this credit for</v>
<v Speaker 1>this revolution,</v>

1647
01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:37.020
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary type of guard and so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just assumed that it's all bullshit.</v>

1648
01:24:37.021 --> 01:24:39.380
<v Speaker 1>It's all over hyped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really it's not.</v>

1649
01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:42.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not on time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you got some weird wild shit.</v>

1650
01:24:42.361 --> 01:24:44.790
<v Speaker 1>You put it together in like a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

1651
01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:45.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's.</v>

1652
01:24:45.781 --> 01:24:50.781
<v Speaker 1>And it's very legit and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>unusual and you're willing to talk to </v>

1653
01:24:50.781 --> 01:24:52.800
<v Speaker 1>anybody and have them fuck with it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with their own stuff.</v>

1654
01:24:52.801 --> 01:24:57.801
<v Speaker 1>When you look at all the different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you've added from your </v>

1655
01:24:57.801 --> 01:24:57.930
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all the moves for Edwin stuff.</v>

1656
01:24:58.050 --> 01:25:03.050
<v Speaker 1>You know all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how you started incorporating </v>

1657
01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:03.050
<v Speaker 1>that in a class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1658
01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:03.850
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese in that time,</v>

1659
01:25:03.851 --> 01:25:05.160
<v Speaker 1>so you're always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1660
01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:10.400
<v Speaker 1>adding whenever there's a new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always adding it and always </v>

1661
01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:10.760
<v Speaker 1>giving the person credit created who </v>
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>

1662
01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:14.300
<v Speaker 5>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's probably the one thing that,</v>

1663
01:25:14.690 --> 01:25:19.690
<v Speaker 5>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the biggest misconception is that you </v>

1664
01:25:19.690 --> 01:25:20.740
<v Speaker 5>take credit for things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1665
01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:25.970
<v Speaker 5>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I take moves and I changed the names and</v>

1666
01:25:26.151 --> 01:25:29.800
<v Speaker 5>then I pretend like I made them up and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>put a whole new name.</v>

1667
01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:35.020
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of people out there </v>
<v Speaker 5>that think back and that's kind of true </v>

1668
01:25:35.271 --> 01:25:38.540
<v Speaker 5>or not really sort of 50.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's totally the opposite.</v>

1669
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:40.860
<v Speaker 5>It's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I everybody fucking up.</v>

1670
01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the twister,</v>

1671
01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:44.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first started doing the twister</v>

1672
01:25:44.001 --> 01:25:45.040
<v Speaker 1>and inside wrestling with.</v>

1673
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:46.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a big.</v>

1674
01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:48.670
<v Speaker 5>That was the big thing because I never </v>
<v Speaker 5>called it the twister I got.</v>

1675
01:25:48.671 --> 01:25:53.260
<v Speaker 5>It was the of is guilty to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the guillotines and John Job,</v>

1676
01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:58.380
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the good team was already taken and </v>

1677
01:25:58.380 --> 01:25:58.380
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu and submission,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grappling,</v>

1678
01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:00.630
<v Speaker 5>all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when I would call the good see now in</v>

1679
01:26:00.631 --> 01:26:03.020
<v Speaker 5>Brazil and just called it the twister </v>
<v Speaker 5>and stuck after a.</v>

1680
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:04.200
<v Speaker 5>So a lot of people</v>

1681
01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:09.200
<v Speaker 4>think like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Russell's Goldman did that in high </v>

1682
01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:09.200
<v Speaker 4>school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1683
01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:09.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1684
01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.030
<v Speaker 4>you got to know the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So real quick,</v>

1685
01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:14.420
<v Speaker 4>it's easy to convince those guys if they</v>
<v Speaker 4>ask about me like,</v>

1686
01:26:14.421 --> 01:26:16.180
<v Speaker 4>what's up with this twitter thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1687
01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:17.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a guillotine.</v>

1688
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:19.250
<v Speaker 4>And wrestling they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1689
01:26:19.251 --> 01:26:24.251
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a bunch of groups like that </v>

1690
01:26:24.251 --> 01:26:25.661
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just changes names and then real </v>

1691
01:26:25.661 --> 01:26:27.551
<v Speaker 4>quick now I got to dig myself out of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>deep hole with a lot of people like </v>

1692
01:26:27.551 --> 01:26:32.141
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like a total opposite </v>

1693
01:26:32.141 --> 01:26:32.141
<v Speaker 4>misconception that I like take moons and</v>
<v Speaker 4>steal them.</v>

1694
01:26:32.141 --> 01:26:32.290
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

1695
01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:37.300
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did it for awhile and then I had to </v>

1696
01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:37.700
<v Speaker 4>stop and slow down and change my ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And from day one,</v>

1697
01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:42.940
<v Speaker 4>my first book I give everyone credit my </v>
<v Speaker 4>Silverado do all that shit.</v>

1698
01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.600
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get pissed off when people learn </v>

1699
01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.510
<v Speaker 4>techniques from someone else and I know </v>
<v Speaker 4>them personally.</v>

1700
01:26:50.511 --> 01:26:55.511
<v Speaker 4>I know where they got the move from and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then they start showing it to someone </v>

1701
01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:55.511
<v Speaker 4>and that'll bring up the person that </v>
<v Speaker 4>taught them.</v>

1702
01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:00.520
<v Speaker 4>That offends me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't always remember to bring up </v>

1703
01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:01.340
<v Speaker 4>names,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I tried to as much as I can.</v>

1704
01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu moves as like a creative thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're adding to like one big </v>

1705
01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:09.120
<v Speaker 1>gigantic piece of artwork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the martial art itself,</v>

1706
01:27:09.121 --> 01:27:11.010
<v Speaker 1>like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you invented a new technique,</v>

1707
01:27:11.011 --> 01:27:16.011
<v Speaker 1>like you invent some new sweep or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>new way to set up a Google plateau and </v>

1708
01:27:16.011 --> 01:27:18.530
<v Speaker 1>then you add it to the Jujitsu language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like that's what it is?</v>

1709
01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:20.970
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you feel like it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of art,</v>

1710
01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:26.090
<v Speaker 1>so it was something that you create and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't give you credit for </v>

1711
01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:26.370
<v Speaker 1>creating that and then people were out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there doing it.</v>

1712
01:27:26.371 --> 01:27:31.371
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're stealing your art </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost because they're going to do it </v>

1713
01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:32.520
<v Speaker 1>regardless what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the thing.</v>

1714
01:27:32.521 --> 01:27:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who was doing his shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he supports and he even had a cop,</v>

1719
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:48.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone learns some ship directly </v>

1720
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.790
<v Speaker 4>from me or my books or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1721
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:51.290
<v Speaker 4>the right thing to do is get credit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1722
01:27:51.291 --> 01:27:55.590
<v Speaker 4>that's the right thing to do and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>giving credit is you did it,</v>

1723
01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:00.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoever you learn a technique from the </v>

1724
01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:00.600
<v Speaker 4>crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to,</v>

1725
01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:04.280
<v Speaker 4>if you don't go into a strap on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't take away from what you did </v>

1726
01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:04.280
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1727
01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.770
<v Speaker 4>people think that somehow or another you</v>
<v Speaker 4>teach them a guy,</v>

1728
01:28:06.771 --> 01:28:08.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain way to set up a rear naked and</v>

1729
01:28:08.871 --> 01:28:10.970
<v Speaker 4>then he does it and then you give them </v>
<v Speaker 4>credit.</v>

1730
01:28:10.971 --> 01:28:12.110
<v Speaker 4>It takes away from him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1731
01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.370
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't take away from that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not at all.</v>

1732
01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:17.800
<v Speaker 4>It's just the friendly thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he sounded like daytime,</v>

1733
01:28:17.930 --> 01:28:22.300
<v Speaker 4>like I pull off a submission,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a that someone else in class showed me.</v>

1734
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:24.590
<v Speaker 4>I'll always go from go it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got it twice a day,</v>

1735
01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:28.820
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do the same thing or the same thing.</v>

1736
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:30.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's important man.</v>

1737
01:28:30.850 --> 01:28:32.150

<v Speaker 4>it's important and it's,</v>

1738
01:28:32.330 --> 01:28:32.540
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1739
01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:34.950
<v Speaker 4>fosters that friendly attitude to come </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

1740
01:28:35.210 --> 01:28:38.780
<v Speaker 4>All I'm trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I guess it feels good.</v>

1741
01:28:38.781 --> 01:28:42.350
<v Speaker 4>It's like a piece of art and something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always feel good when a new transition</v>

1742
01:28:42.351 --> 01:28:47.351
<v Speaker 4>comes up out of nowhere or someone else </v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of my students to me or we see </v>

1743
01:28:47.351 --> 01:28:47.990
<v Speaker 4>it on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get excited.</v>

1744
01:28:47.991 --> 01:28:48.810
<v Speaker 4>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like another.</v>

1745
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:49.730
<v Speaker 4>Those beans I'll do</v>

1746
01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:51.500
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have no idea how complex it is.</v>

1747
01:28:51.501 --> 01:28:56.501
<v Speaker 1>They really have no idea how many levels</v>
<v Speaker 1>and layers there say like I was talking </v>

1748
01:28:56.501 --> 01:28:57.790
<v Speaker 1>to Nathan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about,</v>

1749
01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:00.740
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he trained with Marcello and I went down</v>

1750
01:29:00.741 --> 01:29:05.741
<v Speaker 1>to New York of training them a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>times and it was just talking about how </v>

1751
01:29:05.741 --> 01:29:08.421
<v Speaker 1>good marcella moves and how it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing to see someone operate on that </v>

1752
01:29:08.421 --> 01:29:08.760
<v Speaker 1>level and we just started thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1753
01:29:08.761 --> 01:29:13.761
<v Speaker 1>like how humbling that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're around a guy like </v>

1754
01:29:13.761 --> 01:29:13.761
<v Speaker 1>Marcello or operator or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1755
01:29:13.761 --> 01:29:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait Online,</v>

1756
01:29:14.641 --> 01:29:19.641
<v Speaker 1>rolling through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just rolling through one after </v>

1757
01:29:19.641 --> 01:29:19.641
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just submitting a left,</v>

1758
01:29:19.641 --> 01:29:19.641
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

1759
01:29:19.641 --> 01:29:19.641
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

1760
01:29:19.641 --> 01:29:20.200
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

1761
01:29:20.201 --> 01:29:22.110
<v Speaker 1>when you see someone who's at that high </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

1762
01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:23.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1763
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:27.420
<v Speaker 1>it's so humbling because you realize how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many gundam layers there are to this.</v>

1764
01:29:28.210 --> 01:29:31.950
<v Speaker 1>It never ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a more complex and more,</v>

1765
01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:33.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy shoots a pet,</v>

1766
01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:38.400
<v Speaker 1>gets faster and they're diving on shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>with more precision and their technique </v>

1767
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.690
<v Speaker 1>is more crisp and more sharp and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>options and</v>

1768
01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:46.710
<v Speaker 5>there's 12 different ways that I can </v>
<v Speaker 5>count and they're maybe more 12 to toys </v>

1769
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:49.390
<v Speaker 5>to play off your back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then that's what I can count.</v>

1770
01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:54.660
<v Speaker 5>Well distinctly different styles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a difference you can tell </v>

1771
01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:55.940
<v Speaker 5>to the train die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So look at Tom.</v>

1772
01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.530
<v Speaker 5>He's playing deep path.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's ex card,</v>

1773
01:29:58.690 --> 01:30:01.700
<v Speaker 5>he's playing a lockdown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hap,</v>

1774
01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:06.870
<v Speaker 5>he's playing 50 slash 50 guard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's planning a butterfly gardens and </v>

1775
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:10.240
<v Speaker 5>Robert Gard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's 12 of them that I could count.</v>

1776
01:30:10.241 --> 01:30:13.480
<v Speaker 5>There might be more of a Deli,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Heba Guard,</v>

1777
01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.190
<v Speaker 5>spiral card,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that shit.</v>

1778
01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:20.520
<v Speaker 5>There's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so complex.</v>

1779
01:30:20.770 --> 01:30:22.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing Jujitsu for 16 years.</v>

1780
01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:27.220
<v Speaker 5>I suck at most of those gardens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm not that good at.</v>

1781
01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.980
<v Speaker 5>I might have been della Heba Guard </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't exist there,</v>

1782
01:30:30.010 --> 01:30:32.470
<v Speaker 5>so that's a whole different stock spiral</v>
<v Speaker 5>guard,</v>

1783
01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.900
<v Speaker 5>inverted guard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never do any of that stuff.</v>

1784
01:30:35.170 --> 01:30:37.180
<v Speaker 5>I never played 50 slash 50 guard.</v>

1785
01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:42.360
<v Speaker 5>I never did any of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I have like four or five guards </v>

1786
01:30:42.671 --> 01:30:45.100
<v Speaker 5>and there's like 12.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of them that I don't do.</v>

1787
01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:50.280
<v Speaker 5>There's so much like all these world </v>
<v Speaker 5>champions like Rafael Mendez and marina </v>

1788
01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.470
<v Speaker 5>and all these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is totally different than mine.</v>

1789
01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:57.540
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if we've taught for our seminars </v>

1790
01:30:57.540 --> 01:30:57.540
<v Speaker 5>eats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean two different worlds,</v>

1791
01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:01.820
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so much to learn which path </v>

1792
01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:01.820
<v Speaker 5>you're going to take.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1793
01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:06.810
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing like again 16 years and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm still putting new weapons into the </v>

1794
01:31:07.211 --> 01:31:07.750
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

1795
01:31:07.751 --> 01:31:11.470
<v Speaker 5>I make sure that there's always new </v>
<v Speaker 5>projects that are always,</v>

1796
01:31:11.530 --> 01:31:16.530
<v Speaker 5>always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>always got to be a new projects and </v>

1797
01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:17.310
<v Speaker 5>those projects could take one to three </v>
<v Speaker 5>years to get where you need them to be.</v>

1798
01:31:17.970 --> 01:31:21.070
<v Speaker 5>The Doris is still my project from like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1799
01:31:21.130 --> 01:31:22.690
<v Speaker 5>five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1800
01:31:22.691 --> 01:31:24.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm not as good as the top guys with.</v>

1801
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:26.980
<v Speaker 5>Does a pretty good and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not as good as,</v>

1802
01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:28.750
<v Speaker 5>I still got some more levels to pop </v>
<v Speaker 5>through,</v>

1803
01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:34.110
<v Speaker 5>but you know the over the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>year and a half via teens and north </v>

1804
01:31:34.110 --> 01:31:36.880
<v Speaker 5>south suck with those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they've been on my project.</v>

1805
01:31:36.881 --> 01:31:41.881
<v Speaker 5>That's when I go against the scrubs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I go against the white belts and </v>

1806
01:31:41.881 --> 01:31:41.881
<v Speaker 5>new guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1807
01:31:41.881 --> 01:31:42.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to do anything that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

1808
01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:46.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to only get shit that I suck </v>
<v Speaker 5>at and try to train my body.</v>

1809
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:49.690
<v Speaker 5>I would get into north south and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this feels awkward.</v>

1810
01:31:49.691 --> 01:31:51.770
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how Danny does it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1811
01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:56.780
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I would get in there and try to get </v>

1812
01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:56.780
<v Speaker 5>as far as I can and I'd lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd go do something else.</v>

1813
01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:58.220
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll come back to it and try it again.</v>

1814
01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:00.670
<v Speaker 5>We're not stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not really pleasing.</v>

1815
01:32:00.670 --> 01:32:05.670
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trying to move my lucky focus on it and </v>

1816
01:32:05.670 --> 01:32:07.140
<v Speaker 5>after awhile then you get into like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1817
01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:08.620
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is feeling good.</v>

1818
01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:09.210
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1819
01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:12.820
<v Speaker 5>eventually it'll come and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>remember that people forget that because</v>

1820
01:32:12.821 --> 01:32:14.530
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people when they try something </v>
<v Speaker 5>new they go,</v>

1821
01:32:14.531 --> 01:32:15.670
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it feels kind of awkward.</v>

1822
01:32:15.671 --> 01:32:16.180
<v Speaker 5>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna.</v>

1823
01:32:16.181 --> 01:32:17.440
<v Speaker 5>Go back to my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1824
01:32:17.441 --> 01:32:19.410
<v Speaker 5>He's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got some strange too big.</v>

1825
01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:23.110
<v Speaker 5>You got to remember that all moves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Feel awkward in the beginning and if you</v>

1826
01:32:23.111 --> 01:32:24.550
<v Speaker 5>want this movement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't matter.</v>

1827
01:32:24.670 --> 01:32:27.670
<v Speaker 5>You can master listening if you want it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can be a carrier with this.</v>

1828
01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:30.070
<v Speaker 5>It's up to you how many reps who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>willing to put in,</v>

1829
01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:31.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and in Jujitsu,</v>

1830
01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:38.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the only sport where you can spar 100 </v>

1831
01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:38.700
<v Speaker 5>percent every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone just sparse there.</v>

1832
01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:42.640
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe they'd put in as few reps as </v>
<v Speaker 5>possible.</v>

1833
01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:45.220
<v Speaker 5>Most people have that mentality back </v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you force them.</v>

1834
01:32:45.221 --> 01:32:50.221
<v Speaker 5>And that's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I force my guys because I know they're </v>

1835
01:32:50.221 --> 01:32:50.221
<v Speaker 5>going to get lazy and a guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1836
01:32:50.221 --> 01:32:52.540
<v Speaker 5>everyone do 15 those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 of that and make sure to do that.</v>

1837
01:32:52.541 --> 01:32:56.410
<v Speaker 5>And like I write it on a board and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>just kicked back and you know,</v>

1838
01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.270
<v Speaker 5>chill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not going to do it.</v>

1839
01:32:59.110 --> 01:33:02.440
<v Speaker 5>You gotta have people need people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they hire trainers.</v>

1840
01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:04.900
<v Speaker 5>They can do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know all the exercises.</v>

1841
01:33:04.901 --> 01:33:09.901
<v Speaker 5>They know they can be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just need some of the foursome and </v>

1842
01:33:09.901 --> 01:33:09.901
<v Speaker 5>got someone to force you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>paying them.</v>

1843
01:33:09.901 --> 01:33:11.060
<v Speaker 5>Then it's easier to go to that shit.</v>

1844
01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Never do to actually get to try it.</v>

1845
01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:17.780
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just look at everything.</v>

1846
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:20.150
<v Speaker 5>Most things because like longterm </v>
<v Speaker 5>projects,</v>

1847
01:33:20.151 --> 01:33:25.151
<v Speaker 5>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many cycles have you gone through </v>

1848
01:33:25.151 --> 01:33:26.240
<v Speaker 5>with this technique and eventually by </v>
<v Speaker 5>third or fourth cycle,</v>

1849
01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:31.330
<v Speaker 5>once you hit it bad left,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now he's doing really well and look at </v>

1850
01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:31.330
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1851
01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to motivate yourself to push </v>

1852
01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:34.960
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is definitely important.</v>

1853
01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:35.330
<v Speaker 1>And pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rolling.</v>

1854
01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much more fun.</v>

1855
01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:37.690
<v Speaker 5>Drills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1856
01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:42.720
<v Speaker 5>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine getting on a video game </v>

1857
01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:45.071
<v Speaker 5>and do you ever get on the practice?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just practice the little movements over </v>

1858
01:33:46.221 --> 01:33:47.420
<v Speaker 5>and over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 50 times.</v>

1859
01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:48.410
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay this.</v>

1860
01:33:48.650 --> 01:33:51.980
<v Speaker 5>Do people do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a room where they can just practice</v>

1861
01:33:51.981 --> 01:33:56.981
<v Speaker 5>movements and now they're getting really</v>
<v Speaker 5>good with all the moves and they do all </v>

1862
01:33:56.981 --> 01:33:56.981
<v Speaker 5>the techniques</v>

1863
01:33:56.981 --> 01:34:00.970
<v Speaker 1>that it's like a workout they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wake up is based on map.</v>

1864
01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:06.260
<v Speaker 1>It's based on map systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of different maps to </v>

1865
01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:09.241
<v Speaker 1>play on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the most important things </v>

1866
01:34:09.241 --> 01:34:09.450
<v Speaker 1>about playing quick when you're in a one</v>
<v Speaker 1>on one tool is to understand the map.</v>

1867
01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:11.450
<v Speaker 1>You're got to know where the guns are </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there hitting.</v>

1868
01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:13.890
<v Speaker 1>You got to know where you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>control the map.</v>

1869
01:34:14.010 --> 01:34:16.710
<v Speaker 1>So what you've gotta do is you've gotta </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure you're not every fucking,</v>

1870
01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:19.470
<v Speaker 1>every minute area and you can move </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1871
01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:23.250
<v Speaker 1>So they practice their practice like </v>
<v Speaker 1>special jumps and rocket jobs.</v>

1872
01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Practice jumping into certain areas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so they don't get to have a really far </v>

1873
01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:33.321
<v Speaker 1>and then crumble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'll practice that shape their </v>

1874
01:34:33.321 --> 01:34:35.780
<v Speaker 1>practices so they have complete command </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the map so they can move around the </v>

1875
01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:37.260
<v Speaker 1>map anywhere they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they practice timing.</v>

1876
01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:38.340
<v Speaker 1>When the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1877
01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:43.380
<v Speaker 1>the new version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you were playing the best person</v>

1878
01:34:44.401 --> 01:34:46.600
<v Speaker 1>though is quite free to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite force,</v>

1879
01:34:46.630 --> 01:34:49.100
<v Speaker 1>pretty bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the latest I think,</v>

1880
01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:51.940
<v Speaker 1>quick for us to last because it takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>years to make,</v>

1881
01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:53.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone they didn't know.</v>

1882
01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:56.910
<v Speaker 1>They came up with a new tool every year </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they get better and better.</v>

1883
01:34:56.911 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything about video games</v>

1884
01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:03.110
<v Speaker 2>does this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the graphics and the amount of area</v>

1885
01:35:03.111 --> 01:35:07.210
<v Speaker 2>you can travel to always bigger getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger and bigger.</v>

1886
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Massive with orange juice or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1887
01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Role player games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive world.</v>

1888
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:20.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like an artificial world again </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can just travel for miles and </v>

1889
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:24.690
<v Speaker 1>meet new people and show people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live their whole lives inside those </v>

1890
01:35:24.690 --> 01:35:24.690
<v Speaker 1>things</v>

1891
01:35:24.690 --> 01:35:27.930
<v Speaker 2>and they're actually real people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the real people.</v>

1892
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:33.430
<v Speaker 2>Real people playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people have lost their mind when it </v>

1893
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.840
<v Speaker 2>comes to these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never even heard of that.</v>

1894
01:35:33.870 --> 01:35:38.870
<v Speaker 2>People Starve people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two people in Korea but their </v>

1895
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.870
<v Speaker 2>baby starve</v>

1896
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:43.650
<v Speaker 1>while they are nourishing their online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they have fake baby online and </v>

1897
01:35:43.650 --> 01:35:45.760
<v Speaker 1>they were taking care of that baby while</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're real baby starve to death.</v>

1898
01:35:45.790 --> 01:35:49.210
<v Speaker 1>And Dean Boston marbles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1899
01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:52.360
<v Speaker 1>People are living in artificial worlds </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

1900

<v Speaker 1>So efficient one.</v>

1909

<v Speaker 1>How many people on second life maybe was</v>
<v Speaker 1>called second life for a second.</v>

01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:37.070
<v Speaker 2>their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've talk to a camera.</v>

<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>

1919
01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:48.510
<v Speaker 1>If they're all with us or with us.</v>

1920
01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I passed out on park today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1921
01:36:52.090 --> 01:36:55.900
<v Speaker 2>I've been close like two or three times </v>
<v Speaker 2>a month or two in a real life is like,</v>

1922
01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:01.020
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I imagine that jumps in the </v>

1923
01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:01.020
<v Speaker 2>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think on the floor.</v>

1924
01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:01.820
<v Speaker 2>The top of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much weed?</v>

1925
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.910
<v Speaker 2>Not that much,</v>

1926
01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:08.700
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that much and it happened to his </v>

1927
01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:09.850
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend I had once and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>she had like one kid.</v>

1928
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:15.000
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't anything major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just what I saw someone do that we gave </v>

1929
01:37:15.531 --> 01:37:20.531
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That chick was working on fear factor </v>

1930
01:37:20.531 --> 01:37:20.531
<v Speaker 1>and that was one of the production </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1931
01:37:20.531 --> 01:37:21.880
<v Speaker 1>We're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all in New York or outside of.</v>

1932
01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:25.660
<v Speaker 1>We all went out there filming there for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weekend instead of Bar,</v>

1933
01:37:25.661 --> 01:37:27.200
<v Speaker 1>have a drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get as much smoke,</v>

1934
01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:32.680
<v Speaker 1>someone to never smoked to joining the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ship.</v>

1935
01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:37.720
<v Speaker 1>One big hips train wreck and her eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolled back in her head and she was </v>

1936
01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:38.820
<v Speaker 1>dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought she was faking,</v>

1937
01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:42.500
<v Speaker 2>pretending like I was part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm so I'm going to pass out.</v>

1938
01:37:42.501 --> 01:37:43.610
<v Speaker 2>I thought she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's being silly,</v>

1939
01:37:43.611 --> 01:37:46.250
<v Speaker 2>like we got to catch her up as she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>falling down to the ground.</v>

1940
01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:50.510
<v Speaker 2>The girlfriend was like that and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1941
01:37:50.511 --> 01:37:55.511

01:37:55.511 --> 01:37:55.511
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1943
01:37:55.511 --> 01:37:55.511
<v Speaker 1>Did you catch him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1947
01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:08.010
<v Speaker 2>and probably wasn't gonna be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>catch her anyway.</v>

1948
01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:13.380
<v Speaker 2>What you need to get a chance.</v>

<v Speaker 2>to other scriptures already,</v>

2102
01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.160

<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

2103
01:48:05.161 --> 01:48:10.161
<v Speaker 2>So when you're in class got thrown out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you do like nothing or school but </v>

<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

2106
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:19.030

<v Speaker 2>But that was the charges with the </v>

2107
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.030
<v Speaker 2>charges were,</v>

2108

<v Speaker 1>is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lewdness minor or some shit like that.</v>

2109
01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:26.460
<v Speaker 2>She's machines for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably wasn't the first time raising </v>

2110
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:30.140
<v Speaker 2>feed stocks deck on the little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't stop.</v>

2111
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she did it to this kitchen,</v>

2112
01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:39.120
<v Speaker 1>probably done the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like she's been fucking grown </v>

2113
01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:40.280
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that they're just take time.</v>

2114
01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:43.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2115
01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:44.830
<v Speaker 1>like all of a sudden out of nowhere she </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

2116
01:48:44.831 --> 01:48:46.450
<v Speaker 1>let me just dive in this 14 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2117
01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:51.480
<v Speaker 1>She's done it before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's just not particular about who </v>

2118
01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:51.480
<v Speaker 1>she blows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2119
01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:51.610
<v Speaker 1>that's all that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just a crazy bitch,</v>

2120
01:48:52.570 --> 01:48:55.060
<v Speaker 1>but she didn't have to go to jail for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of her fucking life.</v>

2121
01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:58.760
<v Speaker 1>That's not know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to put kids in Jennifer's</v>

2122
01:48:58.761 --> 01:49:03.761
<v Speaker 1>sexting and trying to make it illegal </v>
<v Speaker 1>for girls to share their same child </v>

2123
01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:11.320
<v Speaker 1>pornographer not notes of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2124
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Do what are they doing it to each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>and childhood setting through their </v>

2125
01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:16.750
<v Speaker 2>boyfriends.</v>

2126
01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:19.210
<v Speaker 1>One of your questions store a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend it.</v>

2127
01:49:19.211 --> 01:49:22.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like nine girls got </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspended from school because they had a</v>

2128
01:49:22.841 --> 01:49:27.841
<v Speaker 1>bunch of pictures that they took and put</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their myspace page in between school </v>

2129
01:49:28.001 --> 01:49:30.340
<v Speaker 1>when they're not at school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like during the summer break.</v>

2130
01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:35.550
<v Speaker 1>So when it came back to school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was suspended because of sexy </v>

2131
01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:38.911
<v Speaker 1>pictures of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose they're like sucking fingers </v>

2132
01:49:38.911 --> 01:49:39.610
<v Speaker 1>sticking out and underwear and stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were like 14.</v>

2133
01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:44.080
<v Speaker 1>They're just doing a normal horse shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they got suspended.</v>

2134
01:49:44.081 --> 01:49:47.890
<v Speaker 1>So the girls are suing the school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to win.</v>

2135
01:49:48.370 --> 01:49:53.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it can go on my space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell someone they can't do </v>

2136
01:49:53.370 --> 01:49:54.460
<v Speaker 1>something during their off time because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not like it,</v>

2137
01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:55.780
<v Speaker 1>but you're just because you're teaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2138
01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did the these fucking retards,</v>

2139
01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:04.330
<v Speaker 2>whatsapp people access and go to school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you could access.</v>

2140
01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:06.350
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had access to my space at school,</v>

2141
01:50:06.351 --> 01:50:08.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what kind of Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to have at school.</v>

2142
01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but either way the kids should be able </v>

2143
01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:16.721
<v Speaker 1>to put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wants to be a war so it'd be a </v>

2144
01:50:16.721 --> 01:50:16.721
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't legislate against that and you</v>

2145
01:50:16.721 --> 01:50:19.010
<v Speaker 1>certainly can't punish them for shit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

2146
01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:21.410
<v Speaker 1>You're acting like you're in fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>mom.</v>

2147
01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying you don't want them in </v>

2148
01:50:26.530 --> 01:50:28.331
<v Speaker 1>school because of what they're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to give other people a bad </v>

2149
01:50:28.331 --> 01:50:28.331
<v Speaker 1>impression of your school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

2150

<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

2152
01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:35.930

<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>

01:50:46.810 --> 01:50:46.810
<v Speaker 1>dictate now how people are supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave.</v>

2158

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a problem with your </v>

2159

<v Speaker 2>I said in the first person I got was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>14 year old girl,</v>

2169
01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:18.320
<v Speaker 2>was a secret fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even notice that.</v>

01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:20.700
<v Speaker 2>How did they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>14,</v>

<v Speaker 1>worship?</v>

2174
01:51:29.850 --> 01:51:31.500
<v Speaker 1>They arrested a 15 year old girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

<v Speaker 2>so they arrested her.</v>

2177
01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:41.880
<v Speaker 2>They eventually charged her with a use </v>
<v Speaker 2>of criminal tools in a criminal tool.</v>

2202
01:52:59.710 --> 01:53:00.540
<v Speaker 1>have any other comments?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie?</v>

2203
01:53:00.770 --> 01:53:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Mike Whitehead got busted for sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>assaults.</v>

2204
01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:07.630

2206
01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Jack Hair Dye and you know,</v>

2207
01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:18.820
<v Speaker 1>he had a massive heart attack a year ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>and is based on.</v>

2208
01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:21.650
<v Speaker 1>So they just thought she was dead the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole time.</v>

2209
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know who was a person they </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought he was done.</v>

2210
01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:28.760
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of people sat like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think even doug sent out an RFP with a</v>

2211
01:53:28.761 --> 01:53:33.761
<v Speaker 1>lot of people were saying he was dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there the rumor going around but </v>

2212
01:53:33.761 --> 01:53:33.761
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was dead,</v>

2213
01:53:33.761 --> 01:53:35.800
<v Speaker 1>but he was basically like barely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is basically the.</v>

2214
01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the scientists of the </v>

2215
01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:41.800
<v Speaker 1>medical details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that he was in really,</v>

2216
01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:44.450
<v Speaker 1>really bad shape from the time of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>till till now.</v>

2217
01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:45.570
<v Speaker 1>So who was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

2218
01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:50.580
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that he was just really a </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful marijuana activists that </v>

2219
01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:55.511
<v Speaker 1>started out his life as like this gold </v>
<v Speaker 1>water republican type guy who was like </v>

2220
01:53:55.511 --> 01:53:59.840
<v Speaker 1>really anti elite and then he'd gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorced and smoking pot with this woman</v>

2221
01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:05.080
<v Speaker 1>that he had just met this new woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took a chance and there's a single </v>

2222
01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:06.830
<v Speaker 1>guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with some chicken and really</v>

2223
01:54:07.130 --> 01:54:10.310
<v Speaker 1>kind of was blown away by it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2224
01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:15.520
<v Speaker 1>fell in love with the effects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana and instead of looking into </v>

2225
01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:18.641
<v Speaker 1>the history and then he put up this </v>
<v Speaker 1>really fucking amazing book called the </v>

2226
01:54:18.641 --> 01:54:22.421
<v Speaker 1>emperor wears no clothes and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this marijuana already been </v>

2227
01:54:22.421 --> 01:54:22.580
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2228
01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:25.450
<v Speaker 5>putting him in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reason he went to jail because he,</v>

2229
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:30.750
<v Speaker 5>before he wrote the book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was already at like a marijuana </v>

2230
01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:32.890
<v Speaker 5>activist for certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so many ways you could fight for</v>

2231
01:54:32.891 --> 01:54:37.891
<v Speaker 5>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I forget exactly what he was </v>

2232
01:54:37.891 --> 01:54:37.891
<v Speaker 5>fighting for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the very beginning.</v>

2233
01:54:37.891 --> 01:54:38.980
<v Speaker 5>He was protesting in front of a federal </v>
<v Speaker 5>building.</v>

2234
01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:44.160
<v Speaker 5>Reagan showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Reagan a total people that federal </v>

2235
01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:48.781
<v Speaker 5>building have handled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You had the cops come and arrest </v>

2236
01:54:48.781 --> 01:54:51.421
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All they had to do was pay like $20 a </v>

2237
01:54:51.421 --> 01:54:54.510
<v Speaker 5>ticket or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He refused the pad and he went to jail </v>

2238
01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:55.380
<v Speaker 5>for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2239
01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:58.540
<v Speaker 5>he went to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where it was.</v>

2240
01:54:58.541 --> 01:54:59.100
<v Speaker 5>Good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

2241
01:54:59.110 --> 01:55:01.270
<v Speaker 5>that's where you had the time to write.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The emperor wears no clothes.</v>

2242
01:55:01.770 --> 01:55:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Jaylen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

2243
01:55:03.620 --> 01:55:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

2244
01:55:05.730 --> 01:55:08.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a good book too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really very detailed.</v>

2245
01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:13.230
<v Speaker 1>If you want to know anything about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of propaganda and the hemp being</v>

2246
01:55:13.231 --> 01:55:18.231
<v Speaker 1>made illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody thinks that the reason why </v>

2247
01:55:18.231 --> 01:55:18.231
<v Speaker 1>marijuana is illegal because it's bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

2248
01:55:18.231 --> 01:55:20.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you ask 100 people $75,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to tell you it's bad for you.</v>

2249
01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:22.260
<v Speaker 1>It's something that doesn't bring it </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

2250
01:55:22.261 --> 01:55:25.230
<v Speaker 1>which causes some problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not why it's illegal.</v>

2251
01:55:25.231 --> 01:55:28.830
<v Speaker 1>It's illegal because when they figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a way to process him,</v>

2252
01:55:28.930 --> 01:55:30.390
<v Speaker 1>fibers more effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That came up.</v>

2253
01:55:30.391 --> 01:55:35.391
<v Speaker 1>This thing called the decorticator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a machine that grinds up to </v>

2254
01:55:35.391 --> 01:55:36.030
<v Speaker 1>happen and them with the fibers easier </v>
<v Speaker 1>to process.</v>

2255
01:55:36.090 --> 01:55:40.780
<v Speaker 1>William Randolph hearst owned the paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies and he also owned newspapers.</v>

2256
01:55:40.781 --> 01:55:41.800
<v Speaker 1>So these paper companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2257
01:55:41.801 --> 01:55:46.801
<v Speaker 1>they make paper out of a fucking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this tap won't paper was much better as </v>

2258
01:55:46.801 --> 01:55:49.740
<v Speaker 1>far superior and it was a competing </v>
<v Speaker 1>product so he wanted to make an illegal.</v>

2259
01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:54.740
<v Speaker 1>So when he decided to do was print </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper articles where they said that </v>

2260
01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:55.470
<v Speaker 1>blacks and Mexicans were raping white </v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

2261
01:55:55.820 --> 01:56:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I knew it and the reason why they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said the reason why they were </v>

2262
01:56:00.961 --> 01:56:05.961
<v Speaker 1>raping white women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because they were smoking this new </v>

2263
01:56:05.961 --> 01:56:07.920
<v Speaker 1>drug called marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when Congress made marijuana illegal,</v>

2264
01:56:07.921 --> 01:56:10.410
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even know they're making the</v>
<v Speaker 1>textile,</v>

2265
01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:10.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2266
01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:11.910
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fabric,</v>

2267
01:56:11.911 --> 01:56:12.290
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2268
01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:17.300
<v Speaker 1>all the things that hemp can make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't really even know they were </v>

2269
01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:17.300
<v Speaker 1>making that illegal to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea.</v>

2270
01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:21.770
<v Speaker 1>It's really completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it's stuck from the 19 </v>

2271
01:56:21.770 --> 01:56:22.920
<v Speaker 1>thirties all the way to here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2010,</v>

2272
01:56:22.921 --> 01:56:27.921
<v Speaker 1>even though we know it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can go right now what on the </v>

2273
01:56:27.921 --> 01:56:30.810
<v Speaker 1>corner store and buy Jack Daniels and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trick ourselves to death easy.</v>

2274
01:56:31.210 --> 01:56:35.130
<v Speaker 1>We walked in with there right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we each bought a big ass bottle,</v>

2275
01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:37.700
<v Speaker 1>a gallon jug of Jack Daniels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All three of us in life.</v>

2276
01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:42.800
<v Speaker 1>No one would bat an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's lethal doses we just bought </v>

2277
01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:47.241
<v Speaker 1>lethal dose is about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can just come here and three of </v>

2278
01:56:47.241 --> 01:56:48.630
<v Speaker 1>us would drink those drip down Jack </v>
<v Speaker 1>tennis until her body literally shut the</v>

2279
01:56:48.631 --> 01:56:49.260
<v Speaker 1>fuck down.</v>

2280
01:56:50.430 --> 01:56:55.430
<v Speaker 1>That sounds cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is it that people don't even </v>

2281
01:56:55.591 --> 01:56:58.050
<v Speaker 1>bat an eye that marijuana should or </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be illegal?</v>

2282
01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:00.970
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it shouldn't be legal.</v>

2283
01:57:00.971 --> 01:57:02.530
<v Speaker 1>If you can go and buy Jack Daniels.</v>

2284
01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:03.450
<v Speaker 6>Ridiculous.</v>

2285
01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking hungry.</v>

2286
01:57:09.410 --> 01:57:11.770
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>End this thing.</v>

2287
01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we've done enough.</v>

2288
01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:19.240
<v Speaker 1>I think we've already talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2289
01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:23.290
<v Speaker 1>I think they're born enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva,</v>

2290
01:57:23.291 --> 01:57:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Sandy's going to take all the UFC belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

2291
01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Anderson Silva's board at 185 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

2292
01:57:28.271 --> 01:57:33.271
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why his last </v>

2293
01:57:33.271 --> 01:57:33.690
<v Speaker 1>performance wasn't up to par.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know who the fuck knows man?</v>

2294
01:57:33.710 --> 01:57:36.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't know until you're inside that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes had no.</v>

2295
01:57:36.311 --> 01:57:38.230
<v Speaker 1>He's obviously brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2296
01:57:38.231 --> 01:57:40.840
<v Speaker 1>and it's Friday and he's probably a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated dude,</v>

2297
01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:46.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I would like to see him </v>

2298
01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:46.140
<v Speaker 1>challenged that Shell fight is gonna be </v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>

2299
01:57:46.690 --> 01:57:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Chael Simon's going to talk a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and he's going to attack it and </v>

2300
01:57:51.690 --> 01:57:56.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>August I think it's going to be in Salt </v>

2301
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Lake City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2302
01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:01.540
<v Speaker 1>she also has a real good rest fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>well you should come in,</v>

2303
01:58:01.541 --> 01:58:06.541
<v Speaker 1>which was really impressive because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should have time start to be like this </v>

2304
01:58:06.541 --> 01:58:07.030
<v Speaker 1>real powerful grappler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chilson just manhandled them,</v>

2305
01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:10.150
<v Speaker 1>grapple the shit out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daddy beat chess.</v>

2306
01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Then it'd be a landmark for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

2307
01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:17.800
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really opened a lot of people and </v>

2308
01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:19.951
<v Speaker 1>so now he gets his way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took on a really explosive with </v>

2309
01:58:19.951 --> 01:58:20.740
<v Speaker 1>double leg take downs and you don't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>that often.</v>

2310
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:21.190
<v Speaker 1>You see that?</v>

2311
01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:26.770
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like GSP with wrestling.</v>

2312
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:32.770
<v Speaker 1>She fought Demian Maia before that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got triangled.</v>

2313
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:36.690
<v Speaker 1>You got a got taken down as soon as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit him with like a lateral or some sort</v>

2314
01:58:36.691 --> 01:58:38.050
<v Speaker 1>of a thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really impressive.</v>

2315
01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 1>And Damien mounted them and then stopped</v>
<v Speaker 1>the triangle from the mountain and pulls</v>

2316
01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:46.580
<v Speaker 1>up on top of them and tapped into drag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really sweet is there too,</v>

2317
01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:49.240
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Damien minor thing,</v>

2318
01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:51.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that guy catches,</v>

2319
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:53.360
<v Speaker 1>catches you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really good at that.</v>

2320
01:58:53.361 --> 01:58:55.180
<v Speaker 1>And she also has been caught in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

2321
01:58:55.600 --> 01:59:00.600
<v Speaker 1>That would be an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Anderson could submit him off of his </v>

2322
01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:00.600
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be fantastic.</v>

2323
01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chael Sonnen at some point in time,</v>

2324
01:59:02.850 --> 01:59:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Anderson doesn't lock them out </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

2325
01:59:04.450 --> 01:59:06.130
<v Speaker 1>So someone's going to have Anderson not </v>
<v Speaker 1>as back,</v>

2326
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:09.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>invested catches them was coming in,</v>

2327
01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:11.360
<v Speaker 1>which is always possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they understand</v>

2328
01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:14.440
<v Speaker 5>crawling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>feeling tight,</v>

2329
01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:19.720
<v Speaker 5>close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's going to take a submission to </v>

2330
01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:21.230
<v Speaker 5>friends in the guard and passing the </v>
<v Speaker 5>garden a little more serious.</v>

2331
01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:23.020
<v Speaker 5>I have a feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2332
01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:25.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's gonna come out </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he gets caught off guard because</v>

2333
01:59:25.701 --> 01:59:27.860
<v Speaker 5>he likes the column in the garland pound</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the garden.</v>

2334
01:59:27.861 --> 01:59:29.130
<v Speaker 5>You can get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2335
01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:31.440
<v Speaker 5>look at that car and airbnb kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>caught,</v>

2336
01:59:31.610 --> 01:59:32.840
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's awesome.</v>

2337
01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:36.130
<v Speaker 5>He's awesome at Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it wants shale.</v>

2338
01:59:36.260 --> 01:59:41.260
<v Speaker 5>Finally realizes that it needs to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>really good at passing and mounting and </v>

2339
01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:45.101
<v Speaker 5>taken aback flock once he realizes that </v>
<v Speaker 5>he needs to adapt the GSP strategy.</v>

2340
01:59:47.900 --> 01:59:52.900
<v Speaker 5>Once he looks at GSP fights and says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit I should be doing with GSP is </v>

2341
01:59:52.911 --> 01:59:57.911
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once he makes that decision will be </v>

2342
01:59:57.911 --> 01:59:59.900
<v Speaker 5>unstoppable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Serious reason why he does great,</v>

2343
01:59:59.901 --> 02:00:02.030
<v Speaker 5>but then you know he loses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he does great,</v>

2344
02:00:02.031 --> 02:00:07.031
<v Speaker 5>but he moves his because he is not </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking guard,</v>

2345
02:00:08.001 --> 02:00:11.600
<v Speaker 5>passing and being safe in the garden and</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking guard,</v>

2346
02:00:11.601 --> 02:00:16.520
<v Speaker 5>passing as the number one priority over </v>
<v Speaker 5>and power in that and the full guard.</v>

2347
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:20.520
<v Speaker 5>The only should really pound in before </v>
<v Speaker 5>God to open shit out.</v>

2348
02:00:20.521 --> 02:00:23.510
<v Speaker 5>Like passing should be your number one </v>
<v Speaker 5>focus.</v>

2349
02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:27.080
<v Speaker 5>Look at GSP passing is this number one </v>
<v Speaker 5>focus.</v>

2350
02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:29.200
<v Speaker 5>That is the correct attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's important.</v>

2351
02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jackson said about GSP.</v>

2352
02:00:33.180 --> 02:00:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Greg Jackson said the fact that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to GSP to pass the </v>

2353
02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:38.180
<v Speaker 1>gardening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We took it down.</v>

2354
02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:39.490
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't pass his garbage route.</v>

2355
02:00:39.970 --> 02:00:43.950
<v Speaker 5>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was being could it</v>

2356
02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:49.720
<v Speaker 1>saying you couldn't pass his guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he wasn't passing it and he was </v>

2357
02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:49.720
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we thought he was wasting energy</v>

2358
02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:52.120
<v Speaker 1>just wanting to feed them up from inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guard.</v>

2359
02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:54.550
<v Speaker 1>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then she goes towards good from the half</v>

2360
02:00:54.551 --> 02:00:54.850
<v Speaker 1>guard.</v>

2361
02:00:58.140 --> 02:01:03.140
<v Speaker 5>You didn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't agree with that strategy at all </v>

2362
02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:03.930
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would never do that,</v>

2363
02:01:03.931 --> 02:01:08.931
<v Speaker 5>but I can understand it in a way where I</v>
<v Speaker 5>can see that the after GSP passes guard </v>

2364
02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:13.620
<v Speaker 5>and Martyrdom Dang hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would give this back.</v>

2365
02:01:13.710 --> 02:01:16.650
<v Speaker 5>Then he would post up and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>eventually shake them off and they would</v>

2366
02:01:16.651 --> 02:01:19.510
<v Speaker 5>stand up again that every time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you've got.</v>

2367
02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:22.430
<v Speaker 5>Jackson was looking at it as like it'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>be past the guards amount.</v>

2368
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:26.340
<v Speaker 5>The NIGGA that mentioned stand up as it </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets back up and it gets up.</v>

2369
02:01:26.430 --> 02:01:29.640
<v Speaker 5>So I think just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like staying this guard.</v>

2370
02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:32.500
<v Speaker 5>He can't get up from there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He can't get up from the guard,</v>

2371
02:01:32.501 --> 02:01:34.640
<v Speaker 5>he can't get up once it gets back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2372
02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:38.070
<v Speaker 5>So just standard gardens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get the w don't take a fucking chance on</v>

2373
02:01:38.071 --> 02:01:39.750
<v Speaker 5>this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like the</v>

2374
02:01:40.110 --> 02:01:44.420
<v Speaker 2>super conservative strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I understand,</v>

2375
02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:49.600
<v Speaker 2>but I think GSP was doing five and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think you should always go for the </v>

2376
02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:52.420
<v Speaker 2>finish and always go for the past almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>twice.</v>

2377
02:01:52.421 --> 02:01:52.920
<v Speaker 2>He almost had,</v>

2378
02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:54.670
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>

2379
02:01:54.671 --> 02:01:57.360
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want your job,</v>

2380
02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:01.480
<v Speaker 2>and they were working on it afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're working on tightening.</v>

2381
02:02:01.481 --> 02:02:06.481
<v Speaker 2>What he was doing wrong with setting up </v>
<v Speaker 2>is Kamora telling him to hit it at a </v>

2382
02:02:06.481 --> 02:02:06.481
<v Speaker 2>different angle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2383
02:02:06.481 --> 02:02:11.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember how he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have to leg over the face in San</v>

2384
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Controller to the other leg over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>face?</v>

2385
02:02:15.450 --> 02:02:19.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what side control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that gap.</v>

2386
02:02:19.930 --> 02:02:24.930
<v Speaker 2>The Camorra looks strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The arm bar looks strong for a couple </v>

2387
02:02:24.930 --> 02:02:24.930
<v Speaker 2>seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2388
02:02:24.930 --> 02:02:28.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm bobby's been back way back for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple seconds to Dan Hardee just rented</v>

2389
02:02:28.301 --> 02:02:30.060
<v Speaker 2>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll just face the mat.</v>

2390
02:02:30.190 --> 02:02:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Turned himself over and Dan only had two</v>
<v Speaker 2>scratches on his under his right eye and</v>

2391
02:02:34.931 --> 02:02:39.370
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't hurt as arms refine and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>may has amazing that he went five rounds</v>

2392
02:02:39.371 --> 02:02:41.590
<v Speaker 2>of GSP and he barely had a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mics on it.</v>

2393
02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:45.700
<v Speaker 2>Go back and ask you this man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No parties a tough dude.</v>

2394
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.460
<v Speaker 2>He's such a smart guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good at shit.</v>

2395
02:02:48.461 --> 02:02:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Talking so good at those interviews that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

2396
02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:53.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2397
02:02:53.111 --> 02:02:56.860
<v Speaker 2>it's such a tricky thing because in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that's like Kinda like anti,</v>

2398
02:02:56.890 --> 02:03:01.890
<v Speaker 2>like with the martial arts is supposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stand for talking shit and you know </v>

2399
02:03:01.890 --> 02:03:03.850
<v Speaker 2>that when dudes do talk shit they make </v>
<v Speaker 2>it so much more interesting.</v>

2400
02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they talk shit back in ancient </v>

2401
02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:11.161
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Samurais against we dudes and all </v>

2402
02:03:11.161 --> 02:03:11.161
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said I think they touched it.</v>

2403
02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:11.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2404
02:03:13.870 --> 02:03:15.960
<v Speaker 2>It's a tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It fucks with people's heads.</v>

2405
02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:16.630
<v Speaker 4>Jumped ship.</v>

2406
02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dick doesn't want to make you </v>

2407
02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:31.280
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it is a tactic,</v>

2408
02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:34.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking dudes heads.</v>

2409
02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:39.460
<v Speaker 2>It is like a legitimate technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that everyone thinks </v>

2410
02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:41.110
<v Speaker 2>they're doing so well and I like rarely </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually feels people off their games.</v>

2411
02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:45.050
<v Speaker 2>That was witty issues sometimes to mix </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2412
02:03:45.051 --> 02:03:50.051
<v Speaker 2>Douchey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The two guys are just talking shit to </v>

2413
02:03:50.051 --> 02:03:50.051
<v Speaker 2>each other now sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2414
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:55.450
<v Speaker 2>but when guys are good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't like personal interview.</v>

2415
02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be honest with you,</v>

2416
02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:03.220
<v Speaker 4>I got when I'm going to go out and give </v>
<v Speaker 4>it my all,</v>

2417
02:04:03.970 --> 02:04:06.220
<v Speaker 4>that's all I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What else do you want me to do?</v>

2418
02:04:08.610 --> 02:04:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Here's the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2419
02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:12.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't really have a lot of job </v>
<v Speaker 2>options.</v>

2420
02:04:12.110 --> 02:04:14.070
<v Speaker 2>I need some money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2421
02:04:14.090 --> 02:04:15.680
<v Speaker 2>and it's not a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fuck it.</v>

2422
02:04:15.681 --> 02:04:20.681
<v Speaker 2>I need to fight and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing that it's going to be a sound on </v>

2423
02:04:20.681 --> 02:04:22.270
<v Speaker 2>tv a couple of times and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2424
02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm to make some cash with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My favorite was Anderson and one of the </v>

2425
02:04:27.580 --> 02:04:29.060
<v Speaker 2>times when they go back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll tell you what,</v>

2426
02:04:29.061 --> 02:04:34.061
<v Speaker 2>that guy said it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say something and it goes like </v>

2427
02:04:34.061 --> 02:04:34.061
<v Speaker 2>divorced guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2428
02:04:34.061 --> 02:04:34.061
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking drama school.</v>

2429
02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:34.880
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2430
02:04:34.881 --> 02:04:36.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said you don't understand.</v>

2431
02:04:36.111 --> 02:04:37.680
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to get you down,</v>

2432
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:39.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Algebra submission.</v>

2433
02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:41.670
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great tactic.</v>

2434
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:43.710
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2435
02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:51.000
<v Speaker 2>That's the smart way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart way to tell her that Anderson is </v>

2436
02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:51.810
<v Speaker 2>pretty good when it comes to cit </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking,</v>

2437
02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:54.960
<v Speaker 2>how casual economy gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but apparently it gets very angry.</v>

2438
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you saw that Chael Sonnen fight men</v>

2439
02:04:57.750 --> 02:05:00.450
<v Speaker 2>or the rather Damien Maia fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets real angry,</v>

2440
02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:03.990
<v Speaker 2>you know Damien Maia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the Fuck David am I said really</v>

2441
02:05:03.991 --> 02:05:08.991
<v Speaker 2>made him bananas and that second round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck was said a </v>

2442
02:05:08.991 --> 02:05:13.131
<v Speaker 2>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but have you ever seen him like that </v>

2443
02:05:13.131 --> 02:05:13.131
<v Speaker 2>before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ever?</v>

2444
02:05:13.131 --> 02:05:13.131
<v Speaker 2>Just screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming shit,</v>

2445
02:05:13.131 --> 02:05:17.661
<v Speaker 2>talking like that never would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would happen again in mind when he </v>

2446
02:05:17.661 --> 02:05:21.090
<v Speaker 2>bought boots and an Anderson Silva's and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a Danny Meyer started doing.</v>

2447
02:05:21.091 --> 02:05:26.091
<v Speaker 2>Some fucking windmill break would stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it just started to break?</v>

2448
02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:33.210
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like right in the middle.</v>

2449
02:05:33.211 --> 02:05:37.200
<v Speaker 2>You just started break dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that thing where it's like they</v>

2450
02:05:37.250 --> 02:05:37.930
<v Speaker 2>don't dress it.</v>

2451
02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:40.260
<v Speaker 2>They spend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be awesome.</v>

2452
02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:44.220
<v Speaker 2>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George St Pierre to break dance.</v>

2453
02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:49.520
<v Speaker 2>You remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to do that a little bit and </v>

2454
02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:49.520
<v Speaker 2>something's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good when you attack someone like</v>

2455
02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:54.411
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he just fucking spun out a big </v>

2456
02:05:54.411 --> 02:05:55.800
<v Speaker 2>propeller energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People imagine that's a fucking break.</v>

2457
02:05:55.801 --> 02:05:57.020
<v Speaker 2>That would be bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2458
02:05:57.030 --> 02:06:02.030
<v Speaker 2>I bet the break dancers would start </v>
<v Speaker 2>making up like this and it was fucking </v>

2459
02:06:03.421 --> 02:06:08.421
<v Speaker 2>switched positions and they can break </v>
<v Speaker 2>down a break dance card to have capital </v>

2460
02:06:09.031 --> 02:06:12.090
<v Speaker 2>or a gun together with break dancing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it created a new.</v>

2461
02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:17.400
<v Speaker 2>Marsha said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's spending like a tsunami of things.</v>

2462
02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Just dive in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get fucking balls and go</v>

2463
02:06:28.531 --> 02:06:33.290
<v Speaker 2>right to the headspin when you spend on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your head and then slide your legs out.</v>

2464
02:06:33.350 --> 02:06:34.410
<v Speaker 2>Fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2465
02:06:35.850 --> 02:06:38.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be great.</v>

2466
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:44.510
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably a good board yet</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about.</v>

2467
02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:52.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about that real quick while </v>

2468
02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:52.800
<v Speaker 2>you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you think about Shinya Aoki?</v>

2469
02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Gilbert Melendez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting fight.</v>

2470
02:06:56.990 --> 02:07:01.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gilbert Melendez is awesome and the </v>

2471
02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:04.170
<v Speaker 2>guard and he did a great job at staying </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from any danger in it.</v>

2472
02:07:04.290 --> 02:07:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe once or twice Aoki at m </v>
<v Speaker 2>and ms dot controlling,</v>

2473
02:07:07.621 --> 02:07:12.621
<v Speaker 2>smashed against the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a bad mother fucker know </v>

2474
02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Gilbert Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

2475
02:07:15.091 --> 02:07:17.370
<v Speaker 2>Timing is standing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was wicked.</v>

2476
02:07:17.490 --> 02:07:19.140
<v Speaker 2>He stayed on top of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2477
02:07:19.141 --> 02:07:21.090
<v Speaker 2>The only way that strategy was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work for him,</v>

2478
02:07:21.180 --> 02:07:22.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>state avoiding the gardens,</v>

2479
02:07:22.651 --> 02:07:24.300
<v Speaker 2>if he could beat him in standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchanges,</v>

2480
02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:28.550
<v Speaker 2>and it definitely did because he lived </v>
<v Speaker 2>in these theaters.</v>

2481
02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Deacon is asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2482
02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:34.260
<v Speaker 2>that that really map the risks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants enforcement on.</v>

2483
02:07:34.261 --> 02:07:34.650
<v Speaker 2>That was good.</v>

2484
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:38.740
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got the arm trapped a couple times,</v>

2485
02:07:38.741 --> 02:07:40.840
<v Speaker 1>but typically just right the fuck out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2486
02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:44.360
<v Speaker 1>And it was never in any danger at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was a big fight for him,</v>

2487
02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:49.600
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just not as good with the fucking </v>

2488
02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:51.330
<v Speaker 1>with regular shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was Jay shows contract </v>

2489
02:07:51.330 --> 02:07:51.330
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated for us because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly.</v>

2490
02:07:51.330 --> 02:07:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is amazing,</v>

2491
02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:57.200
<v Speaker 1>but if they really let him fight without</v>
<v Speaker 1>a contract saying that if he wins that </v>

2492
02:07:57.200 --> 02:07:58.720
<v Speaker 1>he's still in contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that stuff works.</v>

2493
02:07:59.350 --> 02:08:02.020
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you can if you're not willing to</v>

2494
02:08:02.021 --> 02:08:07.021
<v Speaker 1>sign a new contract against him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he felt like.</v>

2495
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:13.680
<v Speaker 1>I think jake shields was upset because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he felt like they were not respected.</v>

2496
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:19.330
<v Speaker 1>They didn't promote him enough day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly.</v>

2497
02:08:19.390 --> 02:08:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Most of the promotion that they had was </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioning Dan Henderson and because he </v>

2498
02:08:24.670 --> 02:08:29.670
<v Speaker 1>was on his last fight to be a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Dan's a legend from to time pride</v>

2499
02:08:33.161 --> 02:08:35.590
<v Speaker 1>champion in two different weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

2500
02:08:35.591 --> 02:08:37.690
<v Speaker 1>So that was a big deal for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big acquisition.</v>

2501
02:08:37.691 --> 02:08:39.070
<v Speaker 1>They thought he was going to be the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>star,</v>

2502
02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:41.920
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were hoping that jake shields would</v>

2503
02:08:41.921 --> 02:08:42.580
<v Speaker 1>lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

2504
02:08:42.850 --> 02:08:47.850
<v Speaker 1>given the right away the other guy off </v>
<v Speaker 1>this first fight,</v>

2505
02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:51.280
<v Speaker 1>the first fight in the organizations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>title fight,</v>

2506
02:08:51.610 --> 02:08:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
