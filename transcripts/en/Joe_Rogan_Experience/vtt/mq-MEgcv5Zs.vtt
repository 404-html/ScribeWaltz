<v Speaker 1>It's not the same.</v>

34
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.503
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you love cigarettes and both of my </v>

35

36
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:24.474
<v Speaker 1>me and then started again like a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>later and she would smoke like in the </v>

37
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>the little house that I grew up in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just always like,</v>

39
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>my whole life was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was built to be a cigarette smoker.</v>

40
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Those two were probably smoking ciggies </v>
<v Speaker 1>while banging,</v>

41
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>making me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

42
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.703
<v Speaker 1>I just love cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I even still love the nice gust of </v>

43
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>secondhand smoke and now that I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsmoker,</v>

44
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>it blows my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hearing people those years say,</v>

45
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes stank.</v>

47
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

48
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>I just love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes me feel good.</v>

49
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird and I know because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pure poison,</v>

50
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 1>it just goes to show like what a dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord I am.</v>

51
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Is that you or is that just cigarettes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in general?</v>

52
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:05.484
<v Speaker 1>Have a grip on people to dark grip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is so crazy because what else </v>

53
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>gives you nothing and takes everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and still it's just.</v>

54
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>This is my favorite part of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Favorite part of the night after sex.</v>

55
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>During coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said that Johnny Carson,</v>

56
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.920
<v Speaker 1>when he was on his deathbed was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>rotting out from the inside.</v>

57
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.720
<v Speaker 1>He was just falling apart and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like those goddamn cigarette.</v>

58
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the main reasons why a,</v>

59
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 1>I actually quit was reading about Johnny</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

60
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.800
<v Speaker 1>because it's sort of correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still,</v>

61
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on runs every day pretty much every </v>

<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short jogs and this and that to wake up </v>

63
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>and get the day started and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile there where I was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like coming up.</v>

65
00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:47.754
<v Speaker 1>Not really coughing up shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was sorta just like it was there </v>

66
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.023
<v Speaker 1>and I'd have to clear my throat before </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on stage and it started to get </v>

67
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.840
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't onstage,</v>

68
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>but it started to creep up during work </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

69
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only was that a major thing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like those damn cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's,</v>

82
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.620

<v Speaker 1>deathbed,</v>

83

144
00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:27.800

<v Speaker 2>It's never going to change.</v>

145
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got it all figured out.</v>

146
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.781
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

147
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 2>she's the one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

148
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 2>It's a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

149
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 2>it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes humorous like Elizabeth Taylor,</v>

150
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 2>who was stunningly beautiful when she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was young.</v>

151
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see who's afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia Wolf [inaudible]?</v>

152
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a must.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

153
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 2>it's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great old movie.</v>

154
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.643
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elizabeth Taylor was probably in her </v>

155
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 2>twenties I guess when she did that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was just so beautiful.</v>

156
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 2>But as she got older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like shoes,</v>

157
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 2>see if he could see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty good picture of her.</v>

158
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 2>But if you see like her whole body and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

159
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:06.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean she was just a bombshell and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a bombshell and you know,</v>

160
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fifties or something like that.</v>

161
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:09.704
<v Speaker 2>Like that picture of her black and white</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the second level where you see your </v>

162
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

163
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.470
<v Speaker 2>That's a real body to dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ain't no gym time there.</v>

164
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.870
<v Speaker 2>That's just straight up genetics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whiskey.</v>

165
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Look at them going on legs and 10 high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just just as biology.</v>

166
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.343
<v Speaker 2>But then towards the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she had been married and </v>

167
00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 2>divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't show the old pictures.</v>

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 3>comedy joke that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

218
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.063

301
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.130
<v Speaker 2>It would be nice if pain pills didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything bad to you.</v>

302
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:23.870

<v Speaker 2>That would be part.</v>

304
00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.330
<v Speaker 2>No addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no physical harm.</v>

305
00:13:27.331 --> 00:13:28.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are always going to be.</v>

306
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.560
<v Speaker 2>People are addicted to washing their </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

307
00:13:30.561 --> 00:13:31.394
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are addicted to really weird </v>

308
00:13:32.031 --> 00:13:32.864
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's always going to be people </v>

309
00:13:34.161 --> 00:13:37.250
<v Speaker 2>that are addicted to things in that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't quit doing them,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is the greatest feeling that I </v>

315
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:52.720
<v Speaker 1>could do this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is incredible.</v>

316
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.840

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Light coating is a coating.</v>

336
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.660
<v Speaker 2>We've done this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

337
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.810
<v Speaker 2>We talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw there's a thc liquid,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Somebody tried to give me some </v>

341
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.410

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>THC infused beer.</v>

<v Speaker 2>from me.</v>

344
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.780
<v Speaker 2>They're making cbd infused beer soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think budweiser,</v>

345
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:09.643
<v Speaker 2>coors or budweiser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone invested a Shitload of money </v>

346
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:14.510
<v Speaker 2>into in Canada or mgd.</v>

347
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.610

<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

348
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.013
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would counteract the effects of </v>

349
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:22.520
<v Speaker 2>alcohol and somewhat because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things about alcohol right,</v>

350
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:23.354
<v Speaker 2>is that it causes inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>CBD perhaps could counteract the </v>

351
00:15:26.681 --> 00:15:28.030
<v Speaker 2>inflammation.</v>

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:34.653
<v Speaker 1>THC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to anything other than </v>

<v Speaker 2>you like a little bit of elevation.</v>

361
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 2>You get a little bit from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the cigarette,</v>

362
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.580
<v Speaker 2>the nicotine that tobacco,</v>

<v Speaker 1>For some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that a monster would lay there </v>

423
00:18:44.561 --> 00:18:49.561
<v Speaker 2>Pieper Luke Christo Suing Boulder for </v>

<v Speaker 2>he heard the door locked behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At that point he summoned his security.</v>

469
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:15.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened.</v>

470
00:21:15.821 --> 00:21:16.654
<v Speaker 2>And then they caught that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's in there with a tarp hiding </v>

471
00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:22.150
<v Speaker 2>under a tarp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While people were shitting on him.</v>

472
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Look at his face.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He sat down with Fox 31 for a jailhouse </v>

477
00:21:37.091 --> 00:21:41.020
<v Speaker 2>interview in which you referred to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spying on urinating or defecating.</v>

00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Women in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest creature in the universe.</v>

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:25.663
<v Speaker 4>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll tell you we should put one behind </v>

515
00:23:26.591 --> 00:23:27.424
<v Speaker 4>the comedy store and see if anyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>starts to like look it up and down and </v>

516
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:34.230
<v Speaker 4>lay down in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

517
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.610
<v Speaker 4>they had this test they did with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

518
00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:41.620
<v Speaker 4>with men where they took men that were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now before we get any further,</v>

519
00:23:41.711 --> 00:23:43.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who conducted these tests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie could probably find it.</v>

520
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:44.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

521
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they conducted</v>

522
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.263
<v Speaker 2>tests where they put devices on penises </v>
<v Speaker 2>who talked about this was Christopher </v>

523
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Ryan may have talked about this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe our friend Chris Ryan talked about</v>

524
00:23:53.931 --> 00:23:54.764
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put sensors on penises and they </v>

525
00:23:57.711 --> 00:23:58.544
<v Speaker 2>showed homophobic men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>erotica and homosexual erotica in </v>

526
00:24:04.491 --> 00:24:05.324
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like guys getting their Dick sucked by </v>

527
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:11.330
<v Speaker 2>guys and they got aroused by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put these things on it.</v>

528
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:14.360
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we would need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to like,</v>

529
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:15.980
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be phobic.</v>

530
00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Men are aroused by gay male porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

531
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.270
<v Speaker 2>Homophobia is associated with sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>excitement by male on male sex.</v>

532
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:26.693
<v Speaker 4>That's one study.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the greatest reality show ever </v>

533
00:24:28.771 --> 00:24:29.820
<v Speaker 4>in the making right now.</v>

534
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:30.703
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One study asked heterosexual men how </v>

535
00:24:33.101 --> 00:24:37.060
<v Speaker 2>comfortable and anxious they are around </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay men based on these scores,</v>

536
00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.840
<v Speaker 2>they then divided these into two groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men that are homophobic,</v>

537
00:24:40.841 --> 00:24:44.110
<v Speaker 2>amended or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These men were then shown three,</v>

538
00:24:44.111 --> 00:24:46.500
<v Speaker 2>four minute videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a long time.</v>

539
00:24:46.501 --> 00:24:48.310
<v Speaker 2>You're sitting there watching to dude </v>
<v Speaker 2>suck a dick.</v>

540
00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.170
<v Speaker 2>One video depicted straight sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

541
00:24:51.171 --> 00:24:52.004
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big depicted lesbian sex and one </v>

542
00:24:53.501 --> 00:24:56.920
<v Speaker 2>depicted gay male sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While this was happening,</v>

543
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.950
<v Speaker 2>a device that was attached to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>participant's penis.</v>

544
00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.910
<v Speaker 2>This device has been found to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>triggered by sexual arousal,</v>

545
00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.080
<v Speaker 2>but not by other types of arousal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such as nervousness or fear.</v>

546
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Arousal often has a very different </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning in psychology.</v>

547
00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Then improper usage.</v>

548
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.880
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wonder what the device looks like.</v>

549
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.923
<v Speaker 4>It's just some dude's mouth to mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty sure this was a Japanese game </v>

550
00:25:22.311 --> 00:25:23.144
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Experimental was they had a guy get </v>

551
00:25:25.311 --> 00:25:28.160
<v Speaker 4>blown by another dude and he had to last</v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain amount of time.</v>

552
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.300
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did hear that.</v>

553
00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:33.270
<v Speaker 4>Kept them under a weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had the last without coming.</v>

554
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.113
<v Speaker 4>He had to go four or five minutes or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something without blowing a little kid </v>

555
00:25:35.931 --> 00:25:36.740
<v Speaker 4>when a bunch of money</v>

556
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.573
<v Speaker 2>and if a guy was sucking his dick is </v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't realize that Japanese </v>

557
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:46.030
<v Speaker 2>before fear factor Japanese game shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>were on another level.</v>

558
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.110
<v Speaker 2>They were doing some fucking insane shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Japanese TV.</v>

559
00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.123
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the early youtube clips we used </v>

560
00:25:53.691 --> 00:25:56.180
<v Speaker 2>to watch was Japanese game shows.</v>

561
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.990
<v Speaker 4>Those guys are way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're always ahead of it.</v>

562
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.960
<v Speaker 4>Ninja warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

563
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:01.841
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

564
00:26:01.841 --> 00:26:04.300
<v Speaker 4>Was that a Japanese show first?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

565
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should be when it first started,</v>

566
00:26:07.661 --> 00:26:11.580
<v Speaker 4>like that's how it got onto the way it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is because g four had a contest for like</v>

567
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:12.423
<v Speaker 4>the first American to go over and do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it just sort of snowballed from </v>

568
00:26:15.521 --> 00:26:16.354
<v Speaker 4>there</v>

569
00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:17.243
<v Speaker 2>and then they had that show that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a version of it for America </v>

570
00:26:20.311 --> 00:26:21.700
<v Speaker 2>called wipe out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

571
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.553
<v Speaker 2>Remember that because that was the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that produced fear factor </v>

572
00:26:25.351 --> 00:26:26.184
<v Speaker 2>produced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wipe out</v>

573
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.403
<v Speaker 4>MFC where they would like auto dm or did</v>
<v Speaker 4>the voice dubs and it would seem a </v>

574
00:26:31.001 --> 00:26:32.770
<v Speaker 4>little funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they'd be like the waiters,</v>

575
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:35.680
<v Speaker 4>the service staff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it'd be almost a big joke.</v>

576
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:37.140
<v Speaker 4>Remember I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

577
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.610
<v Speaker 4>it was called Mx.</v>
<v Speaker 4>see like I don't remember the full name.</v>

578
00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:44.370
<v Speaker 4>I'll pull up a video and see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

579
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.033
<v Speaker 4>we put these sensors on Earl's kcals </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dick and have someone take a shit in </v>

580

585
00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:01.573
<v Speaker 4>Now here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't help but thinking that ladies </v>

586
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.270
<v Speaker 4>running through shit now after we talked</v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

587
00:27:06.271 --> 00:27:09.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I don't see that as mud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a silly Japanese show.</v>

588
00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:12.420
<v Speaker 4>But here's the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other one I was telling you about,</v>

589
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.460
<v Speaker 4>this is the only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can only find it on live leak,</v>

590
00:27:14.461 --> 00:27:17.370
<v Speaker 4>but it is a gay versus straight blow job</v>
<v Speaker 4>challenge.</v>

591
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So who's the Gay Guy?</v>

592
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:21.163
<v Speaker 4>This big guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe the big guy's gay and the </v>

593
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:26.580
<v Speaker 4>straight guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

594
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:31.930
<v Speaker 4>This gay guy says those pants are hot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so this guy has to stand there,</v>

595
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.940
<v Speaker 4>see if we can get Takuya.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

596
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.220
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he doesn't get hard,</v>

597
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he might not get hard like this.</v>

598
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.410
<v Speaker 4>What does the expression mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

599
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.520
<v Speaker 4>welcome to another episode of high speed</v>
<v Speaker 4>vacuum.</v>

600
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.820
<v Speaker 4>Puts his hand in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His expression has changed dramatically.</v>

601
00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.000
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

602
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.120
<v Speaker 4>it's always those fat guys that really </v>
<v Speaker 4>sucked the best dicks.</v>

603
00:28:00.121 --> 00:28:03.270
<v Speaker 4>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>

604
00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.170
<v Speaker 4>At the end of that comment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to say.</v>

605
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.710
<v Speaker 4>I bet I would imagine because it's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a comment.</v>

606
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.040
<v Speaker 4>This guy took his shirt off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened there?</v>

607
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.533
<v Speaker 4>Shot.</v>

608
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.920
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I enjoyed that.</v>

609
00:28:16.921 --> 00:28:18.630
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

610
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.700
<v Speaker 4>so that poor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a winner.</v>

611
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.100
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that poor guy.</v>

612
00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:25.770
<v Speaker 4>Just not in that dude's mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

613
00:28:25.771 --> 00:28:27.780
<v Speaker 4>that's frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot came out,</v>

614
00:28:27.781 --> 00:28:28.740
<v Speaker 4>didn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

615
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:30.810
<v Speaker 4>it's so frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

616
00:28:30.811 --> 00:28:31.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot came out.</v>

617
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Tell them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy's like,</v>

618
00:28:33.781 --> 00:28:35.760
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you enjoyed that.</v>

619
00:28:35.761 --> 00:28:36.780
<v Speaker 4>You came really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>

620
00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.670
<v Speaker 4>It was very frustrating because like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

621
00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:41.010
<v Speaker 4>but a lot came out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You came hard,</v>

622
00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.390
<v Speaker 4>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But frustrating,</v>

623
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:43.643
<v Speaker 4>dumb like no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you liked it at the time because a </v>

624
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:47.730
<v Speaker 4>lot came out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can only comes out if it feels good.</v>

625
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.340
<v Speaker 4>That is there evil that's fucking with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the person's mind.</v>

626
00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:54.803
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys to think about that shit for </v>

627
00:28:56.791 --> 00:28:58.650
<v Speaker 4>the rest of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's probably gay now.</v>

628
00:28:58.651 --> 00:29:01.830
<v Speaker 4>He's probably on the other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>game show second.</v>

629
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.753
<v Speaker 4>The reason why I would imagine fat guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>suck Dick Betters because it involves </v>

630
00:29:04.711 --> 00:29:07.860
<v Speaker 4>food and and gay sex at the same time.</v>

631
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:08.723
<v Speaker 4>It's a combination of things like fat </v>
<v Speaker 4>people probably like things in their </v>

632
00:29:10.381 --> 00:29:11.910
<v Speaker 4>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then on top of that,</v>

633
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:17.270
<v Speaker 4>gay sex and Asian as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kobiashi is the hot dog eating champion.</v>

634
00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.520
<v Speaker 4>I thought you were going to go with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little Dick.</v>

635
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:22.063
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll get the whole thing that you're </v>

636
00:29:25.051 --> 00:29:27.480
<v Speaker 4>not choking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could promote it.</v>

637
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.300
<v Speaker 4>You can really go to town and it might </v>
<v Speaker 4>not even make it to your throat.</v>

638
00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:34.310
<v Speaker 4>Just deep now flip it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

639
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.473
<v Speaker 4>that's a terrible stereotype,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm really embarrassed you brought </v>

640
00:29:37.261 --> 00:29:38.400
<v Speaker 4>that up on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

641
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.930
<v Speaker 4>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Indeed,</v>

642
00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.610
<v Speaker 4>and if anybody knows things about </v>
<v Speaker 4>stereotypes,</v>

643
00:29:42.611 --> 00:29:47.611
<v Speaker 4>it's Asians and Megan Kelly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was an Asian Stereo.</v>

644
00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:50.953
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

645
00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:51.670
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

646
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:52.780
<v Speaker 4>Like Samsung.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

647
00:29:52.781 --> 00:29:53.650
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

648
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.633
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

649
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.520
<v Speaker 4>Megan Kelly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy one.</v>

650
00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.980
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy one because she said dad </v>
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>

651
00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.750
<v Speaker 4>I never really got it all the way.</v>

652
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:05.620
<v Speaker 4>She said that back in her day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people used to be black for Halloween.</v>

653
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:07.023
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why can't you dress up as like Diana </v>

654
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.240
<v Speaker 4>Ross?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

655
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.360
<v Speaker 4>I guess she essentially said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's wrong with wearing blackface?</v>

656
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.950
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is it bad for she?</v>

657
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:19.410
<v Speaker 4>She threw one in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not even really bad as it like.</v>

658
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.373
<v Speaker 4>She started with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is it bad for a black person to </v>

659
00:30:22.781 --> 00:30:26.020
<v Speaker 4>dress up as a white person or white </v>
<v Speaker 4>person dress up as a black person?</v>

660
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.033
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

661
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.220
<v Speaker 4>Nobody says it's bad for a black person </v>
<v Speaker 4>who dressed up as a white person.</v>

662
00:30:30.221 --> 00:30:32.230
<v Speaker 4>Dave Chappelle did it on his TV show </v>
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>

663
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Remember that we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody cared.</v>

664
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.680
<v Speaker 4>It's bad because these two have minstrel</v>
<v Speaker 4>shows,</v>

665
00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.430
<v Speaker 4>like if she knew the history of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you go to back and watch Al Jolson.</v>

666
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.620
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever watched some of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff?</v>

667
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.590
<v Speaker 4>A little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean we should watch some of that.</v>

668
00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.610
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Al Jolson stuff.</v>

669
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.660
<v Speaker 4>Really what would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We go to jail.</v>

670
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.900
<v Speaker 4>Just pc police,</v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube.</v>

671
00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.453
<v Speaker 4>What about white chicks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember white chicks when the Wayans </v>

672
00:30:59.261 --> 00:31:00.940
<v Speaker 4>brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh Oh yeah.</v>

673
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.710
<v Speaker 4>They hit that whole movie where there </v>
<v Speaker 4>were white face.</v>

674
00:31:02.711 --> 00:31:04.240
<v Speaker 4>Huge movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody cares.</v>

675
00:31:04.241 --> 00:31:06.190
<v Speaker 4>Heavily promoted movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Funny movie.</v>

676
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could.</v>

677
00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.760
<v Speaker 4>You could be white.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody cares.</v>

678
00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:12.310
<v Speaker 4>So her saying that was very </v>
<v Speaker 4>disingenuous.</v>

679
00:31:12.311 --> 00:31:14.770
<v Speaker 4>It was just to cover our ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's Al Jolson.</v>

680
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.680
<v Speaker 4>So what does the jazz singer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Al Jolson.</v>

681
00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.313
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And look at what he used to do with his </v>

682
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:23.074
<v Speaker 4>lips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to make his lips cartoonishly </v>

683
00:31:25.781 --> 00:31:30.781
<v Speaker 4>exaggerated any would sing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was like an obviously a white man</v>

684
00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.900
<v Speaker 4>singing in black face as a black man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

685
00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:38.080
<v Speaker 4>it's really weird to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he would wear white gloves on,</v>

686
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.750
<v Speaker 4>is it wrong that I feel weird or </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching this.</v>

687
00:31:40.751 --> 00:31:43.780
<v Speaker 4>Then reading about the guy that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting shit and pissed on,</v>

688
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.510
<v Speaker 4>is it wrong that you came quicker than </v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy?</v>

689
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.810
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

690
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:55.480
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty sure.</v>

691
00:31:55.481 --> 00:31:59.890
<v Speaker 4>That was the first movie with sound also</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the first movie was sound,</v>

692
00:31:59.891 --> 00:32:00.724
<v Speaker 4>was racist as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you got to realize the first movie </v>

693
00:32:07.361 --> 00:32:08.194
<v Speaker 4>was sound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that probably 19 one slash seven </v>

694
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:12.370
<v Speaker 4>slash 27.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

695
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:17.520
<v Speaker 4>So that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that 60 years after slavery?</v>

696
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:21.303
<v Speaker 4>That's after it was abolished,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't even really done when it </v>

697
00:32:23.271 --> 00:32:24.530
<v Speaker 4>was abolished.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>

698
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.910
<v Speaker 4>But when was it done?</v>

699
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.680
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

700
00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.513
<v Speaker 4>Arguably it isn't with jails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean there was still Jesus teach </v>

701
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:32.303
<v Speaker 4>Jamie with deep were still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They weren't all slaves weren't </v>

702
00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.840
<v Speaker 4>immediately twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to them like</v>

703
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.903
<v Speaker 2>slaves weren't immediately released and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when the law passed didn't just say </v>

704
00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.620
<v Speaker 2>you're free because that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I meant was when I just like,</v>

705
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the date you're looking for</v>

706
00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:53.170
<v Speaker 2>like it happened gradually over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

707
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:55.850
<v Speaker 2>because of civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>civil war ended in 18,</v>

708
00:32:55.851 --> 00:32:58.850
<v Speaker 2>$75.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have did it ended at 65.</v>

709
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:04.070
<v Speaker 2>But the resolution to abolish slavery </v>
<v Speaker 2>was passed proclamation that was 65,</v>

710
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.963
<v Speaker 2>64,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the civil war ended just a </v>

711
00:33:09.711 --> 00:33:10.700
<v Speaker 2>couple years later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

712
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Space Proclamation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>January first 18,</v>

713
00:33:13.281 --> 00:33:14.720
<v Speaker 2>63,</v>
<v Speaker 2>63,</v>

714
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:19.310
<v Speaker 2>and then the war ended 1865.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's not that long.</v>

715
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Like 60 years later they're doing.</v>

716
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:27.230
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird.</v>

717
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.360
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird watching old movies.</v>

718
00:33:29.361 --> 00:33:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

719
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.890
<v Speaker 2>they'd go like the 19 twenties and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's.</v>

720
00:33:33.891 --> 00:33:34.711
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

721
00:33:34.711 --> 00:33:35.544
<v Speaker 2>I've watched King Kong with my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had them watch the original King Kong </v>

722
00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.290
<v Speaker 2>and there were we going to be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a few years back,</v>

723
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:47.320
<v Speaker 2>like when one was six and one was for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

724
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:48.141
<v Speaker 2>we're nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worse.</v>

725
00:33:48.141 --> 00:33:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Can I go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't be scared to.</v>

726
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.500
<v Speaker 2>It's not scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just trust me.</v>

727
00:33:51.501 --> 00:33:54.020
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna think it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were laughing.</v>

728
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:57.620
<v Speaker 2>They thought it was so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks so bad.</v>

729
00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:59.200
<v Speaker 2>It looks so Corny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

730
00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:03.950
<v Speaker 2>We're just cuddled up on the couch </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching King Kong looks so corny.</v>

731
00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:04.784
<v Speaker 2>Like the claymation or law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird that back then that was </v>

732
00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:10.814
<v Speaker 2>a horror movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people would go to the movie like </v>

733
00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:13.840
<v Speaker 2>that was terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

734
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:16.010
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go get a sandwich.</v>

735
00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:19.100
<v Speaker 2>My goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to order coffee for a penny.</v>

736
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I saw the new Halloween movie the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day that it was awesome.</v>

737
00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:27.330
<v Speaker 1>They actually did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made a great movie.</v>

738
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Great reboot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really awesome.</v>

739
00:34:29.911 --> 00:34:30.744
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever enjoyed any moment or </v>
<v Speaker 1>know anything about Michael Myers at </v>

740
00:34:33.931 --> 00:34:35.580
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievable.</v>

741
00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really Great.</v>

742
00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like modern day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make Jamie Lee curtis a bad ass.</v>

743
00:34:40.981 --> 00:34:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Like she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's her age.</v>

744
00:34:42.901 --> 00:34:45.060
<v Speaker 1>It's bothered her her whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every.</v>

745
00:34:45.061 --> 00:34:47.160
<v Speaker 1>All anyone wants to talk with her about </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that.</v>

746
00:34:47.161 --> 00:34:48.990
<v Speaker 1>So she like lifted weights and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She holds,</v>

747
00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:49.883
<v Speaker 1>she holds herself up and this big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She builds a compound with fences and </v>

748
00:34:53.671 --> 00:34:54.504
<v Speaker 1>everything in case he ever fucking comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and she teaches herself how to </v>

749
00:34:58.771 --> 00:35:02.220
<v Speaker 1>shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like real awesome dude.</v>

750
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.073
<v Speaker 1>You fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it the rest of the </v>

751
00:35:05.791 --> 00:35:07.620
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying that my wife just just,</v>

752
00:35:07.621 --> 00:35:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe how great that movie was</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she loved it too.</v>

753
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:13.150
<v Speaker 1>So it's like all around wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honest,</v>

754
00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.620
<v Speaker 1>rotten tomato say about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people are crazy.</v>

755
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't listen to any but any of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's opinions.</v>

756
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.810
<v Speaker 2>I went to a yelp review the other day </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

757
00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.673
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this restaurant that I really </v>

758
00:35:25.161 --> 00:35:29.450
<v Speaker 2>liked this near my house and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how it gets reviewed on Yelp.</v>

759
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.790
<v Speaker 2>And it was like all five stars except </v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

760
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.500
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one star,</v>

761
00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.890
<v Speaker 2>and it was like a crazy review or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman was,</v>

762
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.450
<v Speaker 2>she was yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was complaining.</v>

763
00:35:39.451 --> 00:35:40.284
<v Speaker 2>That tips that if you tip on a credit </v>
<v Speaker 2>card that they don't get it until the </v>

764
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.560
<v Speaker 2>end of the week and then it gets taxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

765
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.630
<v Speaker 2>is that how it always works or do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get it at night?</v>

766
00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.490
<v Speaker 2>They cash you out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the restaurant.</v>

767
00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I felt like that was probably common</v>

768
00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.213
<v Speaker 2>that some restaurants will give you with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your weekly check all your tips for </v>

769
00:36:02.701 --> 00:36:03.534
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Typical.</v>

770
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be if like they're pulling </v>

771
00:36:06.261 --> 00:36:07.094
<v Speaker 1>perhaps all the tips of the week </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and splitting it amongst </v>

772
00:36:10.101 --> 00:36:12.200
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which only a really,</v>

773
00:36:12.201 --> 00:36:14.420
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good restaurant with deal.</v>

774
00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.673
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems.</v>

775
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:18.920
<v Speaker 1>That seems like it doesn't encourage </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance though,</v>

776
00:36:18.921 --> 00:36:22.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that at that level of restaurants,</v>

777
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:24.260
<v Speaker 1>the performances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a given,</v>

778
00:36:24.261 --> 00:36:25.094
<v Speaker 1>like they're probably splitting vast </v>
<v Speaker 1>sums of money because it's a full blown </v>

779
00:36:27.801 --> 00:36:29.810
<v Speaker 1>machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a five star.</v>

780
00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.673
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse </v>

781
00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.733
<v Speaker 1>coming out of high school and I learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much everything there is to know </v>

782
00:36:38.181 --> 00:36:41.180
<v Speaker 1>that they make you memorize a stack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cards.</v>

783
00:36:41.181 --> 00:36:43.730
<v Speaker 1>You have to know everything and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing's a well oiled machine.</v>

784
00:36:43.731 --> 00:36:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I was a food runner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means that I had to make</v>

785
00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:50.330
<v Speaker 1>sure that everything going to the tables</v>
<v Speaker 1>was perfectly set up.</v>

786
00:36:50.331 --> 00:36:51.164
<v Speaker 1>Like [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no fixing it once it leaves the </v>

787
00:36:52.731 --> 00:36:53.330
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

788
00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:54.163
<v Speaker 1>So you're basically the final approver </v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything and the servers just </v>

789
00:36:57.771 --> 00:37:00.290
<v Speaker 1>waiting at the table or follows behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

790
00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.213
<v Speaker 1>You set the tray down and they do it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get 10 percent of all the servers </v>

791
00:37:04.791 --> 00:37:09.050
<v Speaker 1>tips on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes some nights if there's,</v>

792
00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:10.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

793
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:15.080
<v Speaker 1>say more than 10 to one food runner or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>servers to food runners,</v>

794
00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.780
<v Speaker 1>you could make more than even a server </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a ruth's Chris Steakhouse.</v>

795
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:20.600
<v Speaker 1>But each restaurant does it differently </v>
<v Speaker 1>and splits tips.</v>

796
00:37:20.601 --> 00:37:21.434
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they pull them that night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pulling the tips actually usually means </v>

797
00:37:24.501 --> 00:37:26.720
<v Speaker 1>that the service is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>

798
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:27.583
<v Speaker 1>Unless it's just a Janky restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they then they probably just do it </v>

799
00:37:30.621 --> 00:37:31.030
<v Speaker 1>normally.</v>

800
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Well this restaurant's very nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant.</v>

801
00:37:32.531 --> 00:37:33.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

802
00:37:33.221 --> 00:37:35.620
<v Speaker 2>I looked at this lady's a one star </v>
<v Speaker 2>review,</v>

803
00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:39.670
<v Speaker 2>like one star to five stars and I always</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a big smile on my face when I see a</v>

804
00:37:39.671 --> 00:37:40.504
<v Speaker 2>one star review because that means this </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch going to have a lot of one star </v>

805
00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:46.510
<v Speaker 2>reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to her page to page,</v>

806
00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.650
<v Speaker 2>it was all one star reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This fucking malcontent,</v>

807
00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:51.663
<v Speaker 2>this monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just going everywhere and </v>

808
00:37:53.111 --> 00:37:56.800
<v Speaker 2>complaining about everything from </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking nail salons to movie theaters.</v>

809
00:37:56.801 --> 00:37:57.634
<v Speaker 2>Like everything.</v>

810
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:58.503
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think trolls and know that </v>

811
00:38:00.131 --> 00:38:00.964
<v Speaker 1>anybody is just one click away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing from them being completely </v>

812
00:38:04.901 --> 00:38:06.820
<v Speaker 1>exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the same thing,</v>

813
00:38:06.821 --> 00:38:08.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on twitter or really anything,</v>

814
00:38:08.921 --> 00:38:11.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see someone say something crazy,</v>

815
00:38:11.261 --> 00:38:14.650
<v Speaker 1>you just click on their profile and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all crazy.</v>

816

<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

818
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:20.803
<v Speaker 2>after Roseanne was on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a bunch of people that tweeted at </v>

819
00:38:24.681 --> 00:38:29.681
<v Speaker 2>me with these wacky conspiracies like </v>
<v Speaker 2>wacky mind control conspiracies and what</v>

820
00:38:31.891 --> 00:38:34.940

<v Speaker 2>I'm not a professional,</v>

821
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>but if I had</v>

822
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:41.010
<v Speaker 3>to guess a wave of mentally ill people </v>
<v Speaker 3>were contacting me and I was,</v>

823
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:42.400
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this.</v>

824
00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:43.234
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people are out there that </v>

825
00:38:45.401 --> 00:38:46.234
<v Speaker 3>believe like the most nuttiest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>CIA based mind control experiments and </v>

826
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.620
<v Speaker 3>NSA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>listening to your conversations by </v>

828
00:38:57.941 --> 00:39:00.940
<v Speaker 3>listening to the vibrations off of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>window panes,</v>

829
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:03.220
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing.</v>

831
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:07.563
<v Speaker 3>Do you really think there's enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the world to be paying </v>

832
00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:12.550
<v Speaker 3>attention to all the people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world?</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's watching everybody.</v>

835
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.473
<v Speaker 3>There's not enough people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See like if you do something like say </v>

836
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:24.790
<v Speaker 3>Tony Hinchcliffe runs for President,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Why is Tony Hinchcliffe friend for </v>

839
00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:32.470
<v Speaker 3>president who's backing him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it George Soros who's looking out for</v>

840
00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:33.990
<v Speaker 3>Tony Hinchcliffe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know who's trying,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but the average person is like,</v>

843
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:41.440
<v Speaker 3>remembered that Mel Gibson movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theory,</v>

844
00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:42.453
<v Speaker 3>remember that he played a mentally ill </v>
<v Speaker 3>person who fell in love with Julia </v>

845
00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.003
<v Speaker 3>Roberts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like a hot mentally ill person </v>

846
00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.193
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just believed everything was a </v>

847
00:39:52.841 --> 00:39:55.570
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching the other day,</v>

848
00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:56.933
<v Speaker 3>like out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was on tv and I saw watched us for a </v>

849
00:39:58.601 --> 00:39:59.800
<v Speaker 3>little bit and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

850
00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.210
<v Speaker 3>fucking wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This movie,</v>

851
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:05.900
<v Speaker 1>people that have schizophrenia don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that their schizophrenia,</v>

852
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:07.003
<v Speaker 1>exact people with bipolar notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be aware that they're having </v>

853
00:40:10.731 --> 00:40:12.590
<v Speaker 1>an episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People OCD,</v>

855
00:40:17.271 --> 00:40:18.104
<v Speaker 1>Match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start hearing the voices become a </v>

856
00:40:20.001 --> 00:40:20.834
<v Speaker 1>normal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you think everybody can hear them </v>

857
00:40:22.821 --> 00:40:25.970
<v Speaker 1>and you're not really acknowledging them</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they become so natural.</v>

858
00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:31.350
<v Speaker 1>The schizophrenia person can be in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psych ward and say to their doctor,</v>

859
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:34.520

873
00:41:06.971 --> 00:41:09.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how we got there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we started off on this whole tangent</v>

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:42.100
<v Speaker 3>because Bert was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

933
00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:45.440
<v Speaker 3>it's because you're not insured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so your heart is always at 80 percent.</v>

934
00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:46.373
<v Speaker 3>No red in a week is in way better shape </v>
<v Speaker 3>that bird is in this whole life of </v>

935
00:43:51.021 --> 00:43:53.300
<v Speaker 3>working out and drinking vodka every </v>
<v Speaker 3>night compared to bird.</v>

936
00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.553
<v Speaker 3>But compared to burt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my point is he was my real </v>

937
00:43:57.111 --> 00:43:58.600
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very,</v>

938
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:01.880
<v Speaker 3>very much worried about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So up until,</v>

939
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:03.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two days ago,</v>

940
00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:07.700
<v Speaker 3>everything seemed to be going good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working out really hard and uh,</v>

941
00:44:07.701 --> 00:44:08.930
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was hard.</v>

942
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.900
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to do three hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's three and a half hours a day.</v>

943
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:14.570
<v Speaker 3>Two days in a row is three and a half </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours a day.</v>

944
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.153
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I started paying and he started </v>

945
00:44:17.841 --> 00:44:20.030
<v Speaker 3>coming out dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

946
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:22.010
<v Speaker 3>like iced tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

947
00:44:22.011 --> 00:44:23.840
<v Speaker 3>This sounds like a guy at a Porta </v>
<v Speaker 3>potties.</v>

948
00:44:23.841 --> 00:44:27.730
<v Speaker 3>Dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sweet tea.</v>

949
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:31.243
<v Speaker 3>Sweet tea.</v>

950
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:33.690
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does he say at the end?</v>

951
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless you.</v>

952
00:44:35.911 --> 00:44:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

953
00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:38.600
<v Speaker 3>For your sweet tea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was famished.</v>

954
00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't look good today.</v>

955
00:44:45.141 --> 00:44:47.590
<v Speaker 3>I had to go to something in my kid's </v>
<v Speaker 3>school list,</v>

956
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:51.440
<v Speaker 3>some Halloween thing and I had to go up </v>
<v Speaker 3>three flights of stairs,</v>

957
00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:54.230
<v Speaker 3>free long flights of stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to talk.</v>

958
00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.970
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I barely made it upstairs.</v>

959
00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.280
<v Speaker 3>I got to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was out of breath.</v>

960
00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.620
<v Speaker 3>My legs were shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

961
00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:02.870
<v Speaker 3>Three flights of stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

962
00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.800
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might have fucked up.</v>

963
00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was today.</v>

964
00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean?</v>

965
00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:14.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think my body's breaking down.</v>

966
00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:18.190
<v Speaker 3>I think I've got like serious muscle </v>
<v Speaker 3>breakdown to the point.</v>

967
00:45:18.191 --> 00:45:21.010
<v Speaker 3>Like my muscles are so sore that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

968
00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm ignoring that they're sore and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>though they're really,</v>

969
00:45:24.191 --> 00:45:25.024
<v Speaker 3>really sore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still doing like three hours of </v>

970
00:45:26.441 --> 00:45:29.020
<v Speaker 3>cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I limped up to the,</v>

971
00:45:29.021 --> 00:45:29.854
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the trail when I ran with my dog </v>

972
00:45:31.661 --> 00:45:32.494
<v Speaker 3>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I ran two miles and then after </v>

973
00:45:34.451 --> 00:45:35.284
<v Speaker 3>I ran two miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did an hour and a half on the </v>

974
00:45:37.091 --> 00:45:37.924
<v Speaker 3>elliptical machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then after I did an hour and a half </v>

975
00:45:39.581 --> 00:45:42.880
<v Speaker 3>on the elliptical machine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did 45 minutes of kicking the bag,</v>

976
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.863
<v Speaker 3>punching and kicking me.</v>

977
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:48.210
<v Speaker 1>I took two naps yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two separate maps.</v>

978
00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:49.323
<v Speaker 3>My point is argus taught me something by</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me about this high that you get </v>

979
00:45:54.521 --> 00:45:55.354
<v Speaker 3>from all this cardio and also kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking nonsense that I knew that there </v>

980
00:45:58.911 --> 00:46:00.340
<v Speaker 3>was like an endorphin high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't.</v>

981
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.193
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think it was a really specific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a very specific high that </v>

982
00:46:04.271 --> 00:46:05.104
<v Speaker 3>you get and it's like if you could take </v>
<v Speaker 3>a pill that puts you in the state of </v>

983
00:46:09.461 --> 00:46:11.770
<v Speaker 3>mind that I am when I work out this </v>
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>

984
00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:12.903
<v Speaker 3>everybody would take it in the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be a better place because you </v>

985
00:46:14.711 --> 00:46:15.730
<v Speaker 3>don't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

986
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:17.303
<v Speaker 3>You don't give a fuck about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not they don't care about people </v>

987
00:46:19.481 --> 00:46:21.250
<v Speaker 3>and friends and loved ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no.</v>

988
00:46:21.251 --> 00:46:23.950
<v Speaker 3>Anxiety is no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the chatter,</v>

989
00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.370
<v Speaker 3>all the negative chatter that you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any brand that you have to like push off</v>

990
00:46:27.371 --> 00:46:29.890
<v Speaker 3>and ignore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's shuts off.</v>

991
00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:30.773
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gone.</v>

992
00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:31.633
<v Speaker 3>Nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wonder how much of that is there </v>

993
00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:35.373
<v Speaker 3>because your brain is almost trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>create problems and conflict because </v>

994
00:46:40.271 --> 00:46:41.104
<v Speaker 3>you're not getting enough exercise </v>
<v Speaker 3>because your body supposed to get a </v>

995
00:46:43.721 --> 00:46:45.040
<v Speaker 3>specific amount of exercise.</v>

996
00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.193
<v Speaker 1>My dog is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like eight months old or </v>

997
00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:52.020
<v Speaker 1>something now and I've learned a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>from having this dog this time.</v>

998
00:46:52.021 --> 00:46:52.854
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't notice a lot of stuff with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other dogs that I've raised in the </v>

999
00:46:55.501 --> 00:46:56.334
<v Speaker 1>past because in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because with this one it's very clear </v>

1000
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.383
<v Speaker 1>and I mean they're all that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't work it out you don't </v>

1001
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.960
<v Speaker 1>take it and exercise it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's crazy.</v>

1002
00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:07.933
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she can be a nut and she shows you by </v>

1003
00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.920
<v Speaker 1>being weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily destroying stuff,</v>

1004
00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:15.413
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the being weird little things by </v>

1005
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.540
<v Speaker 1>nibbling at your finger different way </v>
<v Speaker 1>with just her little front teeth.</v>

1006
00:47:21.541 --> 00:47:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Like sorta like telling you something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1007
00:47:23.671 --> 00:47:24.504
<v Speaker 1>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to fuck and get some exercise in </v>

1008
00:47:26.851 --> 00:47:29.380
<v Speaker 1>and we're all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're where we are that same way.</v>

1009
00:47:29.381 --> 00:47:34.381
<v Speaker 1>So our brain is going to make more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex ways for us to be freaked out.</v>

1010
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Basically run for our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1011
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Like if I don't just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean again,</v>

1012
00:47:39.071 --> 00:47:44.071
<v Speaker 1>I barely do cardio but I do do it pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently,</v>

1013
00:47:44.081 --> 00:47:46.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a mile or two.</v>

1014
00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.090
<v Speaker 1>That's all you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real.</v>

1015
00:47:47.091 --> 00:47:47.924
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1016
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:48.763
<v Speaker 1>And it cleanses the palate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like ginger between Sushi slices </v>

1017
00:47:52.001 --> 00:47:54.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I go without it,</v>

1018
00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:55.923
<v Speaker 1>absolutely it compiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll wake up bitter and angry about </v>

1019
00:47:58.841 --> 00:48:01.360
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll see something on you know somewhere</v>

1020
00:48:01.361 --> 00:48:05.650
<v Speaker 1>something or you're workwise and stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>out about it and like why?</v>

1021
00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh well this and that and stuff</v>

1022
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.680
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make any sense at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:48:09.681 --> 00:48:11.400
<v Speaker 2>And if you were in a good state of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

1024
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who gives a fuck?</v>

1025
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But instead you dwell on it.</v>

1026
00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your brain's like trying to come up </v>

1027
00:48:15.981 --> 00:48:17.150
<v Speaker 2>with problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1028
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.513
<v Speaker 2>because he wants us to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dog Marshall's like that hardcore </v>

1029
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:22.483
<v Speaker 2>because Marshall's and shape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he runs miles with me all the </v>

1030
00:48:25.401 --> 00:48:28.580
<v Speaker 2>time so that dog's ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like we're running,</v>

1031
00:48:28.581 --> 00:48:29.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're running today.</v>

1032
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:30.111
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1033
00:48:30.111 --> 00:48:31.050
<v Speaker 2>not today dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to work.</v>

1034
00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Fuck am I gonna do with myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1035
00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:35.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll just start chewing socks and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1036
00:48:35.731 --> 00:48:37.520
<v Speaker 2>doing things that he's not supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1037
00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.010
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1038
00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:44.660
<v Speaker 2>he's just a ball of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lease he doesn't have like anxiety</v>

1039
00:48:44.661 --> 00:48:45.494
<v Speaker 2>and negative chatter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The complex human mind when it doesn't </v>

1040
00:48:47.541 --> 00:48:48.374
<v Speaker 2>have enough energy output,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always think of the brain is almost </v>

1041
00:48:50.331 --> 00:48:51.164
<v Speaker 2>like a battery that has a lid on it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like energy is flowing out of the </v>

1042
00:48:54.861 --> 00:48:55.694
<v Speaker 2>battery and spilling over the sides and </v>
<v Speaker 2>causing a mess because you gotta expand </v>

1043
00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:03.290
<v Speaker 2>or expand a certain amount of energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>every day in order to keep it clean,</v>

1044
00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:04.400
<v Speaker 2>just to keep everything going.</v>

1045
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1046
00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.500
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel fucking great other than the fact</v>

1047
00:49:07.501 --> 00:49:08.360
<v Speaker 2>that I can't walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1048
00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:10.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just.</v>

1049
00:49:10.671 --> 00:49:12.770
<v Speaker 2>I went too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too hard,</v>

1050
00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:13.933
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to get so far ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My goal was to get so far ahead that no </v>

1051
00:49:18.111 --> 00:49:22.010
<v Speaker 2>one could catch up was like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could do these big days.</v>

1052
00:49:22.011 --> 00:49:22.844
<v Speaker 2>Every now and then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard to do a big day and then </v>

1053
00:49:25.641 --> 00:49:27.590
<v Speaker 2>do another big day and then do another </v>
<v Speaker 2>big day.</v>

1054
00:49:27.591 --> 00:49:30.370
<v Speaker 2>That's what's hard and that's where I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>get them.</v>

1055
00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:33.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll get them in the like the like when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you wake up you're like,</v>

1056
00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:35.980
<v Speaker 2>not today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the day you got to go.</v>

1057
00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:40.150
<v Speaker 2>That's like I'd wanted to put some </v>
<v Speaker 2>distance between them.</v>

1058
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:43.240
<v Speaker 2>So what I did was I did one day where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did six hours.</v>

1059
00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:46.840
<v Speaker 2>I did five hours in the morning and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually five and a half.</v>

1060
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Then I did another hour at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was basically six and a half hours</v>

1061
00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.600
<v Speaker 2>and I got a thousand points for the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>

1062
00:49:52.601 --> 00:49:55.570
<v Speaker 2>what the thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>35 actually</v>

1063
00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.633
<v Speaker 1>guarantee you that when Marin was </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing those voices during that </v>

1064
00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Kennison time that he wasn't working </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1065
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.553
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't work it out now and I think </v>

1066
00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.473
<v Speaker 1>it's easy for a comedian and not work </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and then when you factor that in </v>

1067
00:50:09.441 --> 00:50:14.280
<v Speaker 1>that it's not a normal job and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>go from your bed to your car,</v>

1068
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.190
<v Speaker 1>to the venue to sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At a table to wait till you go onstage,</v>

1069
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:21.630
<v Speaker 1>then you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stand up.</v>

1070
00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that had anything to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

1071
00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:25.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it was cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did so much cocaine.</v>

1072
00:50:25.991 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 2>They were up for days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

1073
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.070
<v Speaker 3>He broke his brain and physically not </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing anything right.</v>

1074
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.963
<v Speaker 3>That too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean I think the big factor was </v>

1075
00:50:33.741 --> 00:50:37.690
<v Speaker 3>the cocaine doing cocaine with Kennison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he just popped a fuse.</v>

1076
00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:43.250
<v Speaker 3>You imagine fucking up for days and days</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kinases like where's the blood?</v>

1077
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Where's the blood?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

1078
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:47.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm only 22,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1079
00:50:47.121 --> 00:50:49.040
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a future.</v>

1080
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:51.000
<v Speaker 3>I have a life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

1081
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.190
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1082
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:53.023
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that he kennison and </v>

1083
00:50:55.011 --> 00:50:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Roseanne have something really serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>in common.</v>

1084
00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.513
<v Speaker 3>They were both hit by cars when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>very young and their personality </v>

1085
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.770
<v Speaker 3>radically changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1086
00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:05.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1087
00:51:05.121 --> 00:51:08.450
<v Speaker 3>And that was one of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>really wanted to cover with Rosanne when</v>

1088
00:51:08.451 --> 00:51:09.284
<v Speaker 3>I had her on the podcast because all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people were calling her a racist </v>

1089
00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:12.134
<v Speaker 3>and all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this and that and all these </v>

1090
00:51:13.641 --> 00:51:14.000
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>

1091
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:14.833
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1092
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:17.480
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1093
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.190
<v Speaker 3>one of the greatest standup comics of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all time.</v>

1094
00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.150
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second,</v>

1095
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:22.303
<v Speaker 3>mentally ill and talks about it openly </v>
<v Speaker 3>and is very honest about her troubles </v>

1096
00:51:26.361 --> 00:51:27.194
<v Speaker 3>and what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was committed to a mental </v>

1097
00:51:28.101 --> 00:51:30.470
<v Speaker 3>institution for nine months after this </v>
<v Speaker 3>car accident.</v>

1098
00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean she was hitting the fucking head </v>
<v Speaker 3>by a car.</v>

1099
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:36.980
<v Speaker 3>The car was driving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sunlight was in her face.</v>

1100
00:51:36.981 --> 00:51:39.240
<v Speaker 3>She couldn't see clip during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intersection,</v>

1101
00:51:39.241 --> 00:51:40.074
<v Speaker 3>sent her flying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was in intensive care for a long </v>

1102
00:51:44.121 --> 00:51:44.954
<v Speaker 3>fucking time in a coma for a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking time payment out of it was </v>

1103
00:51:48.111 --> 00:51:50.420
<v Speaker 3>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't concentrate in school,</v>

1104
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:53.510
<v Speaker 3>and then he committed her to a mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>institution for nine months.</v>

1105
00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Could lead name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a long time.</v>

1106
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hood ornament spiked her fucking </v>

1107
00:51:59.271 --> 00:52:01.070
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1108
00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:02.413
<v Speaker 3>So when people are talking about her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this is all something that she </v>

1109
00:52:05.001 --> 00:52:06.860
<v Speaker 3>planned out because she's an evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

1110
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:10.850
<v Speaker 3>That's like saying to a person who has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>broken leg,</v>

1111
00:52:10.851 --> 00:52:12.500
<v Speaker 3>why you limping?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1112
00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:13.423
<v Speaker 3>It's really like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the reasons why she was so </v>

1113
00:52:16.701 --> 00:52:17.534
<v Speaker 3>brilliant as a comedian other than she </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked hard and she writes and she just </v>

1114
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:22.903
<v Speaker 3>got a great mind for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons was she truly was </v>

1115
00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:28.383
<v Speaker 3>like incredibly impulsive and insane and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what allowed her to say things </v>

1116
00:52:34.791 --> 00:52:37.340
<v Speaker 3>that other people wouldn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially back then.</v>

1117
00:52:37.341 --> 00:52:38.174
<v Speaker 3>Like people have to realize when </v>
<v Speaker 3>Roseanne Barr was huge and she was huge </v>

1118
00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:44.930
<v Speaker 3>before I ever did comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was huge.</v>

1119
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:47.480
<v Speaker 3>When she was huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no women like her.</v>

1120
00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.090
<v Speaker 3>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was fat.</v>

1121
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.980
<v Speaker 3>She didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would go onstage.</v>

1122
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.970
<v Speaker 3>You should talk mad shit would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>hilarious.</v>

1123
00:52:55.971 --> 00:52:58.550
<v Speaker 3>She would kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would kill dude.</v>

1124
00:52:58.970 --> 00:52:59.803
<v Speaker 3>I remember watching her kill like on Hbo</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was like probably like 18 or </v>

1125
00:53:04.041 --> 00:53:04.874
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1126
00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:08.850
<v Speaker 1>He's want to Mitsis true like success </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

1127
00:53:08.851 --> 00:53:10.350

<v Speaker 1>Did you guys talk about that?</v>

1128
00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:11.333
<v Speaker 1>Her being on in the main room and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>being on like Carson weeks later she </v>

1129
00:53:14.971 --> 00:53:18.960
<v Speaker 1>booked Carson and one of her posts about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the first time we might not have.</v>

1130
00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to remember these.</v>

1131
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:21.263
<v Speaker 1>A comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for comedy store fans and </v>

1132
00:53:24.211 --> 00:53:27.210
<v Speaker 1>historians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like an anomaly because I'm pretty</v>

1133
00:53:27.211 --> 00:53:31.770
<v Speaker 1>sure her first ever spot as a paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular was in the main room,</v>

1134
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:32.633
<v Speaker 1>which was a big deal at the time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that spot she got the tonight show </v>

1135
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.333
<v Speaker 1>like a week or two later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she got booked from her first paid </v>

1136
00:53:40.831 --> 00:53:44.580
<v Speaker 1>regular spot to the tonight show from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tonight show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>overnight success.</v>

1138
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:49.920
<v Speaker 1>So it all went like bing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bing.</v>

1139
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:50.993
<v Speaker 1>Burl.</v>

1140
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one thing that you talked about the</v>

1141
00:53:52.981 --> 00:53:54.190
<v Speaker 3>first time she did the POC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jasper,</v>

1142
00:53:54.191 --> 00:53:55.860
<v Speaker 3>that she lost her mind when all that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

1143
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:57.160
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1144
00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.130
<v Speaker 3>I went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost my mind.</v>

1145
00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:05.250
<v Speaker 3>That kind of pressure to go from being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>housewife and Denver until like a couple</v>

1146
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:09.030
<v Speaker 3>of years later being one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>stars in the world like that.</v>

1147
00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:10.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1148

1149
00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would drive anybody crazy.</v>

1150
00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.033
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing's crazy because also </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for it's crazy and working </v>

00:54:23.681 --> 00:54:26.410
<v Speaker 1>so to get it all at once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems crazier than anything because</v>

1153
00:54:26.411 --> 00:54:27.370
<v Speaker 1>then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>What am I going to do?</v>

1155
00:54:29.471 --> 00:54:31.450
<v Speaker 1>At least most of the time in show </v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

1161
00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:41.590
<v Speaker 3>Or you do all those years and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're an oversight overnight.</v>

1162
00:54:41.591 --> 00:54:43.060
<v Speaker 3>Success like Tiffany Haddish,</v>

<v Speaker 3>years for Roseanne.</v>

1167
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:55.833
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that bothered me most about </v>

1168
00:54:56.891 --> 00:55:01.060
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff was how quickly everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to just cancel her,</v>

1169
00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:04.630
<v Speaker 3>get rid of her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like stop her from working ever again.</v>

1170
00:55:04.631 --> 00:55:08.800
<v Speaker 3>Do I don't want to hear her side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no room for explanation.</v>

1171
00:55:08.801 --> 00:55:12.280
<v Speaker 3>There's no room for discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no room for this.</v>

1172
00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:13.240
<v Speaker 3>Just get rid of her.</v>

1173
00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.740
<v Speaker 1>We went from wanting to see people </v>
<v Speaker 1>become stars.</v>

1175
00:55:19.921 --> 00:55:23.220
<v Speaker 1>people's dreams get destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the new obsession.</v>

1176
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:27.000
<v Speaker 1>The new thing is we've seen people make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1177
00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Let's watch the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get crushed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>its own thing,</v>

1184
00:55:38.911 --> 00:55:43.911
<v Speaker 1>but like trying to like destroy people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are artists is,</v>

1185
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:46.600

<v Speaker 3>they're happy because then that person </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to be a regular person again or even</v>

<v Speaker 3>But because he was famous being security</v>

1208
00:56:36.041 --> 00:56:36.874
<v Speaker 3>cards a joke and he's a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was joy in glee and this guy </v>

1209

1214
00:56:59.591 --> 00:57:01.720
<v Speaker 3>fact that he was a security guard now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

1216
00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:03.473
<v Speaker 3>There's a weird tendency that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to wait to watch people that they </v>

1217
00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:09.880
<v Speaker 3>think had it better than them fall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1223
00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:18.473
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently Tyler Perry gave that guy a </v>

1224
00:57:19.561 --> 00:57:21.570
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1230
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:34.690
<v Speaker 3>I love the fact that guys hustling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's out there working.</v>

1231
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.310
<v Speaker 3>There's no shame in working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1232
00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:39.430
<v Speaker 3>The fact that people are so obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that,</v>

1233
00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:40.293
<v Speaker 3>that there is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a shame in it is a shame and </v>

1234
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:45.670
<v Speaker 3>just having a job and working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange.</v>

1235
00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:48.820
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange how people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>attached to that.</v>

1236
00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:50.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they,</v>

1237
00:57:50.361 --> 00:57:51.194
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1238
00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:55.030
<v Speaker 3>they immediately think that this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to mock and make fun of.</v>

1239
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:55.990
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1240
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.823
<v Speaker 3>it was almost universal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many people were doing stories on </v>

1241
00:57:58.331 --> 00:58:01.180
<v Speaker 3>that guy bagging groceries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1242
00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:04.070
<v Speaker 1>It's the age we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1243
00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:07.610
<v Speaker 1>People want to see people break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anybody's doing anything,</v>

1244
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:09.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just waiting.</v>

1245
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:11.950
<v Speaker 1>May people are so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look if,</v>

1246
00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:16.370
<v Speaker 1>if Megan Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we didn't know what her contract was,</v>

1247
00:58:16.371 --> 00:58:17.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was just some,</v>

1248
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:18.583
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say we did know and let's say she </v>

1249
00:58:19.881 --> 00:58:22.970
<v Speaker 1>was getting paid barely what we would </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever guess,</v>

1250
00:58:22.971 --> 00:58:24.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say she's getting paid,</v>

1251
00:58:24.351 --> 00:58:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>

1252
00:58:25.881 --> 00:58:30.410
<v Speaker 1>dollars a year at her new job at NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd probably still have the jobs.</v>

1253
00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the whole crazy part is that</v>

1254
00:58:32.871 --> 00:58:37.640
<v Speaker 1>we all know she got paid $68,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>for three years.</v>

1255
00:58:37.641 --> 00:58:39.500
<v Speaker 1>For what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1256
00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:41.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like analyze and get.</v>

1257
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.790
<v Speaker 1>You know what people are watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what'd she just say about Halloween</v>

1258
00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.870
<v Speaker 1>costume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1259
00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.550
<v Speaker 1>We got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got her.</v>

1260
00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever hear it?</v>

1261
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Play it Meghan.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1264
00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:01.050
<v Speaker 1>apologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was hilarious.</v>

1265
00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:02.093
<v Speaker 3>This woman said that some woman from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia said that it seems like a </v>

1266
00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:05.874
<v Speaker 3>hostage video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that's missing is her </v>

1267
00:59:06.991 --> 00:59:08.700
<v Speaker 3>holding up a newspaper with a date on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1268
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:15.950
<v Speaker 3>I retweeted La is soda and then somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>else said if there's one of the.</v>

1269
00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.920
<v Speaker 3>One of the things about it that's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>strange is how insincere seems like</v>

1270
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.060
<v Speaker 4>forced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some of forrester.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He apologized for it.</v>

1273
00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:30.320
<v Speaker 4>Now I haven't seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the Brits forget the apology.</v>

1274
00:59:30.321 --> 00:59:32.060
<v Speaker 4>Let's play the actual video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually I remember,</v>

1275
00:59:32.061 --> 00:59:33.500
<v Speaker 4>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's two comments.</v>

1276
00:59:33.501 --> 00:59:35.650
<v Speaker 4>She makes one and then they come back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

1277
00:59:35.651 --> 00:59:38.000
<v Speaker 4>I think the second comment I think was </v>
<v Speaker 4>the real issue.</v>

1278
00:59:38.001 --> 00:59:39.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the first comment?</v>

1279
00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:42.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember.</v>

1280
00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:45.600
<v Speaker 7>So there was a controversy on the real </v>
<v Speaker 7>housewives of New York with Luanne.</v>

1281
00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:50.300
<v Speaker 7>If she dresses Diana Ross and she made </v>
<v Speaker 7>her skin look darker than it really is,</v>

1282
00:59:50.301 --> 00:59:53.120
<v Speaker 7>and people said that that was racist and</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

1283
00:59:53.121 --> 00:59:55.280
<v Speaker 7>I felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who doesn't love Diana Ross?</v>

1284
00:59:55.281 --> 00:59:56.114
<v Speaker 7>She wants to look like Diana Ross for </v>
<v Speaker 7>one day and I don't know how that got </v>

1285
00:59:59.331 --> 01:00:00.350
<v Speaker 7>racist on Halloween.</v>

1286
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:05.630
<v Speaker 4>It appeared to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See that's the first one is it?</v>

1287
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:09.980
<v Speaker 4>But it's weird when you watch it now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>

1288
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:11.083
<v Speaker 4>this is her demise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're watching the stumble when </v>

1289
01:00:14.451 --> 01:00:17.390
<v Speaker 4>she trips off the rock and falls off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cliff.</v>

1290
01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:20.720
<v Speaker 4>This is the stumble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I don't get it.</v>

1291
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.590
<v Speaker 4>How is that racist to want to be Diana </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ross then play it again?</v>

1292
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:26.503
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Halloween,</v>

1293
01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.960
<v Speaker 7>like I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was okay.</v>

1294
01:00:28.961 --> 01:00:30.810
<v Speaker 7>As long as you were dressing up as </v>
<v Speaker 7>characters</v>

1295
01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:35.730
<v Speaker 4>and that was just some guys commentary </v>
<v Speaker 4>from Wall Street Journal that was a wrap</v>

1296
01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:40.200
<v Speaker 4>and also have my favorite one of hers </v>
<v Speaker 4>that she ever said.</v>

1297
01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.770
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My favorite one of hers that she.</v>

1298
01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:44.243
<v Speaker 4>We're good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1299
01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:45.263
<v Speaker 4>My favorite one of her she ever said was</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were doing this thing on Fox News </v>

1300
01:00:48.661 --> 01:00:52.020
<v Speaker 4>about Santa Claus and someone had </v>
<v Speaker 4>something about Santa Claus being black.</v>

1301
01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:56.040
<v Speaker 4>They did something about Santa Claus </v>
<v Speaker 4>being black and she just went,</v>

1302
01:00:56.180 --> 01:01:00.720
<v Speaker 4>oh well Santa Claus is definitely white,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she was like,</v>

1303
01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:03.870
<v Speaker 4>I think she sent it to kids like kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Santa Claus is definitely right.</v>

1304
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:05.063
<v Speaker 4>Or kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Santa Claus is real and he's definitely </v>

1305
01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:10.470
<v Speaker 4>white.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget what the exact terminology was,</v>

1306
01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:11.723
<v Speaker 4>but she basically said Santa clauses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely white like Santa Claus in </v>

1307
01:01:14.241 --> 01:01:15.940
<v Speaker 4>fucking real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1308
01:01:15.941 --> 01:01:17.640
<v Speaker 4>That's like saying Spiderman is </v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely white.</v>

1309
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:20.220
<v Speaker 4>She didn't get fired from Fox for saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1310
01:01:20.221 --> 01:01:22.970
<v Speaker 4>She probably got a raise for saying that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they licked her toes.</v>

1311
01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:24.840
<v Speaker 4>Whole different thing at Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1312
01:01:24.841 --> 01:01:26.520
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they don't want to know.</v>

1313
01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:28.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She wanted to go back.</v>

1314
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:28.770
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1315
01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:30.570
<v Speaker 4>we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1316
01:01:30.571 --> 01:01:31.404
<v Speaker 4>they want him to take her back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing is you can't go from being an </v>

1317
01:01:34.051 --> 01:01:39.051
<v Speaker 4>ice princess and the conservative right </v>
<v Speaker 4>wing channel to being like Oprah would.</v>

1318
01:01:40.031 --> 01:01:41.910
<v Speaker 4>She's trying to be like Oprah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1319
01:01:41.970 --> 01:01:42.803
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll never really get what MBC was </v>

1320
01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:46.370
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're thinking Shewchuk.</v>

1321
01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.470
<v Speaker 4>He was just going to come over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what they thought.</v>

1322
01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:56.880
<v Speaker 4>They thought she has a giant fan base,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she had a fan base for sure.</v>

1323
01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:58.650
<v Speaker 4>Some came over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she,</v>

1324
01:01:58.651 --> 01:02:03.010
<v Speaker 4>a lot of her fan base was because she </v>
<v Speaker 4>was the beautiful conservative woman who</v>

1325
01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.340
<v Speaker 4>was a very tough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very articulate,</v>

1326
01:02:05.341 --> 01:02:07.350
<v Speaker 4>very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1327
01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:08.243
<v Speaker 4>and they liked that she was an ice </v>
<v Speaker 4>princess and she would shut people down </v>

1328
01:02:11.441 --> 01:02:14.250
<v Speaker 4>if they're incorrect and she wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>let people talk over her.</v>

1329
01:02:14.251 --> 01:02:16.890
<v Speaker 4>She was powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kind of frightening in a hot way.</v>

1330
01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fox News</v>

1331
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>has a bunch of those checks just </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting,</v>

1332
01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>waiting in the helm</v>

1333
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:28.020
<v Speaker 4>like that closet x market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now when the dude opens it up and sees,</v>

1334
01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:30.690

<v Speaker 4>faces,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just teleprompters ready to roll.</v>

1336
01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:37.873
<v Speaker 1>Big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big letters that they can read it </v>

1337
01:02:39.141 --> 01:02:39.740
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>

1338

<v Speaker 1>potty.</v>

1345
01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.270
<v Speaker 4>Dare you see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could get fired for that.</v>

1346
01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:00.343
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if you were on a show and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>said that that would be the end like </v>

1347
01:03:03.141 --> 01:03:05.390
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a beautiful thing about podcast.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it has zero consequences.</v>

1349
01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:10.970
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

1350
01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:11.803
<v Speaker 4>let's pretend that you were on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tonight show and you were a guest and </v>

1351

<v Speaker 4>That one was just trying to go to the </v>

1354
01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:28.630
<v Speaker 4>restroom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think that's funny?</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening.</v>

1356
01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:31.423
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed it a little bit and stand </v>

1357
01:03:33.741 --> 01:03:34.574
<v Speaker 1>up lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a couple of these road </v>

1358
01:03:36.051 --> 01:03:36.884
<v Speaker 1>trips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did something that you told me not to </v>

1359
01:03:38.301 --> 01:03:39.170
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan.</v>

1360
01:03:39.171 --> 01:03:40.004
<v Speaker 1>You ready for this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You told me not to do it years ago when </v>

1361
01:03:42.021 --> 01:03:42.854
<v Speaker 1>I did it and it was rough and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>performed stand up comedy in </v>

1362
01:03:47.511 --> 01:03:48.344
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut.</v>

1363
01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:51.990
<v Speaker 4>Is that right?</v>

1364
01:03:52.070 --> 01:03:53.300

<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy.</v>

1366
01:03:58.850 --> 01:03:59.683
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I noticed this really cool old guy </v>

1367
01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:06.860
<v Speaker 1>stood out in the front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the audience.</v>

1368
01:04:06.861 --> 01:04:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>older lady almost like almost like Dana </v>

<v Speaker 1>She doesn't want to be here at all.</v>

<v Speaker 1>not just not having fun.</v>

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:44.240
<v Speaker 1>She hated me.</v>

1381
01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:47.420
<v Speaker 1>It could have been something that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about early on.</v>

1382
01:04:47.421 --> 01:04:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was like a.</v>

<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] going off on the girl.</v>

<v Speaker 1>my fans are loving it and they're the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that stumbled into the wrong scene </v>

1408
01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:14.163
<v Speaker 1>over the wrong show at the wrong time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they were looking for Christian </v>

1409
01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:19.960
<v Speaker 1>puppet comedy or whatever,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you think you're gonna change something </v>

1415
01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:39.580
<v Speaker 1>or you're going to do something to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

1416
01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.340
<v Speaker 1>That's what I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Vibe I get from you.</v>

1417
01:06:42.490 --> 01:06:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I literally made the jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowds loving it by the way.</v>

1418
01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:46.083
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they can tell like it's not </v>

1419
01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.700
<v Speaker 1>anything to you or is she just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was wondering.</v>

1420
01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>There was one part where I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go Mike,</v>

1421
01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.250
<v Speaker 1>because my goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that,</v>

1422
01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.940
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I ignored them for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>while was because I go,</v>

1423
01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:01.090
<v Speaker 1>you seem like a tough lady to the mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1424
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:02.260
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you seem tough,</v>

1425
01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:05.860
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to break you at some point</v>
<v Speaker 1>during this set and when I do,</v>

1426
01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make sure this whole room </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows.</v>

1427
01:07:07.811 --> 01:07:08.644
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say I gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not going to tell you when it's </v>

1428
01:07:11.021 --> 01:07:14.080
<v Speaker 1>gonna happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to make you laugh anyway.</v>

1429
01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:14.943
<v Speaker 1>Forty five minutes later I get to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point to where I had in my mind set up </v>

1430
01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:20.374
<v Speaker 1>that there's no way she's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh at this and sure enough I got a </v>

1431
01:07:23.261 --> 01:07:24.910
<v Speaker 1>big smile out of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1432
01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't say what the joke is.</v>

1433
01:07:27.671 --> 01:07:28.504
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give anything away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got the smile and I'm literally </v>

1434
01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:31.714
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the whole crowd's already laughing </v>

1435
01:07:33.371 --> 01:07:34.204
<v Speaker 1>and they can tell that I'm looking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch to see if the lady breaks and she </v>

1436
01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:39.220
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

1437
01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:42.120
<v Speaker 1>how in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was gonna get ya.</v>

1438
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:44.830
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was gonna get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>

1439
01:07:44.831 --> 01:07:47.770
<v Speaker 1>How is it possible that you don't laugh </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that?</v>

1440
01:07:47.771 --> 01:07:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you do for Fun Lady?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like at this point I'm just all amped up</v>

1441
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:55.990
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would I have to do to possibly make</v>

1442
01:07:55.991 --> 01:07:56.770
<v Speaker 1>you laugh?</v>

1443
01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:59.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's finally when the angry </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter goes,</v>

1444
01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:01.570
<v Speaker 1>be funny.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that everywhere,</v>

1479
01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:40.080
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about Connecticut </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's no real cities.</v>

1480
01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:41.513
<v Speaker 2>You've got Hartford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a land of despair and you've </v>

1481
01:09:43.431 --> 01:09:44.264

<v Speaker 2>just a highway between Boston and New </v>

1482
01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:50.520
<v Speaker 2>York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all it is the Boston's great.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the scientists from Mit who's on here </v>

<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He brought it up as a joke.</v>

1488
01:10:03.181 --> 01:10:04.014
<v Speaker 2>What did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember what he said something </v>

01:10:06.031 --> 01:10:08.160
<v Speaker 2>about like he just wanted you to shit on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1490
01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:13.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember exactly what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did so many gigs in Connecticut,</v>

1491
01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:17.190
<v Speaker 2>so many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many because I lived in Boston and it</v>

1492
01:10:17.191 --> 01:10:19.800
<v Speaker 2>was like an hour and a half drive to our</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive.</v>

1493
01:10:19.801 --> 01:10:22.340
<v Speaker 2>You're in Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did a lot of gigs there.</v>

1494
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:23.183
<v Speaker 2>Greg Fitzsimmons and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did a shit ton of gigs in </v>

1495
01:10:24.901 --> 01:10:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd always leave going.</v>

1496
01:10:26.551 --> 01:10:29.310
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck was that?</v>

1497
01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:31.750
<v Speaker 1>It was felt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It felt dirty.</v>

1498
01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a Gig I did purely for the money.</v>

1499
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are good and my good friend</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tommy Junior lives in Connecticut.</v>

1500
01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:41.520
<v Speaker 2>There's good people in Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sun All bad,</v>

1501
01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:44.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's disproportionately bad.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's what happens when you have a bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

1694
01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.113
<v Speaker 3>A light bulb appears</v>

1695
01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:51.540
<v Speaker 9>in your ass instead of over your head.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They just get too comfortable with it</v>

1704
01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.160
<v Speaker 1>and you have to save them no matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>

1705
01:20:32.161 --> 01:20:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I was reading last night about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1706
01:20:33.991 --> 01:20:34.824
<v Speaker 1>about the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish doctor who had the shooter of </v>

1707
01:20:38.731 --> 01:20:41.490
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the temple in Pittsburgh.</v>

1708
01:20:41.730 --> 01:20:45.720
<v Speaker 1>He had to save his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to like make sure that he's okay.</v>

1709
01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:46.703
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you're just helping horrible </v>

1710
01:20:48.841 --> 01:20:52.620
<v Speaker 1>human beings that just slaughtered some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your own people.</v>

1711
01:20:53.670 --> 01:20:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Now you're a Jewish doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happened to fix the guy.</v>

1712
01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Now in our World Tarantino world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we like to think that,</v>

1713
01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:01.050
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1714
01:21:01.051 --> 01:21:03.060
<v Speaker 1>so sorry to accidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1715
01:21:03.061 --> 01:21:05.850
<v Speaker 1>it appears as if though I haven't given </v>
<v Speaker 1>you the right medicine.</v>

1716
01:21:05.851 --> 01:21:06.684
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in real life they have to just </v>

1717
01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:09.960
<v Speaker 1>stitch them up and</v>

1718
01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:11.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1719
01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:12.593
<v Speaker 3>it also mean that guy probably has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>record is in terms of what is success </v>

1720
01:21:16.801 --> 01:21:17.634
<v Speaker 3>ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't want to fuck it up for some </v>

<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>

1722
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:22.963
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like being a doctor would be </v>

1723
01:21:26.011 --> 01:21:27.180
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard.</v>

1724
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:28.103
<v Speaker 1>Like as a mentally it seems like racking</v>
<v Speaker 1>up those losses and such a lack of </v>

1725
01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:34.860
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The human body,</v>

01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:48.571
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1734
01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:51.750
<v Speaker 3>this is a bunch of female emt workers </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they work with.</v>

1735
01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:52.853
<v Speaker 3>They're just bang everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously it's not every emt female </v>

1737
01:22:00.961 --> 01:22:01.794
<v Speaker 3>limited polling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my thought on it is to you imagine </v>

1738
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:09.210
<v Speaker 3>how fleeting you would feel that life </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1739
01:22:09.211 --> 01:22:10.044
<v Speaker 3>If every day you're seeing people die </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday you're dealing with car </v>

1740
01:22:12.211 --> 01:22:13.100
<v Speaker 3>accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're showing up.</v>

1741
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:14.880
<v Speaker 3>People's brains are splattered all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the highway.</v>

1742
01:22:15.090 --> 01:22:15.923
<v Speaker 3>Their legs are ripped off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been run over by trucks every </v>

1743
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:19.050
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all day long.</v>

1744
01:22:19.650 --> 01:22:20.790
<v Speaker 3>And this was what he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1745
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:22.650
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

1746
01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:23.513
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's supposed to see that much </v>

1747
01:22:25.171 --> 01:22:25.860
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>

1748
01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:27.180
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you see that much death,</v>

1749
01:22:27.450 --> 01:22:29.730
<v Speaker 3>it rewires the way your brain works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1750
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:33.210
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Supposed to see that.</v>

1751
01:22:33.211 --> 01:22:35.310
<v Speaker 3>Very rarely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very rarely in life.</v>

1752
01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:38.370
<v Speaker 3>We see it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like something goes wrong,</v>

1753
01:22:38.670 --> 01:22:39.503
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been my experience that some of </v>

1754
01:22:41.881 --> 01:22:44.150
<v Speaker 3>these women with that goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

1755
01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.960
<v Speaker 3>they're just wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>

1756

<v Speaker 3>And he's like too distracting </v>

1759
01:22:51.121 --> 01:22:51.954
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to distract themselves from the </v>

1760
01:22:53.311 --> 01:22:55.020
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:10.340
<v Speaker 1>That was scary until you find out that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the conversation.</v>

1852
01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:14.940
<v Speaker 3>I was 19 at the time when I was teaching</v>
<v Speaker 3>taekwondo,</v>

1853
01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:17.470
<v Speaker 3>when I was teaching this guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1854
01:27:17.730 --> 01:27:18.563
<v Speaker 3>he was friends with a friend of mine who</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely worked for Whitey Bulger who </v>

1855
01:27:24.991 --> 01:27:26.190
<v Speaker 3>wound up going to jail.</v>

<v Speaker 3>whack people.</v>

1857
01:27:32.050 --> 01:27:33.920
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I was teaching him type window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was very serious,</v>

1859
01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.273
<v Speaker 3>like a WHO's very intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was very aware that there was </v>

1860
01:27:44.301 --> 01:27:46.940
<v Speaker 3>something different about him and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes very aware,</v>

1861
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:47.783
<v Speaker 3>like he wasn't just a guy that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning for exercise or self defense </v>

<v Speaker 3>that was in case he needed to use it.</v>

1864
01:27:59.510 --> 01:28:01.190
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>

1865
01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:04.880
<v Speaker 3>there's a mindset of someone who just </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to get better at a martial art and</v>

1866
01:28:04.881 --> 01:28:06.440
<v Speaker 3>there's a mindset of someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about,</v>

1871
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:17.990
<v Speaker 3>there was a certain amount of focus and </v>
<v Speaker 3>intensity that he had.</v>

1872
01:28:17.991 --> 01:28:20.600
<v Speaker 3>That was palpable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>dislodged from his head.</v>

1882
01:28:43.810 --> 01:28:44.643
<v Speaker 3>Although it was unclear whether his </v>
<v Speaker 3>attackers gouged them out or they were </v>

1883
01:28:47.001 --> 01:28:49.880

1963
01:32:55.690 --> 01:33:00.690
<v Speaker 3>His arms are covered in scars and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't good.</v>

1964
01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:04.720
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a talented martial artists,</v>

1965
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:05.823
<v Speaker 3>but he was insanely tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like insanely aggressive and insanely </v>

1966
01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:11.890
<v Speaker 3>tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you sparred him,</v>

1967
01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:15.310
<v Speaker 3>you were fighting for your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your life.</v>

1968
01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:19.780
<v Speaker 3>He would come at me and try to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill me.</v>

1969
01:33:19.810 --> 01:33:20.643
<v Speaker 3>I mean fucking kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing looping punches with every </v>

1970
01:33:25.001 --> 01:33:28.330
<v Speaker 3>fucking ounce of his being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm moving around and I'm like,</v>

1971
01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:29.860
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're fighting to the death here.</v>

1972
01:33:29.861 --> 01:33:31.330
<v Speaker 3>We're fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not,</v>

1973
01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:34.720
<v Speaker 3>this is not sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We only spotted a couple of times before</v>

1974
01:33:34.721 --> 01:33:37.600
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one time he had me cornered.</v>

1975
01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:38.493
<v Speaker 3>He trapped me in a corner and hit me </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a fucking bomb on the top of my </v>

1976
01:33:42.551 --> 01:33:44.160
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just boom,</v>

1977
01:33:44.161 --> 01:33:44.994
<v Speaker 3>like as hard as he could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was a strong guy who's quite a </v>

1978
01:33:46.481 --> 01:33:47.890
<v Speaker 3>bit bigger than me to Irish guy.</v>

1979
01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:51.310
<v Speaker 3>I think he was Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1980
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:54.220
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kicked him in the head so hard.</v>

1981
01:33:54.221 --> 01:33:59.221
<v Speaker 3>It broke his cheek,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like his cheek shifted over his face.</v>

1982
01:33:59.801 --> 01:34:00.634
<v Speaker 3>I will kicked him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I hit him with my heel and his face </v>

1983
01:34:03.850 --> 01:34:07.300
<v Speaker 3>and he dropped down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He collapsed,</v>

1984
01:34:07.570 --> 01:34:11.920
<v Speaker 3>went down to is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like went down face first,</v>

1985
01:34:12.130 --> 01:34:14.920
<v Speaker 3>got up on his all fours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got back up again,</v>

1986
01:34:14.921 --> 01:34:16.500
<v Speaker 3>wanting to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1994
01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:27.573
<v Speaker 3>You want to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After I basically kicked his face in </v>

1995
01:34:29.591 --> 01:34:30.910
<v Speaker 3>half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I hit him so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a sparring session.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I hit him with that thing and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>face planted.</v>

2000
01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:45.940
<v Speaker 3>Most people would have just went out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was so angry and so mean.</v>

2001
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:48.520
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking scary.</v>

2002
01:34:48.521 --> 01:34:50.190
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the last time I sparred with him,</v>

2003
01:34:50.191 --> 01:34:51.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2007
01:34:59.330 --> 01:35:00.163

<v Speaker 3>it was me and him and these two girls </v>

<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm here.</v>

2018
01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:27.950
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm hanging out with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

2019
01:35:27.951 --> 01:35:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Stupid.</v>

2020
01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:30.973
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was one of the rare times I hung out </v>

2021
01:35:31.851 --> 01:35:32.684
<v Speaker 3>with them outside of the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told me a story about how he had a </v>

2022
01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:37.064
<v Speaker 3>fight off these guys with a broomstick </v>
<v Speaker 3>in jail and now he's beaten these guys </v>

2023
01:35:41.541 --> 01:35:45.980
<v Speaker 3>to death with a broomstick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just this horrible story about him being</v>

2024
01:35:45.981 --> 01:35:46.814
<v Speaker 3>forced to mop up something in a bathroom</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these guys cornered them and he's </v>

2025
01:35:50.241 --> 01:35:51.074
<v Speaker 3>just fucking attacking them with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>broomstick and about how you got extra </v>

2026
01:35:54.051 --> 01:35:54.890
<v Speaker 3>time for that.</v>

2027
01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:00.880
<v Speaker 3>I forget what he went to jail for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assume it's probably drug related.</v>

2028
01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:02.553
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember just being so nervous </v>

2029
01:36:05.231 --> 01:36:07.810
<v Speaker 3>about being connected to people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2030
01:36:07.811 --> 01:36:11.620
<v Speaker 3>like knowing people like that from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gym because there's people like that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and he takes a puff of the cigarette and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he takes his shirt off.</v>

2077
01:38:23.490 --> 01:38:24.323
<v Speaker 3>He's going to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has no idea how to fight and he's </v>

2078
01:38:26.101 --> 01:38:26.934
<v Speaker 3>decided he's going to fight this guy who</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows how to fight and this guy leg </v>

2079
01:38:29.791 --> 01:38:32.250
<v Speaker 3>kicks him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drops him to the ground,</v>

2080
01:38:32.251 --> 01:38:33.084
<v Speaker 3>he gets up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy shoots a double lift's his legs </v>

2081
01:38:34.801 --> 01:38:37.440
<v Speaker 3>up in the air and dropped him on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>head and he just goes out.</v>

2082
01:38:37.570 --> 01:38:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so watching.</v>

2083
01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:44.520
<v Speaker 3>There's something about watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's head bounce off concrete.</v>

2084
01:38:44.850 --> 01:38:46.500
<v Speaker 3>That is so fucking disturbing</v>

2085
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:48.990
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2086
01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:51.390
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sad or you find it.</v>

2087
01:38:51.391 --> 01:38:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Anything else?</v>

2088
01:38:52.770 --> 01:38:54.100

2090
01:38:57.710 --> 01:38:58.980
<v Speaker 3>Must pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me see it.</v>

2091
01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:01.860
<v Speaker 3>I once had a concussion in asc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The page.</v>

01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:04.170
<v Speaker 3>Let me scroll down a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

2093
01:39:04.171 --> 01:39:06.760
<v Speaker 3>We'll go to the top again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Go scroll down a little bit.</v>

2095
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody wants to pull it.</v>

2096
01:39:11.890 --> 01:39:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I got an a in a wrestling match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One time.</v>

2097
01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:17.280
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it wasn't sex on,</v>

2098
01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:22.170
<v Speaker 1>I threw up Rice Krispie treats </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere I was out,</v>

2099
01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:23.093
<v Speaker 1>I was unconscious and I was throwing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>rice krispie treats because I loaded up </v>

2100
01:39:27.151 --> 01:39:31.170
<v Speaker 1>on those after weigh ins were like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour before the match.</v>

2101
01:39:31.171 --> 01:39:35.670
<v Speaker 1>I had a peanut butter and jelly and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the back then they had just debuted,</v>

2102
01:39:35.671 --> 01:39:39.720
<v Speaker 1>it was like a new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the premade super processed rice krispie</v>

2103
01:39:39.721 --> 01:39:40.554
<v Speaker 1>treats like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just coming individual packages </v>

2104
01:39:43.351 --> 01:39:45.620
<v Speaker 1>and after cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2105
01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:48.480
<v Speaker 1>my weight cuts were horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>

2106
01:39:48.481 --> 01:39:49.740
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2107
01:39:50.690 --> 01:39:53.760
<v Speaker 1>so like I would just be eyeballing all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this food all week,</v>

2108
01:39:53.761 --> 01:39:56.700
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I'd be so excited.</v>

2109
01:39:56.701 --> 01:39:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be so excited for.</v>

2110
01:39:59.431 --> 01:40:00.264
<v Speaker 1>And I was way too excited about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole box of rice krispie treats that I </v>

2111
01:40:03.151 --> 01:40:08.151
<v Speaker 1>had and I probably had like four or five</v>
<v Speaker 1>right before the match and just boom out</v>

2112
01:40:09.001 --> 01:40:09.630
<v Speaker 1>like a light.</v>

2113
01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Some dubious my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2114
01:40:10.921 --> 01:40:15.060
<v Speaker 1>some dude got my head wrapped up in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>legs like it was,</v>

2115
01:40:15.061 --> 01:40:16.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a,</v>

2116
01:40:16.530 --> 01:40:19.350
<v Speaker 1>like almost like a double chicken wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he had.</v>

2117
01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:20.670
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2118
01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:21.533
<v Speaker 1>my chest was on the mat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he got me in double chicken </v>

2119
01:40:24.241 --> 01:40:26.550
<v Speaker 1>wings and started to walk around my </v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

2120
01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.010
<v Speaker 1>hit year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rolled over and then.</v>

2121
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:30.630
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was really,</v>

2122
01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm really Bridgie and agile and have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long neck that I can bridge up on,</v>

2123
01:40:35.190 --> 01:40:39.090
<v Speaker 1>so when I bridged up on my neck and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just now there's nothing he can do.</v>

2124
01:40:39.091 --> 01:40:43.530
<v Speaker 1>He took his leg and swooped it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure Ford my head.</v>

2125
01:40:43.531 --> 01:40:46.530
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm in a figure four with my head</v>
<v Speaker 1>and double chicken wings.</v>

2126
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:48.310
<v Speaker 1>But then when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once he did that,</v>

2127
01:40:48.311 --> 01:40:51.270
<v Speaker 1>I bridged up again the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember sort of being like,</v>

2128
01:40:51.330 --> 01:40:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2129
01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:53.913
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like you're not pin in May.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he did this thing where you </v>

2130
01:40:56.291 --> 01:41:01.150
<v Speaker 1>just bucked back like a bull in my head </v>
<v Speaker 1>right into the mat,</v>

2131
01:41:01.210 --> 01:41:02.043
<v Speaker 1>out like out like a light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was taken off on a stretcher to the </v>

2132
01:41:04.391 --> 01:41:07.420
<v Speaker 1>hospital that wrestling match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only time that ever happened.</v>

2133
01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:09.850
<v Speaker 1>How quick after that did you go back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling?</v>

2134
01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:11.673
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably probably a week or two or </v>

2135
01:41:13.930 --> 01:41:16.180
<v Speaker 1>assistant coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Son had just died,</v>

2136
01:41:16.181 --> 01:41:17.014
<v Speaker 1>so like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that night was like dedicated to him </v>

2137
01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:23.510
<v Speaker 1>because he showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We weren't expecting him to be there.</v>

2138
01:41:23.810 --> 01:41:24.643
<v Speaker 1>How's The sun was like leukemia or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that and we weren't </v>

2139
01:41:27.941 --> 01:41:28.774
<v Speaker 1>expecting him to be there in like our </v>
<v Speaker 1>head coach gave us one of those pep </v>

2140
01:41:32.711 --> 01:41:37.711
<v Speaker 1>talks like coach Burton's common tonight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's coming after his son dies.</v>

2141
01:41:37.821 --> 01:41:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Then you motherfuckers better not give </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2142
01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Like it was one of those like super </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

2143
01:41:42.670 --> 01:41:47.410
<v Speaker 1>like beyond all of our human potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably why I ended up in that</v>

2144
01:41:47.411 --> 01:41:50.500
<v Speaker 1>position in the first place because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>just bridging for everything,</v>

2145
01:41:50.501 --> 01:41:53.740
<v Speaker 1>including my assistant coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son spirit and all of this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try.</v>

2197
01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:57.650
<v Speaker 2>Takes a drag of a cigarette first and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then takes his shirt off.</v>

2198
01:43:58.230 --> 01:44:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Guy has no idea how to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is hilarious.</v>

2199
01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in shape kick guys.</v>

2200
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:05.703
<v Speaker 2>But people are so ridiculous with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that they think they know how to </v>

2201
01:44:08.451 --> 01:44:09.330
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2202
01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Bang out cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's dark man.</v>

2203
01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:17.360
<v Speaker 2>The banging the head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back of the head off the concrete is</v>

2204
01:44:17.361 --> 01:44:17.980
<v Speaker 2>dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2205
01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:20.110
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Memory's gone that fast.</v>

2206
01:44:20.111 --> 01:44:21.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot gone.</v>

2207
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:22.603
<v Speaker 2>A lot gone with your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I used to always getting mad </v>

2208
01:44:24.291 --> 01:44:28.010
<v Speaker 2>at those movies where people get pistol </v>
<v Speaker 2>whipped and nothing would happen to wake</v>

2209
01:44:28.011 --> 01:44:28.844
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody who liked you had pistol whip </v>

2210
01:44:32.841 --> 01:44:34.310
<v Speaker 2>you because they needed to shut your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>

2211
01:44:37.670 --> 01:44:41.790
<v Speaker 1>You could fucking die or like they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get information out of them.</v>

2212
01:44:41.791 --> 01:44:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Like where's the money hidden?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2213
01:44:43.681 --> 01:44:45.180
<v Speaker 1>well now I don't remember.</v>

2214
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:47.220
<v Speaker 2>And then when they would wake up they'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>have no problem.</v>

2215
01:44:47.221 --> 01:44:50.940
<v Speaker 2>So just be fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problems,</v>

2216
01:44:50.941 --> 01:44:51.774
<v Speaker 2>no coordination issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile your equilibrium would be so </v>

2217
01:44:54.661 --> 01:44:56.040
<v Speaker 2>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your legs wouldn't work.</v>

2218
01:44:56.041 --> 01:44:56.874
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever been knocked out like </v>

2219
01:44:58.710 --> 01:44:59.543
<v Speaker 2>other than that?</v>

2220
01:45:00.690 --> 01:45:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2221
01:45:02.541 --> 01:45:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I've been in a lot of fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never been knocked out.</v>

2222
01:45:05.841 --> 01:45:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Only that wrestling match a did it.</v>

2223
01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:11.720
<v Speaker 2>When you find out how vulnerable you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2224
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:16.310
<v Speaker 2>like the human brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it's positioned in the head that</v>

2225
01:45:16.311 --> 01:45:19.400
<v Speaker 2>all has to do is get hit and yanked </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

2226
01:45:19.410 --> 01:45:19.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2227
01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Pretty deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I have a pro.</v>

2228
01:45:20.941 --> 01:45:21.774
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I have what they would call a </v>

2229
01:45:22.791 --> 01:45:25.640
<v Speaker 1>good chin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks so I've taken some fucking.</v>

2230
01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:28.820
<v Speaker 1>I've taken some real pain and but at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least when I was younger,</v>

2231
01:45:28.821 --> 01:45:33.560
<v Speaker 1>it's been a long time actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a good fucking solid head,</v>

2232
01:45:33.561 --> 01:45:38.561
<v Speaker 1>but about 10 years ago from my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from one of my drunk comedian buddies.</v>

2233
01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2234
01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:44.720
<v Speaker 2>there's a great video of this girl had </v>
<v Speaker 2>buttons go unconscious outside of a bar.</v>

2235
01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:47.020
<v Speaker 2>You probably won't be able to find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some,</v>

2236
01:45:47.050 --> 01:45:49.250
<v Speaker 2>some guys fucking with her and she's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>

2237
01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:50.113
<v Speaker 2>She's pretty small and she grabs this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy by the collar and just playing and </v>

2238
01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:58.550
<v Speaker 2>the dude just crumbles and drops to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground to fucking awesome.</v>

2239
01:45:59.290 --> 01:46:01.700
<v Speaker 2>So it's a real movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This part right here,</v>

2240
01:46:02.210 --> 01:46:05.780
<v Speaker 2>this is where people break their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They break their hands on the top of the</v>

2241
01:46:05.781 --> 01:46:06.614
<v Speaker 2>forehead all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not super hard spot and if you </v>

2242
01:46:09.171 --> 01:46:10.004
<v Speaker 2>smash someone on the jaw with that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the move that it chick actually can </v>

2243
01:46:13.041 --> 01:46:14.930
<v Speaker 2>pull off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she really knows how to do it,</v>

2244
01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:18.040
<v Speaker 2>grab someone's shirt and bang.</v>

2281
01:47:36.221 --> 01:47:37.054
<v Speaker 1>and there was an angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lady that looked that angry in the </v>

2282
01:47:39.431 --> 01:47:41.470
<v Speaker 1>audience one face looking at me and I </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>meeting.</v>

2287
01:47:49.850 --> 01:47:50.683

01:48:58.130 --> 01:48:58.963
<v Speaker 1>So funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call them the apollo 13 because I </v>

2315
01:49:00.381 --> 01:49:01.214
<v Speaker 1>said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

2319
01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:09.890
<v Speaker 2>you're always adding new elements and </v>
<v Speaker 2>always mixing it up.</v>

2320
01:49:09.891 --> 01:49:14.891
<v Speaker 2>But it is one of the best live podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>format ever will because it's so crazy.</v>

2321
01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:16.873
<v Speaker 2>It's so chaotic and you're guaranteed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>either get good comedy or terrible </v>

2322
01:49:20.721 --> 01:49:22.460
<v Speaker 2>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which equals great comedy.</v>

2323
01:49:22.461 --> 01:49:23.294
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2324
01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Just to show you a span this past </v>
<v Speaker 1>Monday,</v>

2325
01:49:25.541 --> 01:49:29.860
<v Speaker 1>we started the show off with a former </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality star that,</v>

2326
01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:31.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was horrible,</v>

2327
01:49:31.870 --> 01:49:32.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't funny.</v>

2328
01:49:32.951 --> 01:49:36.400
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing it 14 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't put any work into it,</v>

2329
01:49:36.401 --> 01:49:38.500
<v Speaker 1>no work ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2330
01:49:38.501 --> 01:49:40.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's like we roasted him in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd,</v>

2331
01:49:40.781 --> 01:49:43.150
<v Speaker 1>loves it because he's such an easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>hateable guy.</v>

2332
01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:44.313
<v Speaker 1>The last guy we pull out of the bucket </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out of the audience area a with </v>

2333
01:49:47.710 --> 01:49:51.970
<v Speaker 1>wearing shorts and one of his legs is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is amputated.</v>

2334
01:49:51.971 --> 01:49:52.804
<v Speaker 1>He has uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has like a prosthetic leg and he </v>

2335
01:49:55.931 --> 01:49:56.764
<v Speaker 1>talks about how he nearly died six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months ago in a motorcycle accident and </v>

2336
01:50:00.011 --> 01:50:03.580
<v Speaker 1>he's a huge kill Tony Fan and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>his first time doing standup.</v>

2337
01:50:03.610 --> 01:50:04.443
<v Speaker 1>This will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find this out after he has a decent </v>

2338
01:50:05.891 --> 01:50:09.020
<v Speaker 1>set for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's his first time ever doing stand up.</v>

2339
01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:12.070
<v Speaker 1>The show keeps him from being depressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that,</v>

2340
01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:12.913
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so this wide span is what helps </v>

2341
01:50:16.481 --> 01:50:19.220
<v Speaker 1>make it refillable like what you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying and you know,</v>

2342
01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:24.300
<v Speaker 1>it's just so cool because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically when it comes to that pc stuff</v>

2343
01:50:24.821 --> 01:50:28.870
<v Speaker 1>that we were talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't know if there's many places</v>

2344
01:50:28.871 --> 01:50:29.704
<v Speaker 1>where the vent for that where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can get a real barometer </v>

2345
01:50:31.721 --> 01:50:33.580
<v Speaker 1>because look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the apollo 13,</v>

2346
01:50:33.581 --> 01:50:34.414
<v Speaker 1>which they're called the apollo 13 </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like showtime at the </v>

2347
01:50:36.401 --> 01:50:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Apollo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's 13 of them.</v>

2348
01:50:37.991 --> 01:50:41.740
<v Speaker 1>So I call them the apollo 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This group of black people.</v>

2349
01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:43.480
<v Speaker 1>So like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few weeks ago,</v>

2350
01:50:43.481 --> 01:50:44.314
<v Speaker 1>this one kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it doesn't even seem like he's 21 </v>

2351
01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:48.393
<v Speaker 1>closes on this horrible joke about Kanye</v>
<v Speaker 1>was somebody needs to throw Kanye up </v>

2352
01:50:52.051 --> 01:50:57.051
<v Speaker 1>banana or something like that in the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole place is in chaos.</v>

2353
01:50:57.551 --> 01:51:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Groaning in the apollo 13 standing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>like ah ha.</v>

2354
01:51:02.970 --> 01:51:07.720
<v Speaker 1>And it's like know since it's such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>live show that's sort of like,</v>

2355
01:51:08.050 --> 01:51:09.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2356
01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:11.620
<v Speaker 1>if you make a racist joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not funny,</v>

2357
01:51:11.621 --> 01:51:14.110
<v Speaker 1>you're going to die dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2358
01:51:14.111 --> 01:51:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the worst type of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2359
01:51:16.631 --> 01:51:19.660
<v Speaker 1>so since there's a real live comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd,</v>

2360
01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:21.333
<v Speaker 1>you get a real good barometer for what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on and it makes it more exciting </v>

2361
01:51:24.731 --> 01:51:28.240
<v Speaker 1>and it's just so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fun what we're doing.</v>

2362
01:51:28.270 --> 01:51:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Keeping it refillable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what you said,</v>

2363
01:51:30.311 --> 01:51:32.860
<v Speaker 1>finding new ways to tweak it here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2364
01:51:32.861 --> 01:51:33.700
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2368
01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:39.813
<v Speaker 2>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that the background guys </v>

01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk about that.</v>

2421
01:53:32.891 --> 01:53:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're.</v>

2422
01:53:35.190 --> 01:53:39.010
<v Speaker 1>They're losing the losing the fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all of a sudden I get up there.</v>

2423
01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:41.680
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the whole.</v>

2424
01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:44.080
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you're touching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>untouchable.</v>

2425
01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:45.580
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly right.</v>

2426
01:53:45.670 --> 01:53:46.503
<v Speaker 2>It's also there's fun in explaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself this fun and navigating the </v>

2427
01:53:50.471 --> 01:53:52.920
<v Speaker 2>waters like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I.</v>

2428
01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:53.773
<v Speaker 2>I made sure that I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought very thought out very </v>

2429
01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:01.720
<v Speaker 2>thoroughly when I did strange times that</v>
<v Speaker 2>my last special,</v>

2430
01:54:01.721 --> 01:54:02.554
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to make sure I really thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>out how I can pull these bits off and </v>

2431
01:54:06.071 --> 01:54:11.071
<v Speaker 2>how I can make them like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug Stan Hope said it best.</v>

2432
01:54:11.171 --> 01:54:13.960
<v Speaker 2>He said he looks at his material like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>defense attorney,</v>

2433
01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:15.533
<v Speaker 2>like as if he's defending his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his material like that's a great way to </v>

2434
01:54:18.221 --> 01:54:20.560
<v Speaker 2>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at my material like I'm a hater.</v>

2435
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:21.583
<v Speaker 2>Like if I was a hater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would I poke fun at that file is </v>

2436
01:54:23.190 --> 01:54:27.130
<v Speaker 2>someone who is looking to be offended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would I so get that out of the way.</v>

2437
01:54:27.131 --> 01:54:32.131
<v Speaker 2>Like there was some bits that I did in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last one in triggered that I changed</v>

2438
01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:33.993
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what they were from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning to when I put them on film </v>

2439
01:54:37.391 --> 01:54:40.270
<v Speaker 2>because of the way audience members were</v>
<v Speaker 2>reacting.</v>

2440
01:54:40.270 --> 01:54:40.721
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2441
01:54:40.721 --> 01:54:44.510
<v Speaker 2>clearly I'm having a problem with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're not I,</v>

2442
01:54:44.630 --> 01:54:48.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even getting to the switch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting to the misdirect because</v>

2443
01:54:48.641 --> 01:54:51.130
<v Speaker 2>they're upset before I get to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>misdirect.</v>

2444
01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:52.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in.</v>

2445
01:54:52.930 --> 01:54:55.300
<v Speaker 2>It'll be fine if they let me get to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>

2446
01:54:55.301 --> 01:54:57.580
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes they would heckle or they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would get upset.</v>

2447
01:54:57.581 --> 01:55:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Like One lady at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had explained to her twice.</v>

2448
01:55:00.641 --> 01:55:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2449
01:55:01.570 --> 01:55:04.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it like this because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to shit on myself afterwards.</v>

2450
01:55:04.370 --> 01:55:06.820
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what it was a bit about.</v>

2451
01:55:06.821 --> 01:55:08.170
<v Speaker 2>You remember that bit I used to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2452
01:55:08.171 --> 01:55:09.004
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a women can do anything men can do or </v>

2453
01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:15.160
<v Speaker 2>that's not true because men can't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2454
01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Some men can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we have the Olympics.</v>

2455
01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea that everybody can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2456
01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:20.853
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go because it was the woman who </v>

2457
01:55:22.631 --> 01:55:24.290
<v Speaker 2>guarded the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2458
01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:24.940
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2459
01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:27.130
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't guard the White House.</v>

2460
01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:27.993
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how I know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I met Shaquille o'neal and his </v>

2461
01:55:29.801 --> 01:55:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Dick is where my faces and I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>explained to her like,</v>

2462
01:55:32.561 --> 01:55:33.700
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

2463
01:55:33.701 --> 01:55:34.534
<v Speaker 2>this is where I was going to go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the White House is experiencing a </v>

2464
01:55:36.561 --> 01:55:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Shaq attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the last guy to save the earth.</v>

2465
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just too fucking big.</v>

2466
01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:43.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would explode,</v>

2467
01:55:43.530 --> 01:55:46.150
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to get to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was,</v>

2468
01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:48.390
<v Speaker 2>this lady was getting upset at me before</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2469
01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:49.560
<v Speaker 2>so I had to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2470
01:55:49.561 --> 01:55:51.690
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this was a drunk dummy,</v>

2471
01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:52.613
<v Speaker 2>how do I keep the drunk dummy from </v>
<v Speaker 2>popping off before I get to the </v>

2472
01:55:55.561 --> 01:55:56.394
<v Speaker 2>misdirect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2473
01:55:56.610 --> 01:55:57.443
<v Speaker 2>so I had to restructure things and I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out a way to make it so that </v>

2474
01:56:00.061 --> 01:56:02.880
<v Speaker 2>it's clear and like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2475
01:56:04.330 --> 01:56:05.163
<v Speaker 2>you just have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just have to navigate the waters </v>

2476
01:56:07.141 --> 01:56:07.974
<v Speaker 2>more carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could still get just as much </v>

2477
01:56:10.051 --> 01:56:10.884
<v Speaker 2>juice out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as much comedy and just as much </v>

2478
01:56:13.621 --> 01:56:14.850
<v Speaker 2>shit that's forbidden.</v>

2479
01:56:15.610 --> 01:56:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Taboo topics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2480
01:56:17.161 --> 01:56:20.650
<v Speaker 2>you have to be really clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be real,</v>

2481
01:56:20.900 --> 01:56:21.840
<v Speaker 2>you have to have good writing.</v>

2482
01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:22.673
<v Speaker 1>That's what's great about doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>clubs on the road before necessarily </v>

2483
01:56:26.611 --> 01:56:27.730
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2484
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:30.750
<v Speaker 1>bigger venues or whatever is because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>really can feel them,</v>

2485
01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:31.753
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel where those moments are </v>

2486
01:56:33.211 --> 01:56:35.980
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in a bigger venue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2487
01:56:36.140 --> 01:56:37.210
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of,</v>

2488
01:56:37.470 --> 01:56:38.490
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

2489
01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:41.420
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of taking a gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's going to.</v>

2490
01:56:41.421 --> 01:56:43.620
<v Speaker 1>We know what's going to get a laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a laugh,</v>

2491
01:56:43.621 --> 01:56:45.420
<v Speaker 1>but you can't really feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2492
01:56:46.130 --> 01:56:46.570
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

2493
01:56:46.570 --> 01:56:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Develop material in a big club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2494
01:56:48.630 --> 01:56:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like a 10,000</v>

2495
01:56:50.381 --> 01:56:54.640
<v Speaker 2>seat room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't develop material at a like Air</v>

2496
01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Canada center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2497

<v Speaker 2>You better have that shit solid.</v>

2500
01:57:00.930 --> 01:57:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even have it memorized.</v>

2501
01:57:03.661 --> 01:57:07.770
<v Speaker 1>It has to be part of your flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're better than anything.</v>

2502
01:57:07.771 --> 01:57:09.420
<v Speaker 1>You have to know it better than you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2503
01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:10.430
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it,</v>

2504
01:57:10.431 --> 01:57:11.850
<v Speaker 2>the funny bone in Columbus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2505
01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:15.350
<v Speaker 2>That place you develop material there.</v>

2506
01:57:15.351 --> 01:57:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Denver developed material there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Develop material and clubs.</v>

2507
01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:19.870
<v Speaker 2>You have to have both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2508
01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:24.260
<v Speaker 2>I firmly believe that those guys who </v>
<v Speaker 2>just do big places and they only play to</v>

2509
01:57:24.261 --> 01:57:26.690
<v Speaker 2>their audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking themselves.</v>

2510
01:57:26.691 --> 01:57:27.524
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an athlete that doesn't </v>

2511
01:57:28.551 --> 01:57:30.650
<v Speaker 2>strength train or it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2512
01:57:30.651 --> 01:57:31.900

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2513
01:57:31.930 --> 01:57:32.580
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2514
01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:34.580
<v Speaker 2>they work out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't watch their diet.</v>

2515
01:57:34.630 --> 01:57:37.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like you got man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta if you want the best results,</v>

2516
01:57:37.221 --> 01:57:38.210

2517
01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:39.330
<v Speaker 1>They're out of touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2518
01:57:39.331 --> 01:57:41.340
<v Speaker 1>you gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotTa do the whole thing.</v>

2519
01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:43.110
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>

2520
01:57:43.550 --> 01:57:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2521
01:57:44.910 --> 01:57:45.743
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to name any names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's just say a guy that's super </v>

2522
01:57:50.221 --> 01:57:52.980
<v Speaker 1>duper famous goes to a theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2523
01:57:52.981 --> 01:57:53.814
<v Speaker 1>one of those big legends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they don't do is they don't </v>

2524
01:57:56.641 --> 01:58:00.100
<v Speaker 1>experiment not being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they should do is they should hire,</v>

2525
01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:04.020
<v Speaker 1>have a secret five minute experimental </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit buried in their set.</v>

2526
01:58:04.021 --> 01:58:07.470
<v Speaker 1>That's purposely nothing funny about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're on it.</v>

2527
01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:11.100
<v Speaker 1>And when they hear those laughs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when they'll realize like,</v>

2528
01:58:11.190 --> 01:58:14.040
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

2529
01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:16.860
<v Speaker 1>They're laughing no matter what because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I have them trained.</v>

2530
01:58:17.970 --> 01:58:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's their fans and their dumb comedy</v>

2531
01:58:21.181 --> 01:58:22.014
<v Speaker 1>fans,</v>

2532
01:58:22.610 --> 01:58:23.443
<v Speaker 2>I'll laugh at things that aren't funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think they're going to laugh </v>

2533
01:58:25.011 --> 01:58:27.920
<v Speaker 2>harder at things that aren't as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're gonna want,</v>

2534
01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:30.470
<v Speaker 2>like I went to see a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna name any names.</v>

2535
01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Me and Joey Diaz went to Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2536
01:58:32.370 --> 01:58:35.000

<v Speaker 2>next night.</v>

2537
01:58:35.020 --> 01:58:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

2538
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:38.383
<v Speaker 2>it was one of those situations where </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone was doing their material for </v>

2539
01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:43.780
<v Speaker 2>audience and you could tell they hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>been working out in the clubs.</v>

2540
01:58:43.890 --> 01:58:46.900
<v Speaker 2>You could just see it and the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to laugh.</v>

2541
01:58:46.930 --> 01:58:48.460
<v Speaker 2>They want it to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were,</v>

2542
01:58:48.461 --> 01:58:50.440
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were fans and they were with it.</v>

2543
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:54.700
<v Speaker 2>That's the difference between that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say a set at the store when it's 11:00</v>

2544
01:58:54.700 --> 01:58:55.533

2549
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:11.343
<v Speaker 2>You have to actually be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give you a minute or two to get </v>

2550
01:59:13.751 --> 01:59:18.220
<v Speaker 2>settled in on stays the clap and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>excited to see you come with the fucking</v>

2551
01:59:18.221 --> 01:59:19.054
<v Speaker 2>jokes.</v>

2552
01:59:19.410 --> 01:59:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Barely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they give you a minute?</v>

2553
01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started second.</v>

2554
01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:26.040
<v Speaker 1>They really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really truly 30 seconds.</v>

2555
01:59:26.041 --> 01:59:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Especially in the or it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is a he,</v>

2556
01:59:30.690 --> 01:59:31.523
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to recover from a spinout </v>
<v Speaker 1>so much easier to start strong and take </v>

2557
01:59:36.091 --> 01:59:41.091
<v Speaker 1>chances and fizzle out than it is to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>start off on the right foot and get them</v>

2558
01:59:41.641 --> 01:59:43.380
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also because they're right on top,</v>

2559
01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:47.250
<v Speaker 2>be on the or they're right there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you could just high five them</v>

2560
01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:50.730
<v Speaker 1>and they know that at that point they </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what's going on.</v>

2561
01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:51.593
<v Speaker 1>They know you better get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've already seen six of their </v>

2562
01:59:57.181 --> 01:59:58.014
<v Speaker 1>favorite new comedians that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>already waiting to google the lineup </v>

2563
02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:03.390
<v Speaker 1>after they go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>corner means.</v>

2566
02:00:07.921 --> 02:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Seeing two or three comedians in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original room,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't really believe you.</v>

2806
02:10:43.011 --> 02:10:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Like I thought you were just being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were being nice.</v>

2807
02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:47.561
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2808
02:10:47.561 --> 02:10:49.040
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to give me a pep talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2809
02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'd tell you dude,</v>

2811
02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:55.700
<v Speaker 1>you could do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2812
02:10:55.850 --> 02:10:56.683
<v Speaker 1>but I know you wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it was crazy to me because </v>

2813
02:10:59.181 --> 02:11:00.014
<v Speaker 1>I'm like either the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either the world is different over here </v>

2814
02:11:02.841 --> 02:11:05.120
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of the world or</v>

2815
02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:08.580
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two things to take into consideration.</v>

2816
02:11:08.581 --> 02:11:11.070
<v Speaker 3>One is their second language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's basically,</v>

2817
02:11:11.071 --> 02:11:13.170
<v Speaker 3>it's a novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going out to see comedy,</v>

2818
02:11:13.171 --> 02:11:14.560
<v Speaker 3>which is a novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2819
02:11:14.650 --> 02:11:15.483
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there are Swedish Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure the timing and the </v>

2820
02:11:19.110 --> 02:11:19.943
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just very different going from a </v>

2821
02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Swedish style comedy to American style </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>

2822
02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:27.630
<v Speaker 3>but they're just really polite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they would,</v>

2823
02:11:27.810 --> 02:11:28.643
<v Speaker 3>they would laugh and then they would </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop and they would listen and you'll </v>

2824
02:11:31.770 --> 02:11:32.603
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just felt like dead in between the </v>

2825
02:11:33.421 --> 02:11:34.254
<v Speaker 3>bits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2826
02:11:34.770 --> 02:11:35.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2827
02:11:35.761 --> 02:11:38.580
<v Speaker 3>you did great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you saw it when they were doing</v>

2828
02:11:38.581 --> 02:11:40.260
<v Speaker 3>it for my set and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2829
02:11:40.261 --> 02:11:41.280
<v Speaker 3>that's how they really are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>

2830
02:11:41.281 --> 02:11:42.360
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2831
02:11:42.361 --> 02:11:43.980
<v Speaker 3>but they had a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they,</v>

2832
02:11:43.981 --> 02:11:45.570
<v Speaker 3>they laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't.</v>

2833
02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:48.280
<v Speaker 3>There's not like all this chatter </v>
<v Speaker 3>inbetween the joke,</v>

2834
02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:49.133
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wait and then they laugh and again </v>

2835
02:11:50.581 --> 02:11:53.100
<v Speaker 3>they laughed again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then your second set,</v>

2836
02:11:53.101 --> 02:11:54.990
<v Speaker 3>we did two shows that night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You came out.</v>

2837
02:11:54.991 --> 02:11:56.070
<v Speaker 3>You were comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2838

<v Speaker 3>you're fine.</v>

2839
02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:57.393
<v Speaker 1>Because I embraced it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just stayed in the pocket instead of </v>

2840
02:11:59.711 --> 02:12:01.150
<v Speaker 1>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

2841
02:12:01.460 --> 02:12:02.293
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are that way in England as well in </v>

2842
02:12:03.531 --> 02:12:06.380

2843
02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:09.050
<v Speaker 3>They really appreciate standup comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they really,</v>

2844
02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:12.950
<v Speaker 3>really appreciate it as a show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're extremely polite when they watch</v>

2845
02:12:12.951 --> 02:12:14.930
<v Speaker 3>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoy performing there.</v>

2846
02:12:14.931 --> 02:12:15.764
<v Speaker 3>I like it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been there in awhile and I </v>

02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:33.173

<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2880
02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:39.780
<v Speaker 2>now though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

2881
02:13:39.781 --> 02:13:42.000
<v Speaker 2>that God can't even walk in Dublin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2882
02:13:42.001 --> 02:13:42.870
<v Speaker 2>I can't go anywhere.</v>

2883
02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:44.033
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that we're about to do </v>

2884
02:13:45.401 --> 02:13:47.140
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go to Toronto.</v>

2885
02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girls fighting my girls.</v>

2886
02:13:49.011 --> 02:13:49.844
<v Speaker 1>Spiky guests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's undefeated with me next to the </v>

2887
02:13:52.181 --> 02:13:54.730
<v Speaker 1>octagon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll want to inject you damn right.</v>

2888
02:13:54.820 --> 02:13:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Guess who's about to be member when she </v>
<v Speaker 1>got that strawweight championship?</v>

2889
02:13:58.691 --> 02:14:00.700
<v Speaker 1>What'd she do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She ran out of the octagon,</v>

2890
02:14:00.730 --> 02:14:03.400
<v Speaker 1>came and took a picture with Tony issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2891
02:14:03.730 --> 02:14:04.563
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2892
02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:07.000
<v Speaker 1>She reached into your pants and grabbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>your Melaleuca stick.</v>

2893
02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:07.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I believe that's what's going to </v>

2894
02:14:11.261 --> 02:14:12.370
<v Speaker 1>happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2895
02:14:12.371 --> 02:14:14.440
<v Speaker 1>she didn't do any of those things folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just joking.</v>

2896
02:14:14.441 --> 02:14:15.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're kidding.</v>

2897
02:14:15.071 --> 02:14:17.380
<v Speaker 1>But she did jump out of the octagon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a picture with.</v>

2898
02:14:17.430 --> 02:14:17.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2899
02:14:17.791 --> 02:14:18.670
<v Speaker 1>that's a different one.</v>

2900
02:14:18.980 --> 02:14:19.813
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Punch you in the face and you're doing </v>

2901
02:14:21.001 --> 02:14:21.834
<v Speaker 2>nothing</v>

2902
02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:23.153
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was that one bottom right there </v>

2903
02:14:24.750 --> 02:14:27.510
<v Speaker 1>again and again and again and again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bottom right.</v>

2904
02:14:28.230 --> 02:14:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2905
02:14:32.190 --> 02:14:35.240
<v Speaker 1>She ran right out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She came out and she pointed at me.</v>

2906
02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:36.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going goes,</v>

2907
02:14:36.011 --> 02:14:38.610
<v Speaker 1>come over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that with a belt on.</v>

2908
02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is hilarious.</v>

2909
02:14:41.070 --> 02:14:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough fight,</v>

2910
02:14:42.091 --> 02:14:44.050
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's fighting volunteership Chenko.</v>

2911
02:14:44.051 --> 02:14:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Valentina is a fucking murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a monster.</v>

2912
02:14:47.550 --> 02:14:48.383
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think not having to cut that extra 10 </v>

2913
02:14:50.581 --> 02:14:51.414
<v Speaker 1>pounds is going to give you on a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pop and a lot of extra energy and we're </v>

2914
02:14:54.481 --> 02:14:57.330
<v Speaker 1>going to see the old deal on a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2915
02:14:57.360 --> 02:14:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Rose had her number technically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

2916
02:14:59.781 --> 02:15:02.610
<v Speaker 1>But that's the only person we've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen have her number.</v>

2917
02:15:02.670 --> 02:15:05.520
<v Speaker 1>So she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she absolutely struggles to make,</v>

2918
02:15:05.521 --> 02:15:05.600
<v Speaker 1>make</v>

2919
02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:07.370
<v Speaker 2>115 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2920
02:15:07.371 --> 02:15:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Undeniably she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's an agonizing weight cut for her.</v>

2921
02:15:11.090 --> 02:15:11.923
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be better for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have fought before they fought two </v>

2922
02:15:15.081 --> 02:15:18.260
<v Speaker 2>or three times in Moitai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Valentine is one.</v>

2923
02:15:18.261 --> 02:15:20.070
<v Speaker 2>All the fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2924
02:15:20.660 --> 02:15:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Valentina is a beast man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2925
02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's bigger.</v>

2926
02:15:23.610 --> 02:15:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Valentina is coming down from 35 to </v>
<v Speaker 2>1:25,</v>

2927
02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:28.753
<v Speaker 2>but I like it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably one of the more technical </v>

2928
02:15:31.220 --> 02:15:34.730
<v Speaker 2>female mma fights you're ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see in terms of like,</v>

2929
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:35.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be in a world champion Moy </v>

2930
02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:40.400
<v Speaker 2>Thai fighter found Tina being at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>same level.</v>

2931
02:15:40.610 --> 02:15:42.890
<v Speaker 2>They're just both super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super technical.</v>

2932
02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:45.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm pumped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be fun.</v>

2933
02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:47.240
<v Speaker 2>We're going to hang out in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>
