<v Speaker 1>packages that she has to weigh.</v>

79
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.410
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing takes a long ass time and there could be three or four people in</v>

80
00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:14.390
<v Speaker 1>front of you and they're all doing the same thing.</v>

227
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.910
<v Speaker 1>they would never think that you're a fighter.</v>

228
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.080
<v Speaker 1>You're a very friendly guy.</v>

231
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.820
<v Speaker 1>You're very easygoing,</v>

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

235
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:33.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be,</v>

236
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't want it to look like a fighter.</v>

237
00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:36.700
<v Speaker 4>When he talked to me and let's say on the phone,</v>

238
00:06:36.701 --> 00:06:39.100
<v Speaker 4>I want it to look like a normal human being.</v>

239
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.460
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

240
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.881
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

241
00:06:39.881 --> 00:06:40.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

242
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.901
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

243
00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 4>it may a little bit the impression that people would have some time.</v>

244
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.931
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

245
00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:44.230
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

246
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.460
<v Speaker 1>you're not just a nice guy.</v>

247
00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:45.941
<v Speaker 1>You'll like,</v>

248
00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:48.460
<v Speaker 1>you're honest about your own vulnerabilities,</v>

249
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:49.990
<v Speaker 1>which I've always found fascinating.</v>

250
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Like you talk about what,</v>

251
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:52.390
<v Speaker 1>what makes you scared.</v>

252
00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:53.890
<v Speaker 1>You talk about what you're worried about.</v>

253
00:06:53.891 --> 00:06:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

254
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.250
<v Speaker 1>like even this nick dance,</v>

256
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.591
<v Speaker 1>what you like,</v>

257
00:06:56.591 --> 00:06:59.290
<v Speaker 1>I am scared because I don't want to lose to this guy.</v>

258
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a lot of people who never admit that</v>

259
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.570
<v Speaker 4>and yeah.</v>

260
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 4>But it may make you think and make you stronger to admit that you're scared</v>

261
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.630
<v Speaker 4>because you're not scared to say that you are scared.</v>

262
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.400
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

263
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.070
<v Speaker 4>Someone who doesn't admit it because he's scared to admit that he's scared,</v>

264
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.380
<v Speaker 4>scared of himself,</v>

265
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 4>scare care of what people are gonna think about him.</v>

266
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:18.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm not scared what people going to think.</v>

267
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 4>They have to see me as I as I am.</v>

268
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:22.790
<v Speaker 4>So I'm not scared to admit that I'm scared.</v>

269
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 1>And it's almost like when you don't admit you're scared,</v>

270
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:26.474
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're praying,</v>

271
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.130
<v Speaker 1>you're protecting yourself from evolving because the only way you can ever be</v>

272
00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:34.700
<v Speaker 1>realistic about a situation and get better at anything in life is you've got to</v>

273
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 1>accurately address what's happening.</v>

274
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

275
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.860
<v Speaker 1>100% with,</v>

276
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

277
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 1>and there's some people that don't do that,</v>

278
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 1>and I think that cuts them off from a certain amount of progress in life.</v>

279
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.900
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a certain,</v>

280
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:45.410
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

281
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.340
<v Speaker 1>there's like walls that you put up yourself because you're not willing to look</v>

282
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 1>at your own failures</v>

283
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:51.600
<v Speaker 4>but sent,</v>

284
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.361
<v Speaker 4>you're not the,</v>

285
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:54.550
<v Speaker 4>you're not the honest with yourself.</v>

286
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.440
<v Speaker 4>So that's what it is.</v>

287
00:07:56.441 --> 00:07:57.274
<v Speaker 4>I did a bit.</v>

288
00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:57.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

289
00:07:57.761 --> 00:08:01.390

435
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.230
<v Speaker 4>I am not sure.</v>

436
00:11:53.231 --> 00:11:53.701
<v Speaker 4>I have not.</v>

437
00:11:53.701 --> 00:11:54.534
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>

438
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.750
<v Speaker 4>Have any of these</v>

439
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.890
<v Speaker 1>variances happened while you've been in the dream state or were you just been</v>

440
00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:01.930
<v Speaker 1>dreaming or just asleep and you were</v>

441
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:02.853
<v Speaker 4>woken up?</v>

442
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.320
<v Speaker 4>I am not sure to that expert.</v>

443
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.771
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

444
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:06.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember anything.</v>

445
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.910
<v Speaker 1>But it was the worst at nighttime type things.</v>

446
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Was it nighttime when you think you might have had something happen to you?</v>

447
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.320
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

448
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 4>I can't say something happened to me.</v>

449
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.130
<v Speaker 4>I have no proof.</v>

450
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.660
<v Speaker 4>I just don't know.</v>

451
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:23.610
<v Speaker 1>What I'm going to tell you about is your brain produces a chemical while you're</v>

452
00:12:23.611 --> 00:12:24.260
<v Speaker 1>sleeping,</v>

453
00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:24.801
<v Speaker 4>but I've got it.</v>

454
00:12:24.801 --> 00:12:28.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell you something and I'm going to be honest about it sometime.</v>

455
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:30.560
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

456
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at the clock and it's like I wake up and I look at the cracker right</v>

457
00:12:36.861 --> 00:12:41.861
<v Speaker 4>after I started and it's like the clock had events like a four hour or two</v>

458
00:12:42.321 --> 00:12:43.154
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

459
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.740
<v Speaker 4>There's a time zone that I don't remember what happened.</v>

460
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.150
<v Speaker 4>It's called falling asleep.</v>

461
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:48.763
<v Speaker 4>I hope so.</v>

462
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:52.500
<v Speaker 1>What do you think you think you're getting snatched up and take it away for a</v>

463
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.333
<v Speaker 1>couple hours.</v>

464
00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.500
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I fall asleep.</v>

465
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.400
<v Speaker 4>That's why I hoped.</v>

466
00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.590
<v Speaker 4>That's why I hope or I can drive.</v>

467
00:12:57.591 --> 00:12:58.580
<v Speaker 4>I can drive my car,</v>

468
00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.750
<v Speaker 4>I can drive my car.</v>

469
00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.250
<v Speaker 4>And then it already happened.</v>

470
00:13:01.251 --> 00:13:01.551
<v Speaker 4>I drove,</v>

471
00:13:01.551 --> 00:13:02.390
<v Speaker 4>I drove my car.</v>

472
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.040
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] I dunno,</v>

473
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.630
<v Speaker 4>I drove my car in a normal day,</v>

474
00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.070
<v Speaker 4>like going somewhere.</v>

475
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:12.050
<v Speaker 4>Then I look and this two hour pass and like two hour,</v>

476
00:13:12.051 --> 00:13:13.790
<v Speaker 4>I would just pass like this.</v>

477
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:15.150
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe,</v>

478
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.420
<v Speaker 4>maybe I didn't see it.</v>

479
00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:17.240
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I didn't.</v>

480
00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:17.601
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

481
00:13:17.601 --> 00:13:18.590
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>

482
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.900
<v Speaker 4>I maybe I watched their tiny the wrong.</v>

483
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.680
<v Speaker 4>Like I watched my clock and I made a mistake myself most likely,</v>

484
00:13:24.681 --> 00:13:25.370
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

485
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:25.820
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

486
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.211
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

487
00:13:26.211 --> 00:13:26.630
<v Speaker 4>My hope.</v>

488
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:27.350
<v Speaker 4>I hope so.</v>

489
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Well that's very minor stuff.</v>

490
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.290
<v Speaker 1>That's very minor stuff.</v>

491
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

492
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

493
00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.020
<v Speaker 1>but that could be,</v>

494
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.930
<v Speaker 1>you talked being tired because you push yourself and less stress.</v>

495
00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:36.853
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly,</v>

496
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.330
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what I hope.</v>

497
00:13:38.331 --> 00:13:38.661
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

498
00:13:38.661 --> 00:13:39.950
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly what I hope so.</v>

499
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.130
<v Speaker 1>But you don't have any memories of great dudes putting fingers up your butt?</v>

500
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:43.341
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

501
00:13:43.341 --> 00:13:43.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

502
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:44.410
<v Speaker 1>None of that.</v>

503
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:44.851
<v Speaker 2>I got it,</v>

504
00:13:44.851 --> 00:13:45.051
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

505
00:13:45.051 --> 00:13:46.210
<v Speaker 2>where you're driving down the street,</v>

506
00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:48.790
<v Speaker 2>like on the highway and you're just like kind of dazed out and you're like,</v>

507
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:49.001
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

508
00:13:49.001 --> 00:13:49.834
<v Speaker 2>how long I've been,</v>

509
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.170
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

510
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.120
<v Speaker 2>I've been dazed out for like 20 minutes.</v>

511
00:13:52.121 --> 00:13:53.640
<v Speaker 2>What have I been doing for 20 minutes?</v>

512
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Autopilot.</v>

513
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

514
00:13:55.391 --> 00:13:55.991
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>

515
00:13:55.991 --> 00:13:58.030
<v Speaker 1>you just realize like almost all of a sudden your home.</v>

516
00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

517
00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.130
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

518
00:13:59.130 --> 00:13:59.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

519
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

520
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.900
<v Speaker 1>the thing about being exhausted and sleep,</v>

521
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

522
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:04.390
<v Speaker 1>and having these experiences at night,</v>

523
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:04.961
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

524
00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:05.561
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

525
00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:07.570
<v Speaker 1>a chemical your brain makes that's,</v>

526
00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:07.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

527
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.930
<v Speaker 1>one of the most powerful psychedelic drugs don't demand.</v>

528
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.420
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things they're trying to connect,</v>

529
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 1>it's called DMT.</v>

530
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.480
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things they're trying to connect is,</v>

531
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

532
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 1>people having near death experiences and people that have had UFO alien</v>

533
00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:25.540
<v Speaker 1>abduction type experiences and this chemical and that they can introduce this</v>

534
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:26.860
<v Speaker 1>chemical into the human body.</v>

535
00:14:26.861 --> 00:14:31.540
<v Speaker 1>And these people have very similar experiences to what they had when they had a</v>

536
00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Ufo encounter or when they had,</v>

537
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

538
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:37.000
<v Speaker 1>a white light near death experience counter.</v>

539
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.000
<v Speaker 1>It's most likely there's this chemical that's doing this.</v>

540
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.810
<v Speaker 1>So when people having these experiences,</v>

541
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.770
<v Speaker 1>they're very realistic and they do believe they're being taken aboard by,</v>

542
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

543
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.530
<v Speaker 1>a Ufo somewhere.</v>

544
00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.030
<v Speaker 1>They might not be wrong,</v>

545
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.070
<v Speaker 1>but this is not a Ufo encounter.</v>

546
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Boyd's</v>

547
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:53.440
<v Speaker 5>and then that the firefighting or job,</v>

548
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:53.910
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

549
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:54.743
<v Speaker 5>Object.</v>

550
00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 5>This the I encounter.</v>

551
00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:57.060
<v Speaker 5>Are we talking about that?</v>

552
00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.070
<v Speaker 5>If they've been taking a board,</v>

553
00:14:59.100 --> 00:14:59.461
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

554
00:14:59.461 --> 00:15:00.211
<v Speaker 5>this is different.</v>

555
00:15:00.211 --> 00:15:00.631
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

556
00:15:00.631 --> 00:15:01.230
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

557
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.210
<v Speaker 5>it could be a third type and commentary.</v>

558
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.640
<v Speaker 5>There's many ways,</v>

559
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.511
<v Speaker 5>but this is different.</v>

560
00:15:06.511 --> 00:15:06.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

561
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:07.643
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>

562
00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:09.780
<v Speaker 5>I you talk about me,</v>

563
00:15:09.781 --> 00:15:10.441
<v Speaker 5>I don't have any,</v>

564
00:15:10.441 --> 00:15:12.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't have any memory of such team,</v>

565
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.680
<v Speaker 5>but I think I had like,</v>

566
00:15:13.681 --> 00:15:13.981
<v Speaker 5>I have,</v>

567
00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:14.461
<v Speaker 5>like you say,</v>

568
00:15:14.461 --> 00:15:15.151
<v Speaker 5>sometimes I fall,</v>

569
00:15:15.151 --> 00:15:15.901
<v Speaker 5>I fall asleep,</v>

570
00:15:15.901 --> 00:15:17.880
<v Speaker 5>then I wake up is the time pass.</v>

571
00:15:17.881 --> 00:15:18.331
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

572
00:15:18.331 --> 00:15:19.164
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

573
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.210
<v Speaker 5>it's like I just,</v>

574
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.480
<v Speaker 5>cause you're tired man.</v>

575
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:22.740
<v Speaker 5>Aliens.</v>

576
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

577
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.250

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:25.830
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's alien.</v>

581
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:26.760
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of what you do.</v>

582
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:27.121
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

583
00:15:27.121 --> 00:15:28.140
<v Speaker 5>it's because I am,</v>

584
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.190
<v Speaker 5>I felt like I didn't fall,</v>

585
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.220
<v Speaker 5>I didn't fall asleep and I'm not tired.</v>

586
00:15:32.221 --> 00:15:32.821
<v Speaker 5>I'm wide awake,</v>

587
00:15:32.821 --> 00:15:33.654
<v Speaker 5>awake,</v>

588
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.370
<v Speaker 5>but I fall asleep rag this,</v>

589
00:15:35.371 --> 00:15:35.910
<v Speaker 5>I just Kinda,</v>

590
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's kind of weird these onto hard sparring days.</v>

591
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:39.300
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

592
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:39.660
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

593
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:40.530
<v Speaker 5>just a normal day.</v>

594
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.860
<v Speaker 5>Negative could happen everyday.</v>

595
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.290
<v Speaker 5>Just get a Gopro like a camera and just record yourself all the time.</v>

596
00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:48.143
<v Speaker 5>That happens.</v>

597
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.660
<v Speaker 5>Watch it recorded for like eight hours at a time.</v>

598
00:15:51.661 --> 00:15:52.440
<v Speaker 5>Some of them.</v>

599
00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:52.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

600
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.790
<v Speaker 5>How long has this been going on?</v>

601
00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:54.893
<v Speaker 5>Since I'm a kid.</v>

602
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.003
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

603
00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:57.893
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

604
00:15:58.170 --> 00:15:59.460
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't it be crazy if,</v>

605
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.060
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

606
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:05.060
<v Speaker 5>the aliens like manufactured you to be a mixed martial arts fighter?</v>

607
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:06.150
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

608
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.983
<v Speaker 5>let's see if we could,</v>

609
00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure if it would have happened,</v>

610
00:16:09.661 --> 00:16:11.070
<v Speaker 5>I would have been much better than,</v>

611
00:16:11.071 --> 00:16:11.521
<v Speaker 5>than,</v>

612
00:16:11.521 --> 00:16:12.300
<v Speaker 5>than this.</v>

613
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.111
<v Speaker 5>Much better than this.</v>

614
00:16:13.111 --> 00:16:14.040
<v Speaker 5>You're the fucking champion.</v>

615
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:14.551
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

616
00:16:14.551 --> 00:16:15.680
<v Speaker 5>But if I would be at here,</v>

617
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:16.281
<v Speaker 5>the manufacturer,</v>

618
00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:17.610
<v Speaker 5>I would it be superman,</v>

619
00:16:17.611 --> 00:16:17.940
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

620
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:18.121
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

621
00:16:18.121 --> 00:16:19.700
<v Speaker 5>they just don't want to get ridiculous with it.</v>

622
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.190
<v Speaker 5>It would be,</v>

623
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:21.670
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

624
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:26.120
<v Speaker 5>it would be obviously can't turn a guy into what God damn superhero maybe didn't</v>

625
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:27.570
<v Speaker 5>manufacture on Anderson Silva.</v>

626
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:28.381
<v Speaker 5>Jon Jones.</v>

627
00:16:28.381 --> 00:16:30.350
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they did the Aldo.</v>

628
00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.850
<v Speaker 5>Maybe someone needs to talk to them about their sleep patterns.</v>

629
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.430
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they're falling asleep behind the wheel too and being sucked to board a</v>

630
00:16:35.431 --> 00:16:36.720
<v Speaker 5>space ship for repairs.</v>

631
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.520
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they don't want to talk about it.</v>

632
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:39.540
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they don't say it,</v>

633
00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:40.141
<v Speaker 5>but maybe they are.</v>

634
00:16:40.141 --> 00:16:40.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

635
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.061
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

636
00:16:41.061 --> 00:16:42.740
<v Speaker 5>I know I'm the print that and they,</v>

637
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.250
<v Speaker 5>I think it's funny though,</v>

638
00:16:44.251 --> 00:16:45.640
<v Speaker 5>that that's maybe one subject,</v>

639
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.211
<v Speaker 5>but you,</v>

640
00:16:46.211 --> 00:16:46.690
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

641
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:47.380
<v Speaker 5>you have,</v>

642
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.060
<v Speaker 5>you had a really hard time talking about that.</v>

643
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:49.820
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

644
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.190
<v Speaker 5>Cause it sounds crazy.</v>

645
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:51.670
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

646
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:52.300
<v Speaker 5>And I know,</v>

647
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.100
<v Speaker 5>and I will talk about it one day.</v>

648
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to talk about my fear,</v>

649
00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.210
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

650
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.150
<v Speaker 5>all of that stuff and yeah.</v>

651
00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.093
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

654

<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

655
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't get deep into this.</v>

656
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:02.641
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

657
00:17:02.641 --> 00:17:04.420
<v Speaker 5>Maybe one day I'll,</v>

658
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:05.360
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

659
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:05.641
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

660
00:17:05.641 --> 00:17:05.941
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

661
00:17:05.941 --> 00:17:06.774
<v Speaker 5>I'll talk about that.</v>

662
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.230
<v Speaker 5>It's not what you promised one day.</v>

663
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:09.671
<v Speaker 5>I promise.</v>

664
00:17:09.671 --> 00:17:10.504
<v Speaker 5>One day.</v>

665
00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:12.510
<v Speaker 5>What is the difference note tomorrow.</v>

666
00:17:12.511 --> 00:17:16.560
<v Speaker 5>Didn't you see rocky three when Apollo creed says that the rocky Balboa,</v>

667
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:17.401
<v Speaker 5>or like you said,</v>

668
00:17:17.401 --> 00:17:17.521
<v Speaker 5>may,</v>

669
00:17:17.521 --> 00:17:17.911
<v Speaker 5>maybe,</v>

670
00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:19.200
<v Speaker 5>maybe I will die one day.</v>

671
00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.460
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I'll die it tomorrow.</v>

672
00:17:20.461 --> 00:17:22.490
<v Speaker 5>I hope I touched wasn't nothing and that people,</v>

673
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:23.010
<v Speaker 5>oh.</v>

674
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:23.820
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

675
00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.020
<v Speaker 5>how did you say that it was that French?</v>

676
00:17:25.021 --> 00:17:25.910
<v Speaker 5>I touched with nuts.</v>

677
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.380
<v Speaker 5>I touched the,</v>

678
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.030
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't let it happen,</v>

679
00:17:30.031 --> 00:17:30.864
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

680
00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

681
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.910
<v Speaker 5>It just let it go.</v>

682
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.470
<v Speaker 5>Just whatever information you've got,</v>

683
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:35.221
<v Speaker 5>spill it now.</v>

684
00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:35.881
<v Speaker 5>But I don't know.</v>

685
00:17:35.881 --> 00:17:36.541
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing my,</v>

686
00:17:36.541 --> 00:17:37.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing my own research.</v>

687
00:17:37.801 --> 00:17:40.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm researching on myself as I think you know,</v>

688
00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:42.810
<v Speaker 5>you just told me he's a very interesting day chemical.</v>

689
00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:47.400
<v Speaker 5>That buddy that's probably that I'm happy that I meet through today and you tell</v>

690
00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 5>that about me because I make me make me up.</v>

691
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.670
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

692
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:51.690
<v Speaker 1>It'll make you think like,</v>

693
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.320
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people think they're going crazy and it's not.</v>

694
00:17:54.321 --> 00:17:56.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just your brain makes like a duck trucks.</v>

695
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:57.540
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

696
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Your brain produces it and parts of your liver and your lungs,</v>

697
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.180
<v Speaker 1>they don't know why this stuff is in the body,</v>

698
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:03.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

699
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a super potent psychedelic.</v>

700
00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.323
<v Speaker 1>Your brain makes it,</v>

701
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 1>it happens when you're sleeping.</v>

702
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 1>So if like the speculation is that it happens during rem sleep.</v>

703
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they have the most accurate way of measuring it,</v>

704
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.630
<v Speaker 1>but they know it's in the body and they believe it's the,</v>

705
00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:22.560
<v Speaker 1>the theory is that it comes out during periods of heavy stress or when your body</v>

706
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:26.880
<v Speaker 1>thinks it's going to die or in rem sleep and that those are the Times that you</v>

707
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.870
<v Speaker 1>have higher levels of this stuff in your neurochemical soup.</v>

708
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.633
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting,</v>

709
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:33.150
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

710
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.080
<v Speaker 1>why would you brain,</v>

711
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.980
<v Speaker 1>why would your brain produce an incredibly potent psychedelic drug?</v>

712
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.220
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people that are having these nighttime experiences,</v>

713
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.840
<v Speaker 1>it could be just varying levels of this chemical that's a going around in your</v>

714
00:18:45.841 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

715
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that these experiences aren't real.</v>

716
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.280
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the fuck sleeping is anyway.</v>

717
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:50.641
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

718
00:18:50.641 --> 00:18:51.474
<v Speaker 1>what is sleeping?</v>

719
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.560
<v Speaker 1>You shut your eyes,</v>

720
00:18:52.561 --> 00:18:53.430
<v Speaker 1>you shut off,</v>

721
00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:57.000
<v Speaker 1>you don't exist in this plane and your consciousness goes somewhere else.</v>

722
00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Like literally you have no memory of a giant chunk of your day and we have no</v>

723
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:06.070
<v Speaker 1>problem with it and yet we don't connect it to any other realm or the,</v>

724
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.220
<v Speaker 1>the idea of there being other dimensions.</v>

725
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:10.140
<v Speaker 1>You go into another dimension when you go to sleep,</v>

726
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:10.651
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

727
00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:11.400
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>

728
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.330
<v Speaker 1>you just shut off.</v>

729
00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:13.164
<v Speaker 1>You stop.</v>

730
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.940
<v Speaker 1>And for all intents and purposes,</v>

731
00:19:14.941 --> 00:19:16.500
<v Speaker 1>you are in another dimension.</v>

732
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.300
<v Speaker 1>And if while you're in that other dimension,</v>

733
00:19:18.301 --> 00:19:22.320
<v Speaker 1>your brain is being pumped with this psychedelic chemical that when you take it,</v>

734
00:19:22.321 --> 00:19:24.810
<v Speaker 1>when you're sober makes you have these incredible experiences.</v>

735
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.033
<v Speaker 1>It only seems to,</v>

736
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.820
<v Speaker 1>it just seems like a normal thing to look into.</v>

737
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Like people should be looking into that.</v>

738
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:30.961
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

739
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:31.240
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

740
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.610
<v Speaker 1>What is what is happening?</v>

741
00:19:32.611 --> 00:19:33.510
<v Speaker 1>When you're sleeping,</v>

742
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 1>you're asleep.</v>

743
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:35.820
<v Speaker 1>You go away.</v>

744
00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.440
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's just so used to it.</v>

745
00:19:37.441 --> 00:19:37.681
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

746
00:19:37.681 --> 00:19:38.514
<v Speaker 1>no big deal.</v>

747
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.750
<v Speaker 1>We just go away.</v>

748
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Just go away for eight hours a day.</v>

749
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:42.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

750
00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:45.030
<v Speaker 1>everybody's scared to die and no one's scared to fall asleep.</v>

751
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:46.131
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

752
00:19:46.131 --> 00:19:46.531
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

753
00:19:46.531 --> 00:19:47.970
<v Speaker 1>you're shutting off man.</v>

754
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.050
<v Speaker 1>He know you're going to be back.</v>

755
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:49.884
<v Speaker 1>So you're not worried,</v>

756
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.060
<v Speaker 1>but you're shutting off.</v>

757
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that is,</v>

758
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:52.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

759
00:19:52.981 --> 00:19:54.180
<v Speaker 1>is just accepted.</v>

760
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.040
<v Speaker 1>If sleeping didn't exist,</v>

761
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.440
<v Speaker 1>it would be the craziest fucking thing.</v>

762
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.420
<v Speaker 1>If all of a sudden you told people that they had to shut off for eight hours a</v>

763
00:20:01.421 --> 00:20:02.910
<v Speaker 1>night and just completely not be,</v>

764
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:03.571
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>

765
00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:04.530
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

766
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:05.670
<v Speaker 1>I got to shut off.</v>

767
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.030
<v Speaker 1>They'll,</v>

768
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:06.421
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

769
00:20:06.421 --> 00:20:09.090
<v Speaker 1>you're going to shut off for eight hours a night and you're not going to know</v>

770
00:20:09.091 --> 00:20:09.924
<v Speaker 1>what's happening.</v>

771
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.940
<v Speaker 1>People can touch your balls while you're sleeping.</v>

772
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.950
<v Speaker 1>He loves no way of stopping them.</v>

773
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.420
<v Speaker 1>He's a lot of things that can happen.</v>

774
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.671
<v Speaker 4>I showed it as like you said,</v>

775
00:20:16.671 --> 00:20:17.270
<v Speaker 4>we don't know.</v>

776
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.780
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

777
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.010
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what the fuck that is.</v>

778
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:19.690
<v Speaker 4>I could,</v>

779
00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:20.180
<v Speaker 4>I could like,</v>

780
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:20.811
<v Speaker 4>you know what I can say?</v>

781
00:20:20.811 --> 00:20:22.370
<v Speaker 4>It's not that I'm afraid to be crazy.</v>

782
00:20:22.371 --> 00:20:23.021
<v Speaker 4>It's just I,</v>

783
00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:24.050
<v Speaker 4>I can say whatever dad,</v>

784
00:20:24.051 --> 00:20:26.870
<v Speaker 4>I won't and we don't know maybe.</v>

785
00:20:26.871 --> 00:20:27.561
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

786
00:20:27.561 --> 00:20:28.071
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

787
00:20:28.071 --> 00:20:28.881
<v Speaker 4>We don't know the truth.</v>

788
00:20:28.881 --> 00:20:29.710
<v Speaker 4>We'd have no idea.</v>

789
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.640
<v Speaker 4>Somebody might be stealing time from you.</v>

790
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.170
<v Speaker 4>They might be stealing time.</v>

791
00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:33.411
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

792
00:20:33.411 --> 00:20:36.190
<v Speaker 4>this motherfucker's got to the true.</v>

793
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.063
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

794
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.980
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I had experience,</v>

795
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.180
<v Speaker 4>but they don't know what it is.</v>

796
00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:45.290
<v Speaker 4>So for me to say it said yet or say it's a dead drug chemical you're talking</v>

797
00:20:45.291 --> 00:20:45.530
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

798
00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

799
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.521
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

800
00:20:46.521 --> 00:20:47.500
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell right now.</v>

801
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.821
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is,</v>

802
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:49.654
<v Speaker 4>but I did,</v>

803
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.493
<v Speaker 4>I felt,</v>

804
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.450
<v Speaker 4>and I get good to have been an experience or not.</v>

805
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I felt maybe I'm crazy and it's the normal thing that everybody would</v>

806
00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:56.080
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

807
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:56.913
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I,</v>

808
00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.031
<v Speaker 4>but right now I,</v>

809
00:20:58.031 --> 00:20:58.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

810
00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:58.661
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

811
00:20:58.661 --> 00:20:58.991
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

812
00:20:58.991 --> 00:20:59.630
<v Speaker 4>It's too,</v>

813
00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm making my own research too to found out about that.</v>

814
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.830
<v Speaker 4>How are you researching?</v>

815
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.200
<v Speaker 4>And I research a lot of stuff.</v>

816
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:05.650
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

817

<v Speaker 4>go on the Internet now.</v>

819
00:21:09.341 --> 00:21:10.840
<v Speaker 4>It's another thing that he just said to me.</v>

820
00:21:10.841 --> 00:21:12.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to research that Maine by research on the room.</v>

821
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.340
<v Speaker 4>I maybe by research things that people that have,</v>

822
00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:18.160
<v Speaker 4>I've tried because that lap lap sauce time that you don't remember,</v>

823
00:21:18.161 --> 00:21:18.461
<v Speaker 4>they've been,</v>

824
00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:20.220
<v Speaker 4>some people been hypnotized on the ad.</v>

825
00:21:20.221 --> 00:21:20.831
<v Speaker 4>The bad,</v>

826
00:21:20.831 --> 00:21:22.360
<v Speaker 4>the bad,</v>

827
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:22.840
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

828
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.531
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

829
00:21:23.531 --> 00:21:24.221
<v Speaker 4>Is that venture,</v>

830
00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:25.510
<v Speaker 4>and I don't want to be an uptight.</v>

831
00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

832
00:21:26.211 --> 00:21:28.040
<v Speaker 1>that was very controversial.</v>

833
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:29.031
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>

834
00:21:29.031 --> 00:21:30.980
<v Speaker 1>what's happening during hypnosis,</v>

835
00:21:30.981 --> 00:21:32.030
<v Speaker 1>hypnotic regression.</v>

836
00:21:32.031 --> 00:21:35.510
<v Speaker 1>It's very controversial because there's a lot of people that believe that you</v>

837
00:21:35.511 --> 00:21:38.990
<v Speaker 1>can introduce fake memories and to a person while they're unconscious,</v>

838
00:21:38.991 --> 00:21:40.040
<v Speaker 1>and then you could,</v>

839
00:21:40.041 --> 00:21:40.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

840
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.630
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

841
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.941
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

842
00:21:40.941 --> 00:21:45.470
<v Speaker 1>you could steer the events in one way or another and introduced false memories.</v>

843
00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:46.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

844
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not very,</v>

845
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:48.290
<v Speaker 1>it's not very reliable.</v>

846
00:21:48.291 --> 00:21:49.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

847
00:21:49.311 --> 00:21:52.670
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the big things about these people that have these crazy stories</v>

848
00:21:52.671 --> 00:21:53.720
<v Speaker 1>from hypnotic regression.</v>

849
00:21:53.721 --> 00:21:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck is really going on?</v>

850
00:21:55.371 --> 00:21:55.581
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

851
00:21:55.581 --> 00:21:56.330
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

852
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.780
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times people that are in therapy in the first place or a little wound,</v>

853
00:21:59.781 --> 00:22:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Doris,</v>

854
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:00.650
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

855
00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:02.810
<v Speaker 1>So it's that those are the type of people that you're,</v>

856
00:22:02.811 --> 00:22:03.471
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with.</v>

857
00:22:03.471 --> 00:22:04.610
<v Speaker 1>You're hypnotizing them.</v>

858
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.060
<v Speaker 1>And then you're finding out about these nutty experiences with aliens.</v>

859
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what the fuck</v>

860
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.080
<v Speaker 4>you're really,</v>

861
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.800
<v Speaker 4>it so credit.</v>

862
00:22:11.801 --> 00:22:12.634
<v Speaker 4>He's just the same.</v>

863
00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.220
<v Speaker 4>You take a fish and they'll water.</v>

864
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:16.300
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

865
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:16.930
<v Speaker 4>And that fisheries,</v>

866
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:17.763
<v Speaker 4>it isn't.</v>

867
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.270
<v Speaker 4>And then as that environment,</v>

868
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.530
<v Speaker 4>let's say a fisherman,</v>

869
00:22:20.531 --> 00:22:21.940
<v Speaker 4>he grabbed a fish in the water,</v>

870
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.530
<v Speaker 4>it pulls it off the water,</v>

871
00:22:23.531 --> 00:22:24.364
<v Speaker 4>look at him,</v>

872
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.411
<v Speaker 4>look at meg,</v>

873
00:22:25.411 --> 00:22:28.390
<v Speaker 4>the official guy around and drop the fish back in the water.</v>

874
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.400
<v Speaker 4>The fish after is going to go back to his friend and he's going to tell it.</v>

875
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.660
<v Speaker 4>The other efficient man,</v>

876
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.760
<v Speaker 4>I build it out of the water in and it was,</v>

877
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.460
<v Speaker 4>the people were breeding area was another environment.</v>

878
00:22:39.461 --> 00:22:40.870
<v Speaker 4>I saw a human being pulled,</v>

879
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:41.831
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

880
00:22:41.831 --> 00:22:42.131
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

881
00:22:42.131 --> 00:22:43.450
<v Speaker 4>and men grabbing me,</v>

882
00:22:43.451 --> 00:22:44.290
<v Speaker 4>I saw trees,</v>

883
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:45.850
<v Speaker 4>I saw a bird in the sky.</v>

884
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:46.571
<v Speaker 4>I saw,</v>

885
00:22:46.571 --> 00:22:47.470
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

886
00:22:47.471 --> 00:22:47.840
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

887
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.611
<v Speaker 4>like I son,</v>

888
00:22:48.611 --> 00:22:49.121
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

889
00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:52.030
<v Speaker 4>I see a different thing in different universe.</v>

890
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.050
<v Speaker 4>And then you put it back.</v>

891
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:53.890
<v Speaker 4>The other official thing,</v>

892
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.910
<v Speaker 4>he's completely insane,</v>

893
00:22:54.911 --> 00:22:55.744
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

894
00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:00.230
<v Speaker 4>So maybe in a way we're all like fish and,</v>

895
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.730
<v Speaker 4>and maybe there is something and you said that when you see,</v>

896
00:23:03.731 --> 00:23:07.600
<v Speaker 4>but another university or another or well or something and we don't know and</v>

897
00:23:07.601 --> 00:23:08.411
<v Speaker 4>we're right next to it,</v>

898
00:23:08.411 --> 00:23:09.244
<v Speaker 4>but we don't know.</v>

899
00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.140
<v Speaker 4>And if that's what I'm doing,</v>

900
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:11.561
<v Speaker 4>research,</v>

901
00:23:11.561 --> 00:23:12.180
<v Speaker 4>I want to see,</v>

902
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:12.511
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

903
00:23:12.511 --> 00:23:12.650
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

904
00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:13.960
<v Speaker 4>when I grow as a human being,</v>

905
00:23:13.961 --> 00:23:14.470
<v Speaker 4>fine,</v>

906
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:15.850
<v Speaker 4>what was the truth?</v>

907
00:23:15.851 --> 00:23:19.530
<v Speaker 4>Even though I probably will never found out the truth and I want to get close</v>

908
00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:20.170
<v Speaker 4>circles or,</v>

909
00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:21.570
<v Speaker 4>and find my own research to see what,</v>

910
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:22.301
<v Speaker 4>what's happening,</v>

911
00:23:22.301 --> 00:23:22.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

912
00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.970
<v Speaker 4>and we're all in the same pattern.</v>

913
00:23:24.971 --> 00:23:25.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

914
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.220
<v Speaker 1>you know what I think the problem with fine people wanting to find the truth is</v>

915
00:23:29.221 --> 00:23:30.330
<v Speaker 1>there is no truth.</v>

916
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.740
<v Speaker 1>There are truths.</v>

917
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:36.120
<v Speaker 1>I think there is no one truth and everyone is like [inaudible] I hope to find</v>

918
00:23:36.121 --> 00:23:36.601
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>

919
00:23:36.601 --> 00:23:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you talking about?</v>

920
00:23:37.561 --> 00:23:38.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not one thing.</v>

921
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.720
<v Speaker 1>There's truths,</v>

922
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:41.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of information.</v>

923
00:23:41.461 --> 00:23:42.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stuff.</v>

924
00:23:42.391 --> 00:23:43.500
<v Speaker 1>And to call it the truth,</v>

925
00:23:43.501 --> 00:23:45.610
<v Speaker 1>like to figure out the whole big thing.</v>

926
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.320
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible for our brains to it to grasp like an aunt doesn't know</v>

927
00:23:50.321 --> 00:23:52.180
<v Speaker 1>what a cell phone tower is.</v>

928
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:52.800
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

929
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.400
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible for our brains to grasp the enormity of,</v>

930
00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:58.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

931
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.780
<v Speaker 1>going from protons and cells and,</v>

932
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:02.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

933
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.940
<v Speaker 1>an animal and a planet and a galaxy in a universe,</v>

934
00:24:06.941 --> 00:24:08.500
<v Speaker 1>in multiple universes.</v>

935
00:24:08.501 --> 00:24:10.900
<v Speaker 1>And it's not too much with,</v>

936
00:24:10.901 --> 00:24:14.590
<v Speaker 1>this was just no way you're going to be able to take all the things that are</v>

937
00:24:14.591 --> 00:24:18.790
<v Speaker 1>going in all over the world and understand it all and understand the pieces that</v>

938
00:24:18.791 --> 00:24:19.624
<v Speaker 1>it falls into.</v>

939
00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:20.560
<v Speaker 1>It's not possible.</v>

940
00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:21.730
<v Speaker 1>So this whole thing where it was like,</v>

941
00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:22.271
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

942
00:24:22.271 --> 00:24:22.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

943
00:24:22.541 --> 00:24:23.740
<v Speaker 1>hopefully I find the truth.</v>

944
00:24:23.741 --> 00:24:24.940
<v Speaker 1>You will find truths.</v>

945
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:25.361
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

946
00:24:25.361 --> 00:24:28.720
<v Speaker 1>you'll never find the truth cause you're a a monkey.</v>

947
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:30.230
<v Speaker 4>Well private,</v>

948
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:31.430
<v Speaker 4>nothing that we're not smart enough.</v>

949
00:24:31.431 --> 00:24:31.870
<v Speaker 4>We're not that.</v>

950
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:32.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

951
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:32.880
<v Speaker 4>that sound,</v>

952
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.310
<v Speaker 4>what did you say?</v>

953
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.561
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>

954
00:24:33.561 --> 00:24:34.394
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>

955
00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:39.410
<v Speaker 1>we're being birthed into a whole new universe of information that's never</v>

956
00:24:41.211 --> 00:24:43.430
<v Speaker 1>existed for any previous human beings.</v>

957
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:44.930
<v Speaker 1>And we're not designed for it.</v>

958
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:46.520
<v Speaker 1>We're not designed to process this,</v>

959
00:24:46.521 --> 00:24:49.910
<v Speaker 1>were designed to figure out where the deer going or designed to figure out who</v>

960
00:24:49.911 --> 00:24:50.780
<v Speaker 1>do you want to fuck.</v>

961
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.250
<v Speaker 1>We're designed to think this guy,</v>

962
00:24:52.251 --> 00:24:53.720
<v Speaker 1>he's probably going to take over my village,</v>

963
00:24:53.721 --> 00:24:54.530
<v Speaker 1>this con.</v>

964
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we're designed.</v>

965
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.120
<v Speaker 1>And then within the last 10,000 years,</v>

966
00:24:59.121 --> 00:25:00.830
<v Speaker 1>that has become,</v>

967
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

968
00:25:01.281 --> 00:25:04.790
<v Speaker 1>watching like space documentaries and getting on the Internet.</v>

969
00:25:04.791 --> 00:25:06.230
<v Speaker 1>And if it's too much,</v>

970
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:06.981
<v Speaker 1>it's no,</v>

971
00:25:06.981 --> 00:25:07.641
<v Speaker 1>there's no way.</v>

972
00:25:07.641 --> 00:25:08.121
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

973
00:25:08.121 --> 00:25:09.890
<v Speaker 1>You know exactly what's going on over the world.</v>

974
00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:10.770
<v Speaker 1>You'll go crazy.</v>

975
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.150
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the time.</v>

976
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.780
<v Speaker 4>It will take a lot of time in and it's still yeah.</v>

977
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.653
<v Speaker 4>To acclimate.</v>

978
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.041
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

979
00:25:17.041 --> 00:25:17.321
<v Speaker 4>100.</v>

980
00:25:17.321 --> 00:25:18.154
<v Speaker 4>What's up with that?</v>

981
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of like a lot of these guys like Dan Hardee,</v>

982
00:25:20.861 --> 00:25:24.700
<v Speaker 1>did this go into Peru and they take those Iowasca ceremonies?</v>

983
00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:25.683
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about that?</v>

984
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:26.170
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

985
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:27.003
<v Speaker 1>You didn't hear about that?</v>

986
00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

987
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Dan Hardee did it again.</v>

988
00:25:29.711 --> 00:25:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Wait to get him on the podcast and talk to him about it.</v>

989
00:25:31.721 --> 00:25:33.130
<v Speaker 1>But he said it changed his whole life.</v>

990
00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.750
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same thing.</v>

991
00:25:34.751 --> 00:25:35.584
<v Speaker 1>It's DMT.</v>

992
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.810
<v Speaker 1>It's these Amazon Indians.</v>

993
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:38.020
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

994
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.310
<v Speaker 1>they make it in a,</v>

995
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:43.840
<v Speaker 1>a brew and the active ingredient is in this brew is DMT.</v>

996
00:25:43.841 --> 00:25:48.841
<v Speaker 1>And they have the ceremonies and they all get together and they'll play music.</v>

997
00:25:48.881 --> 00:25:53.050
<v Speaker 1>And this guy like blows tobacco smoke in your face and he'd drink this stuff and</v>

998
00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:55.690
<v Speaker 1>an hour and 20 minutes later they enter into the spirit world,</v>

999
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.150
<v Speaker 1>have life changing visions,</v>

1000
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:03.300
<v Speaker 1>the wildest physical manifestations of your imagination you could ever possibly</v>

1001
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.520
<v Speaker 1>think of and dream of.</v>

1002
00:26:06.521 --> 00:26:07.600
<v Speaker 1>You can't even think about it.</v>

1003
00:26:07.601 --> 00:26:07.961
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

1004
00:26:07.961 --> 00:26:09.400
<v Speaker 1>you can't even put into words.</v>

1005
00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's legal in Peru,</v>

1006
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1007
00:26:11.561 --> 00:26:13.150
<v Speaker 1>it's legal and parts of South America.</v>

1008
00:26:13.151 --> 00:26:14.500
<v Speaker 1>So people are going down there.</v>

1009
00:26:14.501 --> 00:26:17.920
<v Speaker 1>This Americans are going down there on a regular basis and having these shamanic</v>

1010
00:26:17.921 --> 00:26:18.371
<v Speaker 1>rituals,</v>

1011
00:26:18.371 --> 00:26:19.780
<v Speaker 1>life changing rituals,</v>

1012
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:22.840
<v Speaker 1>and it's all based on the same thing that comes out of your brain when you're</v>

1013
00:26:22.841 --> 00:26:23.360

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1160
00:29:20.411 --> 00:29:21.400
<v Speaker 5>I watch all those,</v>

1161
00:29:21.401 --> 00:29:22.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1162
00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:22.691
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

1163
00:29:22.691 --> 00:29:23.430
<v Speaker 5>I've always</v>

1164
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.961
<v Speaker 1>been a big,</v>

1165
00:29:23.961 --> 00:29:26.630
<v Speaker 1>big fan of MMA and I think that it's,</v>

1166
00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:29.780
<v Speaker 1>it's so important that there's all these other organizations going on like,</v>

1167
00:29:29.781 --> 00:29:30.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1168
00:29:30.051 --> 00:29:30.580
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

1169
00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.790
<v Speaker 1>that MFC up in Canada and it used to be strike force and you know,</v>

1170
00:29:34.791 --> 00:29:36.530
<v Speaker 1>now this Bella Tor is doing really well.</v>

1171
00:29:36.531 --> 00:29:41.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like so important to have a bunch of different outlets for guys to pursue</v>

1172
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 1>careers.</v>

1173
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.590
<v Speaker 4>But up in Canada was just like that Tko organization.</v>

1174
00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:44.861
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1175
00:29:44.861 --> 00:29:45.930
<v Speaker 4>And then a couple anymore.</v>

1176
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:46.211
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1177
00:29:46.211 --> 00:29:49.090
<v Speaker 4>it was pretty much I'll need t that TK when you guys fought in a ring.</v>

1178
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:50.081
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1179
00:29:50.081 --> 00:29:51.130
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't hearing back down.</v>

1180
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:51.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1181
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.770
<v Speaker 4>What do you do some guys prefer the ring.</v>

1182
00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:54.480
<v Speaker 4>What do you prefer?</v>

1183
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:54.731
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1184
00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:55.270
<v Speaker 4>the cage.</v>

1185
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 4>The cage.</v>

1186
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.081
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:29:56.081 --> 00:29:56.914
<v Speaker 4>The ring is,</v>

1188
00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.510
<v Speaker 4>it's not the environment,</v>

1189
00:29:58.570 --> 00:29:59.403
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1190
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.230
<v Speaker 4>the cage as better or I would read or do like,</v>

1191
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:02.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1192
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.360
<v Speaker 4>add the cages perfect.</v>

1193
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:05.141
<v Speaker 4>As circular,</v>

1194
00:30:05.141 --> 00:30:09.250
<v Speaker 4>like octagon or a circular cage or even better than entering.</v>

1195
00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.120
<v Speaker 4>That would be like a platform where it,</v>

1196
00:30:12.121 --> 00:30:13.810
<v Speaker 4>where there is no walls.</v>

1197
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.030
<v Speaker 4>There is a like a</v>

1198
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.370
<v Speaker 5>like align,</v>

1199
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:18.120
<v Speaker 5>align.</v>

1200
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:18.280
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1201
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:18.401
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1202
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:19.031
<v Speaker 5>you don't fall.</v>

1203
00:30:19.031 --> 00:30:21.450
<v Speaker 5>But there is a line and if you step across and I didn't put you,</v>

1204
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:24.310
<v Speaker 5>they put you back but there was a line and then there was a,</v>

1205
00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:27.250
<v Speaker 4>I beg you it so you don't fall about this platform and</v>

1206
00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:28.740
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1207
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:29.600
<v Speaker 5>I see what you're saying.</v>

1208
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:34.670
<v Speaker 5>That's the Super League and it's a bit like wrestling assuming yeah.</v>

1209
00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.461
<v Speaker 5>Kind of similar.</v>

1210
00:30:35.461 --> 00:30:35.611
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1211
00:30:35.611 --> 00:30:36.061
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

1212
00:30:36.061 --> 00:30:37.140
<v Speaker 5>Then it wouldn't be good too.</v>

1213
00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:37.591
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1214
00:30:37.591 --> 00:30:38.490
<v Speaker 5>that's not a bad idea.</v>

1215
00:30:38.491 --> 00:30:40.170
<v Speaker 5>It's just a space consideration.</v>

1216
00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:41.730
<v Speaker 5>Probably the exact ad on know for sure.</v>

1217
00:30:41.731 --> 00:30:43.330
<v Speaker 5>Exactly what want some Brock Lesnar do.</v>

1218
00:30:43.331 --> 00:30:45.210
<v Speaker 5>Just steamroll and someone write into the crowd.</v>

1219
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:45.841
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>

1220
00:30:45.841 --> 00:30:46.651
<v Speaker 5>And I know that would be,</v>

1221
00:30:46.651 --> 00:30:47.510
<v Speaker 5>that wouldn't be a quarter but,</v>

1222
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.190
<v Speaker 5>but something like that or you know,</v>

1223
00:30:50.191 --> 00:30:51.024
<v Speaker 5>I think they got,</v>

1224
00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:51.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1225
00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.201
<v Speaker 5>the the cage.</v>

1226
00:30:52.201 --> 00:30:52.860
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty good.</v>

1227
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:52.931
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1228
00:30:52.931 --> 00:30:54.090
<v Speaker 5>no it's a good day surface.</v>

1229
00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:54.841
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:30:54.841 --> 00:30:59.160
<v Speaker 5>The only objection that people have as fans and sometimes it makes the action a</v>

1231
00:30:59.161 --> 00:30:59.641
<v Speaker 5>little harder.</v>

1232
00:30:59.641 --> 00:31:00.960
<v Speaker 5>See Two there,</v>

1233
00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:01.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1234
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.221
<v Speaker 5>watching it at home,</v>

1235
00:31:02.221 --> 00:31:02.940
<v Speaker 5>it's perfect.</v>

1236
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they could make a,</v>

1237
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.633
<v Speaker 4>I meant Ariel,</v>

1238
00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:10.140
<v Speaker 4>which is like a window that could see truet like a plastic window.</v>

1239
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:12.010
<v Speaker 5>Turn it off racy and shit.</v>

1240
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.200
<v Speaker 5>Every time dudes would be like that.</v>

1241
00:31:14.201 --> 00:31:16.180
<v Speaker 5>Daniel Cromey a frank Mir fight happened.</v>

1242
00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:16.450
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1243
00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.550
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing would be just grease.</v>

1244
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.330
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't be able to see shit cause they,</v>

1245
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:23.560
<v Speaker 5>those guys pressed up against every spot on that cage.</v>

1246
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:24.180
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1247
00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:24.911
<v Speaker 5>It's awesome girl.</v>

1248
00:31:24.911 --> 00:31:28.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm in May now and it can be like a carwash liquor at girl and the main car.</v>

1249
00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.173
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there is.</v>

1250
00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.540
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of things I would've changed at this point.</v>

1251
00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:35.530
<v Speaker 5>First of all the time.</v>

1252
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.393
<v Speaker 5>There's no time,</v>

1253
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.233
<v Speaker 5>no round.</v>

1254
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:38.643
<v Speaker 5>I think he's,</v>

1255
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:39.360
<v Speaker 5>I think seriously.</v>

1256
00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.300
<v Speaker 5>I believe it's stupid.</v>

1257
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:41.560
<v Speaker 5>The wrong one.</v>

1258
00:31:41.561 --> 00:31:41.810
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

1259
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:42.520
<v Speaker 5>Was the best mountain.</v>

1260
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.390
<v Speaker 5>Let them fight,</v>

1261
00:31:43.391 --> 00:31:44.224
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1262
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.230
<v Speaker 5>15 minutes or maybe 25 minutes for the championship.</v>

1263
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.541
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1264
00:31:47.541 --> 00:31:47.890
<v Speaker 5>Around.</v>

1265
00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:48.850
<v Speaker 5>And why did that round,</v>

1266
00:31:48.851 --> 00:31:50.170
<v Speaker 5>why we tried to be like boxing,</v>

1267
00:31:50.171 --> 00:31:50.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1268
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:51.380
<v Speaker 5>or not boxers.</v>

1269
00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:52.270
<v Speaker 5>They did.</v>

1270
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:56.620
<v Speaker 5>They did the round to be like boxing to be accepted as a sport.</v>

1271
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.450
<v Speaker 5>It would probably be a lot more finishes.</v>

1272
00:31:58.770 --> 00:31:59.400
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't,</v>

1273
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.233
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1274
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:01.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah of course.</v>

1275
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.800
<v Speaker 5>100% no round.</v>

1276
00:32:02.801 --> 00:32:03.071
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1277
00:32:03.071 --> 00:32:03.641
<v Speaker 5>and I got this,</v>

1278
00:32:03.641 --> 00:32:04.540
<v Speaker 5>this is ridiculous.</v>

1279
00:32:04.541 --> 00:32:05.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean I like it.</v>

1280
00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:06.361
<v Speaker 5>Me,</v>

1281
00:32:06.361 --> 00:32:06.750
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

1282
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:06.980
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

1283
00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:07.660
<v Speaker 5>It's a receipt.</v>

1284
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.870
<v Speaker 5>Do you think it's possible that the UFC would you,</v>

1285
00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.241
<v Speaker 5>would you,</v>

1286
00:32:10.241 --> 00:32:13.570
<v Speaker 5>would you fight someone like that 100% to arrange that?</v>

1287
00:32:13.571 --> 00:32:15.100
<v Speaker 5>Like as a particular rule,</v>

1288
00:32:15.101 --> 00:32:18.130
<v Speaker 5>like maybe the UFC could do it in Russia or somewhere where they're gangster</v>

1289
00:32:18.131 --> 00:32:18.610
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

1290
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:18.851
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1291
00:32:18.851 --> 00:32:19.080
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

1292
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:19.570
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

1293
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:20.620
<v Speaker 5>I would rather like,</v>

1294
00:32:20.621 --> 00:32:21.560
<v Speaker 5>I would rather fight it.</v>

1295
00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 5>A rule like this.</v>

1296
00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:25.300
<v Speaker 5>I think it would be more honest like it who's that better than a man at that</v>

1297
00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.370
<v Speaker 5>fight that could have happened in pride.</v>

1298
00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.700
<v Speaker 5>They did that and pride right with this isn't hoists Gracie have a 90 minute</v>

1299
00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:32.150
<v Speaker 5>match with Sakharova.</v>

1300
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.250
<v Speaker 5>But I think that was like,</v>

1301
00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.470
<v Speaker 5>even then it was like that.</v>

1302
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.360

1369
00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:03.410
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] needed to have so much courage back in the day to step into the</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm like the,</v>

1384
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.720
<v Speaker 5>this is a one time use.</v>

1385
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:30.431
<v Speaker 5>This is the,</v>

1386
00:34:30.431 --> 00:34:31.630
<v Speaker 5>the guys that pioneer,</v>

1387

00:34:32.361 --> 00:34:34.010

<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1391

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

00:34:35.001 --> 00:34:36.160
<v Speaker 5>There was no referee stopping.</v>

1393
00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:36.411
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1394
00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:37.181
<v Speaker 5>no referee,</v>

1395
00:34:37.181 --> 00:34:37.641
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1396
00:34:37.641 --> 00:34:38.151
<v Speaker 5>round.</v>

<v Speaker 5>At Lake Commission and no awake glass.</v>

1401
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:42.523
<v Speaker 5>no way.</v>

1402
00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.920
<v Speaker 5>Lights were fights get stopped quickly.</v>

1403
00:34:45.921 --> 00:34:46.820
<v Speaker 5>Does that Piss you off?</v>

1404
00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:48.520
<v Speaker 5>Why didn't,</v>

1405
00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:48.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1406
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:49.880
<v Speaker 5>it's to protect the,</v>

1407
00:34:49.881 --> 00:34:50.090
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1408
00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:50.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1409
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:52.160
<v Speaker 5>at the referee can make a mistake sometime.</v>

1410
00:34:52.161 --> 00:34:53.200
<v Speaker 5>And it pissed me off yet.</v>

1411
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:55.400
<v Speaker 5>Sad to see it when his a mistake done.</v>

1412
00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:56.261
<v Speaker 5>I think they,</v>

1413
00:34:56.261 --> 00:34:58.100
<v Speaker 5>they tried to be the best they could be.</v>

1414
00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.240
<v Speaker 5>But like the,</v>

1415
00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.310
<v Speaker 5>I believe the round,</v>

1416
00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1417
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:03.740
<v Speaker 5>I don't think grown is good idea.</v>

1418
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.540
<v Speaker 5>That's my open year round.</v>

1419
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:07.491
<v Speaker 5>It's a good idea.</v>

1420
00:35:07.491 --> 00:35:07.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1421
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:08.900
<v Speaker 5>What about gloves?</v>

1422
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.260
<v Speaker 5>Some people think there should be no gloves.</v>

1423
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.760
<v Speaker 5>Some people think Nia guy and elbow guy and kick a guy.</v>

1424
00:35:16.761 --> 00:35:18.680
<v Speaker 5>Like why are they have covers on your knuckles?</v>

1425
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:19.520
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

1426
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.900
<v Speaker 5>It could be an option but no glove.</v>

1427
00:35:20.901 --> 00:35:22.220
<v Speaker 5>But they would be a lot of broken him.</v>

1428
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.270
<v Speaker 5>But that probably they would fight different migration.</v>

1429
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.620
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1430
00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.520
<v Speaker 5>I wrote stuff that they used to hit a lot with the,</v>

1431
00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.200
<v Speaker 5>smashed it down,</v>

1432
00:35:30.201 --> 00:35:31.034
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1433
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:32.021
<v Speaker 5>Well if you,</v>

1434
00:35:32.021 --> 00:35:32.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1435
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.720
<v Speaker 5>she wants the old boss Rutan days and pancreas,</v>

1436
00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.520
<v Speaker 5>he figured out that he could throw punches</v>

1437
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.880
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1438
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.560
<v Speaker 1>he pulls his hand way back.</v>

1439
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.830
<v Speaker 1>So instead of like slapping and like karate chop style,</v>

1440
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:47.340
<v Speaker 1>he was throwing punches but he was doing with his palm.</v>

1441
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1442
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:49.710
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is we wouldn't fight that same way.</v>

1443
00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:50.544
<v Speaker 4>We would fight now,</v>

1444
00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:52.440
<v Speaker 4>preserve our buddy like,</v>

1445
00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:54.270
<v Speaker 4>and I like it when I fucked in the ass.</v>

1446
00:35:54.271 --> 00:35:54.640
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't,</v>

1447
00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:58.890
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't turtle Bush and I was punching like if I were to be bare hand,</v>

1448
00:35:58.891 --> 00:36:01.110
<v Speaker 4>I would hit with my palm.</v>

1449
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.861
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1450
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:03.420
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't get that same way.</v>

1451
00:36:03.421 --> 00:36:07.110
<v Speaker 4>I would have probably be broke my hand or I never had my hand broken.</v>

1452
00:36:07.111 --> 00:36:07.851
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm at.</v>

1453
00:36:07.851 --> 00:36:08.401
<v Speaker 4>I'm lucky,</v>

1454
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:09.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1455
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:09.781
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1456
00:36:09.781 --> 00:36:10.614
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1457
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.070
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

1458
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:11.670
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

1459
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:12.181
<v Speaker 4>different way.</v>

1460
00:36:12.181 --> 00:36:14.010
<v Speaker 4>It would make it better also for the,</v>

1461
00:36:14.011 --> 00:36:18.930
<v Speaker 4>all the grappling aspect of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and wrestling is I would be</v>

1462
00:36:18.931 --> 00:36:19.630
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

1463
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:20.740
<v Speaker 1>It would be more realistic.</v>

1464
00:36:20.741 --> 00:36:21.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1465
00:36:21.011 --> 00:36:23.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't really understand why they have a pat on the gloves.</v>

1466
00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:23.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1467
00:36:23.921 --> 00:36:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a 100% I don't know if you don't have pads on your shins and your</v>

1468
00:36:28.691 --> 00:36:31.240
<v Speaker 1>kicking people in the face like come on.</v>

1469
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.990
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1470
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to pad little knuckles and yeah,</v>

1471
00:36:34.211 --> 00:36:35.200
<v Speaker 1>you can cut people more,</v>

1472
00:36:35.201 --> 00:36:36.460
<v Speaker 1>but it also breaks your hand more.</v>

1473
00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:37.031
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1474
00:36:37.031 --> 00:36:37.851
<v Speaker 1>it's if you want to,</v>

1475
00:36:37.851 --> 00:36:38.684
<v Speaker 1>if this sport,</v>

1476
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.960
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to have it be realistic,</v>

1477
00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:45.100
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like bad to allow people to wear gloves because it allows them to</v>

1478
00:36:45.101 --> 00:36:48.760
<v Speaker 1>tee off and punches hard as they can without worrying about breaking their hands</v>

1479
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:49.760
<v Speaker 4>100%.</v>

1480
00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.361
<v Speaker 4>100%.</v>

1481
00:36:50.361 --> 00:36:50.900
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

1482
00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:51.733
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

1483
00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.311
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

1484
00:36:52.311 --> 00:36:52.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1485
00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:53.150
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1486
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1487
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:54.710
<v Speaker 4>you could break your hand,</v>

1488
00:36:54.711 --> 00:36:55.101
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1489
00:36:55.101 --> 00:36:58.100
<v Speaker 4>when you hit that guy with a good bunch on and their Dra,</v>

1490
00:36:58.410 --> 00:36:58.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1491
00:36:58.821 --> 00:37:00.770
<v Speaker 4>at bare knuckle I don't think it will break your hand,</v>

1492
00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.633
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1493
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:02.810
<v Speaker 4>just doing karate,</v>

1494
00:37:02.811 --> 00:37:03.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1495
00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:03.761
<v Speaker 4>Kevin cushion,</v>

1496
00:37:03.761 --> 00:37:03.931
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1497
00:37:03.931 --> 00:37:04.251
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1498
00:37:04.251 --> 00:37:04.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1499
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:06.420
<v Speaker 1>well people are also um,</v>

1500
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:07.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1501
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.310
<v Speaker 1>punch much harder of course because the tape and I don't think it's there.</v>

1502
00:37:10.311 --> 00:37:11.290
<v Speaker 1>The Grad I think is that they,</v>

1503
00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:12.270
<v Speaker 1>the holder risk.</v>

1504
00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.700
<v Speaker 1>So there was no movement than there is at everything.</v>

1505
00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:17.520
<v Speaker 1>All the impact makes it hard or is definitely,</v>

1506
00:37:17.521 --> 00:37:18.354
<v Speaker 1>that's why I believe,</v>

1507
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:19.261
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1508
00:37:19.261 --> 00:37:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I think the hand wrap definitely aids the person who's punching.</v>

1509
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:26.310
<v Speaker 1>But you also would be really cognizant of only punching with the first two</v>

1510
00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:27.144
<v Speaker 1>knuckles,</v>

1511
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:27.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1512
00:37:27.451 --> 00:37:28.440
<v Speaker 1>cause in boxing,</v>

1513
00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.900
<v Speaker 1>you know your toe,</v>

1514
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.630
<v Speaker 1>you taught to punch and concentrate on those knuckles button.</v>

1515
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Real reality.</v>

1516
00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:35.580
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times when you throw in combinations,</v>

1517
00:37:35.581 --> 00:37:37.380
<v Speaker 1>you're hitting them with all parts of your hand.</v>

1518
00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you're taught in karate,</v>

1519
00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:40.800
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a punching,</v>

1520
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:41.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1521
00:37:41.281 --> 00:37:43.440
<v Speaker 1>like a mock Mara over and over and over again.</v>

1522
00:37:43.441 --> 00:37:43.941
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough,</v>

1523
00:37:43.941 --> 00:37:48.270
<v Speaker 1>and these two knuckles Jack Dempsey says is that third Nicole the third note.</v>

1524
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:48.571
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1525
00:37:48.571 --> 00:37:51.780
<v Speaker 1>He was punished with that Turret Nakota and it was no Starbucks cup power.</v>

1526
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:52.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1527
00:37:52.261 --> 00:37:53.370
<v Speaker 1>he could punch very hard.</v>

1528
00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Just I'm so he says is that third I call called because he said that I like him</v>

1529
00:37:56.221 --> 00:37:58.200
<v Speaker 1>enough that buddy is better with at third knuckle.</v>

1530
00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1531
00:37:58.830 --> 00:37:59.663
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1532
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:02.220
<v Speaker 1>So maybe I wouldn't never argue with Jack Dempsey,</v>

1533
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:05.730
<v Speaker 1>but for most people believe that it's the first time I can cut,</v>

1534
00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:05.940
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1535
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:06.900
<v Speaker 1>The same thing they teach.</v>

1536
00:38:06.901 --> 00:38:10.920
<v Speaker 1>But Jack Dempsey strangely says the third Nicola in that book,</v>

1537
00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:13.170
<v Speaker 1>he says that that guy was a fucking savage,</v>

1538
00:38:13.171 --> 00:38:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1539
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1540
00:38:14.101 --> 00:38:14.934
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

1541
00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.130
<v Speaker 1>watch those old old school fights and he would find dude's much bigger than him.</v>

1542
00:38:19.131 --> 00:38:22.830
<v Speaker 1>He was only at about a buck 90 and he was like one 96 or something like that</v>

1543
00:38:22.831 --> 00:38:24.720
<v Speaker 1>when he was the heavyweight champion.</v>

1544
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.060
<v Speaker 1>He was fucking up those.</v>

1545
00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:27.601
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1546
00:38:27.601 --> 00:38:28.351
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong.</v>

1547
00:38:28.351 --> 00:38:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I think actually Jack Dempsey was even lighter than that.</v>

1548
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I think Jack Dempsey,</v>

1549
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:32.790
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>

1550
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:33.623
<v Speaker 1>Let me pull it up.</v>

1551
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't even</v>

1552
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:39.060
<v Speaker 1>think he was 196 rocky Marciano,</v>

1553
00:38:39.061 --> 00:38:40.050
<v Speaker 1>which has really Sarah?</v>

1554
00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:40.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1555
00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.760
<v Speaker 1>was one 75 yeah.</v>

1556
00:38:41.761 --> 00:38:42.960
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck man?</v>

1557
00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.450
<v Speaker 1>This certain dudes like that,</v>

1558
00:38:45.451 --> 00:38:47.940
<v Speaker 1>that chicks just can hit so fucking hard.</v>

1559
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:48.431
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1560
00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:49.040
<v Speaker 4>but they're all,</v>

1561
00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.400
<v Speaker 4>but it was not as big as well,</v>

1562
00:38:51.401 --> 00:38:51.860
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1563
00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.880
<v Speaker 4>Now we're like months that I looked at Klitschko,</v>

1564
00:38:54.881 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1565
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:55.811
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy,</v>

1566
00:38:55.811 --> 00:38:56.240
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1567
00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1568
00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.370
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't say his weight</v>

1569
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.580
<v Speaker 1>on his Wikipedia says is a,</v>

1570
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.473
<v Speaker 1>he was six foot,</v>

1571
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.110
<v Speaker 4>not sandal or Dempsey.</v>

1572
00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:05.220
<v Speaker 4>It.</v>

1573
00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:09.490
<v Speaker 4>Monsanto was like one seven one one 75 one then one 80</v>

1574
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Marsianno was one 85</v>

1575
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:15.050
<v Speaker 4>mass general was,</v>

1576
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:16.920
<v Speaker 4>I remember I read it was a one 80 none.</v>

1577
00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:17.330
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

1578
00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:18.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he was.</v>

1579
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:21.170
<v Speaker 4>Dempsey was one 92 that's crazy.</v>

1580
00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:21.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1581
00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.450
<v Speaker 4>It's like my size.</v>

1582
00:39:22.451 --> 00:39:26.390
<v Speaker 4>It's my size fighting the every white guy like Brock Lesnar over these shoots.</v>

1583
00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:27.581
<v Speaker 1>But they do,</v>

1584
00:39:27.581 --> 00:39:29.940
<v Speaker 1>they have those little tiny ass gloves back then.</v>

1585
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:30.390
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

1586
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:31.070
<v Speaker 1>They just a little,</v>

1587
00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.360
<v Speaker 1>a little cover over the knuckles.</v>

1588
00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Very little padding at all and it was probably just like a little horse hair in</v>

1589
00:39:36.391 --> 00:39:37.224
<v Speaker 1>there as well.</v>

1590

<v Speaker 4>I get like a,</v>

1608

<v Speaker 4>very good fighters.</v>

1610
00:40:10.951 --> 00:40:11.171
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1611
00:40:11.171 --> 00:40:14.910
<v Speaker 4>they come from that and I think it translate to him and made her very well.</v>

1612
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1613
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.030
<v Speaker 1>And Marsha was one 88 apparently.</v>

1614
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1615
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:20.613
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1616
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:21.180
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1617
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.820
<v Speaker 1>the ability to move in and out like really quickly as my best ever fought.</v>

1618
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.010
<v Speaker 1>You fought in point tournaments before?</v>

1619
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

1620
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:27.580
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1621
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Very frustrated.</v>

1622
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:29.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Kyokushin karate.</v>

1623
00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not that same seminar.</v>

1624
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:32.600
<v Speaker 1>I did point get ready before.</v>

1625
00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1626
00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:35.020
<v Speaker 1>I find only a few point karate tournaments,</v>

1627
00:40:35.021 --> 00:40:35.331
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1628
00:40:35.331 --> 00:40:36.190
<v Speaker 1>I found them,</v>

1629
00:40:36.191 --> 00:40:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1630
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I fought some fault one really high level guy and he was like,</v>

1631
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.430
<v Speaker 1>he wins a lot of those point tournaments.</v>

1632
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:46.390
<v Speaker 1>It was so different from taekwondo being like continuous fighting to this being</v>

1633
00:40:46.391 --> 00:40:46.990
<v Speaker 1>like stop,</v>

1634
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:47.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1635
00:40:47.261 --> 00:40:47.940
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1636
00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.800
<v Speaker 1>and it was really hard to fight that way if you're not used to it.</v>

1637
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:54.700
<v Speaker 1>And I would just imagine that the guy who's really good at lunging in and out</v>

1638
00:40:54.701 --> 00:40:55.121
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1639
00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1640
00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.340
<v Speaker 1>If you could teach them all the other aspects of MMA,</v>

1641
00:40:57.341 --> 00:40:58.174
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a big one.</v>

1642
00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.360
<v Speaker 4>That's what I use for my,</v>

1643
00:40:59.361 --> 00:41:01.910
<v Speaker 4>I take it out on the shoot that people saw is your wrestling.</v>

1644
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.310
<v Speaker 4>It has nothing to do with my wrestling and I was saying is that once I get that</v>

1645
00:41:04.311 --> 00:41:05.300
<v Speaker 4>leg I finish that they go,</v>

1646
00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:06.360
<v Speaker 4>but what I'll do,</v>

1647
00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.030
<v Speaker 4>I get in and that was because of karate before like no way guy right there,</v>

1648
00:41:10.031 --> 00:41:10.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1649
00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.570
<v Speaker 4>and scarcity.</v>

1650
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.140
<v Speaker 4>That allowed me to cut the distance and take,</v>

1651
00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.110
<v Speaker 4>take the people down.</v>

1652
00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:18.530
<v Speaker 4>I have a very good single to the boat or the very good Dubbo and a very good</v>

1653
00:41:18.531 --> 00:41:20.660
<v Speaker 4>penetration is because of my leg.</v>

1654
00:41:20.661 --> 00:41:23.450
<v Speaker 4>The way I do and this timing I get is from the karate.</v>

1655
00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:24.763
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1656
00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:26.210
<v Speaker 4>It's I wrestling too,</v>

1657
00:41:26.211 --> 00:41:30.650
<v Speaker 4>but karate primary because before I start wrestling it was karate guy pure and</v>

1658
00:41:30.651 --> 00:41:31.060
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1659
00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:31.370
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1660
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:34.280
<v Speaker 4>I he mates myself well to wrestling</v>

1661
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.920
<v Speaker 5>and wrestling for especially for the mixed martial art.</v>

1662
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:37.501
<v Speaker 5>Why does,</v>

1663
00:41:37.501 --> 00:41:39.470
<v Speaker 5>that's really interesting because I've always said that one,</v>

1664
00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:43.040
<v Speaker 5>you are the best things about you as the your ability to close the distance.</v>

1665
00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:43.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1666
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:44.000
<v Speaker 5>It's got read to you.</v>

1667
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:44.870
<v Speaker 5>Does that make sense?</v>

1668
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1669
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:46.610
<v Speaker 5>totally makes sense.</v>

1670
00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:46.881
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1671
00:41:46.881 --> 00:41:49.030
<v Speaker 5>My footwork pattern and everything is from karate.</v>

1672
00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:52.910
<v Speaker 5>Is this what I get it from springing in like that,</v>

1673
00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:53.151
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1674
00:41:53.151 --> 00:41:54.620
<v Speaker 5>the ability to cover that distance,</v>

1675
00:41:54.621 --> 00:41:58.220
<v Speaker 5>that's a huge advantage covered in the sand and to not get hit.</v>

1676
00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.620
<v Speaker 5>This is very important.</v>

1677
00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.513
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1678
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:01.041
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1679
00:42:01.041 --> 00:42:04.490
<v Speaker 5>And that is one of the cornerstones of those tournament's.</v>

1680
00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:05.870
<v Speaker 5>And that style,</v>

1681
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:07.010
<v Speaker 5>did you um,</v>

1682
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.480
<v Speaker 5>have a hard time when you made the transition to more Thai and MMA style?</v>

1683
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:12.550
<v Speaker 5>It today,</v>

1684
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.800
<v Speaker 5>today even my kicks are more like karate guy.</v>

1685
00:42:15.801 --> 00:42:16.100
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1686
00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:16.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1687
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:17.623
<v Speaker 5>I do more tie,</v>

1688
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.040
<v Speaker 5>but I might kick,</v>

1689
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:19.341
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1690
00:42:19.341 --> 00:42:20.870
<v Speaker 5>it's like printed inside.</v>

1691
00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.540
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to say like you're a taekwondo guy,</v>

1692
00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.010
<v Speaker 5>you'll can kick butt,</v>

1693
00:42:25.011 --> 00:42:26.300
<v Speaker 5>you will stay taekwondo.</v>

1694
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.193
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1695
00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:27.650
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1696
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:28.370
<v Speaker 5>it's fine too.</v>

1697
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:28.640
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1698
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.810
<v Speaker 5>it's the best.</v>

1699
00:42:29.811 --> 00:42:32.120
<v Speaker 5>Like I believe it was the best spending back at you.</v>

1700
00:42:32.121 --> 00:42:34.670
<v Speaker 5>You have the best spinning back kick I ever seen in my entire life.</v>

1701
00:42:34.671 --> 00:42:35.270
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1702
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:36.250
<v Speaker 5>they're from taekwondo,</v>

1703
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:36.860
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1704
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1705
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:42.080
<v Speaker 5>And is your background and you tried to change your technique of your spending</v>

1706
00:42:42.081 --> 00:42:42.541
<v Speaker 5>back keg,</v>

1707
00:42:42.541 --> 00:42:44.030
<v Speaker 5>it will be the worst thing you could do.</v>

1708
00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:44.661
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1709
00:42:44.661 --> 00:42:47.500
<v Speaker 5>So I tried to learn to have stuff to Marzano,</v>

1710
00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:48.910
<v Speaker 5>but I don't try to change my,</v>

1711
00:42:48.911 --> 00:42:49.551
<v Speaker 5>my thing,</v>

1712
00:42:49.551 --> 00:42:49.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1713
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.870
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>

1714
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:50.300
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1715
00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:50.960
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1716
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1717
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.070
<v Speaker 5>I um,</v>

1718
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.950
<v Speaker 5>I still incorporate a lot of those techniques,</v>

1719
00:42:54.951 --> 00:42:59.951
<v Speaker 5>but I do more just regular more time now than anything else because I think all</v>

1720
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:04.190
<v Speaker 5>those techniques like the spinning back kick and we'll kick for a guy like you</v>

1721
00:43:04.191 --> 00:43:07.880
<v Speaker 5>that has like a strong karate background or a guy who picks things up really</v>

1722
00:43:07.881 --> 00:43:08.391
<v Speaker 5>quickly,</v>

1723
00:43:08.391 --> 00:43:08.900
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1724
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:09.171
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1725
00:43:09.171 --> 00:43:09.261
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>

1726
00:43:09.261 --> 00:43:10.790
<v Speaker 5>those are good techniques to learn.</v>

1727
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:14.240
<v Speaker 5>But like for every day use,</v>

1728
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:18.230
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to pull those things off unless you're doing it on a regular basis.</v>

1729
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:21.950
<v Speaker 5>Like they become normal when you're fighting and Taco no tournaments and</v>

1730
00:43:21.951 --> 00:43:22.620
<v Speaker 5>everybody's doing it,</v>

1731
00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:23.630
<v Speaker 5>you're doing it every day.</v>

1732
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.820
<v Speaker 5>But in MMA there's so many other fucking things like to,</v>

1733
00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:27.601
<v Speaker 5>to have the,</v>

1734
00:43:27.601 --> 00:43:29.360
<v Speaker 5>the type of leg dexterity that you see,</v>

1735
00:43:29.361 --> 00:43:31.370
<v Speaker 5>like the top level talk when no guys have,</v>

1736
00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:36.610
<v Speaker 5>it's be so hard to have that along with wrestling along with boxing,</v>

1737
00:43:37.191 --> 00:43:38.570
<v Speaker 5>along with Jujitsu,</v>

1738
00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.730
<v Speaker 5>like how do you manage like all your different skill sets?</v>

1739
00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:44.180
<v Speaker 5>Do you have like a,</v>

1740
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:46.670
<v Speaker 5>like a 20% of your time goes to this?</v>

1741
00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:49.310
<v Speaker 5>30% goes to that like no,</v>

1742
00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:49.591
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1743
00:43:49.591 --> 00:43:49.790
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1744
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:52.750
<v Speaker 5>It depends on the like fuck that.</v>

1745
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.140
<v Speaker 5>Like I'll give you an example right now.</v>

1746
00:43:54.141 --> 00:43:54.890
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1747
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:58.810
<v Speaker 5>last week I was doing for the movie captain America,</v>

1748
00:43:58.811 --> 00:43:59.570
<v Speaker 5>that filming.</v>

1749
00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.070
<v Speaker 5>Then now I'm doing the interview,</v>

1750
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.800
<v Speaker 5>but every day I find the time I go to Freddy Roach,</v>

1751
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:08.930
<v Speaker 5>work on my boxing and this bird of my like this time on my box,</v>

1752
00:44:08.931 --> 00:44:09.764
<v Speaker 5>same pretty much.</v>

1753
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.260
<v Speaker 5>And when I'm going to go to New York for example,</v>

1754
00:44:12.261 --> 00:44:14.470
<v Speaker 5>because I have to go to New York for a Dobro,</v>

1755
00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.640
<v Speaker 5>the book Promo and said I'm going to do my digits,</v>

1756
00:44:16.641 --> 00:44:17.400
<v Speaker 5>would John Donne error,</v>

1757
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to be doing Jujitsu,</v>

1758
00:44:18.711 --> 00:44:19.160
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu.</v>

1759
00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.120
<v Speaker 5>When I go back and my child,</v>

1760
00:44:20.121 --> 00:44:20.960
<v Speaker 5>I mixed up everything,</v>

1761
00:44:20.961 --> 00:44:21.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1762
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:23.060
<v Speaker 5>but when I go to different places,</v>

1763
00:44:23.061 --> 00:44:23.600
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

1764
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1765
00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:24.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1766
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.513
<v Speaker 5>I do my,</v>

1767
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:26.810
<v Speaker 5>my like,</v>

1768
00:44:26.811 --> 00:44:27.170
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1769
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:28.310
<v Speaker 5>specific things.</v>

1770
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:30.410
<v Speaker 5>And this is in between fights,</v>

1771
00:44:30.411 --> 00:44:31.800
<v Speaker 5>so you don't have to scheduled.</v>

1772
00:44:31.801 --> 00:44:32.520
<v Speaker 5>So now</v>

1773
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.130
<v Speaker 1>you just in the skill development phases it is.</v>

1774
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:35.481
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1775
00:44:35.481 --> 00:44:37.640
<v Speaker 4>And that's where my training is fun because I,</v>

1776
00:44:37.641 --> 00:44:38.270
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1777
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:41.240
<v Speaker 4>I trained for myself to get better and I try stuff.</v>

1778
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:44.420
<v Speaker 4>I acknowledge you see me if I go roller with my friend,</v>

1779
00:44:44.421 --> 00:44:45.290
<v Speaker 4>like it is like heading me,</v>

1780
00:44:45.291 --> 00:44:45.741
<v Speaker 4>I wrote,</v>

1781
00:44:45.741 --> 00:44:47.930
<v Speaker 4>I try stuff that I would maybe not have the,</v>

1782
00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:50.960
<v Speaker 4>the guts to try it normal dying because it's risky.</v>

1783
00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:51.800
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1784
00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.521
<v Speaker 4>so I'd try it.</v>

1785
00:44:52.521 --> 00:44:52.701
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1786
00:44:52.701 --> 00:44:53.540
<v Speaker 4>I get that bad.</v>

1787
00:44:53.541 --> 00:44:53.811
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1788
00:44:53.811 --> 00:44:54.301
<v Speaker 4>I ate that but,</v>

1789
00:44:54.301 --> 00:44:54.801
<v Speaker 4>and I laugh,</v>

1790
00:44:54.801 --> 00:44:55.660
<v Speaker 4>who cares like that,</v>

1791
00:44:55.661 --> 00:44:56.150
<v Speaker 4>but I don't,</v>

1792
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:57.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't care her sometime at that pay,</v>

1793
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:58.490
<v Speaker 4>sometime I get that.</v>

1794
00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:59.210
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1795
00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:01.040
<v Speaker 4>But when I trained for a training camp,</v>

1796
00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:01.911
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1797
00:45:01.911 --> 00:45:04.400
<v Speaker 4>I traded for performance so I have to perform.</v>

1798
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:06.740
<v Speaker 4>I cannot be beaten and trainee is always,</v>

1799
00:45:06.741 --> 00:45:07.980
<v Speaker 4>my confidence will be effect.</v>

1800
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:09.560
<v Speaker 4>So I tried to perform.</v>

1801
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:12.200
<v Speaker 4>So that's where my training is not as fun as it is now.</v>

1802
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:13.283
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1803
00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:13.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1804
00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:18.320
<v Speaker 1>The ability to loosen up in training is very important when you're in the</v>

1805
00:45:18.321 --> 00:45:18.981
<v Speaker 1>learning phase,</v>

1806
00:45:18.981 --> 00:45:19.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1807
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1808
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:21.470
<v Speaker 1>That's how you develop new techniques.</v>

1809
00:45:21.471 --> 00:45:22.340
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

1810
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:23.990
<v Speaker 1>there is an ego issue too,</v>

1811
00:45:23.991 --> 00:45:25.070
<v Speaker 1>like with guys who,</v>

1812
00:45:25.071 --> 00:45:25.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1813
00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.110
<v Speaker 1>are not that good at Jujitsu.</v>

1814
00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Like you see it a lot like maybe like strikers,</v>

1815
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.330
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to roll because they don't like getting tapped</v>

1816
00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:33.600
<v Speaker 4>stupid as it,</v>

1817
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.430
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean anything.</v>

1818
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.821
<v Speaker 4>You tap,</v>

1819
00:45:34.821 --> 00:45:36.520
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean you're not as good as the other guy.</v>

1820
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:40.430
<v Speaker 4>That's mean you play that game and you just got to cut that none of it.</v>

1821
00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:41.301
<v Speaker 4>So what you know,</v>

1822
00:45:41.301 --> 00:45:42.710
<v Speaker 4>so when I got the tap all the time,</v>

1823
00:45:42.711 --> 00:45:43.431
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a damn.</v>

1824
00:45:43.431 --> 00:45:43.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1825
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:45.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating aspect of Jujitsu though.</v>

1826
00:45:45.951 --> 00:45:47.690
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't exist in other martial arts.</v>

1827
00:45:47.691 --> 00:45:47.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1828
00:45:47.841 --> 00:45:49.850
<v Speaker 1>like if he was kickbox and spar a guy,</v>

1829
00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:50.880
<v Speaker 4>it's not as it,</v>

1830
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:51.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1831
00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:52.030
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1832
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:52.231
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1833
00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:53.320
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to be knocked out.</v>

1834
00:45:53.321 --> 00:45:54.910
<v Speaker 4>But I mean is it would be that same thing in a way.</v>

1835
00:45:54.911 --> 00:45:56.830
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you,</v>

1836
00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:58.830
<v Speaker 4>you're a Jujitsu guy and you do kick by someone,</v>

1837
00:45:58.840 --> 00:45:59.081
<v Speaker 4>that guy,</v>

1838
00:45:59.081 --> 00:46:00.060
<v Speaker 4>but that guy will not knock y'all.</v>

1839
00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:00.420
<v Speaker 4>You will,</v>

1840
00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:00.670
<v Speaker 4>it will.</v>

1841
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.830
<v Speaker 4>Let's say we'll do a combo that he will be like,</v>

1842
00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:06.710
<v Speaker 4>you will know and I owe that right hand and would have knocked me out if you</v>

1843
00:46:06.711 --> 00:46:07.710
<v Speaker 4>know it's something you're Jitsu.</v>

1844
00:46:07.711 --> 00:46:08.650
<v Speaker 4>Oh I would tap,</v>

1845
00:46:08.651 --> 00:46:08.951
<v Speaker 4>I'd always,</v>

1846
00:46:08.951 --> 00:46:10.210
<v Speaker 4>he would have break my arm.</v>

1847
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:11.590
<v Speaker 4>It's same thing.</v>

1848
00:46:11.591 --> 00:46:11.741
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

1849
00:46:11.741 --> 00:46:12.730
<v Speaker 4>we don't hurt each other.</v>

1850
00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:17.860
<v Speaker 4>You can allow it to go further without hurting then and kickboxing for example</v>

1851
00:46:17.861 --> 00:46:20.190
<v Speaker 4>where it's tracking it can be brain damage.</v>

1852
00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1853
00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:22.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the hardest is that,</v>

1854
00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:26.590
<v Speaker 1>or I should ask you is that the hardest place to find guys that are comfortable</v>

1855
00:46:26.591 --> 00:46:28.030
<v Speaker 1>with training with is in striking.</v>

1856
00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:30.490
<v Speaker 1>So you know that they're not trying to knock you out.</v>

1857
00:46:30.491 --> 00:46:30.761
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1858
00:46:30.761 --> 00:46:32.800
<v Speaker 1>you like every day in the gym is in a war.</v>

1859
00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Fred,</v>

1860
00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:38.400

1862
00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:39.141
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1863
00:46:39.141 --> 00:46:40.220
<v Speaker 4>and I have no choice.</v>

1864
00:46:40.221 --> 00:46:41.054
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1865
00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:41.690
<v Speaker 4>I've been,</v>

1866
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:42.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1867
00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:42.890
<v Speaker 4>and when I first,</v>

1868
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:43.783
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1869
00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:44.240
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1870
00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.350
<v Speaker 4>it's different because of the nut RBT APP.</v>

1871
00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.850
<v Speaker 4>I can find place how I can go and I mean training,</v>

1872
00:46:49.851 --> 00:46:50.601
<v Speaker 4>it's training,</v>

00:46:50.601 --> 00:46:50.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1874
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:51.830
<v Speaker 4>we still go hard.</v>

1875
00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.230
<v Speaker 4>There is a smart way to train.</v>

1876
00:46:54.231 --> 00:46:54.651
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

1877
00:46:54.651 --> 00:46:58.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't try to hurt myself when I train and tried to hurt the people,</v>

1878
00:46:58.071 --> 00:46:58.904
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1879
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.750
<v Speaker 4>But of course I say I'm training for a fight before a fight and we spar hard.</v>

1880
00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.860
<v Speaker 4>If the guy you see,</v>

1881
00:47:03.861 --> 00:47:04.401
<v Speaker 4>you heard the guy,</v>

1882
00:47:04.401 --> 00:47:05.270
<v Speaker 4>you let them breed,</v>

1883
00:47:05.271 --> 00:47:05.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1884
00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.530
<v Speaker 4>don't go for the finish.</v>

1885
00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.310
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is for example kicked today,</v>

1886
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.560
<v Speaker 4>who control that kicked today?</v>

1887
00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:11.391
<v Speaker 4>Things like that,</v>

1888
00:47:11.391 --> 00:47:11.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1889
00:47:11.571 --> 00:47:13.280
<v Speaker 4>we don't do needs today.</v>

1890
00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:14.330
<v Speaker 4>The hell Buddhist stuff like that.</v>

1891
00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:15.164
<v Speaker 4>We don't do that.</v>

1892
00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.140
<v Speaker 4>That and this is important.</v>

1893
00:47:18.141 --> 00:47:19.340
<v Speaker 4>I have a good training partner like that,</v>

1894
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:20.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1895
00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.710
<v Speaker 4>cause sometimes we turn it with someone who was crazy.</v>

1896
00:47:21.711 --> 00:47:22.241
<v Speaker 4>He's gonna you're,</v>

1897
00:47:22.241 --> 00:47:23.600
<v Speaker 4>you're getting ready for a fight.</v>

1898
00:47:23.601 --> 00:47:24.680
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of money on the table.</v>

1899
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:25.940
<v Speaker 4>He's going to cut.</v>

1900
00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:26.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1901
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.140
<v Speaker 4>Cut you or say like is things like that you don't need you to make a name for</v>

1902
00:47:30.141 --> 00:47:30.860
<v Speaker 4>himself.</v>

1903
00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:31.700
<v Speaker 4>So now when I'm,</v>

1904
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.841
<v Speaker 4>people ask me,</v>

1905
00:47:32.841 --> 00:47:32.991
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1906
00:47:32.991 --> 00:47:34.670
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to go train in my gym?</v>

1907
00:47:34.671 --> 00:47:36.240
<v Speaker 4>And like this is because sometime I had,</v>

1908
00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:37.520
<v Speaker 4>because I go train in the gym,</v>

1909
00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:39.560
<v Speaker 4>they know who I am and I'm George Saint Pierre.</v>

1910
00:47:39.561 --> 00:47:39.891
<v Speaker 4>And they go,</v>

1911
00:47:39.891 --> 00:47:40.041
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1912
00:47:40.041 --> 00:47:41.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try to hurt him to make a name for myself.</v>

1913
00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:42.860
<v Speaker 4>And that sucks.</v>

1914
00:47:42.861 --> 00:47:43.101
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1915
00:47:43.101 --> 00:47:43.341
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1916
00:47:43.341 --> 00:47:44.174
<v Speaker 4>I don't like it.</v>

1917
00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:48.710
<v Speaker 4>So that very careful with where I trained now that's the bad side of it because</v>

1918
00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.360
<v Speaker 4>they let other people tried to take him out.</v>

1919
00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.290
<v Speaker 4>They can make that name,</v>

1920
00:47:51.291 --> 00:47:52.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1921
00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:53.270
<v Speaker 4>and I don't like it.</v>

1925
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:58.250

1926
00:47:58.251 --> 00:47:58.971

2234
00:54:40.801 --> 00:54:41.191

2237
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:45.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2238
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.990
<v Speaker 1>and when people say,</v>

2239
00:54:45.991 --> 00:54:50.310
<v Speaker 1>oh like the level of kickboxing and MMA is not as high as the level of kickbox</v>

2240
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.580
<v Speaker 4>different distance.</v>

2241
00:54:51.581 --> 00:54:52.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2242
00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:55.260
<v Speaker 4>Every friend you cannot compare different stance.</v>

2243
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:56.210
<v Speaker 4>I list over,</v>

2244
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:57.820
<v Speaker 4>we didn't get knocked out by a,</v>

2245
00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:00.600
<v Speaker 4>the Tonio big footsteps of a daze.</v>

2246
00:55:00.601 --> 00:55:01.960
<v Speaker 4>I K one champion.</v>

2247
00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.950
<v Speaker 4>You've got it guys.</v>

2248
00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.080
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same thing.</v>

2249
00:55:05.081 --> 00:55:06.400
<v Speaker 4>It's not that same thing.</v>

2250
00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:10.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's easy to adapt when you are at a higher level k one guy to adapt to</v>

2251
00:55:10.901 --> 00:55:11.800
<v Speaker 4>MMA timing.</v>

2252
00:55:11.801 --> 00:55:12.101
<v Speaker 4>But there's,</v>

2253
00:55:12.101 --> 00:55:13.090
<v Speaker 4>the timing is different.</v>

2254
00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.420
<v Speaker 4>I think Allister had some issues going and stuff like,</v>

2255
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.201
<v Speaker 4>cause they could be too,</v>

2256
00:55:17.201 --> 00:55:17.381
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2257
00:55:17.381 --> 00:55:18.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the inside of it,</v>

2258
00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:19.414
<v Speaker 4>but I've just,</v>

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:26.420
<v Speaker 1>he tested high for testosterone.</v>

2266
00:55:26.421 --> 00:55:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Like he had taken something.</v>

2267
00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2268
00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:29.330

2269
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:29.840
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2270
00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:30.031
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

2271
00:55:30.031 --> 00:55:30.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2272
00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:30.860
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2273
00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:31.810

2279
00:55:39.871 --> 00:55:40.770
<v Speaker 1>beat the shit out of them.</v>

2280

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:44.520
<v Speaker 1>that was a brutal knockout too.</v>

2282
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:45.301
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

2283
00:55:45.301 --> 00:55:46.440
<v Speaker 1>I was surprised to see that.</v>

2284
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.831
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2285

2307
00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:15.900
<v Speaker 1>he hit him like four times before Monet can even drop.</v>

2308
00:56:15.901 --> 00:56:16.591
<v Speaker 1>That was bad.</v>

2309
00:56:16.591 --> 00:56:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2310
00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:20.250
<v Speaker 1>And baroni could fucking hit and the just teeing off on him.</v>

2311
00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:22.920
<v Speaker 1>It literally is keeping them standing with his punches.</v>

2312
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:26.100
<v Speaker 1>This big foot one wasn't quite as devastating as that,</v>

2313
00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:27.023
<v Speaker 1>but it was number.</v>

2314
00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:27.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2315
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.401
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2316
00:56:27.401 --> 00:56:28.390
<v Speaker 4>It was like bouncing on.</v>

2317
00:56:28.391 --> 00:56:30.130
<v Speaker 4>They felt like bang,</v>

2318
00:56:30.131 --> 00:56:30.551
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>

2319
00:56:30.551 --> 00:56:31.001
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>

2320
00:56:31.001 --> 00:56:31.391
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>

2321
00:56:31.391 --> 00:56:32.224
<v Speaker 4>Bang.</v>

2322
00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:34.040
<v Speaker 1>It was like the greatest punching,</v>

2323
00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:36.830
<v Speaker 1>not highlight reel knockout ever that brony Manet fights.</v>

2324
00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:37.400
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

2325
00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.120
<v Speaker 1>It was bad.</v>

2326
00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.220
<v Speaker 1>It was bad at some of the those knock out of your Washer,</v>

2327
00:56:40.221 --> 00:56:40.460
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2328
00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

2329
00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2330
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:43.100
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

2331
00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:43.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2332
00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:47.060
<v Speaker 1>when you first lost your title to Matt Serra,</v>

2333
00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:48.780
<v Speaker 1>there was the first time that Matt,</v>

2334
00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

2335
00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:49.803
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

2336
00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:50.321
<v Speaker 1>Matt said,</v>

2337
00:56:50.321 --> 00:56:50.480
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2338
00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:50.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2339
00:56:50.571 --> 00:56:50.871
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

2340
00:56:50.871 --> 00:56:51.440
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

2341
00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.990
<v Speaker 1>When you lost your title Matt Serra and you know,</v>

2342
00:56:53.991 --> 00:56:55.400
<v Speaker 1>and maths or a stop to,</v>

2343
00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:56.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2344
00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:57.043
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

2345
00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.490
<v Speaker 1>was that like,</v>

2346
00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:02.060
<v Speaker 1>that had to be like the most devastating loss of your career,</v>

2347
00:57:02.061 --> 00:57:02.241
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2348
00:57:02.241 --> 00:57:02.481
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2349
00:57:02.481 --> 00:57:06.920
<v Speaker 1>but I learned something vulnerable that allowed me to survive to Carlos condit.</v>

2350
00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:08.193
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>

2351
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:10.460
<v Speaker 1>When I get hit by Matt Serra,</v>

2352
00:57:10.461 --> 00:57:11.660
<v Speaker 1>the First Punch,</v>

2353
00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:12.250
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2354
00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:12.690
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2355
00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:13.540
<v Speaker 4>he uh,</v>

2356
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:18.040
<v Speaker 4>I make me very dizzy and I was so proud that pride,</v>

2357
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:19.090
<v Speaker 4>it's a good thing,</v>

2358
00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.080
<v Speaker 4>but it could be a bad thing.</v>

2359
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:21.700
<v Speaker 4>I was so proud.</v>

2360
00:57:21.701 --> 00:57:21.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2361
00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:22.631
<v Speaker 4>I'm a very proper,</v>

2362
00:57:22.631 --> 00:57:22.800
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2363
00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:23.410
<v Speaker 4>so I got,</v>

2364
00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:24.150
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>

2365
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2366
00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:27.180
<v Speaker 4>when we're both just say an English Womble I got,</v>

2367
00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:30.370
<v Speaker 4>I got Wabo and instead of back off and say,</v>

2368
00:57:30.371 --> 00:57:30.670
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2369
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:32.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go back to my sense,</v>

2370
00:57:32.261 --> 00:57:32.470
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

2371
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.681
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

2372
00:57:32.681 --> 00:57:32.801
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2373
00:57:32.801 --> 00:57:35.220
<v Speaker 4>I go back to my Calibra before we attacking,</v>

2374
00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:37.450
<v Speaker 4>I got Webo and I got so angry.</v>

2375
00:57:37.451 --> 00:57:38.140
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2376
00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:41.860
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe this guy because back in the day it was like five to one,</v>

2377
00:57:41.861 --> 00:57:42.521
<v Speaker 4>10 to one,</v>

2378
00:57:42.521 --> 00:57:43.420
<v Speaker 4>the odds,</v>

2379
00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:44.080
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2380
00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:47.110
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I get wobble by a guy like this.</v>

2381
00:57:47.111 --> 00:57:48.130
<v Speaker 4>And I looked like back in the day.</v>

2382
00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:49.030
<v Speaker 4>Like I was saying,</v>

2383
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.860
<v Speaker 4>I was angry that I got wobble.</v>

2384
00:57:50.861 --> 00:57:53.380
<v Speaker 4>I was proud gay first time I ever happened in my life,</v>

2385
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:56.830
<v Speaker 4>so I want it to give it back to him as fast as I can,</v>

2386
00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.740
<v Speaker 4>but that's already hit very hard was I was,</v>

2387
00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:01.180
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have any caliber them.</v>

2388
00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.530
<v Speaker 4>I got a website with one shot.</v>

2389
00:58:02.531 --> 00:58:07.531
<v Speaker 4>Then I tried to jump back into a war with him into a slug fest with him while I</v>

2390
00:58:08.801 --> 00:58:10.480
<v Speaker 4>was wobbled annual hasn't,</v>

2391
00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.590
<v Speaker 4>so I got punched,</v>

2392
00:58:11.591 --> 00:58:12.281
<v Speaker 4>I boom,</v>

2393
00:58:12.281 --> 00:58:12.821
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

2394
00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:13.210
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

2395
00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:16.370
<v Speaker 4>Then he started the tee off on me and then I fall down and I had thought about</v>

2396
00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:16.450
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2397
00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:17.530
<v Speaker 4>I know it was completely,</v>

2398
00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:18.790
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

2399
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:19.541
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2400
00:58:19.541 --> 00:58:21.370
<v Speaker 4>if I would have to keep going I would be like,</v>

2401
00:58:21.371 --> 00:58:22.060
<v Speaker 4>you know I,</v>

2402
00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:22.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2403
00:58:22.361 --> 00:58:23.770
<v Speaker 4>I just stop and things.</v>

2404
00:58:23.771 --> 00:58:23.971
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2405
00:58:23.971 --> 00:58:24.804
<v Speaker 4>the referee stopped.</v>

2406
00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:28.030
<v Speaker 4>But what happened with Carlos condit the same situation.</v>

2407
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.820
<v Speaker 4>I got kicked in the head then.</v>

2408
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.270
<v Speaker 4>Then instead of telling,</v>

2409
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.510
<v Speaker 4>oh I need to give it back to him,</v>

2410
00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:35.570
<v Speaker 4>I followed him around.</v>

2411
00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:35.951
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2412
00:58:35.951 --> 00:58:36.401
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2413
00:58:36.401 --> 00:58:36.731
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2414
00:58:36.731 --> 00:58:37.564
<v Speaker 4>I got caught.</v>

2415
00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:39.010
<v Speaker 4>Then relax.</v>

2416
00:58:39.011 --> 00:58:40.690
<v Speaker 4>Now it's time to re defense,</v>

2417
00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:41.670
<v Speaker 4>catch up your bread,</v>

2418
00:58:41.671 --> 00:58:42.011
<v Speaker 4>catch up,</v>

2419
00:58:42.011 --> 00:58:43.090
<v Speaker 4>your your senses,</v>

2420
00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:43.451
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>

2421
00:58:43.451 --> 00:58:43.751
<v Speaker 4>Bang,</v>

2422
00:58:43.751 --> 00:58:44.350
<v Speaker 4>Bang.</v>

2423
00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 4>I focused on my defense,</v>

2424
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:46.810
<v Speaker 4>my shield grows,</v>

2425
00:58:46.811 --> 00:58:47.351
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

2426
00:58:47.351 --> 00:58:49.360
<v Speaker 4>every opportunity as to hurt me.</v>

2427
00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:51.040
<v Speaker 4>And then I came back after,</v>

2428
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:52.480
<v Speaker 4>so I step into my,</v>

2429
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:53.343
<v Speaker 4>my uh,</v>

2430
00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:54.520
<v Speaker 4>my ego a little bit,</v>

2431
00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:55.930
<v Speaker 4>tried to accept the fight.</v>

2432
00:58:55.931 --> 00:58:56.764
<v Speaker 4>I got hit,</v>

2433
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:57.580
<v Speaker 4>relax,</v>

2434
00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:58.690
<v Speaker 4>and then I came back later.</v>

2435
00:58:58.691 --> 00:58:59.501
<v Speaker 4>That's a little bit of it.</v>

2436
00:58:59.501 --> 00:59:03.130
<v Speaker 4>That's the experience that I gained from that loss with Matt Serra that allowed</v>

2437
00:59:03.131 --> 00:59:04.090
<v Speaker 4>me to survive.</v>

2438
00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.080
<v Speaker 4>Carlos condit.</v>

2439
00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:06.663
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

2440
00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:09.040
<v Speaker 4>Because Carlos Condit we dropped me with that,</v>

2441
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.581
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2442
00:59:09.581 --> 00:59:10.414
<v Speaker 4>that kick.</v>

2443
00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:11.230
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2444
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:12.310
<v Speaker 4>the first time he cut me,</v>

2445
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.121
<v Speaker 4>I want bold,</v>

2446
00:59:13.121 --> 00:59:14.530
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't drop like I was,</v>

2447
00:59:14.531 --> 00:59:15.400
<v Speaker 4>I was on my feet,</v>

2448
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.110
<v Speaker 4>but I tried to get back right into a slug fest with him instead of backing up,</v>

2449
00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:21.300
<v Speaker 4>tried to use my work,</v>

2450
00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.730
<v Speaker 4>get back to my senses.</v>

2451
00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:24.080
<v Speaker 4>And that's what happened.</v>

2452
00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:24.490

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2566
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:14.170
<v Speaker 4>and I tried to see figure out what's going to happen and what the,</v>

2567
01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:17.570
<v Speaker 4>wait could I send everything he says he can make one 70 back if you want.</v>

2568
01:02:17.571 --> 01:02:18.530
<v Speaker 4>Maximum one seven yeah.</v>

2569

2570
01:02:20.731 --> 01:02:21.810
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's possible?</v>

2571
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:27.180
<v Speaker 4>He was fighting back in the day in Japan at one 68 that was a long time ago.</v>

2572
01:02:27.181 --> 01:02:27.721
<v Speaker 4>But he was,</v>

2573
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:29.490
<v Speaker 4>he was over 25 years old.</v>

2574
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2575
01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:31.453
<v Speaker 1>So you think he,</v>

2576
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:34.280
<v Speaker 1>if he just did it slowly over a long time?</v>

2577

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2581
01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:44.421
<v Speaker 4>A lot of car.</v>

2582
01:02:44.421 --> 01:02:48.340
<v Speaker 4>It would be easier for me to go fight at one 55 then finding one 85 I would be</v>

2583
01:02:48.341 --> 01:02:50.500
<v Speaker 4>more at my weight actually,</v>

2584

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:58.540

2591
01:02:58.541 --> 01:02:59.590
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want to have a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

2617
01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:33.981
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2618
01:03:33.981 --> 01:03:35.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a fight that a lot of people want to see you.</v>

2619
01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:37.970
<v Speaker 1>You have a very talent stack division,</v>

2620
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:38.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2621
01:03:38.361 --> 01:03:42.290
<v Speaker 1>you at the top and look at how many a great contenders are at one 70</v>

2622
01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:42.941
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2623
01:03:42.941 --> 01:03:43.091
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2624
01:03:43.091 --> 01:03:43.270
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2625
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:44.530
<v Speaker 4>It said it's a tough,</v>

2626
01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:45.870
<v Speaker 4>it's a very tough division though.</v>

2627
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:48.690
<v Speaker 1>What's it like walking around with that kind of stress?</v>

2628
01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:51.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean you got like a whole line of trained killers that want to get to the</v>

2629
01:03:51.991 --> 01:03:52.740
<v Speaker 1>champ,</v>

2630
01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:52.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2631
01:03:52.981 --> 01:03:54.990
<v Speaker 1>is that a difficult thing to manage</v>

2632
01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:55.831
<v Speaker 4>and that's stress.</v>

2633
01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:57.630
<v Speaker 4>I tried to take one fight at a time,</v>

2634
01:03:57.631 --> 01:03:58.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2635
01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:01.140
<v Speaker 4>and a focus on the one guy that I have no choice.</v>

2636
01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:02.610
<v Speaker 4>I cannot split myself enough,</v>

2637
01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.473
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2638
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:08.540
<v Speaker 4>And for me that has to fight where close to each other and my second fight that</v>

2639
01:04:08.541 --> 01:04:08.931
<v Speaker 4>training can,</v>

2640
01:04:08.931 --> 01:04:09.960
<v Speaker 4>and it was brutal,</v>

2641
01:04:09.961 --> 01:04:12.870
<v Speaker 4>like in no way that I didn't have mental break.</v>

2642
01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.000
<v Speaker 4>Now I needed to take a little break,</v>

2643
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:18.320
<v Speaker 4>meant it to come back stronger after because I always thought,</v>

2644
01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:20.190
<v Speaker 4>well I will get third what I do,</v>

2645
01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:22.840
<v Speaker 4>I will not be as good as I could.</v>

2646
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:23.351
<v Speaker 4>I could be,</v>

2647
01:04:23.351 --> 01:04:24.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2648
01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.260
<v Speaker 4>but you still train,</v>

2649
01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:26.094
<v Speaker 4>you still constantly.</v>

2650
01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:27.240
<v Speaker 4>But I trained for fun.</v>

2651
01:04:27.241 --> 01:04:28.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't try to for performance,</v>

2652
01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:29.011
<v Speaker 4>which is different.</v>

2653
01:04:29.011 --> 01:04:30.030
<v Speaker 4>Like I explained earlier,</v>

2654
01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.370
<v Speaker 4>I trade for myself and having a good time.</v>

2655
01:04:32.371 --> 01:04:33.204
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>

2656
01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:34.230
<v Speaker 4>Now while you're doing this,</v>

2657
01:04:34.231 --> 01:04:37.110
<v Speaker 4>do you keep up with the Jujitsu at all or do you just do your boxing?</v>

2658
01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:37.561
<v Speaker 4>None of them.</v>

2659
01:04:37.561 --> 01:04:38.450
<v Speaker 4>I do Jujitsu too.</v>

2660
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:41.270
<v Speaker 4>I like how many hours a day do you train?</v>

2661
01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:42.870
<v Speaker 4>I depend.</v>

2662
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:45.480

2665
01:04:48.141 --> 01:04:48.780
<v Speaker 4>And then I,</v>

2666
01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:49.020

2670
01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:51.520

2676
01:05:01.111 --> 01:05:02.760
<v Speaker 4>45 minutes for 30 minutes.</v>

2677
01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:03.960
<v Speaker 4>The training itself,</v>

2678
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:05.600
<v Speaker 4>but that talking that this,</v>

2687
01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:14.171
<v Speaker 1>Once,</v>

2688

2689
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:16.900
<v Speaker 1>And you think that's like a really responsible,</v>

2690
01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>a lot</v>

2691
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:18.650
<v Speaker 5>of like,</v>

2692
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:19.483
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2693
01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:21.430
<v Speaker 5>any track and field?</v>

2694
01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:22.293
<v Speaker 5>I did check it.</v>

2695
01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.041
<v Speaker 5>I run the check,</v>

2696
01:05:23.041 --> 01:05:28.041
<v Speaker 5>had a track door like sprints and jumps and 60 60 hundreds and four hundreds and</v>

2697
01:05:29.171 --> 01:05:29.800
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2698
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:34.180
<v Speaker 5>you feel like that's the best kind of a exercise for frame and may if I would</v>

2699
01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:37.570
<v Speaker 5>have to start all over at GAM because back in the day used to train like an</v>

2700
01:05:37.571 --> 01:05:37.840
<v Speaker 5>idiot.</v>

2701
01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:42.300
<v Speaker 5>I was doing buddy bolder and watching movies like you know rocky and all this,</v>

2702
01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:42.660
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2703
01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:45.010
<v Speaker 4>Oh and Jacco van Damme aren't all,</v>

2704
01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:50.110
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was the thing back in the 90s for my generation.</v>

2705
01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:54.850
<v Speaker 4>That was the thing back in the day where I'm from Canada and mix of martial art</v>

2706
01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:58.870
<v Speaker 4>and buddy building was the best mix of it would be you would your like you say a</v>

2707
01:05:58.871 --> 01:05:59.411
<v Speaker 4>bad ass,</v>

2708
01:05:59.411 --> 01:06:03.030
<v Speaker 4>you know what you say that then in the after we discovered at butterball,</v>

2709
01:06:03.050 --> 01:06:04.530
<v Speaker 4>dirt is not suited for,</v>

2710
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2711
01:06:05.021 --> 01:06:05.591
<v Speaker 4>it makes my trade,</v>

2712
01:06:05.591 --> 01:06:10.591
<v Speaker 4>it's better like do like I was doing more like a strength conditioning kind of</v>

2713
01:06:10.601 --> 01:06:11.040
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

2714
01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.380
<v Speaker 4>but then I found out after that strength conditioning it was bitter and on a</v>

2715
01:06:14.381 --> 01:06:15.400
<v Speaker 4>picnic thing I think is better.</v>

2716
01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:16.234
<v Speaker 4>Does gymnastics.</v>

2717
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:19.060
<v Speaker 4>I think I tried a few joints as well.</v>

2718
01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:19.510
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2719
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:20.740
<v Speaker 4>track and field and gymnastics.</v>

2720
01:06:20.741 --> 01:06:21.960
<v Speaker 4>If I wouldn't have to do it,</v>

2721
01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:23.200
<v Speaker 4>that's how I would George.</v>

2722
01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:24.880
<v Speaker 4>That's how I would have to go back in time.</v>

2723
01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:26.620
<v Speaker 4>I would have to tell myself that George,</v>

2724
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.710
<v Speaker 4>stop all that bloody building stuff that you're doing.</v>

2725
01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:31.370
<v Speaker 4>It's better to do gymnastic.</v>

2726
01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:31.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2727
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:33.260
<v Speaker 5>and a track and field.</v>

2728
01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:37.190
<v Speaker 5>Is that because you were already a fairly physically strong guy and you're</v>

2729
01:06:37.191 --> 01:06:39.680
<v Speaker 5>pretty strong from a wrestling as well,</v>

2730
01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:43.620
<v Speaker 4>but if I'm very strong when I arrest,</v>

2731
01:06:43.621 --> 01:06:43.901
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2732
01:06:43.901 --> 01:06:44.270
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>

2733
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:44.470
<v Speaker 4>when?</v>

2734
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:45.670
<v Speaker 4>When I grabbed someone,</v>

2735
01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:47.710
<v Speaker 4>I can that strength,</v>

2736
01:06:47.711 --> 01:06:47.941

2914
01:10:15.681 --> 01:10:17.950
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't wrote all the words myself.</v>

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2918
01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:21.850
<v Speaker 4>It's made with someone I needed like a,</v>

2919
01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 4>so you don't write it in English at all?</v>

2920
01:10:23.361 --> 01:10:24.194

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2925
01:10:26.691 --> 01:10:30.050
<v Speaker 4>I would not write a book in English because it has been made in English first,</v>

2926
01:10:30.051 --> 01:10:30.884
<v Speaker 4>then in French.</v>

2931
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:38.180
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

2932
01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:41.750
<v Speaker 4>you took stuff that I say and I had in my notes stuff that I write myself in</v>

2933
01:10:41.751 --> 01:10:42.061
<v Speaker 4>French.</v>

2942
01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:49.910
<v Speaker 4>it's not a biography.</v>

2943
01:10:49.911 --> 01:10:51.350
<v Speaker 4>It's not about that MMA boy,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's about my w the tactic that I use to be,</v>

2949
01:11:00.741 --> 01:11:03.530
<v Speaker 4>to start where I come from and to be world champion.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2953
