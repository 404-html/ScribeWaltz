46
00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:08.930
<v Speaker 1>drunk and belligerent that it was like we had to argue before we get to fuck.</v>

47
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:09.711
<v Speaker 1>And then when we did it,</v>

48
00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:10.191
<v Speaker 1>when it was over,</v>

49

<v Speaker 1>I get off the train at union station and I'm going to be an actor.</v>

117
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

118
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work out.</v>

119
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>When I was in Boston,</v>

120
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>every girl had a modeling photo.</v>

121
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.693
<v Speaker 1>Remember when girls,</v>

122

<v Speaker 1>what you used to go to modeling Casablanca?</v>

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

124
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>and they would take a photo of the girl or standing like this and like her hair</v>

125
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 1>blowing in the wind and the poses.</v>

126
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>They would spend all this money.</v>

127
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>It was basically a huge scam where they would just get these girls to spend a</v>

128
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>fuckload of money on getting their photos taken and then they get their photos</v>

129
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 1>taken with this guy's logo at the bottom of it and they would send it out and</v>

130
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 1>nothing would ever happen.</v>

131
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 1>But it was like these curls like cabin doing some modeling.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was trying to avoid her.</v>

143
00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to avoid her and she goes to me,</v>

144
