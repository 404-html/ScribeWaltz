00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.330
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take a lot of time to</v>

2
00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Primarily because people don't really</v>

3
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>understand money as it is today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand how banks work.</v>

4
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand how the Federal</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reserve creates money.</v>

5
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand a debt based</v>
<v Speaker 1>system for money.</v>

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I've read about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it.</v>

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a read many things.</v>

8
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I watch documentaries when I understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that most of the people when the first</v>

9
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>face bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start asking questions about money</v>

10
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>and it quickly becomes apparent to all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us when we do this,</v>

11
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>that we don't know much about money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we learn about money and we</v>

12
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>start reading about money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

13
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

14
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>it's very much part of the culture to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where I'll talk to people</v>

15
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:37.170
<v Speaker 1>about bitcoin and they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

16
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>it's not backed by gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how can it have value?</v>

17
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>The dollar hasn't been backed by gold</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like 60 years.</v>

18
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>And you talk to the average person in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the streets and they still think there's</v>

19
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>some gold in a volt and that stuff does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't exist.</v>

20
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm happening all the gold in the vault</v>
<v Speaker 1>watches.</v>

21
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole other question.</v>

22
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean the real issue is this heath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't been on a gold standard for</v>

23
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>decades and all of the currencies in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world are created based on the</v>

24
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:06.180
<v Speaker 1>productive capacity of the country and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legal system.</v>

25
00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>And because they have value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you pay your taxes with them and</v>

26
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 1>then they just float freely in exchange</v>
<v Speaker 1>rates.</v>

27
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>So they very against each other in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the dollar is used to buy oil as</v>

28
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>the world reserve currency and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other currencies and measured against</v>

29
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is no gold and,</v>

30
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine.</v>

31
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.690
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean it doesn't have value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It absolutely has.</v>

32
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>That fucks up a lot of old action</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

33
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

34
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>it really does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those movies where you would break into</v>

35
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:31.480
<v Speaker 1>the vault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Lone ranger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bars of gold would always be brick</v>

37
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:36.790
<v Speaker 1>shaped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the thing is gold isn't,</v>

38
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>that's efficient for building a currency</v>
<v Speaker 1>on because the rates of which you can</v>

39
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:42.980
<v Speaker 1>produce gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>is his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's hoarded and you know,</v>

41
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>you have certain problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

42
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 1>the Nice thing about bitcoin is that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes,</v>

43
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes the same concept of,</v>

44
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>of scarcity a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of having something that is a limited</v>

45
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>resource,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does it by algorithm.</v>

46
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>So you essentially have math that says</v>
<v Speaker 1>that every 10 minutes,</v>

47
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:07.161
<v Speaker 1>25 new bitcoin is created by the network</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a whole with all of the computing</v>

48
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>capacity of the network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's fixed.</v>

49
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>And every four years we create half as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much every 10 minutes.</v>

50
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>So in four years it goes down to 12 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a half bitcoin every 10 minutes.</v>

51
00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>And then it goes down to six and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter and it keeps going down until</v>

52
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>you meant the last bit coin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're done 21 million coins,</v>

53
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that you provide a sound</v>

54
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>basis for money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that is rare,</v>

55
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>cannot be forged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is easily transportable.</v>

56
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>And that is the form of currency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 21 million bitcoins and then it's</v>

57
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:37.720
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There will be theirs.</v>

58
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>You can divide a Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 million pieces.</v>

59
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>So it goes down to a digits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means the lowest units has</v>

60
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>called a Sitoshi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's 100 million satoshis in a</v>

61
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 21 million times 100 million,</v>

62
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>21 quadrillion coins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coins,</v>

63
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am,</v>

64
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>why is it so complicated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it like 100 million?</v>

65
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think part of the reason is that</v>

66
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to write a number without a</v>
<v Speaker 1>decimal points and just to write a small</v>

67
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>leak units with lots of Zeros after it.</v>

68
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier in computer terms to handle</v>

69
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>numbers that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

70
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>but most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter because what you see</v>

71
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>on your screen at today might be a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>coin.</v>

72
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Actually on my wallets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use millibitcoins thousands of a</v>

73
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin because of corresponds more to</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daily purchases.</v>

74
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a few years from now you're going</v>

75
00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>to be using a millions of a bitcoin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at your balance.</v>

76
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what you call a unit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

77
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>the point is what value does it have</v>
<v Speaker 1>because someone else is willing to give</v>

78
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 1>you that amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

79
00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>I was Mormon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did we have this conversation?</v>

80
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

81
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.830
<v Speaker 2>He was raised Mormon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

82
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My folks are still,</v>

83
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 2>well my dad's still mormon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His whole side of the family or are you</v>

84
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 2>from Utah Now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm from Texas.</v>

85
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mormon Texas.</v>

86
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.020
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

87
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're everywhere.</v>

88
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.821
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

89
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:56.060
<v Speaker 2>born and raised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

90
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 2>less attrition is 14.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

91
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 2>When you were 14,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it that got you to I just</v>

92
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:02.884
<v Speaker 2>didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

93
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so funny too,</v>

94
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 2>because I hadn't found science yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I knew,</v>

95
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have like all these answers</v>

96
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 2>available to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just probably around like 12,</v>

97
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 2>maybe 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you start questioning things,</v>

98
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 2>I really started questioning things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things weren't making sense for</v>

99
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:17.674
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

100
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.491
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

101
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 2>just a lot of the answers that they give</v>
<v Speaker 2>you in the church like weren't sitting</v>

102
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 2>well with me.</v>

103
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.030
<v Speaker 2>And so I was studying and I was trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out like,</v>

104
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been taught this is my whole life,</v>

105
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:29.590
<v Speaker 2>but it just doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't sit well with reality.</v>

106
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 2>And I remember going to my father and</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

107
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have all these questions.</v>

108
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm very confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

109
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the answer they always give you is</v>

110
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 2>just to like really pray about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

111
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 2>it's like they give you all of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>answers that aren't helping at all.</v>

112
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.090
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't really improve your confusion</v>

113
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:45.790
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so ultimately I finally just came to</v>

114
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:46.310
<v Speaker 2>him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

115
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

116
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure at this point that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>really don't believe in God and an</v>

117
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 2>attending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a huge part of your life when</v>

118
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 2>you're 14.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

119
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 2>when you're in high school and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mormon,</v>

120
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 2>you go to church for three hours every</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunday,</v>

121
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 2>you go to youth group every Wednesday</v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

122
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 2>you have all sorts of family things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>family home evening every Monday night.</v>

123
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 2>And then you go to seminary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is either Bible Book of Mormon,</v>

124
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then like pearl of great price in</v>

125
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:11.060
<v Speaker 2>doctrine and covenants study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

126
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.220
<v Speaker 2>every morning before school I would go</v>
<v Speaker 2>at 6:00 AM for like an hour before</v>

127
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

128
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really intense.</v>

129
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 2>It takes up a huge part of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you don't believe it's kind of,</v>

130
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to come out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to come out like it's,</v>

131
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 2>it's so painful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're stuck in this skin that's</v>

132
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 2>not you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

133
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it's like for somebody</v>

134
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 2>who is gay who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

135
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 2>scared to come out in their community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

136
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:38.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would assume that there's like at</v>

137
00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 2>least a faint similarity to that feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like,</v>

138
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.610
<v Speaker 2>I can't live like this because I'm lying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to myself or day.</v>

139
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 2>So I finally came out to my father and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like not good.</v>

140
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.650
<v Speaker 2>It was a difficult situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hard for the family and I didn't</v>

141
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:51.251
<v Speaker 2>end up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

142
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:54.310
<v Speaker 2>I ended up actually not having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with him for many years.</v>

143
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:54.700
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

144
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.100
<v Speaker 2>it's better now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the time it was like a really</v>

145
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 2>intense thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as a 14 year old kid to be like,</v>

146
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to make this like really intense</v>

147
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 2>life decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your dad didn't want to interact with</v>

148
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 2>you or you didn't want to interact with</v>
<v Speaker 2>him because of the pressure?</v>

149
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.041
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

150
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 2>so my parents were divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went to my dad's house every other</v>

151
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 2>weekend and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like a month in the summer or</v>

152
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we also went to his house on Sundays</v>

153
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 2>to go to church together because my mom</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't attending after they got</v>

154
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 2>divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he basically told me,</v>

155
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the quote to this day,</v>

156
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I have a moral obligation to God to</v>
<v Speaker 2>force you to go to church until you're</v>

157
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 2>18 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're living under my roof.</v>

158
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go anymore.</v>

159
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:33.381
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

160
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 2>then I guess you're not going to live</v>
<v Speaker 2>under my roof anymore.</v>

161
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a really tough decision.</v>

162
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of like me or me or your</v>
<v Speaker 2>atheism.</v>

163
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 2>And at the time I just felt like I can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>not make this decision.</v>

164
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 2>So we didn't speak for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I like didn't go to his house for a</v>

165
00:06:48.111 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 2>really long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have a relationship,</v>

166
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 2>but it improved.</v>
