54
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.090
<v Speaker 1>So this dude gets busted on the Palisades parkway.</v>

55
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>They pull him over and his 2005 Mitsubishi Lancer and he's acting real weird.</v>

56
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

57
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.110
<v Speaker 1>so they decided to bring him in.</v>

58
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.370
<v Speaker 1>So they bring him in and they open up his ass.</v>

59
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.230
<v Speaker 1>They just gave him a cavity check.</v>

60
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guy didn't do anything wrong and they pulled him over.</v>

61
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.890
<v Speaker 1>He just looked weird.</v>

62
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.240
<v Speaker 1>He was tweaking out on his own.</v>

63
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Something was going on with him,</v>

64
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:48.100
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

65
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.791
<v Speaker 1>He was pulled over.</v>

66
00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:50.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean routine traffic stop.</v>

67
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.520
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

68
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.720
<v Speaker 1>they detected the smell of marijuana and that's where they,</v>

69
00:01:55.721 --> 00:01:56.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.290
<v Speaker 1>that's where they got them and they brought him in because they smelled</v>

71
00:01:59.291 --> 00:01:59.860
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

72
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.580
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

73
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.400
<v Speaker 1>And he had a hundred bags of heroin up his ass.</v>

74
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.330
<v Speaker 1>And you can't put a hundred bags of heroin up your ass while the cops are going</v>

75
00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:08.440
<v Speaker 1>from their car to your car.</v>

76
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.611
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

77
00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 1>So driving around with those packed up,</v>

78
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:13.160
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

79
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.120
<v Speaker 1>why would you drive around and smoke weed with a hundred packs of heroin in your</v>

80
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:16.600
<v Speaker 1>ass?</v>

81
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

82
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.000
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just one of those guys.</v>

83
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.333
<v Speaker 1>That's his move.</v>

84
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.533
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's like,</v>

85
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>like Russian checks.</v>

86
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>We'll put Ben Wa balls and their pussy to tighten up their must there.</v>

87
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:28.074
<v Speaker 1>Fuck muscle.</v>

88
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this dude was just like exercise and his his ass door starfish,</v>

89
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>starfish.</v>

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>I maybe he didn't trust his roommate's like,</v>

91
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:36.211
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

99
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.403
<v Speaker 1>I can't leave.</v>

100
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I can't leave it in my dash.</v>

101
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Let's work on that star fish.</v>
