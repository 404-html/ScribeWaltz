22
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scared.</v>

23
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Lead that foam would have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

24
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>I asked if I needed to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there isn't.</v>

25
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>There is a thing like what if something</v>
<v Speaker 1>important happens?</v>

26
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think like when does</v>

27
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Rare.</v>

28
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>But if it did happen where your phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in the car and somebody needed you,</v>

29
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:13.950
<v Speaker 1>you'd feel terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

30
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.070
<v Speaker 1>But you can just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>

31
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>what's the balance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so slippery when we didn't have any</v>

32
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>way to get in touch with back in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

33
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:22.770
<v Speaker 1>You have to yell for help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

34
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't yell how?</v>

35
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not in Los Angeles.</v>

36
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>There's too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You yell for help.</v>

37
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's in some languages helped mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

38
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:32.560
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>something not good at or something in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic or something.</v>

40
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>People will fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just make that up.</v>

41
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

42
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I think I might've heard that because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in Westwood and we have a very</v>

43
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>diverse over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people sometimes</v>

44
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>yelling stuff in the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think a for real do you think</v>

45
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>help mean something bad in other</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages?</v>

46
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>So real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody told me hello means go to hell</v>

47
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>in like Greek or Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

48
00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like politics means like a political,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like a tick,</v>

52
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>like blood sucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

53
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>The government or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with one.</v>

54
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.060
<v Speaker 1>should we do it with hello first?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

56
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I think because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just say things and I don't even</v>

57
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>know sometimes think somebody just told</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to say hello when I was young and</v>

58
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying in my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what does help mean is helping</v>

59
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>anything in another language is help a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad word and other languages.</v>

60
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 1>So I'm looking up if the word help means</v>
<v Speaker 1>something in another language.</v>

61
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Not that there weren't help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the word help means something in</v>

62
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:46.090
<v Speaker 1>another language that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna have to award it.</v>

63
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna have to word it uniquely I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think because it's a.</v>

64
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>that's a hard one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

65
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.280
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's yeah.</v>

66
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's translation.</v>

67
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe an Arabic or something.</v>

68
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I that have any sort of alternate</v>

69
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>meanings and other languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

70
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not accusing anybody the Arab</v>
<v Speaker 1>nations or whatever,</v>

71
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>or a beach or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.640
<v Speaker 1>the Arabic and Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those old old languages have the</v>

73
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>coolest letters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the way they write things,</v>

74
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>like you look at some old Hindu script</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

75
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Like why is that looks so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like a mystery man.</v>

76
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Anytime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even Russian when you see Russia</v>

77
00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>and written out and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

78
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 1>look at the crazy little letters they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

79
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.563
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

80
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Like this is like some alien writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

81
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>I'd be furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

82
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine having to learn some</v>

83
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 1>of the other languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

84
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 1>like I'm going to China next week we</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to Shanghai and I'm like,</v>

85
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 1>it's basically just gonna be looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>around at different drawings,</v>

86
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as far as even though words go,</v>

87
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have a lot of stuff in</v>

88
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:51.810
<v Speaker 1>English there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

89
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are a lot.</v>

90
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Speaker 1>A lot of countries where there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of tourism.</v>

91
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>They just put stuff in English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>English seems to be the language that</v>

92
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 1>most European countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most people know you can,</v>

93
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of get by and in Italy you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can kind of get by in Germany,</v>

94
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>just speak English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

95
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting man,</v>

96
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>because it's because I guess there's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much tourism and I guess everyone's</v>

97
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>worried about us because we have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear bombs.</v>

98
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Everybody learned English and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveled a lot because we have more</v>

99
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>money here probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have the ability to go places</v>

100
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:26.480
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

101
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 1>do you like English?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only language I know.</v>

102
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.020
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it,</v>

103
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's just weird how much cooler</v>
<v Speaker 1>other languages look when they're</v>

104
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>written out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's just because we're what</v>

105
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:42.931
<v Speaker 1>we're accustomed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like tie at writing or like I was</v>

106
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to read something one time and</v>

107
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:46.610
<v Speaker 1>tie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sweating by the end of the</v>

108
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.740
<v Speaker 1>craziest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean ic food.</v>

109
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it just,</v>

110
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took me out of my element,</v>

111
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a couple of,</v>

112
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of words off,</v>

113
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:56.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I almost needed help Asian characters</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like if you had a movie like a</v>

115
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 1>science fiction movie and in the movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found a crashed Ufo and it had some</v>

116
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>writing on the I beams or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

117
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>It would look like a lot of Asian</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

118
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would look like something,</v>

119
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.880
<v Speaker 1>something crazy from Asia that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

120
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 1>what am I looking at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

121
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Like alien issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying I might as well be alien</v>

122
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 1>writing if you don't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 1>If there were alien writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it's going to look more like</v>

124
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>something from Asian writing than it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>from American writing.</v>

125
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be weird if it was like comic book</v>

126
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:31.660
<v Speaker 1>font.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

127
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>like a or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

128
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alien speak English.</v>

129
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

130
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if aliens were in like a Boeing</v>

131
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.680
<v Speaker 1>shuttle man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the biggest mind fuck that I ever</v>

132
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:49.681
<v Speaker 1>heard was that because of the size of</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinity [inaudible] not only is there</v>

133
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 1>another theo vaughn out there in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

134
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.470
<v Speaker 1>but because infinity is so big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to butcher for short.</v>

135
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.600
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this a little bit less.</v>

136
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.331
<v Speaker 1>I was in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

137
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:03.940
<v Speaker 1>We did a little thing you've ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone has done the exact same things,</v>

138
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 1>the exact same order down to the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>millisecond.</v>

139
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you.</v>

140
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's something that you think are,</v>

141
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 1>that's something that you think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be really true.</v>

142
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it could be really true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

143
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>but honestly my brain is not really</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong enough to compute that,</v>

144
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 1>so I would have to take many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

145
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:28.220
<v Speaker 1>many hours to really thinking about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means because right now when I'm</v>

146
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.480
<v Speaker 1>saying what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

147
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those whoa dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like I'm saying it,</v>

148
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:34.280
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not really thinking it through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

149
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.193
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much,</v>

150
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 1>how much are you really thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>through?</v>

151
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a couple of steps.</v>

152
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.610
<v Speaker 1>You're not really thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

153
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 1>That there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then that means for you,</v>

154
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 1>there's another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another man out there who did</v>

155
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 1>comedy it last night at the comedy store</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wore,</v>

156
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 1>did the exact same set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tripped over the exact same words,</v>

157
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 1>spelt his water the same way every.</v>

158
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be everything and not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

159
00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>but because infinity so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to be an infinite</v>

160
00:06:58.341 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 1>number of those people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

161
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't man,</v>

162
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 1>because that would hurt my feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>

163
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 1>It would make me feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes accept.</v>

164
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the universe is so big,</v>

165
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

166
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:16.770
<v Speaker 1>everything's so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just what we know about our solar system</v>

167
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 1>so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so big.</v>

168
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Speaker 1>That alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

169
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.550
<v Speaker 1>The idea that there's no end to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

170
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.541
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

171
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be an end.</v>

172
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

173
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

174
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:27.860
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

175
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 1>That's too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's too crazy when it comes to</v>

176
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:33.260
<v Speaker 1>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe is crazy.</v>

177
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.190
<v Speaker 1>There is nothing about it that makes any</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

178
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy that we don't like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

179
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:44.651
<v Speaker 1>Last night I was watching the fireworks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fireworks were going off and I</v>

180
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:45.411
<v Speaker 1>was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

181
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:46.100
<v Speaker 1>this is Kinda cool.</v>

182
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 1>You know what's cooler?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking billions of flying</v>

183
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:54.371
<v Speaker 1>explosions that are above our heads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fireworks that are constantly in the</v>

184
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:56.050
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we just,</v>

185
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.730
<v Speaker 1>we'll get together for like some</v>
<v Speaker 1>something made in Honduras,</v>

186
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.930
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that they're like shooting</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars every night and nobody gives a</v>

187
00:08:03.931 --> 00:08:04.560
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

188
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>And we like because the streetlights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't see the craziest light show</v>

189
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the Milky Way.</v>

190
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

191
00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:14.610
<v Speaker 1>when you draw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make that drive out to vegas or you</v>

192
00:08:14.611 --> 00:08:17.270
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into driving through Montana at night or</v>

193
00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:18.650
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pull over.</v>

194
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.360
<v Speaker 1>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that fireworks from last night by</v>

195
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.220
<v Speaker 1>last night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just from a,</v>

196
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.170
<v Speaker 1>the NBC for helicopter Pasedena to</v>
<v Speaker 1>downtown.</v>

197
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:28.820
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are illegal.</v>

198
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.240
<v Speaker 1>At least half of them are illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

199
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.780
<v Speaker 1>I would say most of them are illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a lot of like a kind of</v>

200
00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 1>civil war artwork also sped up dude for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a firefighter,</v>

201
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:42.950
<v Speaker 1>that has got to be a crazy time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of them get off.</v>

202
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.410
<v Speaker 1>I think on fires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some of them,</v>

203
00:08:44.411 --> 00:08:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I think they want a little bit of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think?</v>

204
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

205
00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:52.550
<v Speaker 1>it's been proven that some people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are mentally ill that become firemen and</v>

206
00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 1>actually start fires something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

207
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not 99 point nine,</v>

208
00:08:58.411 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine percent of them or whatever the</v>

209
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 1>number is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but occasionally in every line of work,</v>

210
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get someone who's crazy.</v>

211
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I could see that dude,</v>

212
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 1>you want something gone and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of money or anything like</v>

213
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of that.</v>

214
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:12.620
<v Speaker 1>It's also just that they're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

215
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:13.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just.</v>

216
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Some people there's something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

217
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's connections that are being made</v>

218
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 1>in there and then not they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

219
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.380
<v Speaker 1>they're capable of doing things just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deceive.</v>

220
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 1>People would rip people off or they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of doing things for their own</v>

221
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:31.200
<v Speaker 1>personal gain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lighting a building on fire just so</v>

222
00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 1>they could put it out.</v>

223
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some people that are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>broken,</v>

224
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 1>like there's something about them that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not connected.</v>

225
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:38.311
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

226
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 1>We should shut them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

227
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the future we have to have</v>

228
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:45.330
<v Speaker 1>some better programs to find out who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not even who doesn't care about</v>

229
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:46.080
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

230
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that don't care about</v>

231
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:51.330
<v Speaker 1>people who doesn't care about people</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't care about people</v>

232
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:54.600
<v Speaker 1>then it's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you shouldn't be here.</v>

233
00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:56.190
<v Speaker 1>He should be somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be in a place where they</v>

234
00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:57.390
<v Speaker 1>don't have any people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

235
00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a dangerous thing to have</v>

236
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the most part.</v>

237
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:01.740
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

238
00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Because life is fairly easy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized times.</v>

239
00:10:05.661 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of this stuff is fun.</v>

240
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Most of the stuff without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.970
<v Speaker 1>the caveat for the occasional chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just fucking.</v>

242
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.890
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell how crazy people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>until something really happens and me</v>

243
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.960
<v Speaker 1>and you really need to count on them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>

244
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're pinned underneath the</v>

245
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:26.220
<v Speaker 1>dresser and they look at you and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just run out of the room and just take</v>

246
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:26.581
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:27.750
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even going to help me.</v>

248
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people like that.</v>

249
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you think some of those people didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even know that they would?</v>

250
00:10:32.191 --> 00:10:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Do that until the situation arises that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sometimes what I would love to</v>

251
00:10:36.061 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 1>have some and I know this sounds a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little dark but like to have some</v>

252
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:42.600
<v Speaker 1>serious stressors in our world to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out even who I really am,</v>

253
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to see who rises to like who you</v>

254
00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:49.260
<v Speaker 1>are inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what rises to the core of my skin</v>

255
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:51.240
<v Speaker 1>and says this is who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

256
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 1>like I got trapped in an elevator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to do with like seven or eight</v>

257
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:54.841
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

258
00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 1>And this sounds like a small idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this was like three hours,</v>

259
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:00.650
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And suddenly like at first one dude's</v>

260
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.640
<v Speaker 1>kind of verbose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's suddenly like I'm the leader,</v>

261
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.000
<v Speaker 1>but like an hour later he's like trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fuck a couple chicks that are also</v>

262
00:11:06.001 --> 00:11:08.130
<v Speaker 1>stuck in the elevator and you start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see like,</v>

263
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:10.080
<v Speaker 1>okay wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was trying to fuck them,</v>

264
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.260
<v Speaker 1>like it was hitting on them or he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to actually get down in the</v>

265
00:11:13.261 --> 00:11:13.710
<v Speaker 1>elevator.</v>

266
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:14.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't kind to fucking other,</v>

267
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.060
<v Speaker 1>but he was maybe going to fuck them</v>
<v Speaker 1>later if they got out of the elevator a</v>

268
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:20.020
<v Speaker 1>safely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like a rape or like a guy who's</v>

269
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.580
<v Speaker 1>going gonna date them or take them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner and then hopefully have sex with</v>

270
00:11:23.581 --> 00:11:25.770
<v Speaker 1>them at some point if they want to as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

271
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.590
<v Speaker 1>But he um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm saying?</v>

272
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.720
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consensual sex.</v>

273
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

274
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.850
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

275
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.060
<v Speaker 1>but you started to see who was who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one guy was like,</v>

276
00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:39.480
<v Speaker 1>just literally wouldn't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone tried to rip the doors open for</v>

277
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:44.370
<v Speaker 1>two hours and then like just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like gave up on that one lady was</v>

278
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.680
<v Speaker 1>really scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like immediately it started to kind of</v>

279
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:48.900
<v Speaker 1>fold out who was going to be who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

280
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.870
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I don't think you're</v>

281
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>supposed to climb out though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like</v>

282
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.300
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

283
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Climb out into that shaft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to stay here as far as I</v>

284
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:00.280
<v Speaker 2>know you're supposed to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

285
00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:02.960
<v Speaker 2>they must have some sort of regular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

286
00:12:02.961 --> 00:12:07.961
<v Speaker 2>have an elevator fell in one of the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 2>hotels like real far and fucked up CB</v>

287
00:12:10.471 --> 00:12:12.820
<v Speaker 2>dollar away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the UFC fighters.</v>

288
00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 2>His back is fucked up from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>

289
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he's suing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he fought that day.</v>

290
00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I think they had to cancel his fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I might be wrong about that,</v>

291
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.170
<v Speaker 2>but I know his back was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>significantly fucked up from that fall.</v>

292
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Elevators make it too easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

293
00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:34.090
<v Speaker 2>I miss the old days sometimes when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this for the fight.</v>

294
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 2>He scratched from the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

295
00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:39.490
<v Speaker 2>And he's fought since,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he's still having problems</v>

296
00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:41.430
<v Speaker 2>with his back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

297
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.251
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to fix,</v>

298
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:45.160
<v Speaker 2>to have back to one of the hardest.</v>

299
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.500
<v Speaker 2>One of the hardest things to make better</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

300
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.510
<v Speaker 2>It seems like every time people get</v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery,</v>

301
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.170
<v Speaker 2>it's just a slippery slope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare that someone gets surgery</v>

302
00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:54.250
<v Speaker 2>on their back and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

303
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Speaker 2>my back's great now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's fine.</v>

304
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:57.251
<v Speaker 2>It's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

307
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.240
<v Speaker 2>And they're literally getting their back</v>
<v Speaker 2>fused from top to bottom.</v>

308
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:07.750
<v Speaker 2>No dudes with like four or five fake</v>
<v Speaker 2>disks in their back that are still</v>

309
00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:09.760
<v Speaker 2>fighters to Yo know.</v>

313

320
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:41.740
<v Speaker 2>is it the actual disk gelatin or as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>spine itself?</v>

321
00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:43.450
<v Speaker 2>The spinal column.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all the.</v>

322
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.500
<v Speaker 2>All the nerves are firing all the way up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the brainstem.</v>

323
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.950

324
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:56.050
<v Speaker 2>If you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the connection between your brain</v>

325
00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.730
<v Speaker 2>and then that cord that goes to all your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body and everything moving and it's all</v>

326
00:14:00.731 --> 00:14:04.990
<v Speaker 2>just this back area that very few people</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever even exercise,</v>

327
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.370

<v Speaker 2>concentrating on like lower back</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercises.</v>

<v Speaker 2>ground by your foot and then</v>

337
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:39.880
<v Speaker 2>straightened back up again.</v>

338
00:14:39.881 --> 00:14:44.110

<v Speaker 1>think maybe wouldn't even do nothing to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk by that on the street and you</v>

00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:48.050
<v Speaker 1>They're exposed brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that you don't remember Mars</v>

385
00:16:48.051 --> 00:16:49.770
<v Speaker 1>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never seen anything like that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Never saw Mars attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch all of</v>

387
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.700
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the greatest movies of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>

388
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.020
<v Speaker 1>It's Tim Burton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

389
00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Is that who I believe it's because I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch something amazing.</v>

390
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:03.470
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

391
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Jack Nicholson is in it and he pleased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleased to obviously different people</v>

392
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.520
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's obviously the same guy playing</v>

393
00:17:10.521 --> 00:17:14.090
<v Speaker 1>to people and it's never brought up so</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great movie man.</v>

394
00:17:14.091 --> 00:17:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great movie.</v>

395
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks bad dude.</v>

396
00:17:17.781 --> 00:17:19.180
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it really?</v>

397
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.410
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it looks bad because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're watching here,</v>

398
00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:23.900
<v Speaker 1>but it's all on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on purpose.</v>

399
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when this is what it is,</v>

400
00:17:26.571 --> 00:17:31.571
<v Speaker 1>is they somehow or another captured how</v>
<v Speaker 1>we feel about this time period.</v>

401
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:38.080
<v Speaker 1>They captured it with this weird like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegas thing with this is the president</v>

402
00:17:38.871 --> 00:17:42.920
<v Speaker 1>back then and when these aliens come off</v>
<v Speaker 1>this spaceship,</v>

403
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.750
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about the way they</v>

404
00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:48.290
<v Speaker 1>moved to makes you think like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching a movie from the fifties but</v>

405
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.430
<v Speaker 1>still good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just</v>

406
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:54.300
<v Speaker 2>good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what he did by making the effects</v>

407
00:17:54.301 --> 00:17:59.301
<v Speaker 2>weird and barely real is he almost gave</v>
<v Speaker 2>you in this stallion for like 19</v>

408
00:18:01.471 --> 00:18:03.520
<v Speaker 2>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 seventies movie.</v>

409
00:18:03.521 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 2>You can see that a little bit right</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

410
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:05.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

411
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:08.100
<v Speaker 2>But it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way better than anything they were</v>

412
00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:09.120
<v Speaker 2>capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

413
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.730
<v Speaker 2>look at the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shadows and the head and everything</v>

414
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:13.830
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watched a little bit of this real quick.</v>

415
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.500
<v Speaker 2>This is when they first land</v>

416
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.600
<v Speaker 3>come</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

417
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

418
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:39.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

419
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.220
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you'd eat something from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mars?</v>

420
00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:41.760
<v Speaker 2>If they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

421
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.340
<v Speaker 2>if they had to say this because I knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd like to be a wild eater.</v>

422
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:46.770
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some of the stuff you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You eat kind of rare.</v>

423
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:47.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

424
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:48.500
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're not,</v>

425
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.570
<v Speaker 2>you're not afraid to eat the rayer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And would you have,</v>

426
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:52.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say this,</v>

427
00:18:52.561 --> 00:18:55.220
<v Speaker 2>they catch a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Mars donkey or something,</v>

428
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just,</v>

429
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.920
<v Speaker 2>they're serving up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know what's in it.</v>

430
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:04.050
<v Speaker 2>Bright Eyes Wide Shut party serving up a</v>
<v Speaker 2>donkey from Mars,</v>

431
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many pounds of that?</v>

432
00:19:06.031 --> 00:19:07.950
<v Speaker 2>But you can add the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would need it.</v>

433
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:09.990
<v Speaker 2>No chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

434
00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:10.801
<v Speaker 2>people were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

435
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:12.240
<v Speaker 2>people are going to be definitely mad at</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

436
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.000
<v Speaker 2>You think people are mad at you for</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating animals on earth.</v>

437
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Imagine eating animals from space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only one.</v>

438
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Don't be so fucking mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second of all,</v>

439
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 2>I would want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would not want to be an early adopter</v>

440
00:19:23.911 --> 00:19:26.670
<v Speaker 2>of Mars meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really don't want to sit back.</v>

441
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.420
<v Speaker 2>Look this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are convinced that meat,</v>

442
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's people that are convinced</v>

443
00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:36.270
<v Speaker 2>that meat is bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That meat itself is bad for you.</v>

444
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of people that eat meat</v>

445
00:19:38.281 --> 00:19:42.120
<v Speaker 2>wind up with a bunch of heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that they're not really</v>

446
00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:45.750
<v Speaker 2>measuring just the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just measuring people that eat</v>

447
00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:46.800
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else do you eat?</v>

448
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.410
<v Speaker 2>You eat a lot of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a lot of bread,</v>

449
00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:52.490
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You eat a lot of this and you drain</v>

450
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Tony's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

451
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.770
<v Speaker 2>you might have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might smoke cigarettes,</v>

452
00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:01.080
<v Speaker 2>so it's hard to tell and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things are good for different</v>

453
00:20:01.081 --> 00:20:03.900
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people can't even agree on whether</v>

454
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:06.300
<v Speaker 2>or not it's healthy to eat meat.</v>

455
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.070
<v Speaker 2>There's some people that disagree in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

456
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.610
<v Speaker 2>What's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you want to wait to see what</v>

457
00:20:11.611 --> 00:20:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Mars meet to people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you want to fucking I,</v>

458
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to sit back and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

459
00:20:16.621 --> 00:20:19.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm good with Bison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can eat those Mars donkeys all day</v>

460
00:20:19.831 --> 00:20:22.690
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to see what a 20 year profiled</v>

461
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.620
<v Speaker 2>fucking donkeys from Mars eaters looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

462
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.470
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of star dust steak or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something at a Mars.</v>

463
00:20:28.471 --> 00:20:30.680
<v Speaker 2>They only have one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying that one donkey.</v>

464
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it could be like some preannounce</v>

465
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.030
<v Speaker 2>getting your system and you got mad cow</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease like blindly.</v>

466
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.340
<v Speaker 2>You could also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you adopt a superpower by eating</v>

467
00:20:38.341 --> 00:20:39.690
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

468
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.720
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing that nobody ever brings</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with nuclear energy,</v>

469
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.960
<v Speaker 2>like all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these nuclear disasters,</v>

470
00:20:45.961 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 2>everybody's terrified of mutations</v>

471
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.820
<v Speaker 1>and radioactive waves and all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit's going to fuck us up,</v>

472
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:56.200
<v Speaker 1>but nobody remembers comic books where</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single time somebody got hit with</v>

473
00:20:56.201 --> 00:20:58.780
<v Speaker 1>some radioactive shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they became a superhero superhero.</v>

474
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.560
<v Speaker 1>That's never happened here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if I could handle the dude if I</v>

475
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:04.800
<v Speaker 1>had a super.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like I would tell everyone</v>

476
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.900
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be able to keep it a secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some secrets powers.</v>

477
00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:11.020
<v Speaker 1>You're allowed to just tell everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some dudes,</v>

478
00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:12.220
<v Speaker 1>they just tell everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

479
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Like who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who doesn't have to keep it a secret.</v>

480
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the thing he can't keep it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>secret.</v>

481
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.290
<v Speaker 1>What is it that the big x men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to go?</v>

482
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had high,</v>

483
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.950
<v Speaker 1>but the thing doesn't hide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is just,</v>

484
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.920
<v Speaker 1>that's what he's covered in rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

485
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:28.710

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giant club time.</v>

488
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Who else doesn't have to hide anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can hide anything.</v>

489
00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Bannister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

490
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.210
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is personable banner.</v>

491
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Banner.</v>

492
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you know when they show as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>carpenter?</v>

493
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Isn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

494
00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.773
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

495
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that when they did the</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible health TV show,</v>

496
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.480
<v Speaker 1>they changed his name from Bruce to</v>
<v Speaker 1>David because people thought Bruce was</v>

497
00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:55.360
<v Speaker 1>gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really was a lot of bruises.</v>

498
00:21:55.361 --> 00:21:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Ged then do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always been the stereotypical</v>

499
00:21:58.841 --> 00:21:59.700
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>

500
00:21:59.701 --> 00:22:02.380
<v Speaker 1>when like a comedian would do a hack</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke about a gay guy,</v>

501
00:22:02.381 --> 00:22:05.610
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth me randy over.</v>

502
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.800
<v Speaker 1>And really I would never heard Randy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bruce,</v>

503
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.920
<v Speaker 1>it's always been bruce is the name that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would use.</v>

504
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:16.360
<v Speaker 1>So apparently people in the seventies</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the hulk TV show was around with</v>

505
00:22:16.361 --> 00:22:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Lou Ferrigno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

506
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just decided like,</v>

507
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

508
00:22:20.351 --> 00:22:22.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's change this name,</v>

509
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.570
<v Speaker 1>change it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it David David Banner and we all</v>

510
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.940
<v Speaker 1>comic book Dorks like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

511
00:22:27.941 --> 00:22:30.670
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you,</v>

512
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:34.120
<v Speaker 1>how dare you change his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the best show ever because it</v>

513
00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:36.930
<v Speaker 1>made it feel like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may.</v>

514
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:38.080
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were ugly,</v>

515
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:40.570
<v Speaker 1>you can still be cool and do neat stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like,</v>

516
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.500
<v Speaker 1>well it was the revenge of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are bullied and picked on.</v>

517
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.850
<v Speaker 1>There's the idea that you could be this</v>
<v Speaker 1>nerdy guy and you get picked on by these</v>

518
00:22:48.851 --> 00:22:51.640
<v Speaker 1>assholes and you just fucking hulk out</v>
<v Speaker 1>become bulletproof.</v>

519
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met him at the post office one time.</v>

520
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.113
<v Speaker 1>The frig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

521
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a real nice guy.</v>

522
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:57.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seemed nice.</v>

523
00:22:57.641 --> 00:23:00.040
<v Speaker 1>He was with a lady friend and it might</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been his wife a thing.</v>

524
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.910
<v Speaker 1>He's still yoked as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's jacked like,</v>

525
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

526
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:07.870
<v Speaker 1>he looks really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you looks healthy too.</v>

527
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.370
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

528
00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:11.230
<v Speaker 1>the dude's got to be deep into his</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties,</v>

529
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.590
<v Speaker 1>but he looks very healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might wonder who,</v>

530
00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.341
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who.</v>

531
00:23:15.341 --> 00:23:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if people are going to start</v>

532
00:23:17.411 --> 00:23:19.010
<v Speaker 1>living for like a really like looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>them there.</v>

533
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.480
<v Speaker 1>That dude looks healthy as fuck and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

534
00:23:22.481 --> 00:23:25.390
<v Speaker 1>He looks a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more reasonable.</v>

535
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

536
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.590
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a gigantic supersized human at</v>

537
00:23:29.591 --> 00:23:31.980
<v Speaker 1>one point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he used to look like.</v>

538
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:36.810
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So big.</v>

539
00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 1>So when you saw him on the hulk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem was he couldn't really be</v>

540
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 1>that defined for long periods of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and film a show because it</v>

541
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.060
<v Speaker 2>was too unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

542
00:23:47.061 --> 00:23:51.770
<v Speaker 2>it's super unhealthy when those guys are</v>

544
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.320
<v Speaker 2>They are really unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get lightheaded.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That Willie Nelson.</v>

547
00:24:01.221 --> 00:24:04.870
<v Speaker 2>That looks like a 75 year old jack man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See them.</v>

548
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.460

550
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Depends how far I am from civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

552
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd eat them if it was,</v>

553
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.300
<v Speaker 2>whether or not eating them or not</v>
<v Speaker 2>surviving,</v>

554
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.520
<v Speaker 2>getting home to my family or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

555
00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm going to put you under a little</v>

556
00:24:21.651 --> 00:24:22.270
<v Speaker 2>bit of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

558
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.051
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't mind.</v>

559
00:24:24.051 --> 00:24:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>

560
00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:25.643
<v Speaker 2>Please do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

561
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.380
<v Speaker 2>So a ship went down a shuttle and air</v>
<v Speaker 2>ship or something,</v>

562
00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:29.243
<v Speaker 2>a plane.</v>

563
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.950
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that movie alive,</v>

564
00:24:30.951 --> 00:24:31.850

<v Speaker 2>You know you're going to eat well.</v>

567
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:40.490
<v Speaker 2>It's whether or not the bodies like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are killed already.</v>

568
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.250
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is when people start</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing people and meeting people,</v>

569
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.140
<v Speaker 2>then you've got a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

<v Speaker 2>People are already killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are already dead.</v>

571
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.650
<v Speaker 2>It's to senior citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

572
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.420
<v Speaker 2>It was a small plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

573
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:53.900
<v Speaker 2>you got to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People can live without food for several</v>

574
00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.730
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're the average</v>

575
00:24:55.731 --> 00:24:57.320
<v Speaker 2>American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got a lot of fat in your body.</v>

576
00:24:57.321 --> 00:25:02.060
<v Speaker 2>After a day or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body kicks into fat burning ketosis</v>

577
00:25:02.061 --> 00:25:03.580
<v Speaker 2>mode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to be hungry though.</v>

578
00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.930
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you will be less hungry believe it</v>

579
00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:07.370
<v Speaker 2>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After the first day,</v>

580
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:10.970
<v Speaker 2>once your body kicks into fat burning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like have you ever been on a fat burning</v>

581
00:25:10.971 --> 00:25:11.750
<v Speaker 2>diet?</v>

582
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.780
<v Speaker 2>I've just on Paleo for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little different because Paleo,</v>

583
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:16.430
<v Speaker 2>you're still eating a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates.</v>

584
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Just cutting out all the grains and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

585
00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.550
<v Speaker 2>When you go on a fat burning diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the first things that happens is</v>

586
00:25:22.551 --> 00:25:25.490
<v Speaker 2>your appetite just changes radically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird.</v>

587
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Like you just stopped being hungry the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same way,</v>

588
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:33.100
<v Speaker 2>like hunger isn't a desperation thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I know when I'm not ketogenic</v>

589
00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.710
<v Speaker 2>because then my hunger gets desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I have to eat something.</v>

590
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.873
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

591
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.700
<v Speaker 2>I never feel like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With Quito it's like I'm hungry,</v>

592
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.740
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay.</v>

593
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like and through the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like energy levels are much more</v>

594
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.740
<v Speaker 2>stabilized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I felt like on Paleo.</v>

595
00:25:48.741 --> 00:25:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I'd never done anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

596
00:25:50.031 --> 00:25:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I lost like 11 pounds was telling them</v>
<v Speaker 2>think I was supposed to lose,</v>

597
00:25:52.191 --> 00:25:53.840
<v Speaker 2>like I didn't really have like a plan or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

598
00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.140
<v Speaker 2>but next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I felt,</v>

599
00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.490
<v Speaker 2>I never felt like I had to eat.</v>

600
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I needed to eat to get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next few moments in my life,</v>

601
00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:03.530
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

602
00:26:03.531 --> 00:26:06.890
<v Speaker 2>I got to make a big deal about eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It felt more like a survival technique,</v>

603
00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:12.620
<v Speaker 2>like eating all day and then my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt I did feel more energy.</v>

604
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.130
<v Speaker 2>I never felt like that after eating I</v>
<v Speaker 2>always felt like,</v>

605
00:26:16.131 --> 00:26:17.660
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can eat and then still go do</v>

606
00:26:17.661 --> 00:26:20.870
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could go play cards or run around or</v>

607
00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chase a friend or do anything,</v>

608
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang out.</v>

609
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The um,</v>

610
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:31.010
<v Speaker 2>so who do you think you would have to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to first of all,</v>

611
00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.770
<v Speaker 2>talk to everybody about because you got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

612
00:26:33.771 --> 00:26:35.150
<v Speaker 2>you got two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

613
00:26:35.151 --> 00:26:37.340
<v Speaker 2>You got two weeks for your body can just</v>
<v Speaker 2>go on fat.</v>

614
00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.560
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to start using itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

615
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.360
<v Speaker 2>that your body starts eating itself.</v>

616
00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to talk to people and say,</v>

617
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:45.780
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this person is dead,</v>

618
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.110
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just meat now that can keep us</v>

619
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:54.111
<v Speaker 2>alive and we can survive and we could</v>
<v Speaker 2>see our family and our friends or we</v>

620
00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:00.160
<v Speaker 2>cannot eat this person and would take a</v>
<v Speaker 2>chance on going hungry and we might get</v>

621
00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:04.350
<v Speaker 2>too weak to get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to think like,</v>

622
00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:06.150
<v Speaker 2>what if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you can get saved,</v>

623
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.820
<v Speaker 2>but you have to be able to hike out 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles in the mountains.</v>

624
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now you really planning ahead.</v>

625
00:27:10.321 --> 00:27:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Then a lot of you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to you you're,</v>

626
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:15.090
<v Speaker 2>you're either going to die or you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to live.</v>

627
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the only two things that could</v>

628
00:27:16.651 --> 00:27:19.080
<v Speaker 2>possibly happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Internet even mattered at this</v>

629
00:27:19.081 --> 00:27:20.190
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got to figure out,</v>

630
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.110
<v Speaker 2>is it even possible that you can live?</v>

631
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.290
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible you might be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might not be.</v>

632
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:29.550
<v Speaker 2>You might be in the mountains in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>winter with nothing around you to eat,</v>

633
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.910
<v Speaker 2>no way for you to get off the mountain</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's too dangerous because you</v>

634
00:27:32.911 --> 00:27:36.420
<v Speaker 2>get cliffed out every time he tried to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go down and then try to get back up and</v>

635
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:39.720
<v Speaker 2>you can't get back up and you're stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could fall and die.</v>

636
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.900
<v Speaker 2>It happens to people all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it might not be that you can make it,</v>

637
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:48.390
<v Speaker 2>but if you are going to make it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to want to have some energy</v>

638
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.560
<v Speaker 2>and so different people have different</v>
<v Speaker 2>fitness levels obviously,</v>

639
00:27:52.561 --> 00:27:55.860
<v Speaker 2>so some people like they're not even</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be capable of hiking out.</v>

640
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Would it be take a lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

641
00:27:57.001 --> 00:27:58.380
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to eat the whole person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

642
00:27:58.381 --> 00:28:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Then like you guys could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would eat them in parts for sure.</v>

643
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.430
<v Speaker 2>What would you have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a psychologically devastating.</v>

644
00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.750
<v Speaker 2>The thought of just eating human meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's psychologically devastating.</v>

645
00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:12.640
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're crossing a threshold that you</v>

646
00:28:12.641 --> 00:28:13.950
<v Speaker 2>know you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're into.</v>

647
00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:15.570
<v Speaker 2>It's a dark art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

648
00:28:15.571 --> 00:28:17.010
<v Speaker 2>it's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's everything.</v>

649
00:28:17.011 --> 00:28:21.330
<v Speaker 2>It's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy and it's also a rich part of,</v>

650
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human adventure history.</v>

651
00:28:23.881 --> 00:28:25.620
<v Speaker 2>There was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you run into cannibals,</v>

652
00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a pig part of those crazy</v>

653
00:28:28.111 --> 00:28:30.960
<v Speaker 2>movies about it in the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got eaten by cannibals.</v>

654
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Even Brady Bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember they came across some people,</v>

655
00:28:32.821 --> 00:28:34.790
<v Speaker 2>I think they were cannibals weren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannibal,</v>

656
00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:37.290
<v Speaker 2>but like all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even cartoons,</v>

657
00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:40.140
<v Speaker 2>all of them did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was cannibals or like a joe versus</v>

658
00:28:40.141 --> 00:28:41.340
<v Speaker 2>the volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that.</v>

659
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.550
<v Speaker 2>And I don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he came across cannonballs well</v>

660
00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:48.090
<v Speaker 2>there was saying Hannibal's in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of cannibals.</v>

661
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.270
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that there was so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannibalism amongst native Americans.</v>

662
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Native Americans would cannibalize</v>
<v Speaker 2>settlers.</v>

663
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:57.060
<v Speaker 2>They would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them like the Nez perce Indians.</v>

664
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Steve knows telling me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would cut dudes up and eat them.</v>

665
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:03.930
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

666
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.400
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

667
00:29:05.401 --> 00:29:06.150
<v Speaker 2>Imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

668
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:08.790
<v Speaker 2>If somebody goes down and you're this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a part you already know,</v>

669
00:29:08.791 --> 00:29:09.630
<v Speaker 2>you like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

670
00:29:09.631 --> 00:29:12.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm cutting this dude's sand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having a little bit of fucking</v>

671
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:15.720
<v Speaker 2>ligament right here on this hillside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rough man.</v>

672
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:21.080
<v Speaker 2>The guy got killed by a polar bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday in front of his kids in</v>

673
00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:23.520
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was protecting his kids from the</v>

674
00:29:23.521 --> 00:29:26.380
<v Speaker 2>polar bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

675
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.980
<v Speaker 2>he died 31 year old dude.</v>

676
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:32.430
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a hero though.</v>

677
00:29:32.431 --> 00:29:33.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kids will think of him as a hero.</v>

678
00:29:33.841 --> 00:29:38.130
<v Speaker 2>A bet he lives in that same place where</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people live on that life below</v>

679
00:29:38.131 --> 00:29:40.140
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called nunavet</v>

680
00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.380
<v Speaker 2>people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lives.</v>

681
00:29:44.381 --> 00:29:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he lives in a really,</v>

682
00:29:47.351 --> 00:29:52.351
<v Speaker 2>really remote area that has polar bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Polar bears are the most dangerous bear</v>

683
00:29:53.031 --> 00:29:56.740
<v Speaker 2>you could ever run into because they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only animal that all,</v>

684
00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.670
<v Speaker 2>all of them actively hunt people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

685
00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Nunavut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the place where it was.</v>

686
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

687
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.710
<v Speaker 2>they hunt everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything that moves.</v>

688
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.660
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have any vegetables up there.</v>

689
00:30:07.661 --> 00:30:10.390
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the only 100 percent carnivorous</v>

690
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:11.680
<v Speaker 2>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All they eat is meat.</v>

691
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.000
<v Speaker 2>All Day is meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every other.</v>

692
00:30:13.001 --> 00:30:16.330
<v Speaker 2>Bear is like eating berries and berries</v>
<v Speaker 2>or ignore you.</v>

693
00:30:16.331 --> 00:30:17.990
<v Speaker 2>If they've got a whole field for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>barrier.</v>

694
00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:21.430
<v Speaker 2>I not chase you asshole to your bones</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that bullshit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna eat beverage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lazy Vas.</v>

696
00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:28.600
<v Speaker 2>I did some various laying on his back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love berries and you find like</v>

697
00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:32.380
<v Speaker 2>giant fields of blueberries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll find bears just snacking away,</v>

698
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.140
<v Speaker 2>having a great time eating blueberries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll do it all day.</v>

699
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Not Polar bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Polar bears eat your asshole.</v>

700
00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.690
<v Speaker 2>I'll kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kill everything,</v>

701
00:30:40.691 --> 00:30:42.760
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hate that.</v>

702
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.350
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone was trying to eat me,</v>

703
00:30:44.351 --> 00:30:45.910
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just be so upset.</v>

704
00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:46.744
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

705
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.500
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that lady that got in</v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble because she shot a giraffe?</v>

706
00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:55.810
<v Speaker 2>She shot him that she shot a rare</v>
<v Speaker 2>giraffe and so everybody's freaking out</v>

707
00:30:55.811 --> 00:30:58.000
<v Speaker 2>on her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seemed sad,</v>

708
00:30:58.001 --> 00:30:59.680
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That giraffe seemed like it probably</v>

709
00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:02.710
<v Speaker 2>wasn't going to do to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to do anything to her for</v>

710
00:31:02.711 --> 00:31:04.330
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

711
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:07.360
<v Speaker 2>It is rare for an animal to get that</v>
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

712
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.500
<v Speaker 2>It's 18 years old.</v>

713
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.870
<v Speaker 2>It's real dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't had dark skin or something.</v>

714
00:31:10.871 --> 00:31:13.090
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of the old males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get dark.</v>

715
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.930
<v Speaker 2>That's super cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing though that people need to</v>

716
00:31:16.931 --> 00:31:17.561
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

717
00:31:17.561 --> 00:31:20.860
<v Speaker 2>all these things are complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not as simple as everybody wants</v>

718
00:31:20.861 --> 00:31:24.190
<v Speaker 2>to think they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of the things that's</v>

719
00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:27.880
<v Speaker 2>complicated about this store is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that draft was killing little giraffes.</v>

720
00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.890
<v Speaker 2>It's a normal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The old bowls like that one,</v>

721
00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:36.220
<v Speaker 2>which is a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive 18 year old animal,</v>

722
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.560
<v Speaker 2>a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge animal.</v>

723
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just was not having it with these</v>

724
00:31:41.651 --> 00:31:43.810
<v Speaker 2>young ones coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not having it.</v>

725
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.490
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jealousy or anger?</v>

726
00:31:45.491 --> 00:31:46.710
<v Speaker 2>It's just nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

727
00:31:46.711 --> 00:31:48.610
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kill off the younger males,</v>

728
00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:51.040
<v Speaker 2>like pissed at the neighbor kids kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

729
00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't want anybody taking</v>

730
00:31:52.691 --> 00:31:54.970
<v Speaker 2>their spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know that they're riding off</v>

731
00:31:54.971 --> 00:31:55.750
<v Speaker 2>into the sunset.</v>

732
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Like he's not a viable breeding male</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

733
00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.180
<v Speaker 2>but still huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at 18 years of age,</v>

734
00:32:01.181 --> 00:32:04.960
<v Speaker 2>he had killed off three young bowls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were going to have to kill him.</v>

735
00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's not good.</v>

736
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:07.650
<v Speaker 2>You need the bulls to keep the thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>

737
00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:08.770
<v Speaker 2>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

738
00:32:08.771 --> 00:32:12.430
<v Speaker 2>not just that he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a species of giraffe that</v>

739
00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:15.160
<v Speaker 2>already has a population problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of them.</v>

740
00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.210
<v Speaker 2>And if he's killing off these young</v>
<v Speaker 2>bowls,</v>

741
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:22.330
<v Speaker 2>each one of those young bulls could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>fathered countless children.</v>

742
00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:26.440
<v Speaker 2>So they're missing all these future</v>
<v Speaker 2>children for one bull who can't even</v>

743
00:32:26.441 --> 00:32:28.630
<v Speaker 2>breed anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's going to continue to do it.</v>

744
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.840
<v Speaker 2>He was seeking out the young bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

745
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Already killed three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is not a cut and dry thing.</v>

746
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:39.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it looks cool to pose with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rifle and a giraffe.</v>

747
00:32:39.771 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

748
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's something about giraffes</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are so gentle that they let kids</v>

749
00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:46.580
<v Speaker 5>feed them when you go to the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>zoo.</v>

750
00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.950
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

751
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:53.020
<v Speaker 5>So I get why people would be upset.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you find out what it actually</v>

752
00:32:53.631 --> 00:32:54.350
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go,</v>

753
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:55.460
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not as,</v>

754
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.600
<v Speaker 5>this is more complicated than I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Than I'm seeing on the surface.</v>

755
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.110
<v Speaker 5>It's not simply a cruel person shot a</v>
<v Speaker 5>giraffe and we should be angry at her.</v>

756
00:33:03.111 --> 00:33:04.040
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

757
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:07.550
<v Speaker 5>they had to shoot that giraffe because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was killing other giraffes.</v>

758
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.150
<v Speaker 5>So is it appropriate the way she</v>
<v Speaker 5>celebrated it?</v>

759
00:33:11.151 --> 00:33:12.580
<v Speaker 5>That's when you have to wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

760
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:14.330
<v Speaker 5>but they were eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

761
00:33:14.331 --> 00:33:17.270
<v Speaker 5>that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like they got fucking 800 pounds of</v>

762
00:33:17.271 --> 00:33:19.250
<v Speaker 5>meat or something like that out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

763
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:22.400
<v Speaker 5>That's a huge animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was more than that.</v>

764
00:33:22.401 --> 00:33:24.140
<v Speaker 5>Then they say 2000 pounds of meat.</v>

765
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.980
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a 4,000 pound animal and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got 2000 pounds of meat,</v>

766
00:33:27.981 --> 00:33:31.270
<v Speaker 5>which they give to all the villages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the people there and I know people</v>

767
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:31.830
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

768
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't shoot a draft.</v>

769
00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:38.360
<v Speaker 5>I feel the same way because when I see a</v>
<v Speaker 5>giraffe I don't think of it as something</v>

770
00:33:38.361 --> 00:33:40.880
<v Speaker 5>I want to shoot and eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think of it as something a little kid</v>

771
00:33:40.881 --> 00:33:43.550
<v Speaker 5>can feed at the fucking zoo because</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're so gentle.</v>

772
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:46.310
<v Speaker 5>They're so gentle that they like people</v>
<v Speaker 5>feed them.</v>

773
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.080
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had a thing by our home when I was</v>

774
00:33:48.081 --> 00:33:49.670
<v Speaker 5>growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had a thing dude at a couple of</v>

775
00:33:49.671 --> 00:33:51.860
<v Speaker 5>giraffes out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a couple of lambs and shit.</v>

776
00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:55.280
<v Speaker 5>You can get out there and buy a little</v>
<v Speaker 5>cup of corn and go out there and you</v>

777
00:33:55.281 --> 00:33:56.940
<v Speaker 5>don't even have to know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't have to sign away.</v>

778
00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.820
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't even have to fucking be able</v>

779
00:33:58.821 --> 00:34:00.950
<v Speaker 5>to read very well and you could fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>feed a Giraffe,</v>

780
00:34:00.951 --> 00:34:04.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>point blank is the only animal that is a</v>

781
00:34:04.071 --> 00:34:09.071
<v Speaker 5>wild African animal that we let kids</v>
<v Speaker 5>feed at the fucking zoo.</v>

782
00:34:09.621 --> 00:34:11.510
<v Speaker 5>Little kids can feed them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

783
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:13.580
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe that there's that much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

784
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.710
<v Speaker 5>when I hear that for one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the lady,</v>

785
00:34:15.711 --> 00:34:17.870
<v Speaker 5>what did she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why did she have to put that picture</v>

786
00:34:17.871 --> 00:34:19.670
<v Speaker 5>out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was in it for her to do that?</v>

787
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.780
<v Speaker 5>If she even knew like she's a hunter and</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was excited that you got to kill a</v>

788
00:34:23.781 --> 00:34:25.250
<v Speaker 5>big giraffe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

789
00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.810
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

790
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.270
<v Speaker 5>it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

791
00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:33.110
<v Speaker 5>it gets strange when you just kill a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of things and make stuff.</v>

792
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.630
<v Speaker 5>Trophies and you put them in your trophy</v>
<v Speaker 5>room and you go,</v>

793
00:34:35.631 --> 00:34:36.740
<v Speaker 5>well I want to get it now.</v>

794
00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.240
<v Speaker 5>I want to get a Ram.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

795
00:34:38.241 --> 00:34:39.950
<v Speaker 5>I got a ramp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I want to get a mountain goat.</v>

796
00:34:39.951 --> 00:34:42.410
<v Speaker 5>I'll get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you got like this menagerie inside</v>

797
00:34:42.411 --> 00:34:44.650
<v Speaker 5>of your house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it gets dark man.</v>

798
00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:45.740
<v Speaker 5>Now I want to get a mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

799
00:34:45.741 --> 00:34:47.690
<v Speaker 5>I want to get a stepdad now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to get a fucking.</v>

800
00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.160
<v Speaker 5>But then is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

801
00:34:49.161 --> 00:34:52.340
<v Speaker 5>but if you're eating all of those things</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is how you get your meat.</v>

802
00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:53.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that okay?</v>

803
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:54.261
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

804
00:34:54.261 --> 00:34:55.280
<v Speaker 5>that's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's something.</v>

805
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.790
<v Speaker 5>There's something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all have a strange feeling about</v>

806
00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.070
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea is that people are killing</v>

807
00:35:01.071 --> 00:35:04.850
<v Speaker 5>these things and they're getting some</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of pleasure out of it and then not</v>

808
00:35:04.851 --> 00:35:06.640
<v Speaker 5>doing it just to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

809
00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.560
<v Speaker 5>It's not like even if you you are going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to eat it,</v>

810
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:12.140
<v Speaker 5>we don't want you to be really happy</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you kill something.</v>

811
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:13.820
<v Speaker 5>That's too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's some of it.</v>

812
00:35:13.821 --> 00:35:15.610
<v Speaker 5>I think the villagers should it be able</v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

813
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.740
<v Speaker 5>Ones that should vote on if it was okay</v>
<v Speaker 5>or not.</v>

814
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:21.770
<v Speaker 5>It's in their village.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would vote okay every time because</v>

815
00:35:21.771 --> 00:35:24.230
<v Speaker 5>they get money from it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then to me then that seems okay because</v>

816
00:35:24.231 --> 00:35:26.750
<v Speaker 5>a lot of times it's like we're judging</v>
<v Speaker 5>things from so far away.</v>

817
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.450
<v Speaker 5>We don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We didn't even know what it's like.</v>

818
00:35:29.451 --> 00:35:33.770
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about completely different</v>
<v Speaker 5>dynamics in terms of like the way their</v>

819
00:35:33.771 --> 00:35:35.210
<v Speaker 5>culture works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

820
00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 5>the money for these big hunt so that</v>
<v Speaker 5>these</v>

821
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.410
<v Speaker 2>people pay to shoot all these different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things down there.</v>

822
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:45.030
<v Speaker 2>That's a shitload of money and that shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>load of money for that area,</v>

823
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:49.020
<v Speaker 2>for that part of the world is gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuels conservation efforts.</v>

824
00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:52.650
<v Speaker 2>It pays for these people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially their version of game</v>

825
00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:53.880
<v Speaker 2>wardens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

826
00:35:53.881 --> 00:35:57.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they have these different</v>

827
00:35:57.061 --> 00:35:59.820
<v Speaker 2>people that are employed by these</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting companies and then there's</v>

828
00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:04.850
<v Speaker 2>resources to stop poaching and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources to actively participate in</v>

829
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:12.000
<v Speaker 2>controlling habitat and making sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>these animals are in healthy populations</v>

830
00:36:12.001 --> 00:36:15.030
<v Speaker 2>and bringing their numbers up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all done through the money that</v>

831
00:36:15.031 --> 00:36:16.740
<v Speaker 2>comes from hunting them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's super,</v>

832
00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:19.710
<v Speaker 2>it's super fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

833
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.750
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because it doesn't make</v>

834
00:36:21.751 --> 00:36:25.080
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the people that are paying to</v>

835
00:36:25.081 --> 00:36:27.840
<v Speaker 2>keep these animal alive are also the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones that want to shoot up.</v>

836
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:31.380
<v Speaker 2>So people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the F we would like it to be.</v>

837
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.950
<v Speaker 2>All the conservation money comes from</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who just love animals and want to</v>

838
00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:36.960
<v Speaker 2>keep them alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the case.</v>

839
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.070
<v Speaker 2>That's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

840
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:43.100
<v Speaker 2>The money comes almost exclusively</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are a lot of conservation</v>

841
00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:48.891
<v Speaker 2>groups that do donate for wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 2>protection and for preserving of animal</v>

842
00:36:48.961 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 2>habitats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>

843
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.510
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely some people that</v>

844
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:52.380
<v Speaker 2>donate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

845
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.900
<v Speaker 2>But there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even close to the amount of</v>

846
00:36:54.901 --> 00:36:58.680
<v Speaker 2>money that's raised from hunting to and</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially hunting you on that local</v>

847
00:36:58.681 --> 00:36:59.530
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're a,</v>

848
00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:00.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some of these,</v>

849
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.300
<v Speaker 2>like these programs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there are a little bit more</v>

850
00:37:03.301 --> 00:37:04.530
<v Speaker 2>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more blanket,</v>

851
00:37:04.531 --> 00:37:06.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you get into that local level.</v>

852
00:37:06.481 --> 00:37:08.700
<v Speaker 2>$50,000 can keep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

853
00:37:08.701 --> 00:37:13.500
<v Speaker 2>a small town or small habitat around for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the year,</v>

854
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:17.610
<v Speaker 2>that money who was getting all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

855
00:37:17.611 --> 00:37:18.560
<v Speaker 2>But you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

856
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:20.190
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes us uncomfortable.</v>

857
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.600
<v Speaker 2>But rightly so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

858
00:37:21.601 --> 00:37:24.420
<v Speaker 2>you look at a Giraffe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want giraffes to stay alive.</v>

859
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:25.620
<v Speaker 2>You say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing,</v>

860
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:30.150
<v Speaker 2>but we have to know the facts behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this particular case where they,</v>

861
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:33.330
<v Speaker 2>that giraffe had to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that draft was killing giraffes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They swing their head like,</v>

864
00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:41.430

<v Speaker 2>like a mace smash into each other.</v>

865
00:37:41.431 --> 00:37:44.700

<v Speaker 2>just be myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>A little bit,</v>

941
00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.200

<v Speaker 2>The first time I ever interviewed</v>

942
00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:40.270
<v Speaker 2>anybody ever after a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had an interview Mark Coleman after he</v>

943
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:45.271
<v Speaker 2>choked out Dan several.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was in like UFC fucking 12.</v>

944
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.670
<v Speaker 2>So that was 1997.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

945
00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Mark Coleman was so fired up man because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had just won the heavyweight title</v>

946
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:59.960
<v Speaker 2>fucking jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was so jacked and uh,</v>

947
00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:05.020
<v Speaker 2>he was fucking pumped up and he had no</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea Bayer for that movie doesn't even,</v>

948
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:08.410
<v Speaker 2>he was the king of the world back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark the hammer,</v>

949
00:41:08.411 --> 00:41:10.410
<v Speaker 2>coleman changed the fucking game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the.</v>

950
00:41:10.411 --> 00:41:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Because she was like a real world class</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestler,</v>

951
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:19.600
<v Speaker 2>taken dudes down and just smashing them</v>
<v Speaker 2>any was fucking huge,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

953
00:41:21.731 --> 00:41:26.650
<v Speaker 2>And so I had to interview first</v>
<v Speaker 2>interview anybody and had no idea who I</v>

954
00:41:26.651 --> 00:41:27.670
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

955
00:41:27.671 --> 00:41:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck is this guy interviewing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I ask respectful questions and then</v>

956
00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 2>gave him an opportunity to express</v>
<v Speaker 2>himself and it</v>

957
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.870
<v Speaker 5>worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I prepared for that man.</v>

958
00:41:35.871 --> 00:41:38.180
<v Speaker 5>I was nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

959
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.380
<v Speaker 5>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was nervous.</v>

960
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.790
<v Speaker 6>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

961
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:41.481
<v Speaker 6>Because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to me,</v>

962
00:41:41.481 --> 00:41:42.291
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit,</v>

963
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:43.330
<v Speaker 6>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

964
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:46.430
<v Speaker 6>this man is going into the cage after</v>
<v Speaker 6>lunch.</v>

965
00:41:46.431 --> 00:41:47.360
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

966
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:49.480
<v Speaker 6>That's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How you.</v>

967
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:50.750
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I felt like me.</v>

968
00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:52.250
<v Speaker 6>But like when you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

969
00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:53.050
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

970
00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:53.630
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these,</v>

971
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:55.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these guys are very,</v>

972
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:57.500
<v Speaker 6>some of these admin are very physically</v>
<v Speaker 6>imposing to me.</v>

973
00:41:57.501 --> 00:41:59.570
<v Speaker 6>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so when you,</v>

974
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.470
<v Speaker 6>sometimes I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

975
00:42:00.471 --> 00:42:03.100
<v Speaker 6>I can't believe that you go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just brave as well.</v>

976
00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:06.650
<v Speaker 5>No one thing that I think they all know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if they don't know,</v>

977
00:42:06.651 --> 00:42:11.651
<v Speaker 5>I want them to know that I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything other than them to shine.</v>

978
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:15.530
<v Speaker 5>That's all I'm trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when I interview people,</v>

979
00:42:15.531 --> 00:42:18.830
<v Speaker 5>but I'm trying to do is give them an</v>
<v Speaker 5>opportunity to talk about moments.</v>

980
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.960
<v Speaker 5>I just want to give them a chance to</v>
<v Speaker 5>shine,</v>

981
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:23.150
<v Speaker 5>show who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want them to feel comfortable.</v>

982
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:27.170
<v Speaker 5>I look out for their best interests a</v>
<v Speaker 5>really do I try to do that with</v>

983
00:42:27.171 --> 00:42:29.150
<v Speaker 5>commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if it sounds critical,</v>

984
00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:34.520
<v Speaker 5>my critical commentary is just expose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I look at it in terms of I'm</v>

985
00:42:34.521 --> 00:42:38.540
<v Speaker 5>looking at it like it's a math problem</v>
<v Speaker 5>or a system and if I see things I'm</v>

986
00:42:38.541 --> 00:42:39.191
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is.</v>

987
00:42:39.191 --> 00:42:42.290
<v Speaker 5>This is an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if the person can win with this</v>

988
00:42:42.291 --> 00:42:43.820
<v Speaker 5>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a real issue.</v>

989
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:46.700
<v Speaker 5>Like a a high level person is gonna</v>
<v Speaker 5>exploit that issue.</v>

990
00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:48.470
<v Speaker 5>Maybe this guy can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this.</v>

991
00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.320
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes people get upset at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That does happen,</v>

992
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:51.861
<v Speaker 5>but I say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

993
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:56.540
<v Speaker 5>I have to bose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It made me think I exaggerate,</v>

994
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:59.730
<v Speaker 5>but believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those fucking high class killers that</v>

995
00:42:59.731 --> 00:43:03.020
<v Speaker 5>see the same shit that I see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to try to exaggerate that</v>

996
00:43:03.021 --> 00:43:04.970
<v Speaker 5>shit too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're going to try to jump on that</v>

997
00:43:04.971 --> 00:43:07.480
<v Speaker 5>little hole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a little hole somewhere and that</v>

998
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:08.930
<v Speaker 5>happens all the time with people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>get mad.</v>

999
00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 5>If you point out their holes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't mean they can't win.</v>

1000
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.820
<v Speaker 5>There's guys who've gotten their entire</v>
<v Speaker 5>career,</v>

1001
00:43:13.821 --> 00:43:16.790
<v Speaker 5>they rarely throw a kick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They never submit anybody and there some</v>

1002
00:43:16.791 --> 00:43:21.140
<v Speaker 5>of the best of all time that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to have a fully complete game.</v>

1003
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:26.320
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it's better to just be ultra</v>
<v Speaker 5>good at one or two things and those</v>

1004
00:43:26.361 --> 00:43:28.160
<v Speaker 5>other things just don't fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 5>submissions,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Different kinds of raccoon.</v>

1031
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:25.560
<v Speaker 5>Raccoons that live in high density areas</v>
<v Speaker 5>are bolder species and they have access</v>

1032
00:44:25.751 --> 00:44:29.470
<v Speaker 5>to massive amounts of food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just would lift off the lid from</v>

1033
00:44:29.471 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 5>the garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can they lift off lid to get</v>

1034
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.990

1035
00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:35.730
<v Speaker 1>All but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'd just be sitting there staring</v>

1092
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Like he's just chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not worried that something's going</v>

1100
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:19.890
<v Speaker 1>at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the crazy thing is he could hold</v>

1101
00:47:19.891 --> 00:47:24.891
<v Speaker 1>onto that plastic tube with his hands</v>
<v Speaker 1>and feet to of each two of his hands or</v>

1102
00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:27.540
<v Speaker 1>to have his feet or their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of their body,</v>

1103
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.590
<v Speaker 1>their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This big tiny.</v>

1104
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine having a little bitty</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby hand and having to do something.</v>

1105
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:34.541
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>

1108
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Imagine opening a door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't even open a door.</v>

1109
00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:44.380
<v Speaker 1>You just have to stare at a door knob</v>
<v Speaker 1>with little bro.</v>

1110
00:47:44.381 --> 00:47:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking the littlest hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tiny.</v>

1111
00:47:47.021 --> 00:47:48.850
<v Speaker 1>They'll fuck you up to those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1112
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Raccoons eat a lot of chickens too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like to get into chicken coops.</v>

1113
00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Fuck up chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would jump on your back.</v>

1114
00:47:53.651 --> 00:47:55.300
<v Speaker 1>It was almost the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the crazy thing I remember about</v>

1115
00:47:55.301 --> 00:47:58.030
<v Speaker 1>being around raccoons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It felt like they were playing with you,</v>

1116
00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:02.260
<v Speaker 1>but had an immediate propensity for</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence like gay could go like very</v>

1117
00:48:02.261 --> 00:48:07.261
<v Speaker 1>quick from fun and comfortable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely violent.</v>

1118
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.340
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1119
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:13.130
<v Speaker 1>what a rough and tumble world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world of the raccoons mother fucker.</v>

1120
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:15.070
<v Speaker 1>They live at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at your swing the door.</v>

1121
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Look at this now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a close the door here</v>

1122
00:48:19.421 --> 00:48:22.420
<v Speaker 1>and it opens it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My grandmother had a friend that had a</v>

1123
00:48:22.421 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 1>couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he just knows how to open doors.</v>

1124
00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:28.413
<v Speaker 1>Creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1125
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:33.670
<v Speaker 1>There's something weird about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a strange animal that like almost</v>

1126
00:48:33.671 --> 00:48:35.650
<v Speaker 1>seems like it shouldn't be real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1127
00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:38.740
<v Speaker 1>like a smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird animal that lives in the forest.</v>

1128
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Like you expected to start talking to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid that's on a walk.</v>

1129

1132

<v Speaker 1>dice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This turnover.</v>

1133
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Your grandmother won't mind if you hang</v>
<v Speaker 1>out with me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's made of candy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but that's weird to me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the animals that have adapted to living</v>

<v Speaker 1>fighting at this.</v>

1156
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:53.350

<v Speaker 1>That's where you draw back right there.</v>

1165
00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And other one jumped in.</v>

1166
00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Three coyotes strategically held by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush.</v>

1169
00:50:21.161 --> 00:50:25.570
<v Speaker 1>point where you know that humans fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals like they did back in the old</v>

1170
00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:25.990
<v Speaker 1>days?</v>

1173
00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do that in another country for</v>

1174
00:50:29.811 --> 00:50:30.920
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:35.390
<v Speaker 2>If somebody from some crazy country</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they had some maniacal dicker</v>

1176
00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:40.220
<v Speaker 2>dictator who's on crystal meth and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to have humans versus lions</v>

1177
00:50:40.221 --> 00:50:42.600
<v Speaker 2>given to a sword and the shield and</v>
<v Speaker 2>armor and him.</v>

1180
00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think there's people with</v>

<v Speaker 2>enough money,</v>

<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

1184
00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.140
<v Speaker 2>there's people just probably can't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfied.</v>

1185
00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.950
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't get any.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What else I want?</v>

1191
00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:17.120
<v Speaker 2>I want to watch a dude fight a lion with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sword.</v>

1192
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:20.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is probably like some place that</v>

1193
00:51:20.051 --> 00:51:20.930
<v Speaker 2>you can go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1194
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:25.550
<v Speaker 2>And it's got like a drains in the floor</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they hose it down from all the</v>

1195
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:28.370
<v Speaker 2>blood and it's built like a hockey rink.</v>

1196
00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1197
00:51:29.661 --> 00:51:32.480
<v Speaker 2>the floor underneath the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is zoo just like that.</v>

1198
00:51:32.481 --> 00:51:34.620
<v Speaker 2>They used to do it in the Roman days and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1199
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:37.250
<v Speaker 2>it rises up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they let the animal out,</v>

1200
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:42.080
<v Speaker 2>close it down and then they opened the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cage and the fucking dude stands there</v>

1201
00:51:42.081 --> 00:51:46.790
<v Speaker 2>with the sword and the crowd goes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all listening to techno music</v>

1202
00:51:46.791 --> 00:51:48.640
<v Speaker 2>and speak in Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then</v>

1203
00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:53.900
<v Speaker 2>suddenly we know where they are at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

1204
00:51:53.901 --> 00:51:55.640
<v Speaker 2>in that fucking lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Go to war.</v>

1205
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.840
<v Speaker 2>They go at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1206
00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He think he has like face paint on or</v>

1207
00:51:59.931 --> 00:52:02.870
<v Speaker 2>anything or he's just [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was probably a good move.</v>

1208
00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Pull a face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paint on.</v>

1209
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:05.320
<v Speaker 2>You need every edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1210
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:07.430
<v Speaker 2>You know you got to fight a line with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sword.</v>

1211
00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:10.730
<v Speaker 2>You probably gonna get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to cut the line and then</v>

1212
00:52:10.731 --> 00:52:12.030
<v Speaker 2>get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're going to do.</v>

1213
00:52:12.031 --> 00:52:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Then you get one good hit at it.</v>

1214
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:16.700
<v Speaker 2>If you're lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably won't even really it.</v>

1215
00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You swordman yeah.</v>

1216
00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:21.260
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any idea how slow you are</v>

1217
00:52:21.261 --> 00:52:24.980
<v Speaker 2>until you're around a cat that kills</v>
<v Speaker 2>antelopes and shit.</v>

1218
00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:28.340
<v Speaker 2>Chases after willdabeast takes him out</v>
<v Speaker 2>with his face.</v>

1219
00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:31.880
<v Speaker 2>You're just that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea.</v>

1220
00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.300
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1221
00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you get a shot off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with the cat wants to the cats</v>

1222
00:52:36.501 --> 00:52:39.860
<v Speaker 2>on you so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You barely have time to move your arm.</v>

1223
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.260
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

1224
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:45.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you have any idea how fast</v>

1225
00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.440
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a real Predator moves and how</v>

1226
00:52:48.441 --> 00:52:50.920
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously soft human beings are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1227
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some.</v>

1228
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:56.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking Conan the barbarian due</v>
<v Speaker 2>to can actually swing a sword,</v>

1229
00:52:56.391 --> 00:52:59.750
<v Speaker 2>a heavy sword with some fucking oomph</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind it.</v>

1230
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever pick up a real sword?</v>

1231
00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.900
<v Speaker 2>It's heavy as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1232
00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:06.530
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking heavy and it's sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost scary to have one sometimes.</v>

1233
00:53:06.531 --> 00:53:07.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like fuck.</v>

1234
00:53:07.341 --> 00:53:10.730
<v Speaker 2>I would hurt myself or I'd cut my cousin</v>
<v Speaker 2>up or something on accident or had hurt</v>

1235
00:53:10.731 --> 00:53:11.930
<v Speaker 2>somebody at the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1236
00:53:11.931 --> 00:53:16.580
<v Speaker 2>The odds of you killing that lion with</v>
<v Speaker 2>one swipe or almost zero,</v>

1237
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:18.650
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1238
00:53:18.651 --> 00:53:20.750
<v Speaker 2>How would you attack it then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say you're in a place.</v>

1239
00:53:20.751 --> 00:53:23.270
<v Speaker 2>You've got this sword.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe got one other weapon,</v>

1240
00:53:23.271 --> 00:53:25.140
<v Speaker 2>a small weapon you keep on your leg or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1241
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:26.520
<v Speaker 2>The only way</v>

1242
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:32.120
<v Speaker 5>that I think you have a chance is if you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can keep your shit together and plugins</v>

1243
00:53:32.761 --> 00:53:35.250
<v Speaker 5>that blade and it's chest as it leaps on</v>
<v Speaker 5>you</v>

1244
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:41.750
<v Speaker 5>as the only way you would have to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>ready to as it comes at you to push</v>

1245
00:53:42.601 --> 00:53:47.460
<v Speaker 5>forward and hold onto that sword with</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything you have as it's coming at</v>

1246
00:53:47.461 --> 00:53:50.970
<v Speaker 5>you and the blade goes into its body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That might be the only way,</v>

1247
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:55.020
<v Speaker 5>and even then it's going to walk you and</v>
<v Speaker 5>rip you apart.</v>

1248
00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:58.350
<v Speaker 5>You want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to be able to.</v>

1249
00:53:58.351 --> 00:54:00.380
<v Speaker 5>It's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he could do it to.</v>

1250
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:02.250
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

1251
00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:03.600
<v Speaker 5>You don't think you could.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1252
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:05.670
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you would keep both hands on.</v>

1253
00:54:05.671 --> 00:54:06.780
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how you acted it out.</v>

1254
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:09.810
<v Speaker 5>You keep both hands on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are not going to be able to hang on.</v>

1255
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:12.870
<v Speaker 5>You're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a different kind of power.</v>

1256
00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.790
<v Speaker 5>It's the power of many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many men.</v>

1257
00:54:14.791 --> 00:54:17.760
<v Speaker 5>It's like the idea of a who borrowed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think you could win a tug of war</v>

1258
00:54:17.761 --> 00:54:18.810
<v Speaker 5>with 10 dudes?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1259
00:54:18.811 --> 00:54:21.000
<v Speaker 5>Fuck Yeah Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most guys are bitches.</v>

1260
00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:27.150
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a chance?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a strength level.</v>

1261
00:54:27.151 --> 00:54:31.160
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to be like some Herculean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Marriott's,</v>

1262
00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.740
<v Speaker 5>Pooja,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nowatzski type dudes.</v>

1263
00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:37.810
<v Speaker 5>Some enormous fucking world's strongest</v>
<v Speaker 5>man guy with chalk all over your hands</v>

1264
00:54:37.891 --> 00:54:42.240
<v Speaker 5>and a good grip on the blade and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 5>tie it down like a Rodeo rider plunging</v>

1265
00:54:42.241 --> 00:54:44.280
<v Speaker 5>into the heart of a lion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And even then,</v>

1266
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:47.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you're hanging onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that things gonna Book and kick</v>

1267
00:54:47.521 --> 00:54:50.970
<v Speaker 5>and and you're going to be so terrified</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's a male lion,</v>

1268
00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:55.050
<v Speaker 5>you get to see that main in that face</v>
<v Speaker 5>and your body scare you.</v>

1269
00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.370
<v Speaker 5>You're going to get diminished.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1270
00:54:56.371 --> 00:54:58.140
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be so overwhelmed with</v>
<v Speaker 5>adrenaline.</v>

1271
00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:02.070
<v Speaker 5>Your instinct is going to be to just run</v>
<v Speaker 5>away from that thing as far as you can.</v>

1272
00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:05.390
<v Speaker 5>Do you feel like some truths as like any</v>
<v Speaker 5>truths,</v>

1273
00:55:05.391 --> 00:55:08.640
<v Speaker 5>like any innate truth would be revealed</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you're,</v>

1274
00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:11.280
<v Speaker 5>as you're sitting here looking at each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other's eyes and you know that it's</v>

1275
00:55:11.281 --> 00:55:14.400
<v Speaker 5>going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you're even there at that</v>

1276
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:15.660
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if you're.</v>

1277
00:55:15.661 --> 00:55:20.661
<v Speaker 5>I think you're such a primal experience</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I think at that point you are</v>

1278
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:24.570
<v Speaker 5>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're barely a human.</v>

1279
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:29.460
<v Speaker 5>You're just a series of synapses firing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are designed to protect you from</v>

1280
00:55:29.461 --> 00:55:31.680
<v Speaker 5>predators.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you just in full panic,</v>

1281
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:36.870
<v Speaker 5>full adrenaline rush,</v>
<v Speaker 5>full survival mode where you don't.</v>

1282
00:55:36.871 --> 00:55:38.790
<v Speaker 5>You don't know what the fuck is going</v>
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

1283
00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:40.860
<v Speaker 5>I have some friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man.</v>

1284
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.790
<v Speaker 5>I've got some friends that got a</v>
<v Speaker 5>taxpayer there.</v>

1285
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:46.350
<v Speaker 5>They got attacked by a giant grizzly</v>
<v Speaker 5>bear and they.</v>

1286
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:50.730
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody got away survived luckily,</v>

1287
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:56.150
<v Speaker 5>but they were in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were in an island off of Alaska,</v>

1288
00:55:56.641 --> 00:56:01.020
<v Speaker 5>of fog neck island,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's a huge population of brown</v>

1289
00:56:01.021 --> 00:56:03.290
<v Speaker 5>bears and elk and they all lived</v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

1290
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.090
<v Speaker 5>These,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these fucking parents are huge and this</v>

1291
00:56:06.091 --> 00:56:08.160
<v Speaker 5>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was like an 11 foot bear,</v>

1292
00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:12.900
<v Speaker 5>charged into their camp and knocked</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone over like guys were flying left</v>

1293
00:56:12.901 --> 00:56:15.960
<v Speaker 5>and right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the dudes is a nicknames.</v>

1294
00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:18.480
<v Speaker 5>Dartmouth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dartmouth was riding on the back.</v>

1295
00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:21.390
<v Speaker 5>If you want to hear the whole story and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a great story,</v>

1296
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:26.750
<v Speaker 5>go to the mediator and I think the</v>
<v Speaker 5>episodes just say a fog.</v>

1297
00:56:27.251 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 5>Neck island.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it says bear attack on a</v>

1298
00:56:30.671 --> 00:56:32.860
<v Speaker 5>fog neck island,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you're a.</v>

1299
00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:36.640
<v Speaker 5>If you're a clever googler,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll find it's a great podcast.</v>

1300
00:56:36.641 --> 00:56:38.500
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Steve Rainelle is a genius.</v>

1301
00:56:38.501 --> 00:56:40.630
<v Speaker 5>He's a really interesting guy and a</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunter,</v>

1302
00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:42.460
<v Speaker 5>like we just totally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>totally</v>

1303
00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:48.700
<v Speaker 5>defies the stereotype that people have</v>
<v Speaker 5>of like doofy hunters like super well</v>

1304
00:56:48.701 --> 00:56:49.090
<v Speaker 5>read.</v>

1305
00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:52.450
<v Speaker 5>Really interesting guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but his depiction of this event,</v>

1306
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:55.720
<v Speaker 5>the most striking thing about it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it defied everything that he</v>

1307
00:56:55.721 --> 00:56:58.660
<v Speaker 5>thought it would be like if there was an</v>
<v Speaker 5>actual bear attack.</v>

1308
00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.850
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like hemingway esque almost in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird way.</v>

1309
00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:02.140
<v Speaker 5>Well know in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1310
00:57:02.141 --> 00:57:05.260
<v Speaker 5>Because when look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if something really fucking crazy</v>

1311
00:57:05.261 --> 00:57:08.380
<v Speaker 5>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the best case scenario is there someone</v>

1312
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:11.140
<v Speaker 5>who actually knows how to write.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right there.</v>

1313
00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:14.530
<v Speaker 5>When this something crazy happened and</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the case,</v>

1314
00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:18.160
<v Speaker 5>but instead of writing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just does a very eloquent job of</v>

1315
00:57:18.161 --> 00:57:19.990
<v Speaker 5>describing it as does everybody else</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1316
00:57:19.991 --> 00:57:21.690
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was quite a few guys there.</v>

1317
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:26.710
<v Speaker 5>My friend Rammi Warren was there and</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yonis will tell us this is one where</v>

1318
00:57:26.921 --> 00:57:29.620
<v Speaker 5>they got um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>false attacked.</v>

1319
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:34.300
<v Speaker 5>This was in British Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got false charged of false charge</v>

1320
00:57:34.301 --> 00:57:36.430
<v Speaker 5>is a bear this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in this case,</v>

1321
00:57:36.431 --> 00:57:40.300
<v Speaker 5>it was a bear with cubs and she just</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to scare them off.</v>

1322
00:57:40.301 --> 00:57:45.301
<v Speaker 5>So she came running at them full clip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy to see because they fired</v>

1323
00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:48.550
<v Speaker 5>near her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they had the discipline to not fire</v>

1324
00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:49.610
<v Speaker 5>her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1325
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:54.630
<v Speaker 5>that is really impressive because this</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing just came fucking running at them</v>

1326
00:57:55.391 --> 00:57:57.520
<v Speaker 5>and it's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like here it is.</v>

1327
00:57:58.410 --> 00:57:59.620
<v Speaker 5>Like give me some volume here.</v>

1328
00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:08.260
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I will shoot to kill this</v>

1329
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:16.950
<v Speaker 7>peels off man's away and Callahan says</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll never forget.</v>

1330
00:58:16.951 --> 00:58:20.950
<v Speaker 7>I want to give them a tee shirt with him</v>
<v Speaker 7>and his mustache and this smell us now</v>

1331
00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:25.530
<v Speaker 7>it smells now lady.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a sentence that comes to mind,</v>

1332
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:31.390
<v Speaker 5>so that is what he had experienced</v>
<v Speaker 5>before and so he,</v>

1333
00:58:31.391 --> 00:58:35.790
<v Speaker 5>he kind of kept his composure in that</v>
<v Speaker 5>situation and he was like this other one</v>

1334
00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:41.420
<v Speaker 5>where the grizzly bear literally knocked</v>
<v Speaker 5>them over to the teeth were gnashing 10</v>

1335
00:58:41.821 --> 00:58:45.030
<v Speaker 5>inches from his face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just so many people.</v>

1336
00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:47.670
<v Speaker 5>The grizzly probably didn't expect there</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be that many people there.</v>

1337
00:58:47.671 --> 00:58:50.310
<v Speaker 5>There was like seven people there is</v>
<v Speaker 5>that my views.</v>

1338
00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:51.630
<v Speaker 5>Let me think of how many people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

1339
00:58:51.631 --> 00:58:52.464
<v Speaker 5>two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three.</v>

1340
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:56.190
<v Speaker 5>At least five people there and I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what saved him,</v>

1341
00:58:56.191 --> 00:58:59.280
<v Speaker 5>but the camera people to is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It probably was about seven people and I</v>

1342
00:58:59.281 --> 00:59:03.720
<v Speaker 5>think that's what saved them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fact that this was a giant mass of</v>

1343
00:59:03.721 --> 00:59:05.910
<v Speaker 5>people and the bear didn't know which</v>
<v Speaker 5>way to go,</v>

1344
00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:09.000
<v Speaker 5>and one of the dudes Yanas hit it in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>face with trekking poles.</v>

1345
00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:09.953
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's trekking poles.</v>

1346
00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.750
<v Speaker 5>He said it was right there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>smacked in the face and thing.</v>

1347
00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:14.610
<v Speaker 5>Veered off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the guys,</v>

1348
00:59:14.611 --> 00:59:16.040
<v Speaker 5>remy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he juked it.</v>

1349
00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:18.520
<v Speaker 5>He faked right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then went laugh on the bear.</v>

1350
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:20.880
<v Speaker 5>There was just so much going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bear just ran through it.</v>

1351
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 5>One of the guys wound</v>

1352
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.660
<v Speaker 2>up on the bears back now for like 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>yards there was running and he was</v>

1353
00:59:26.661 --> 00:59:29.480
<v Speaker 2>somehow into the stuck on the bears back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then fell off.</v>

1354
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:33.500
<v Speaker 2>This is how big the bear was in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to see a bear,</v>

1355
00:59:33.501 --> 00:59:34.940
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think it's going to be like</v>

1356
00:59:34.941 --> 00:59:37.880
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that intense,</v>

1357
00:59:37.881 --> 00:59:39.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't think it because the first</v>

1358
00:59:39.741 --> 00:59:42.100
<v Speaker 2>picture they showed that bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he seemed like a calm Bayer,</v>

1359
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:42.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that bear.</v>

1360
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:45.440
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst thing about bears is they</v>

1361
00:59:45.441 --> 00:59:49.400
<v Speaker 2>advertise them mostly Disney movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you see a bear teddy bear?</v>

1362
00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:50.990
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1363
00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have fucking bearish fucking to on</v>

1364
00:59:53.691 --> 00:59:55.070

<v Speaker 2>you have all that kind of shit,</v>

1365
00:59:55.071 --> 00:59:57.150
<v Speaker 2>but it's like sweeties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1366
00:59:58.390 --> 01:00:00.080

<v Speaker 2>They're your buddy.</v>

1367
01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about those little kids that their</v>

1368
01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:03.290
<v Speaker 2>dad got eaten in front of them?</v>

1369
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do those little kids,</v>

1370
01:00:04.371 --> 01:00:07.850
<v Speaker 2>what if they had a little pet polar bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not outside the realm of</v>

1371
01:00:07.851 --> 01:00:11.360
<v Speaker 2>possibility with little kids and you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced that that's what those animals</v>

1372
01:00:11.361 --> 01:00:12.300
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1373
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you shouldn't have a pet</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuffed polar bear.</v>

1374
01:00:14.901 --> 01:00:17.090
<v Speaker 2>They're cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a path.</v>

1375
01:00:17.091 --> 01:00:18.140
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A toy.</v>

1376
01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Would you have a little barrier thing as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pet?</v>

1377
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:23.640
<v Speaker 2>No fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man released.</v>

1378
01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He seemed like a guy that might have a</v>

1379
01:00:25.731 --> 01:00:28.190
<v Speaker 2>little vague to that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

1380
01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:29.590
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not listening to you.</v>

1381
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Get Away with all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might be your friend,</v>

1382
01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:34.340
<v Speaker 2>it might be your friend as they grow</v>
<v Speaker 2>older,</v>

1383
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.140
<v Speaker 2>but you better keep that food around</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

1384
01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:39.260
<v Speaker 2>And even if you have that food around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't keep them from killing other</v>

1385
01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:41.660
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a guy who has his bear</v>

1386
01:00:41.661 --> 01:00:43.790
<v Speaker 2>trained look at the size of that fucker.</v>

1387
01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:46.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's definitely probably.</v>

1388
01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was like a gay.</v>

1389
01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:53.030
<v Speaker 2>If you keep this animal fed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people that have bears.</v>

1390
01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Does this in Russia is Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1391
01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:00.560
<v Speaker 2>So if there's people that keep bears fed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and take care of them and treat them</v>

1392
01:01:00.561 --> 01:01:01.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1393
01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:05.420
<v Speaker 2>and this is the thing about bears too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is at burt bears are omnivores.</v>

1394
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:06.830
<v Speaker 2>They eat everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1395
01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Hate animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They vegetables,</v>

1396
01:01:09.201 --> 01:01:11.270
<v Speaker 2>they eat everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1397
01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.180
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like people in a lot of way in</v>

1398
01:01:14.181 --> 01:01:15.150
<v Speaker 2>that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1399
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:17.690
<v Speaker 2>their diet very so they don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>

1400
01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:21.500
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to kill things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't necessarily have the desire to</v>

1401
01:01:21.501 --> 01:01:23.710
<v Speaker 2>chase things down and killed things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cat does.</v>

1402
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Like cats have a deep desire to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1403
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Like cats can't shake that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1404
01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.550
<v Speaker 2>I think you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could feed a bear well and take care</v>

1405
01:01:31.551 --> 01:01:33.320
<v Speaker 2>of it and you could probably avoid most</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

1406
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.270
<v Speaker 2>But if it ever feels threatened in any</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1407
01:01:35.271 --> 01:01:37.970
<v Speaker 2>you're so fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do you think you have any like</v>

1408
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:39.920
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might not even notice when that bear</v>

1409
01:01:39.921 --> 01:01:42.050
<v Speaker 2>feels that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't.</v>

1410
01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:44.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a beer expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a real bear expert would see</v>

1411
01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.550
<v Speaker 2>that something's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Bears Act and sketchy</v>

1412
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:49.310
<v Speaker 2>or bears like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1413
01:01:49.311 --> 01:01:51.740
<v Speaker 2>they just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start acting irritated.</v>

1414
01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.840
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1415
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.570
<v Speaker 2>This guy is definitely a pervert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think so?</v>

1416
01:01:56.930 --> 01:02:00.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This because I think there's got to be</v>

1417
01:02:00.081 --> 01:02:05.081
<v Speaker 2>something inside of you that gets off in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a weird way to do this.</v>

1418
01:02:05.151 --> 01:02:10.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't think this feels natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're intoxicated by powerful</v>

1419
01:02:10.011 --> 01:02:13.490
<v Speaker 2>animals and having these powerful</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals around gives them a thrill.</v>

1420
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thrill has to be.</v>

1421
01:02:15.351 --> 01:02:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they could kill him.</v>

1422
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:18.890
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

1423
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:19.900
<v Speaker 2>And also did like</v>

1424
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>the thrill is they are beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures,</v>

1425
01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>so you do want to be around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're cool to just be around and if</v>

1426
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make friends with this beautiful</v>

1427
01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>creature that could just kill a mass of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1428
01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:33.090
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of feels fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous.</v>

1429
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1430
01:02:34.021 --> 01:02:35.740
<v Speaker 1>It feels dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a celebrity.</v>

1431
01:02:35.741 --> 01:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like no one else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John or are way better.</v>

1432
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>You got a pet grizzly come over my</v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

1433
01:02:40.351 --> 01:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a 12 foot dog that lives in my</v>

1434
01:02:42.721 --> 01:02:44.960
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1435
01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:46.700
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but cats seed.</v>

1436
01:02:46.701 --> 01:02:48.460
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more.</v>

1437
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>These are different animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a different thing,</v>

1438
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>but I think if people have an animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

1439
01:02:54.511 --> 01:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking next to it at night and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

1440
01:02:56.550 --> 01:02:58.690
<v Speaker 1>I think some of them shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1441
01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:01.560
<v Speaker 1>probably near it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're getting involved</v>

1442
01:03:01.561 --> 01:03:03.120
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they're doing near it.</v>

1443
01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.390
<v Speaker 1>But just fuck right next to the tiger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get them horny.</v>

1444
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:10.080
<v Speaker 1>What do beastiality needs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've thought this about</v>

1445
01:03:10.081 --> 01:03:12.840
<v Speaker 1>beastiality and I don't know if we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>even talked about this,</v>

1446
01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.170
<v Speaker 1>but if you have sex with a local animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that lives here,</v>

1447
01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:18.530
<v Speaker 1>how livestock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens,</v>

1448
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.920
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up.</v>

1449
01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:22.230
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1450
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel overseas with the specific</v>

1451
01:03:24.481 --> 01:03:26.730
<v Speaker 1>intention of having sex with an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1452
01:03:26.731 --> 01:03:27.600
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

1453
01:03:27.601 --> 01:03:29.160
<v Speaker 1>that's so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1454
01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:30.750
<v Speaker 1>the rules are different depending on who</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ask.</v>

1455
01:03:30.751 --> 01:03:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Probably locally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure in some places they're like</v>

1456
01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.290
<v Speaker 1>me some money and you can do whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want it.</v>

1457
01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:37.770
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1458
01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:41.430
<v Speaker 1>but if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you fuck a mountain lion,</v>

1459
01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:43.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a strong man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I.</v>

1460
01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

1461
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:48.390
<v Speaker 1>You never buy a beer again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fuck a mountain?</v>

1462
01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:51.900
<v Speaker 1>You fuck a links that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not beastiality.</v>

1463
01:03:51.901 --> 01:03:54.870
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like some Ragnar Loft Brooke type</v>

1464
01:03:54.871 --> 01:03:55.321
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1465
01:03:55.321 --> 01:03:57.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the bravest thing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a viking shit.</v>

1466
01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Imagine a trying to keep an erection and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then sneak up on a bucket animals,</v>

1467
01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:03.810
<v Speaker 1>but you'd have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out a way to hold him</v>

1468
01:04:03.811 --> 01:04:07.230
<v Speaker 1>down and you think there's ever a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best of the mountain line then</v>

1469
01:04:07.231 --> 01:04:09.120
<v Speaker 1>fucked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1470
01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think.</v>

1471
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:16.800
<v Speaker 1>I believe there might be another Theo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vaughn or an infinite number of them out</v>

1472
01:04:16.801 --> 01:04:20.190
<v Speaker 1>in the universe talking to another me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that were sitting in the exact same.</v>

1473
01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.230
<v Speaker 1>The exact same notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>

1474
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I believe any of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people on any of those plants that have</v>

1475
01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:28.050
<v Speaker 1>planets ever fucked a mountain lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1476
01:04:28.051 --> 01:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>A long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that when?</v>

1477
01:04:30.011 --> 01:04:31.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no youtube.</v>

1478
01:04:31.411 --> 01:04:34.050
<v Speaker 1>There was nobody to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only person who knows is the other</v>

1479
01:04:34.051 --> 01:04:35.820
<v Speaker 1>two people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are gonna think they're lying</v>

1480
01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>because they're alcoholics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could eat.</v>

1481
01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1482
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any squirrels that</v>
<v Speaker 1>rape people either.</v>

1483
01:04:41.701 --> 01:04:46.701
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's more likely.</v>

1484
01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.710
<v Speaker 1>It's more likely that a squirrel would</v>
<v Speaker 1>rape a person.</v>

1485
01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see a school kind of funk.</v>

1486
01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Someone's drunk who passed out in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>yard.</v>

1487
01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:56.610
<v Speaker 1>That's more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a crazy super horny squirrel.</v>

1488
01:04:56.611 --> 01:04:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Just can't keep it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He keeps [inaudible] up.</v>

1489
01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some Kappa Delta just passed out on her</v>

1490
01:05:01.051 --> 01:05:02.130
<v Speaker 1>fucking yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1491
01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:04.260
<v Speaker 1>had many peanut butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

1492
01:05:04.261 --> 01:05:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I do not think that a guy could fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>them out in line.</v>

1493
01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that's ever happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially not gay sex.</v>

1494
01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a female mountain lion might let</v>

1495
01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's all wild up and heat and why</v>

1496
01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:21.670
<v Speaker 1>eat my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it Chris Ryan talked about</v>

1497
01:05:21.671 --> 01:05:24.040
<v Speaker 1>fucking his cat with a pencil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he gave me a shirt?</v>

1498
01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1499
01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:26.450
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his shirt.</v>

1500
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:31.460
<v Speaker 1>He tells a great story about his cat was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in heat and she backed up to him.</v>

1501
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:36.050
<v Speaker 1>She was like trying to get some Dick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he put a pencil in their giddy,</v>

1502
01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.930
<v Speaker 1>like a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like a little kid.</v>

1503
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sherry was an adult sexual experience.</v>

1504
01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Was this cat backing up on this pencil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1505
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.910
<v Speaker 1>I could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

1506
01:05:45.911 --> 01:05:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I remember getting like an erection and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1507
01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.410
<v Speaker 1>I remember just hold it against fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

1508
01:05:50.411 --> 01:05:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I remember being at the library when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was young and this is back when they</v>

1509
01:05:53.831 --> 01:05:54.550
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1510
01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1511
01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.170
<v Speaker 1>what do they have now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1512
01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:59.380
<v Speaker 1>you don't fucking know her library still</v>
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>

1513
01:05:59.381 --> 01:06:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Who's hitting their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just people trying to finger each other.</v>

1514
01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Who was in a fucking liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You even imagined,</v>

1515
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I guess books about homeless people</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow homeless people in libraries.</v>

1516
01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we just start calling them shelters?</v>

1517
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.010
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And serve lunch.</v>

1518
01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>But I remember going in there and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only sex you could see at the time,</v>

1519
01:06:19.131 --> 01:06:20.800
<v Speaker 1>it was like Rodin or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1520
01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Or these old artists remember they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>paint like a reuben ask one by shooting</v>

1521
01:06:24.341 --> 01:06:24.790
<v Speaker 1>him and shoot.</v>

1522
01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:27.160
<v Speaker 1>But like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see breasts instead of one of her</v>

1523
01:06:27.161 --> 01:06:30.460
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this weird thing with the hands.</v>

1524
01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything was always this way.</v>

1525
01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I remember like opposed indicative</v>

1526
01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:43.510
<v Speaker 1>of a certain time and history I guess</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's really hard to draw a hand.</v>

1527
01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be it.</v>

1528
01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe somebody drew it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you think that like emperors</v>

1529
01:06:49.001 --> 01:06:53.540
<v Speaker 1>would stand there and do this to their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their people like you now look,</v>

1530
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:56.110
<v Speaker 1>there's two things to trump could do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1531
01:06:56.111 --> 01:07:00.010
<v Speaker 1>People would freak the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them obviously he's like a sieg</v>

1532
01:07:00.011 --> 01:07:00.521
<v Speaker 1>Heil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1533
01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:02.890
<v Speaker 1>that's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one that might be just as bad</v>

1534
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:06.990
<v Speaker 1>as the emperor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He comes out with one hand almost like</v>

1535
01:07:06.991 --> 01:07:09.670
<v Speaker 1>he's holding an invisible football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

1536
01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:15.090
<v Speaker 1>do this and just addressed to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will blow a gasket.</v>

1537
01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:19.040
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The emperor wants me to Buckingham for.</v>

1538
01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1539
01:07:20.801 --> 01:07:23.410
<v Speaker 1>he should start wearing a crown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How great would it be if he started</v>

1540
01:07:23.411 --> 01:07:24.850
<v Speaker 1>wearing a crown?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude?</v>

1541
01:07:24.851 --> 01:07:27.160
<v Speaker 1>It would be hilarious if you started</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing like a cheap burger.</v>

1542
01:07:27.161 --> 01:07:29.010
<v Speaker 1>King one just didn't say nothing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1543
01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:32.570
<v Speaker 1>I bet he will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he.</v>

1544
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:35.440
<v Speaker 1>I think he has a sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He definitely does.</v>

1545
01:07:35.441 --> 01:07:36.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He definitely.</v>

1546
01:07:36.221 --> 01:07:39.850
<v Speaker 1>He's the first president that has ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>been roasted on comedy central.</v>

1547
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great point,</v>

1548
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.900
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got roasted on comedy central and</v>

1549
01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Ross even said to him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ya'll laughing at the jokes,</v>

1550
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:48.820
<v Speaker 1>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd probably laugh at them like,</v>

1551
01:07:48.821 --> 01:07:49.654
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

1552
01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:53.740
<v Speaker 1>It's probably people like it better if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going along with it.</v>

1553
01:07:53.741 --> 01:07:54.180
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1554
01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.220
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he loosened up and started</v>

1555
01:07:56.221 --> 01:07:59.140
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he takes advice from people that are</v>

1556
01:07:59.141 --> 01:08:02.380
<v Speaker 1>in the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They told some ruthless jokes about him.</v>

1557
01:08:02.381 --> 01:08:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hung up.</v>

1558
01:08:04.321 --> 01:08:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Mary handled it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked in keys,</v>

1559
01:08:05.921 --> 01:08:08.050
<v Speaker 1>resilient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not he can feel any of that</v>

1560
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.430
<v Speaker 1>because of his like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1561
01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:10.570
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ego spaces.</v>

1562
01:08:10.571 --> 01:08:12.340
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder how much of that even</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels,</v>

1563
01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.100
<v Speaker 1>but only he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might be the only human in America</v>

1564
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:20.230
<v Speaker 1>could take this much hatred from people</v>
<v Speaker 1>at such a level that.</v>

1565
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't even care.</v>

1566
01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:24.350
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1567
01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:25.461
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1568
01:08:25.461 --> 01:08:27.200
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of awesome.</v>

1569
01:08:27.230 --> 01:08:27.771
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1570
01:08:27.771 --> 01:08:30.740
<v Speaker 1>I remember after he got elected driving</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the street and being like,</v>

1571
01:08:30.741 --> 01:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1572
01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:36.950
<v Speaker 1>I could be president puking anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what we thought when we were</v>

1573
01:08:36.951 --> 01:08:39.080
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what's awesome about his.</v>

1574
01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:40.940
<v Speaker 1>And when I say awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean good.</v>

1575
01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean amazing about his abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all throughout all this crazy shit.</v>

1576
01:08:45.411 --> 01:08:50.411
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't show any signs of being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem to be like freaked out</v>

1577
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:56.430
<v Speaker 1>right over the stormy Daniels Shit or</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the rush sugar,</v>

1578
01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:01.420
<v Speaker 1>all the investigations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally he goes mad tweetstorm.</v>

1579
01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems to be the same guy he was</v>

1580
01:09:04.761 --> 01:09:06.680
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't seem to be.</v>

1581
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:10.400
<v Speaker 1>There's certain dudes when you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

1582
01:09:10.401 --> 01:09:12.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a good example.</v>

1583
01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Something fucked up happens to them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it in their face.</v>

1584
01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:16.570
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1585
01:09:16.570 --> 01:09:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Like George Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever maybe on that video in the nine</v>

1586
01:09:18.771 --> 01:09:20.990
<v Speaker 1>slash one or whenever they see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures and they told him about nine.</v>

1587
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11 was huge thing.</v>

1588
01:09:22.581 --> 01:09:24.680
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he knew how huge it was at</v>

1589
01:09:24.681 --> 01:09:26.630
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all breaking out.</v>

1590
01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:28.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad example.</v>

1591
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1592
01:09:29.601 --> 01:09:34.090
<v Speaker 1>trump just seems totally unaffected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just same.</v>

1593
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:37.340
<v Speaker 1>No more senior citizens on twitter that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a thing senior citizens on</v>

1594
01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:39.350
<v Speaker 1>twitter is kind of bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>minutes of doing facebook all day,</v>

1599
01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think everybody's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people like the time</v>

1600
01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:55.940
<v Speaker 1>we're in right now because it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

1601
01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.860
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you know what you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get,</v>

1602
01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:58.790
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1603
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:59.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1604
01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:01.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange time for communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1605
01:10:01.971 --> 01:10:04.760
<v Speaker 1>It really is a strange time for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1606
01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:05.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1607
01:10:05.781 --> 01:10:07.580
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>

1608
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:10.970
<v Speaker 1>It's so different that it's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of fascinating.</v>

1609
01:10:10.971 --> 01:10:11.804
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1610
01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:13.870
<v Speaker 1>that got Jordan Peterson came on</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

1611
01:10:13.871 --> 01:10:17.060
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't met him on your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was wild because I know his</v>

1612
01:10:17.061 --> 01:10:18.610
<v Speaker 1>publicist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1613
01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:21.530
<v Speaker 1>and I reached out and the publicist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1614
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:24.190
<v Speaker 1>and then it was wild and so then he came</v>
<v Speaker 1>through because I mean,</v>

1615
01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:25.970
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the people listen to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

1616
01:10:25.971 --> 01:10:27.490
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1617
01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:31.280
<v Speaker 1>we talk a lot about like being sober and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people that masturbate too much,</v>

1618
01:10:31.281 --> 01:10:32.310
<v Speaker 1>kind of weird stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1619
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:34.160
<v Speaker 1>troubled youths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of I'll say it,</v>

1620
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:35.103
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1621
01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:38.210
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was cool because he like,</v>

1622
01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1623
01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.041
<v Speaker 1>better than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1624
01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:42.320
<v Speaker 1>he loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said a lot of Nice things about,</v>

1625
01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:43.041
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nice.</v>

1626
01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:45.290
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really misunderstood,</v>

1627
01:10:45.291 --> 01:10:47.480
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Misrepresented people think he's some</v>

1628
01:10:47.481 --> 01:10:50.300
<v Speaker 1>fascist and some Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think that at all.</v>

1629
01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:52.220
<v Speaker 1>He's not by any stretch of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

1630
01:10:52.221 --> 01:10:55.760
<v Speaker 1>He just says certain things that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are uncomfortable hearing and whether</v>

1631
01:10:55.761 --> 01:10:57.290
<v Speaker 1>you agree with them or disagree with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1632
01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:00.380
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what the demonization is</v>

1633
01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:02.900
<v Speaker 1>where it gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you would think he's what his</v>

1634
01:11:02.901 --> 01:11:06.590
<v Speaker 1>idea is foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't misrepresent who he is as a person</v>

1635
01:11:06.591 --> 01:11:10.310
<v Speaker 1>because they try to pretend that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>this racist,</v>

1636
01:11:10.311 --> 01:11:13.860
<v Speaker 1>homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking character.</v>

1637
01:11:13.861 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 1>He's</v>

1638
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:19.070
<v Speaker 5>not by any stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just a guy that especially when his</v>

1639
01:11:19.081 --> 01:11:23.690
<v Speaker 5>principles are being debated or when his</v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas are being tested like he,</v>

1640
01:11:23.691 --> 01:11:27.720
<v Speaker 5>he'll stand his ground and he's very</v>
<v Speaker 5>firm about what he thinks is wrong about</v>

1641
01:11:27.721 --> 01:11:32.190
<v Speaker 5>things like equality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like making sure that everybody makes</v>

1642
01:11:32.191 --> 01:11:34.410
<v Speaker 5>the same amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make sure that everybody achieves the</v>

1643
01:11:34.411 --> 01:11:38.130
<v Speaker 5>same amount of success like that is a</v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous idea that leads to communism</v>

1644
01:11:38.131 --> 01:11:42.270
<v Speaker 5>and Marxism and he gets into it and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>made me rethink how I thought about it</v>

1645
01:11:42.271 --> 01:11:43.740
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I thought about it before then,</v>

1646
01:11:43.741 --> 01:11:47.850
<v Speaker 5>like an unattainable goal that socialist</v>
<v Speaker 5>lean towards because it's like the</v>

1647
01:11:47.851 --> 01:11:50.190
<v Speaker 5>ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ideal is that money's not a concern</v>

1648
01:11:50.191 --> 01:11:53.310
<v Speaker 5>for anybody and everybody just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>does whatever they want to do because</v>

1649
01:11:53.311 --> 01:11:55.500
<v Speaker 5>they enjoy doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not because they're doing it for money</v>

1650
01:11:55.501 --> 01:11:58.200
<v Speaker 5>and then all the money kind of piled in</v>
<v Speaker 5>together and we take care of everybody.</v>

1651
01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.490
<v Speaker 5>It sounds great on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1652
01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:01.380
<v Speaker 5>But then he starts talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1653
01:12:01.381 --> 01:12:04.530
<v Speaker 5>you have to enforce an equality of</v>
<v Speaker 5>outcome,</v>

1654
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.160
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1655
01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.170
<v Speaker 5>when you're talking about a quick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be people that work</v>

1656
01:12:07.171 --> 01:12:09.480
<v Speaker 5>harder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be able to try harder.</v>

1657
01:12:09.481 --> 01:12:12.510
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be different varying</v>
<v Speaker 5>levels of effort because we're human</v>

1658
01:12:12.511 --> 01:12:14.650
<v Speaker 5>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to take that into consideration</v>

1659
01:12:14.651 --> 01:12:17.490
<v Speaker 5>and as soon as these people don't take</v>
<v Speaker 5>that into consideration,</v>

1660
01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:18.900
<v Speaker 5>it's then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1661
01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:23.550
<v Speaker 5>you're either trying to stop the people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are doing too well or you're trying</v>

1662
01:12:23.551 --> 01:12:26.970
<v Speaker 5>to take from them to give to yourself</v>
<v Speaker 5>and how you enforcing this.</v>

1663
01:12:26.971 --> 01:12:28.740
<v Speaker 5>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just takes you down this rabbit hole</v>

1664
01:12:28.741 --> 01:12:33.180
<v Speaker 5>of thought and really kind of explains</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problems with Marxism and socialism.</v>

1665
01:12:33.181 --> 01:12:36.510
<v Speaker 5>And I'm sure there's really intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that dispute his ideas.</v>

1666
01:12:36.511 --> 01:12:40.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that his ideas are</v>
<v Speaker 5>infallible or that he's the only voice</v>

1667
01:12:40.141 --> 01:12:41.490
<v Speaker 5>that I would listen to in these</v>
<v Speaker 5>subjects.</v>

1668
01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:44.280
<v Speaker 5>But he's a brilliant guy and he's a very</v>
<v Speaker 5>nice guy too.</v>

1669
01:12:44.281 --> 01:12:47.790
<v Speaker 5>And he's really missing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>misrepresented and in willfully.</v>

1670
01:12:47.791 --> 01:12:51.780
<v Speaker 5>So a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's sad because I think what's</v>

1671
01:12:51.781 --> 01:12:56.610
<v Speaker 5>missing between right and the left is</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much vit we we would probably agree</v>

1672
01:12:56.611 --> 01:13:00.030
<v Speaker 5>on and if we could just talk about</v>
<v Speaker 5>things rationally instead of</v>

1673
01:13:00.031 --> 01:13:03.270
<v Speaker 5>contentiously instead of getting into</v>
<v Speaker 5>these right versus left debates which</v>

1674
01:13:03.271 --> 01:13:07.470
<v Speaker 5>are just way too common where</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's on one side is trying to</v>

1675
01:13:07.471 --> 01:13:09.070
<v Speaker 5>diminish the person in their side and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1676
01:13:09.071 --> 01:13:12.240
<v Speaker 5>and get angry and they're doing a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>these in front of big crowds,</v>

1677
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:16.050
<v Speaker 5>which I think is also weird because then</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're playing to the crowd and I've</v>

1678
01:13:16.051 --> 01:13:18.990
<v Speaker 5>seen some things that Jordan did with</v>
<v Speaker 5>this Michael Eric Dyson guy with the guy</v>

1679
01:13:18.991 --> 01:13:21.870
<v Speaker 5>was literally wasn't looking at him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's looking at the crowd,</v>

1680
01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:27.050
<v Speaker 5>calling him a mean mad white man and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like I see these kinds of things</v>

1681
01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:28.130
<v Speaker 5>that people are doing.</v>

1682
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:32.130
<v Speaker 5>It's just everyone's just digging their</v>
<v Speaker 5>heels in deeper on each side and instead</v>

1683
01:13:32.131 --> 01:13:36.720
<v Speaker 5>of looking at life like just having an</v>
<v Speaker 5>open conversation about things that are</v>

1684
01:13:36.721 --> 01:13:39.510
<v Speaker 5>troubling things where we could do</v>
<v Speaker 5>better things,</v>

1685
01:13:39.511 --> 01:13:43.920
<v Speaker 5>where society needs work or things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe where our perceptions are off and</v>

1686
01:13:43.921 --> 01:13:46.470
<v Speaker 5>maybe we could look at the other side</v>
<v Speaker 5>and look at each other or look at the</v>

1687
01:13:46.471 --> 01:13:49.590
<v Speaker 5>whole thing better and figure out a</v>
<v Speaker 5>better way around things instead of</v>

1688
01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:51.780
<v Speaker 5>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's just right versus left and</v>

1689
01:13:51.781 --> 01:13:55.680
<v Speaker 5>right and deeper in the trenches and</v>
<v Speaker 5>harder and we've got to stop trump and I</v>

1690
01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:59.490
<v Speaker 5>hope we have a recession to stop trump</v>
<v Speaker 5>and people saying crazy shit crazy like</v>

1691
01:13:59.491 --> 01:14:02.850
<v Speaker 5>everybody's supposed to suffer so that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can make one guy feel like he's</v>

1692
01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.090
<v Speaker 5>doing a bad job or just not the way to</v>
<v Speaker 5>approach it.</v>

1693
01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.400
<v Speaker 5>Like you've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is that woman's name?</v>

1694
01:14:08.401 --> 01:14:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Maxine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is her name?</v>

1695
01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 5>Maximum trump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

1696
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.700
<v Speaker 2>call her dark trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She says she's,</v>

1697
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:19.110
<v Speaker 2>she's wild to interrupt people's meals</v>
<v Speaker 2>and draw a crowd and like,</v>

1698
01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:25.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I guess it's in response to what is</v>

1699
01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:30.370
<v Speaker 2>the most disturbing policy was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>separate children from their parents.</v>

1700
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:33.370
<v Speaker 2>People that are crossing the border,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he didn't.</v>

1701
01:14:33.371 --> 01:14:36.490
<v Speaker 2>He decided to put a stop to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they decided to put a stop to that.</v>

1702
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:38.320
<v Speaker 2>Did he sign something to put a stop to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1703
01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely scary if you're doing</v>

1704
01:14:39.851 --> 01:14:41.590
<v Speaker 2>that at the border.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did,</v>

1705
01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:44.680
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read that it didn't do any change</v>

1706
01:14:44.681 --> 01:14:45.514
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1707
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Let's find out what the fuck that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll find out what would happen.</v>

1708
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:52.560
<v Speaker 2>I know it's hard to do that and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1709
01:14:52.561 --> 01:14:53.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you separate people from their</v>

1710
01:14:53.831 --> 01:14:57.010
<v Speaker 2>kids?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be you gotta be trying to send</v>

1711
01:14:57.011 --> 01:15:00.310
<v Speaker 2>some fucked up message to scare the shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of him so that'll keep them from</v>

1712
01:15:00.311 --> 01:15:00.880
<v Speaker 2>coming over.</v>

1713
01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:03.260
<v Speaker 2>This is the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess if you tell them you're going to</v>

1714
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:05.680
<v Speaker 2>take their kids away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably won't even try and then.</v>

1715
01:15:05.681 --> 01:15:07.120
<v Speaker 2>But what about this say if like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1716
01:15:07.121 --> 01:15:11.020
<v Speaker 2>everybody's against like sex trafficking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not like what if one of those</v>

1717
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:14.410
<v Speaker 2>people is that scenario and the kids too</v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid to say it.</v>

1718
01:15:14.411 --> 01:15:16.840
<v Speaker 2>I know that's like a maybe more of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>acute situation,</v>

1719
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:20.740
<v Speaker 2>but in that case you'd be grateful that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you separated them at least to get each</v>

1720
01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:23.620
<v Speaker 2>other's point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know kind of what's a little bit more</v>

1721
01:15:23.621 --> 01:15:25.870
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently that's like a huge issue.</v>

1722
01:15:25.871 --> 01:15:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Like apparently sex trafficking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1723
01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:30.640
<v Speaker 2>everybody's just bringing young women in</v>
<v Speaker 2>here to,</v>

1724
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:32.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from other places for sex and I don't,</v>

1725
01:15:32.881 --> 01:15:35.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't see that much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but apparently it's the biggest thing in</v>

1726
01:15:35.501 --> 01:15:36.370
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1727
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:37.540
<v Speaker 2>or it was last month.</v>

1728
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was something that was,</v>

1729
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is true either.</v>

1730
01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:44.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving Jamie a lot of work today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1731
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:46.120
<v Speaker 2>there was a smart though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1732
01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex trafficking ring that was broken up</v>

1733
01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:55.740
<v Speaker 2>by ice and outside of it these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>were protesting ice because of what I,</v>

1734
01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:02.260
<v Speaker 2>they were like saying abolish ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile ice was like stepping.</v>

1735
01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:04.900
<v Speaker 2>They didn't understand that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

1736
01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:08.170
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Emma's immigrations customs enforcement.</v>

1737
01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Ice stands for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're doing is not just,</v>

1738
01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:17.350
<v Speaker 2>they're not just trying to stop people</v>
<v Speaker 2>from crossing over the border there also</v>

1739
01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:22.440
<v Speaker 2>busting in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently it was a sex trafficking or</v>

1740
01:16:22.691 --> 01:16:25.270
<v Speaker 2>human trafficking ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they were using them as</v>

1741
01:16:25.271 --> 01:16:27.580
<v Speaker 2>slaves or if they're using them as sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>slaves.</v>

1742
01:16:27.610 --> 01:16:28.241
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

1743
01:16:28.241 --> 01:16:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Say if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say if two truckloads of people coming</v>

1744
01:16:30.741 --> 01:16:31.481
<v Speaker 2>to America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1745
01:16:31.481 --> 01:16:32.410
<v Speaker 2>And one is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1746
01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:33.281
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1747
01:16:33.281 --> 01:16:35.770
<v Speaker 2>adults and children and another as</v>
<v Speaker 2>adults and children,</v>

1748
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:36.370
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1749
01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:40.840
<v Speaker 2>And one of them are just actual family</v>
<v Speaker 2>members and one of them are sex,</v>

1750
01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:42.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adults,</v>

1751
01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:46.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean men trying to bring in sex workers.</v>

1752
01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:47.450
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1753
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:48.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1754
01:16:48.610 --> 01:16:50.170
<v Speaker 2>how do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you not set,</v>

1755
01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:50.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1756
01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:51.161
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1757
01:16:51.161 --> 01:16:53.890
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to take a mother from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid or a father from a daughter,</v>

1758
01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:56.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know what if and what if you</v>

1759
01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:57.940
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1760
01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:01.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the problem with people coming</v>

1761
01:17:01.001 --> 01:17:02.310
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're coming in illegally,</v>

1762
01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.940
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing.</v>

1763
01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1764
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:07.660
<v Speaker 2>that's only one problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other problem is people who are</v>

1765
01:17:07.661 --> 01:17:10.280
<v Speaker 2>criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are violent</v>

1766
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.500
<v Speaker 5>offenders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1767
01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:13.760
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's people that have gone back and</v>

1768
01:17:13.761 --> 01:17:16.830
<v Speaker 5>forth multiple times and got busted in</v>
<v Speaker 5>American wind up killing people.</v>

1769
01:17:16.831 --> 01:17:17.960
<v Speaker 5>That's happened many times.</v>

1770
01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:20.280
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had that guy in San Francisco.</v>

1771
01:17:20.281 --> 01:17:22.120
<v Speaker 6>I remember that accidentally shot the</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1772
01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.970
<v Speaker 6>end up shooting the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>

1773
01:17:23.971 --> 01:17:24.960
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1774
01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:26.040
<v Speaker 6>I'm glad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1775
01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:27.840
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as much as it's hectic sometimes to</v>

1776
01:17:27.841 --> 01:17:30.720
<v Speaker 6>think about it and here about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's also,</v>

1777
01:17:30.810 --> 01:17:33.610
<v Speaker 6>it's neat to be alive at a time when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1778
01:17:33.630 --> 01:17:35.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm challenged to think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1779
01:17:35.071 --> 01:17:36.270
<v Speaker 6>and I'm challenged to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1780
01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:38.820
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to feel different ways and to hear</v>

1781
01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:40.980
<v Speaker 6>different voices and opinions about it</v>
<v Speaker 6>honestly.</v>

1782
01:17:40.981 --> 01:17:43.380
<v Speaker 6>Like I feel like we should have more of</v>
<v Speaker 6>a roll call in America.</v>

1783
01:17:43.381 --> 01:17:45.360
<v Speaker 6>Like you have to know who's here before</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can even,</v>

1784
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:47.280
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if you're teaching a classroom,</v>

1785
01:17:47.281 --> 01:17:48.990
<v Speaker 6>if you don't know who's in the class,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how can you even,</v>

1786
01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:50.373
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's</v>

1787
01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:54.600
<v Speaker 5>what they should do first and foremost</v>
<v Speaker 5>is legalized drugs.</v>

1788
01:17:55.230 --> 01:18:00.230
<v Speaker 5>And the reason being is that they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting across from organized crime and</v>

1789
01:18:01.261 --> 01:18:05.130
<v Speaker 5>it's building organized crime in Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 5>to a staggering degree.</v>

1790
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:08.160
<v Speaker 5>The drugs are here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are selling these drugs,</v>

1791
01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:10.050
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to keep selling these</v>

1792
01:18:10.051 --> 01:18:11.970
<v Speaker 5>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to diminish the amount</v>

1793
01:18:11.971 --> 01:18:14.130
<v Speaker 5>of drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just not.</v>

1794
01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:15.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one's ever been able to do it.</v>

1795
01:18:15.721 --> 01:18:17.460
<v Speaker 5>The drug wars and complete total</v>
<v Speaker 5>failure.</v>

1796
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:19.500
<v Speaker 5>He Cope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They love coke.</v>

1797
01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:24.530
<v Speaker 5>So make coke legal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would put a fucking halt to so much</v>

1798
01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:28.320
<v Speaker 5>and if you made coke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>legal people would buy pure coke.</v>

1799
01:18:28.410 --> 01:18:32.040
<v Speaker 5>You would it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would it be tested and you could give</v>

1800
01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:34.800
<v Speaker 5>people drug education because like</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody knows.</v>

1801
01:18:34.801 --> 01:18:37.170
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many beers can you drink?</v>

1802
01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:39.780
<v Speaker 5>If you drink three beers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you probably shouldn't drive a car</v>

1803
01:18:40.050 --> 01:18:41.880
<v Speaker 5>unless you're a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1804
01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.310
<v Speaker 5>like three beers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're probably over the legal limit.</v>

1805
01:18:44.311 --> 01:18:45.410
<v Speaker 5>Azure of Bayer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1806
01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:48.570
<v Speaker 5>Let's just some seven foot tall</v>
<v Speaker 5>guerrilla type man.</v>

1807
01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:53.100
<v Speaker 5>We've got a lot of buy in a regular.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you are a regular guy</v>

1808
01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:55.200
<v Speaker 5>disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should not drive.</v>

1809
01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:58.950
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now stop and think like what is the</v>

1810
01:18:58.951 --> 01:19:00.930
<v Speaker 5>level for cocaine?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1811
01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:02.310
<v Speaker 5>I don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never done it,</v>

1812
01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:05.220
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe we should know like you know,</v>

1813
01:19:05.221 --> 01:19:08.190
<v Speaker 5>you can't have three shots of Jack</v>
<v Speaker 5>Daniels and Dr. Okay.</v>

1814
01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.720
<v Speaker 5>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what about,</v>

1815
01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.040
<v Speaker 5>what about speed?</v>

1816
01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:15.330
<v Speaker 6>I can take two lines of coke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You should not be talking to people.</v>

1817
01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:20.310
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Business shouldn't be fucking calling an</v>

1818
01:19:20.311 --> 01:19:21.580
<v Speaker 6>architect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>

1819
01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.570
<v Speaker 6>One of my buddies try to put all of his</v>
<v Speaker 6>fingers in his butt one time for you to</v>

1820
01:19:24.571 --> 01:19:26.430
<v Speaker 6>like an eight ball of coke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How crazy is that?</v>

1821
01:19:26.431 --> 01:19:27.540
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so good goal,</v>

1822
01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:32.600
<v Speaker 6>but a look and it's hard apparently to</v>
<v Speaker 6>do and it's nice to have a name for.</v>

1823
01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:35.160
<v Speaker 6>What was that called?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fingers in your book called something.</v>

1824
01:19:35.161 --> 01:19:37.890
<v Speaker 6>It was like called a clapper.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The liberty bell or something.</v>

1825
01:19:37.891 --> 01:19:41.420
<v Speaker 6>Some crazy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm Jamie's googling it.</v>

1826
01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:46.470
<v Speaker 6>What is the term when you have all your</v>
<v Speaker 6>fingers in your butt?</v>

1827
01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:49.270
<v Speaker 6>I think that's called gopher hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to be like,</v>

1828
01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:51.690
<v Speaker 6>how would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to be like lying on your back</v>

1829
01:19:51.691 --> 01:19:53.880
<v Speaker 6>with your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bugs bunny style over your head.</v>

1830
01:19:53.881 --> 01:19:58.530
<v Speaker 6>You have to hook your left and then this</v>
<v Speaker 6>and to be super flexible.</v>

1831
01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:00.900
<v Speaker 6>Pull it off and you're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The crazy part is,</v>

1832
01:20:00.901 --> 01:20:03.420
<v Speaker 6>and I've just thought about this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I have thought about this for a</v>

1833
01:20:03.421 --> 01:20:05.700
<v Speaker 6>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to start with your smallest</v>

1834
01:20:05.701 --> 01:20:07.050
<v Speaker 6>fingers and then you're going to be</v>

<v Speaker 1>had them on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1899
01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:30.840
<v Speaker 1>I listened to your episode with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>extra from the day before and I listened</v>

1900
01:22:30.841 --> 01:22:33.990
<v Speaker 1>to 'em and I'd been listening to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

1901
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:38.070
<v Speaker 1>So that's where I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I listened to the debate of the munk</v>

1902
01:22:38.071 --> 01:22:40.710
<v Speaker 1>debates of the ones where the guy called</v>
<v Speaker 1>him a bad white man.</v>

1903
01:22:40.711 --> 01:22:42.060
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this so silly,</v>

1904
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:46.740
<v Speaker 1>but I found him to be in this just a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just seemed like the pure.</v>

1905
01:22:46.890 --> 01:22:49.740
<v Speaker 1>He seemed completely pure and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1906
01:22:49.741 --> 01:22:51.750
<v Speaker 1>he believed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that in helping people,</v>

1907
01:22:51.751 --> 01:22:53.280
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I talked to him about like did</v>

1908
01:22:53.281 --> 01:22:54.930
<v Speaker 1>he start to feel like famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1909
01:22:54.931 --> 01:22:59.931
<v Speaker 1>like because people are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravitating towards and he just felt it</v>

1910
01:23:01.051 --> 01:23:04.590
<v Speaker 1>genuinely seemed that he felt just good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people.</v>

1911
01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 1>He Won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was happy</v>

1912
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:10.660
<v Speaker 2>to be helping others and that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't seem like he had any ego in</v>

1913
01:23:10.661 --> 01:23:11.830
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1914
01:23:11.831 --> 01:23:15.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he definitely does like to help people,</v>

1915
01:23:15.011 --> 01:23:18.670
<v Speaker 2>but he also feels a responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of his knowledge to explain what</v>

1916
01:23:18.671 --> 01:23:21.440
<v Speaker 2>he thinks is a problem with certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>types of behavior,</v>

1917
01:23:21.441 --> 01:23:25.390
<v Speaker 2>certain laws and one of them that got</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in trouble or got him</v>

1918
01:23:25.391 --> 01:23:29.440
<v Speaker 2>controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a lot of controversy attached to it</v>

1919
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:32.500
<v Speaker 2>was the compelled speech laws for</v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender people.</v>

1920
01:23:32.501 --> 01:23:36.340
<v Speaker 2>The use of a compelled pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning Canada.</v>

1921
01:23:36.370 --> 01:23:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you decided that you weren't going</v>

1922
01:23:38.621 --> 01:23:41.950
<v Speaker 2>to be a he or a she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could make up a number of different</v>

1923
01:23:41.951 --> 01:23:44.980
<v Speaker 2>names and they would be legally</v>
<v Speaker 2>compelled to use those names.</v>

1924
01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.440
<v Speaker 2>And some people are arguing that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it says.</v>

1925
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:48.490
<v Speaker 2>And then he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1926
01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:51.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a human rights violation if you</v>

1927
01:23:51.101 --> 01:23:53.680
<v Speaker 2>don't follow along with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is,</v>

1928
01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:56.740
<v Speaker 2>this is compelled speech and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous because this is why this is</v>

1929
01:23:56.741 --> 01:23:57.574
<v Speaker 2>what it leads to.</v>

1930
01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.950
<v Speaker 2>And then there's all these people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>debating with them.</v>

1931
01:23:59.951 --> 01:24:01.540
<v Speaker 2>But then when you got a chance to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1932
01:24:01.541 --> 01:24:04.780
<v Speaker 2>with him debating these points with</v>
<v Speaker 2>these various intellectuals,</v>

1933
01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.030
<v Speaker 2>including like gender studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teachers and Shit,</v>

1934
01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:09.280
<v Speaker 2>you got to see like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh this,</v>

1935
01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:13.390
<v Speaker 2>this is a crazy idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like these,</v>

1936
01:24:13.391 --> 01:24:17.260
<v Speaker 2>these people that think that you should</v>
<v Speaker 2>have like 78 different gender pronouns.</v>

1937
01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:20.920
<v Speaker 2>And then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tantamount to violence to not use</v>

1938
01:24:20.921 --> 01:24:22.450
<v Speaker 2>someone's preferred pronoun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

1939
01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.440
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1940
01:24:23.441 --> 01:24:26.410
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh this is a mad person who wants the</v>

1941
01:24:26.411 --> 01:24:29.830
<v Speaker 2>world to be different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you want all these new laws attached</v>

1942
01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:34.150
<v Speaker 2>to whether or not someone calls them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he or she and they're getting some</v>

1943
01:24:34.151 --> 01:24:37.810
<v Speaker 2>traction with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is weird in New York,</v>

1944
01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:41.230
<v Speaker 2>New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the landlords and it might</v>

1945
01:24:41.231 --> 01:24:43.450
<v Speaker 2>be employers my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think I'm pretty sure it's</v>

1946
01:24:43.451 --> 01:24:46.900
<v Speaker 2>landlords.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are compelled to use your preferred</v>

1947
01:24:46.901 --> 01:24:51.220
<v Speaker 2>pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if your landlord decides to call you</v>

1948
01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.680
<v Speaker 2>a different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you say a machine now,</v>

1949
01:24:53.681 --> 01:24:55.870
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you knew you when you were theo,</v>

1950
01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Theo.</v>

1951
01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:58.430
<v Speaker 2>See what that law is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1952
01:24:58.810 --> 01:25:01.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compelled gender pronouns,</v>

1953
01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:03.160
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York City.</v>

1954
01:25:03.690 --> 01:25:04.750
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people are like,</v>

1955
01:25:04.751 --> 01:25:05.561
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

1956
01:25:05.561 --> 01:25:09.100
<v Speaker 2>how many do I have to know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which ones do I have to agree with you</v>

1957
01:25:09.101 --> 01:25:10.630
<v Speaker 2>start?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a ton of them.</v>

1958
01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.780
<v Speaker 2>Now they're literate is 78 different</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender pronouns.</v>

1959
01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:15.730
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm fine like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they would,</v>

1960
01:25:15.731 --> 01:25:16.241
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1961
01:25:16.241 --> 01:25:18.850
<v Speaker 2>for awhile it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in certain areas they don't want</v>

1962
01:25:18.851 --> 01:25:22.030
<v Speaker 2>to build transgender bathrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like because there's nine people in</v>

1963
01:25:22.031 --> 01:25:24.940
<v Speaker 2>this town and we've seen everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick,</v>

1964
01:25:24.941 --> 01:25:25.571
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody.</v>

1965
01:25:25.571 --> 01:25:28.630
<v Speaker 2>We don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't change all these zoning laws</v>

1966
01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:31.810
<v Speaker 2>for peak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for when there's not even someone</v>

1967
01:25:31.811 --> 01:25:36.670
<v Speaker 2>present in some of these areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in some bad ways they're making</v>

1968
01:25:36.671 --> 01:25:41.671
<v Speaker 2>people not be accepting of transgender</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that they may meet at some point</v>

1969
01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:45.410
<v Speaker 2>by creating all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1970
01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:47.890
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this rhetoric or whatever it is,</v>

1971
01:25:47.891 --> 01:25:49.060
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this conversation.</v>

1972
01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:53.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like some people are already fed up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they've never even met someone like</v>

1973
01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:55.540
<v Speaker 2>this and so then they're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

1974
01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:59.110
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have already like</v>
<v Speaker 2>contentious views when they do meet</v>

1975
01:25:59.111 --> 01:26:01.540
<v Speaker 2>someone just because they've heard so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much background noise that it's</v>

1976
01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:03.440
<v Speaker 2>problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when not.</v>

1977
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:04.340
<v Speaker 2>That's certainly</v>

1978
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:07.130
<v Speaker 5>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also possible that people will be</v>

1979
01:26:07.131 --> 01:26:12.131
<v Speaker 5>scared of the backlash so they won't use</v>
<v Speaker 5>transphobic language anymore.</v>

1980
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:17.330
<v Speaker 5>The problem with that is you're not</v>
<v Speaker 5>encouraging empathy.</v>

1981
01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:22.340
<v Speaker 5>You're encouraging fear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're encouraging fear of not following</v>

1982
01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:27.400
<v Speaker 5>the standard line of behavior and speech</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's where people have a problem</v>

1983
01:26:27.411 --> 01:26:29.360
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the real way to do it is to</v>

1984
01:26:29.361 --> 01:26:31.160
<v Speaker 5>promote empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to say like,</v>

1985
01:26:31.161 --> 01:26:32.570
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people like this,</v>

1986
01:26:32.571 --> 01:26:36.320
<v Speaker 5>guys born in the wrong body became a</v>
<v Speaker 5>woman who went through the surgery,</v>

1987
01:26:36.321 --> 01:26:38.480
<v Speaker 5>let him use the women's room like why</v>
<v Speaker 5>not?</v>

1988
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:41.720
<v Speaker 5>And if they're a bad person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>judged that bad person on each</v>

1989
01:26:41.721 --> 01:26:43.940
<v Speaker 5>individual basis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now when you're talking about children,</v>

1990
01:26:43.941 --> 01:26:46.700
<v Speaker 5>that's what people are scared of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you know you're going to have some</v>

1991
01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:50.270
<v Speaker 5>creep who pretends he's a woman so he</v>
<v Speaker 5>can get in the girls room and he's gonna</v>

1992
01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:52.670
<v Speaker 5>molest children.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like those are those worst case</v>

1993
01:26:52.671 --> 01:26:53.210
<v Speaker 5>scenarios.</v>

1994
01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:56.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are terrible worst case scenarios,</v>

1995
01:26:56.061 --> 01:26:59.180
<v Speaker 5>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How often is that going to happen?</v>

1996
01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.720
<v Speaker 5>How do we protect that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do we prevent that from happening?</v>

1997
01:27:03.210 --> 01:27:06.830
<v Speaker 5>Those are the questions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what for the vast majority of the</v>

1998
01:27:06.831 --> 01:27:10.010
<v Speaker 5>people that become trans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you really think that they're going</v>

1999
01:27:10.011 --> 01:27:11.330
<v Speaker 5>to molest people?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they are.</v>

2000
01:27:11.331 --> 01:27:14.360
<v Speaker 5>You can't judge the vast majority based</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a few.</v>

2001
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:19.250
<v Speaker 5>That's just like the same logic that</v>
<v Speaker 5>says people shoot up people with guns,</v>

2002
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:22.250
<v Speaker 5>so we should take everyone's guns away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy to know.</v>

2003
01:27:22.251 --> 01:27:24.680
<v Speaker 5>The vast majority of people with guns</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't shoot people.</v>

2004
01:27:24.681 --> 01:27:27.620
<v Speaker 5>The vast majority of people were trans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to hurt anybody.</v>

2005
01:27:27.621 --> 01:27:30.920
<v Speaker 5>Then that's all they're trying to do is</v>
<v Speaker 5>just get along and be who they are.</v>

2006
01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:34.030
<v Speaker 5>This is a complex subject.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the end,</v>

2007
01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:39.060
<v Speaker 5>the danger is when people are scared,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're scared or bullied into agreeing</v>

2008
01:27:40.881 --> 01:27:44.300
<v Speaker 5>with one side of the other side because</v>
<v Speaker 5>then then shit gets weird because then</v>

2009
01:27:44.301 --> 01:27:48.950
<v Speaker 5>it becomes a battle but becomes a battle</v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of an opportunity.</v>

2010
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:50.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Discussion and opportunity to.</v>

2011
01:27:50.770 --> 01:27:54.530
<v Speaker 5>To enforce and encourage compassion like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2012
01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.370
<v Speaker 5>It can be done both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2013
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:58.590
<v Speaker 5>I think the opera,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but to look at these people like,</v>

2014
01:27:58.610 --> 01:27:59.900
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just hook.</v>

2015
01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.610
<v Speaker 5>Why do you care if someone wants to be a</v>
<v Speaker 5>girl?</v>

2016
01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.260
<v Speaker 5>Why do you care if she wants to be a</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy?</v>

2017
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:05.210
<v Speaker 5>Why do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like let them do it.</v>

2018
01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:08.060
<v Speaker 5>Let them be free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let them be there themselves.</v>

2019
01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:12.560
<v Speaker 5>Just like let it do tattoo his face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let let what do whatever you want,</v>

2020
01:28:12.561 --> 01:28:14.930
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as you're not fucking people</v>

2021
01:28:14.931 --> 01:28:18.080
<v Speaker 5>over and you're not hurting people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know out there robbing people and</v>

2022
01:28:18.081 --> 01:28:20.030
<v Speaker 5>stealing from people and murdering</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

2023
01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.880
<v Speaker 5>As long as that's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do whatever you want.</v>

2024
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:26.780
<v Speaker 5>What should be our approach?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This stuff that should be one of our.</v>

2025
01:28:26.781 --> 01:28:28.790
<v Speaker 5>That should be someone in the bill of</v>
<v Speaker 5>rights or something or a new what?</v>

2026
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:31.850
<v Speaker 5>New.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A new amendment should be something in</v>

2027
01:28:31.851 --> 01:28:34.970
<v Speaker 5>there where we think about the why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why,</v>

2028
01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:37.670
<v Speaker 5>why we have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and how we address the problem.</v>

2029
01:28:37.770 --> 01:28:39.440
<v Speaker 5>As soon as you address the problem of</v>
<v Speaker 5>force,</v>

2030
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:43.280
<v Speaker 5>force forward is forced in return,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get forced back.</v>

2031
01:28:43.281 --> 01:28:45.560
<v Speaker 5>People are going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to want to get ramped up</v>

2032
01:28:45.561 --> 01:28:49.070
<v Speaker 5>just as much to attack you is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You attack them and then you going back</v>

2033
01:28:49.071 --> 01:28:51.170
<v Speaker 5>and forth left and right and it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking chaos.</v>

2034
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:54.200
<v Speaker 5>And that's what we have right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you see the difference between Fox</v>

2035
01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:58.340
<v Speaker 5>News and CNN and the right and the left</v>
<v Speaker 5>and everybody digs their heels in bad.</v>

2036
01:28:58.490 --> 01:28:59.323
<v Speaker 5>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2037
01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:01.220
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not helpful.</v>

2038
01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:02.970
<v Speaker 5>It's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's also a bunch of people that</v>

2039
01:29:02.971 --> 01:29:05.130
<v Speaker 5>profit off of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this battle and dispute.</v>

2040
01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:08.100
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No New York City did not just introduce</v>

2041
01:29:08.101 --> 01:29:09.110
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>$250,000,</v>

2042
01:29:09.111 --> 01:29:11.070
<v Speaker 5>fine for any incorrect use of gender</v>
<v Speaker 5>pronouns,</v>

2043
01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:13.380
<v Speaker 5>but they did for some use of gender</v>
<v Speaker 5>pronouns.</v>

2044
01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:14.790
<v Speaker 5>I think the question</v>

2045
01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:18.780
<v Speaker 8>misinterpretation of a guideline that's</v>
<v Speaker 8>already existed,</v>

2046
01:29:19.130 --> 01:29:21.930
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there was a blog post that got written</v>

2047
01:29:21.931 --> 01:29:25.800
<v Speaker 8>in the New York Post reported on it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There was an updated or a change in the</v>

2048
01:29:25.801 --> 01:29:28.140
<v Speaker 8>guidelines,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's not supposed to be for like an</v>

2049
01:29:28.141 --> 01:29:31.650
<v Speaker 8>incorrect or ms dot misuse of it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What is it supposed to be for harassment</v>

2050
01:29:31.651 --> 01:29:33.270
<v Speaker 8>and discrimination and things like that.</v>

2051
01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:36.420
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So regardless of individual sex assigned</v>

2052
01:29:36.421 --> 01:29:37.650
<v Speaker 5>at birth anatomy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gender,</v>

2053
01:29:37.651 --> 01:29:41.310
<v Speaker 5>medical history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>appearance or the sex indicated on the</v>

2054
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:44.610
<v Speaker 5>individual's identification.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2055
01:29:45.150 --> 01:29:50.150
<v Speaker 5>The raw requires employers and covered</v>
<v Speaker 5>entities to use an individual's</v>

2056
01:29:50.971 --> 01:29:53.730
<v Speaker 5>preferred name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pronoun and title,</v>

2057
01:29:53.731 --> 01:29:56.580
<v Speaker 5>Eg,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mrs. Or Mrs. Regardless of the</v>

2058
01:29:56.581 --> 01:29:59.420
<v Speaker 5>individual sex assigned at birth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's it.</v>

2059
01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.950
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These guidelines as noted by the</v>

2060
01:30:01.951 --> 01:30:06.480
<v Speaker 5>commission can impose penalties of up to</v>
<v Speaker 5>$250,000 for violations that are the</v>

2061
01:30:06.481 --> 01:30:10.020
<v Speaker 5>result of willful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wanton or malicious conduct.</v>

2062
01:30:10.770 --> 01:30:13.260
<v Speaker 5>So that seems like they're saying that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is true.</v>

2063
01:30:15.090 --> 01:30:16.200
<v Speaker 8>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That is.</v>

2064
01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.540
<v Speaker 8>So there is a law,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but there's a commission.</v>

2065
01:30:18.541 --> 01:30:21.000
<v Speaker 8>It's not just like you can't just say it</v>
<v Speaker 8>and someone's going to find you.</v>

2066
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:24.000
<v Speaker 8>It has to go through a long,</v>
<v Speaker 8>lengthy court process and they're not</v>

2067
01:30:24.001 --> 01:30:26.660
<v Speaker 8>just finding people like businesses and</v>
<v Speaker 8>like.</v>

2068
01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:29.970
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get it still slippery.</v>

2069
01:30:29.971 --> 01:30:33.250
<v Speaker 5>This is all going to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine the GE?</v>

2070
01:30:33.450 --> 01:30:35.880
<v Speaker 5>All this is going to do is create a ton</v>
<v Speaker 5>of lawsuits.</v>

2071
01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:38.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just because it's a commission like that</v>

2072
01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:41.040
<v Speaker 5>that might even be worse that you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>bringing it into.</v>

2073
01:30:41.041 --> 01:30:44.610
<v Speaker 5>Like you have to sit in front of a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 5>of experts who have to decide whether or</v>

2074
01:30:44.611 --> 01:30:46.590
<v Speaker 5>not you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You missed gendered.</v>

2075
01:30:46.591 --> 01:30:48.630
<v Speaker 5>Someone stop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2076
01:30:48.631 --> 01:30:50.780
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy to miss.</v>

2077
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:53.300
<v Speaker 5>Just look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if someone's an asshole,</v>

2078
01:30:53.301 --> 01:30:54.420
<v Speaker 5>you're an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what if,</v>

2079
01:30:54.810 --> 01:30:57.090
<v Speaker 5>what if you're a Jew and someone calls</v>
<v Speaker 5>you a Kike?</v>

2080
01:30:57.210 --> 01:31:00.210
<v Speaker 5>Can they get fined $250,000.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How does that work?</v>

2081
01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:01.561
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2082
01:31:01.561 --> 01:31:03.870
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's an offensive term for a</v>

2083
01:31:03.871 --> 01:31:04.770
<v Speaker 5>Jewish person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2084
01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:07.950
<v Speaker 5>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you brought that to court,</v>

2085
01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:10.570
<v Speaker 5>how would that work?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you'd get people.</v>

2086
01:31:10.710 --> 01:31:12.370
<v Speaker 5>It's commission though.</v>

2087
01:31:12.450 --> 01:31:15.080
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That would be like a business being</v>

2088
01:31:15.081 --> 01:31:16.870
<v Speaker 8>brought.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're not like just a person,</v>

2089
01:31:16.871 --> 01:31:17.070
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

2090
01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:18.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like landlords.</v>

2091
01:31:18.211 --> 01:31:22.740
<v Speaker 5>It was one of them that they brought up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you decided that you will be</v>

2092
01:31:22.741 --> 01:31:24.960
<v Speaker 5>Jamie still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now you're jamming the woman.</v>

2093
01:31:24.961 --> 01:31:25.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fuck Outta here,</v>

2094
01:31:25.951 --> 01:31:27.000
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a dude.</v>

2095
01:31:27.001 --> 01:31:30.110
<v Speaker 5>GimMe my money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like a wouldn't date</v>

2096
01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:33.910
<v Speaker 8>if that was the case it was and I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 8>an apartment that you were offering and</v>

2097
01:31:33.911 --> 01:31:35.770
<v Speaker 8>you wouldn't give me the apartment for</v>
<v Speaker 8>that reason</v>

2098
01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:40.130
<v Speaker 5>or we work together in some sort of way</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm discriminating against you at</v>

2099
01:31:40.131 --> 01:31:44.300
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it feel like so many.</v>

2100
01:31:44.301 --> 01:31:46.310
<v Speaker 5>It just seems like a ground for so many</v>
<v Speaker 5>lawsuits.</v>

2101
01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:49.190
<v Speaker 5>What I find is if somebody is an addict</v>
<v Speaker 5>to somebody,</v>

2102
01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:52.850
<v Speaker 5>if somebody's calling somebody a name or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something these days with so many camera</v>

2103
01:31:52.851 --> 01:31:56.060
<v Speaker 5>phones and so many things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>usually it gets brought up pretty quick.</v>

2104
01:31:56.150 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 5>If somebody is racist these days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like really devout in their core</v>

2105
01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:03.670
<v Speaker 1>and they like it gets brought out pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking quick.</v>

2106
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Not always though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not always.</v>

2107
01:32:05.741 --> 01:32:07.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure some people get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2108
01:32:07.661 --> 01:32:10.740
<v Speaker 1>you know how you learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how I learned like a in the</v>

2109
01:32:10.770 --> 01:32:13.600
<v Speaker 1>area I grew up in not to be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd hear somebody say something to</v>

2110
01:32:13.601 --> 01:32:16.750
<v Speaker 1>somebody else that they shouldn't say</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they got their ass whooped and then</v>

2111
01:32:16.751 --> 01:32:17.820
<v Speaker 1>they learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not they.</v>

2112
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a weird way to learn it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you learned,</v>

2113
01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:24.220
<v Speaker 1>you learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be nice if people could learn</v>

2114
01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:27.700
<v Speaker 1>another way to realize how stupid it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just be racist.</v>

2115
01:32:27.701 --> 01:32:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of ways you should judge</v>

2116
01:32:29.861 --> 01:32:33.640
<v Speaker 1>individuals like based on their actions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they've done,</v>

2117
01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:36.550
<v Speaker 1>how they're treating other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you know whether or not they're</v>

2118
01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:39.700
<v Speaker 1>doing things that are illegal or immoral</v>
<v Speaker 1>or unethical.</v>

2119
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:44.110
<v Speaker 1>That's as an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as you're doing it based on</v>

2120
01:32:44.111 --> 01:32:47.340
<v Speaker 1>where they can't control right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're,</v>

2121
01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:50.080
<v Speaker 1>what they look like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they were born,</v>

2122
01:32:50.081 --> 01:32:51.550
<v Speaker 1>what part of the world they're from.</v>

2123
01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:54.100
<v Speaker 1>That's just fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a stew.</v>

2124
01:32:54.190 --> 01:32:55.150
<v Speaker 1>It's you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2125
01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.450
<v Speaker 1>you're judging people on something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have zero control over.</v>

2126
01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:00.070
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any control of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>color.</v>

2127
01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:03.490
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people that are still doing</v>

2128
01:33:03.491 --> 01:33:05.290
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are still living in that space.</v>

2129
01:33:05.291 --> 01:33:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Then it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2130
01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:10.120
<v Speaker 1>it is something that I think some of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>will just take more time,</v>

2131
01:33:10.121 --> 01:33:12.330
<v Speaker 1>but I think eventually something will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>eradicated it.</v>

2132
01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:15.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it's beige powers my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all going to be beige,</v>

2133
01:33:15.401 --> 01:33:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2134

<v Speaker 1>Regeneration from all being based thing.</v>

2135
01:33:19.471 --> 01:33:20.920
<v Speaker 1>So you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2136
01:33:20.921 --> 01:33:24.760
<v Speaker 1>not because of places like England and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotland and Ireland where it's always</v>

2137
01:33:24.761 --> 01:33:26.860
<v Speaker 1>rainy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to just kinda get a massive</v>

2138
01:33:26.861 --> 01:33:28.930
<v Speaker 1>amount of white people in those spots no</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter what.</v>

2139
01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:31.770
<v Speaker 1>There's no sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even White Brown people that moved</v>

2140
01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:32.650
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

2141
01:33:32.651 --> 01:33:34.840
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven generations in this type Pale</v>

2142
01:33:34.841 --> 01:33:37.210
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brendan Schaub.</v>

2143
01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:41.020
<v Speaker 1>See he said he was from England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it.</v>

2144
01:33:41.021 --> 01:33:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really black dude from Manga?</v>

2145
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:45.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just forgets things.</v>

2146
01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:48.690
<v Speaker 1>A black guy from England like 500 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

2147
01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:51.640
<v Speaker 1>his whole fan was probably black and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then over time,</v>

2148
01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:54.940
<v Speaker 1>over time they just turned into white</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2149
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Just like every other person that moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>to England,</v>

2150
01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every fucking human being came out of</v>

2151
01:33:59.621 --> 01:34:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

2152
01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:05.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the origin of the species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We came from Africa.</v>

2153
01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:08.440
<v Speaker 1>We branched out into the world and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to places like Scotland where it</v>

2154
01:34:08.441 --> 01:34:11.080
<v Speaker 1>never fucking never sunny and we got</v>
<v Speaker 1>bleached out.</v>

2155
01:34:11.130 --> 01:34:14.290
<v Speaker 1>He believed God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they turned into like a solar panels for</v>

2156
01:34:14.291 --> 01:34:17.830
<v Speaker 1>vitamin D at this to soak up that</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin D.</v>

2157
01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're black,</v>

2158
01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:22.780
<v Speaker 1>like you have so much Melanin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congo black,</v>

2159
01:34:22.810 --> 01:34:26.350
<v Speaker 1>you got a dark skin color that's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome for sun,</v>

2160
01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:29.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's terrible when there's no sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how are you getting your vitamin D</v>

2161
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.270
<v Speaker 1>dot?</v>

2162
01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Even if you hug a black person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like your skin feels a little bit</v>

2163
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.990
<v Speaker 1>kind of like more moist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2164
01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:38.470
<v Speaker 1>They use cocoa butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember ashy Larry?</v>

2165

<v Speaker 1>whole leg was asked.</v>

2170
01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:53.680

<v Speaker 1>African like in my course and I was a</v>

2171
01:34:53.681 --> 01:34:56.270
<v Speaker 1>lay in bed at night and just pretend I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in Africa.</v>

2172
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 1>She ever get your blood tested</v>

2173

<v Speaker 2>scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

2176
01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.890

<v Speaker 2>but what you might be.</v>

2177
01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:09.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I don't want to be honest</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why would that bother you?</v>

2183
01:35:21.741 --> 01:35:25.100
<v Speaker 2>Even a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just they made great wine,</v>

2184
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:28.580
<v Speaker 2>great painters who crave wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They complain a lot.</v>

2185
01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:30.720
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they liked to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2186
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:34.550
<v Speaker 2>That's the word that French people just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to fuck and they think that the way</v>

2187
01:35:34.551 --> 01:35:39.410
<v Speaker 2>we handle things is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have affairs like openly,</v>

2188
01:35:39.411 --> 01:35:41.610
<v Speaker 2>publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the French,</v>

2189
01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:43.460
<v Speaker 2>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politicians,</v>

01:35:43.461 --> 01:35:44.720
<v Speaker 2>they of course they cheat.</v>

2191
01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:48.830
<v Speaker 2>They're all fucking animals over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just drew and that toxo plasma</v>

2192
01:35:48.831 --> 01:35:51.860
<v Speaker 2>apparently was running rapid through</v>
<v Speaker 2>France.</v>

2193
01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it toxo plasma is that thing that you</v>

<v Speaker 2>Get it and they get it from rats and</v>

2195
01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:02.960
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a parasite that gets into human</v>

2196
01:36:02.961 --> 01:36:06.620
<v Speaker 2>brains and it affects humans and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes people a little bit more reckless.</v>

2197
01:36:06.710 --> 01:36:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Like rabies kind of a light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2198
01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:10.130
<v Speaker 2>not rabies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More like a,</v>

2199
01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:13.910
<v Speaker 2>like slightly drunk all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2200
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:17.420
<v Speaker 2>this toxo plasma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently there was one point in time</v>

2201
01:36:17.421 --> 01:36:22.421
<v Speaker 2>40 percent of the franchise of France</v>
<v Speaker 2>was infected with toxo plasma.</v>

2202
01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you find that that's true.</v>

01:36:28.071 --> 01:36:31.220
<v Speaker 2>You Got to pee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that there's a direct</v>

2206
01:36:31.221 --> 01:36:35.870
<v Speaker 2>correlation between the high levels of</v>
<v Speaker 2>infestation and the behavioral changes</v>

2207
01:36:35.871 --> 01:36:37.620
<v Speaker 2>that the population in Pensacola,</v>

2209
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:42.200
<v Speaker 2>of this talkshow plastic suppliers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably 50 million people in this</v>

2210
01:36:42.201 --> 01:36:45.770
<v Speaker 2>country have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get it from cat shit or from if you</v>

<v Speaker 2>live in a farm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you step on the field and it gets</v>

2212
01:36:48.471 --> 01:36:51.350
<v Speaker 2>in your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe cats had been shitting all</v>

2213
01:36:51.351 --> 01:36:54.520
<v Speaker 2>over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a dog will eat something that you</v>

2214
01:36:54.521 --> 01:36:55.520
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some cat shit,</v>

01:36:55.521 --> 01:36:57.170
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you get shit and you're around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dog.</v>

2216
01:36:57.380 --> 01:37:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand 12 analysis from France are</v>
<v Speaker 2>an estimated 43 percent of the people</v>

2217
01:37:01.401 --> 01:37:06.401
<v Speaker 2>carrying toxoplasmosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gandhi concluded that men with a latent</v>

2218
01:37:07.101 --> 01:37:11.000
<v Speaker 2>infection tend to be more dogmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less confident,</v>

2219
01:37:11.001 --> 01:37:13.070
<v Speaker 2>more jealous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less impulsive,</v>

2220
01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:17.840
<v Speaker 2>and more orderly than infected men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Infected women seem warmer,</v>

2221
01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:20.810
<v Speaker 2>more conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more persistent,</v>

2222
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:23.870
<v Speaker 2>more insecure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more sanctimonious.</v>

2223
01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2224
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I'll get a six pack for the ladies then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

2225
01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:31.340
<v Speaker 2>That sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that that 43 percent of people carry</v>

2226
01:37:31.341 --> 01:37:32.930
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2227
01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:37.730
<v Speaker 2>That's a large number of human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>infected by something that changes</v>

2228
01:37:37.731 --> 01:37:42.731
<v Speaker 2>behavior or at least leads to trends</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are different and and noticeable.</v>

2229
01:37:43.941 --> 01:37:45.380
<v Speaker 2>More dogmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less confident,</v>

2230
01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:47.720
<v Speaker 2>less confident is interesting that gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

2231
01:37:48.170 --> 01:37:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Toxoplasmosis gone die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Associations of having antibodies to the</v>

2232
01:37:53.511 --> 01:37:56.400
<v Speaker 2>parasite with bipolar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suicidal</v>

2233
01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:59.250
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even optimistic disposition,</v>

2234
01:37:59.430 --> 01:38:02.430
<v Speaker 1>possibly related to the parasites effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>on dopamine.</v>

2235
01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:06.600
<v Speaker 1>So it gets into your body and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just have it for life.</v>

2236
01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2237
01:38:07.710 --> 01:38:09.240
<v Speaker 1>it is sexually transmitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must be.</v>

2238
01:38:09.241 --> 01:38:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Then that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good question.</v>

2239
01:38:11.341 --> 01:38:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if 43 percent of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have it.</v>

2240
01:38:13.291 --> 01:38:16.200
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine that half of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population to stepped on a,</v>

2241
01:38:16.610 --> 01:38:17.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>

2242
01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good question.</v>

2243
01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:22.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's a lot of feral cats</v>

2244
01:38:22.531 --> 01:38:23.430
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2245
01:38:23.470 --> 01:38:24.303
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

2246
01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when there's places like El</v>

2247
01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Gato.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2248
01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:29.170
<v Speaker 1>We got a lot of feral cats running</v>
<v Speaker 1>around gratitude.</v>

2249
01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:30.660
<v Speaker 1>They have that whole movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that animal,</v>

2250
01:38:30.661 --> 01:38:32.160
<v Speaker 1>that was a chef.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2251
01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:35.700
<v Speaker 1>And what it does to the rats is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes them get hard ons when they smell</v>

2252
01:38:35.701 --> 01:38:37.650
<v Speaker 1>cat piss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that really?</v>

2253
01:38:37.670 --> 01:38:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It rewires their sexual reward system.</v>

2254
01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:43.980
<v Speaker 1>So the testes in large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they smell cat piss.</v>

2255
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:45.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get hard.</v>

2256
01:38:45.571 --> 01:38:47.670
<v Speaker 1>So it gets at a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A neighbor like that dated.</v>

2257
01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:50.100
<v Speaker 1>This guy will always with pregnancy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say that again.</v>

2258
01:38:50.101 --> 01:38:52.020
<v Speaker 1>It gets them through pregnancy to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

2259
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Woof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woof.</v>

2260
01:38:54.090 --> 01:38:58.220
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know 43 percent is a high number.</v>

2261
01:38:58.510 --> 01:39:01.320
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of people.</v>

2262
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:04.920
<v Speaker 1>It's 43 out of 100 people do 3 billion</v>
<v Speaker 1>people on the planet.</v>

2263
01:39:05.370 --> 01:39:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Two billion people have it as 43 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those tested in that study and that's</v>

2264
01:39:09.331 --> 01:39:11.640
<v Speaker 1>all the people that get tested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck I've never been tested.</v>

2265
01:39:11.670 --> 01:39:12.900
<v Speaker 1>You've been tested?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2266
01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:16.200
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have been tested?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a rough estimate,</v>

2267
01:39:16.201 --> 01:39:17.310
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't fucking know.</v>

2268
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's a lot higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

2269
01:39:18.901 --> 01:39:21.930
<v Speaker 1>As a lot of people that have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2270
01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Shit in the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2271
01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:26.490
<v Speaker 1>I probably got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a Dr Robert Sapolsky and the</v>

2272
01:39:26.491 --> 01:39:27.840
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did one with him.</v>

2273
01:39:27.841 --> 01:39:32.160
<v Speaker 1>He's an expert in it and he's got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of lectures and speeches on it and</v>

2274
01:39:32.161 --> 01:39:37.161
<v Speaker 1>he said that when he was a resident then</v>
<v Speaker 1>he heard about a guy who found out that</v>

2275
01:39:38.281 --> 01:39:43.170
<v Speaker 1>a disproportionate number of motorcycle</v>
<v Speaker 1>accidents were attributed to people that</v>

2276
01:39:43.171 --> 01:39:45.150
<v Speaker 1>were on this toxo plasma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2277
01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:45.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That they.</v>

2278
01:39:45.871 --> 01:39:49.950
<v Speaker 1>That they got this infection and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>causing them to do stupid shit on</v>

2279
01:39:49.951 --> 01:39:52.770
<v Speaker 1>motorcycles and crash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would hate that man.</v>

2280
01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:55.070
<v Speaker 1>It's hard enough to ride a motorcycle</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they have like,</v>

2281
01:39:55.770 --> 01:39:58.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to be being led astray by rare</v>

2282
01:39:58.681 --> 01:40:02.100
<v Speaker 1>disease in your brain one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder if it varies.</v>

2283
01:40:02.101 --> 01:40:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if the Toxoplasma that they get</v>

2284
01:40:04.021 --> 01:40:08.110
<v Speaker 1>in Paris has the same exact response was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that they get in South America.</v>

2285
01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:11.190
<v Speaker 1>The America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a bunch of variations.</v>

2286
01:40:11.191 --> 01:40:11.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2287
01:40:11.671 --> 01:40:13.080
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm talking about.</v>

2288
01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:17.550
<v Speaker 1>There's different ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Long Island has a lot of Jesus Christ.</v>

2289
01:40:17.551 --> 01:40:21.090
<v Speaker 1>There's different ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

2290
01:40:21.150 --> 01:40:21.983
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet the.</v>

2291
01:40:22.590 --> 01:40:24.270
<v Speaker 1>What is this though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This seemed like.</v>

2292
01:40:24.271 --> 01:40:26.280
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2293
01:40:26.281 --> 01:40:28.800
<v Speaker 1>it's parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parasites,</v>

2294
01:40:29.190 --> 01:40:34.190
<v Speaker 1>parasites exist in so many animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hitch rides and then that's their</v>

2295
01:40:34.291 --> 01:40:37.200
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our ecosystem is to be on planet earth.</v>

2296
01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Their ecosystem is to be in planet feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vaughn and they just get inside of you.</v>

2297
01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Have parasites ever changed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the kind of the course of history?</v>

2298
01:40:44.251 --> 01:40:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Is that what happened with the plague or</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a different thing?</v>

2299
01:40:46.530 --> 01:40:47.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plagues a different thing,</v>

2300
01:40:47.971 --> 01:40:50.310
<v Speaker 1>but they probably could change the</v>
<v Speaker 1>course of history.</v>

2301
01:40:50.311 --> 01:40:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Have they really changed that many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's behavior?</v>

2302
01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.860
<v Speaker 1>If you think about Paris or France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about 43 percent of the</v>

2303
01:40:56.861 --> 01:40:59.500
<v Speaker 1>people have this infection and the irony</v>
<v Speaker 1>of parasites.</v>

2304
01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.360
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2305
01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:05.500
<v Speaker 1>It's Paris site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if they have.</v>

2306
01:41:05.501 --> 01:41:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine a little French</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking berets?</v>

2307
01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:12.430
<v Speaker 1>We Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to change your behavior a</v>

2308
01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.440
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll go to stupid American.</v>

2309
01:41:15.490 --> 01:41:18.130
<v Speaker 1>The craziest one man is this aquatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>worm.</v>

2310
01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:23.140
<v Speaker 1>It climbs inside of grasshoppers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Body grows and the grasshoppers body,</v>

2311
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:26.410
<v Speaker 1>and then it tells the grasshopper to</v>
<v Speaker 1>commit suicide.</v>

2312
01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it gets the grasshopper to jump into</v>

2313
01:41:29.321 --> 01:41:31.600
<v Speaker 1>the water and then once the grasshopper</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets in the water,</v>

2314
01:41:31.610 --> 01:41:33.620
<v Speaker 1>then it bursts out of its body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2315
01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.070
<v Speaker 1>it's like Pinocchio meets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm alien.</v>

2316
01:41:36.071 --> 01:41:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the movie alien?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sigourney weaver.</v>

2317
01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:42.430
<v Speaker 1>It is like Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the bottom of the whale,</v>

2318
01:41:42.431 --> 01:41:44.800
<v Speaker 1>right in the belly of the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2319
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:48.760
<v Speaker 1>That movie alien with Sigourney Weaver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably my favorite science fiction</v>

2320
01:41:48.761 --> 01:41:50.050
<v Speaker 1>movie of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

2321
01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say if I had to pick one science</v>

2322
01:41:53.021 --> 01:41:55.840
<v Speaker 1>fiction horror movie that was like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2323
01:41:56.170 --> 01:41:58.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll say that alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of cornball.</v>

2324
01:41:58.511 --> 01:42:00.130
<v Speaker 1>When you watched the special effects now</v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Forget different times and even 1980</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like this isn't a woman that needs a</v>

<v Speaker 1>sudden,</v>

2357
01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.070
<v Speaker 1>so easy to kill them because there's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They just became like clumsy and</v>

2362
01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:19.690
<v Speaker 1>bumbling and shoot them and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>another one around the corner.</v>

01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:04.280
<v Speaker 1>White.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they call him big brown.</v>

2382
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh Dang.</v>

2384
01:44:07.131 --> 01:44:11.750

2385
01:44:11.751 --> 01:44:14.630
<v Speaker 1>pretty white to me when I see a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>white dude.</v>

2386
01:44:14.690 --> 01:44:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loved.</v>

2387
01:44:16.081 --> 01:44:18.420
<v Speaker 1>He always has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He as the best disposition doesn't</v>

2388
01:44:18.530 --> 01:44:20.360
<v Speaker 1>break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just loves to laugh.</v>

2389
01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Do you can take it out on.</v>

2390
01:44:22.170 --> 01:44:23.630
<v Speaker 1>He just hated on dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get Jealous.</v>

2391
01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever get jealous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you think.</v>

2392
01:44:25.730 --> 01:44:30.730
<v Speaker 1>And also he says stupid shit sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you think he feels that he.</v>

2393
01:44:30.981 --> 01:44:33.140
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he has a special gift where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of,</v>

2394
01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:35.870
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can kind of joke with him and</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's got a great attitude.</v>

2398
01:44:43.130 --> 01:44:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Like if more people had his attitude</v>
<v Speaker 1>about dealing with life's problems,</v>

2399
01:44:46.610 --> 01:44:49.760
<v Speaker 1>we'd have a happier world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows how to let things roll right</v>

2400
01:44:49.761 --> 01:44:51.380
<v Speaker 1>off his back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's big.</v>

2401

<v Speaker 1>about people now.</v>

2480
01:48:01.711 --> 01:48:04.440
<v Speaker 1>I know the people you used to be alive</v>

<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2490
01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2491
01:48:27.391 --> 01:48:29.820
<v Speaker 1>It makes you really wonder then what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is my time mean?</v>

2492
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.180
<v Speaker 1>What does your timing like?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2494
01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:39.390

<v Speaker 1>just feeling more okay with myself</v>

2495
01:48:39.391 --> 01:48:43.950
<v Speaker 1>probably and trying to have maybe help</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people being more okay with</v>

2496

<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2498
01:48:48.810 --> 01:48:51.270
<v Speaker 1>I just wish I just felt more comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my own skin a lot of times,</v>

2499
01:48:51.271 --> 01:48:53.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I feel like I'm be able to be</v>

2500
01:48:53.821 --> 01:48:58.821
<v Speaker 1>more effective as a person if I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kind of get not toil in some of my</v>

2501
01:48:59.041 --> 01:49:01.450
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2502
01:49:01.650 --> 01:49:05.490
<v Speaker 1>the small self worth issues or like lack</v>
<v Speaker 1>of confidence at times,</v>

2503
01:49:05.491 --> 01:49:07.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could trust my instincts and I</v>

2504
01:49:07.051 --> 01:49:10.770
<v Speaker 1>wish my instincts were like better</v>
<v Speaker 1>calibrated so that I knew when I was</v>

2505
01:49:11.230 --> 01:49:12.870
<v Speaker 1>what if I was doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>in good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then my insides like told me,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2509

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2510
01:49:21.090 --> 01:49:23.490
<v Speaker 1>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big one is almost always from your</v>

2511
01:49:23.491 --> 01:49:28.410
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost feelings of lack of worth and</v>

2512
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:32.670
<v Speaker 1>self worth come from that feeling as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're developing,</v>

2513
01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.200
<v Speaker 1>as you're growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2514
01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Feel like you're not loved or you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciated or you're,</v>

2515
01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:42.090
<v Speaker 1>you're criticized too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're a loser and really</v>

2516
01:49:42.091 --> 01:49:44.820
<v Speaker 1>be concise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically can be very hard to</v>

2517
01:49:44.821 --> 01:49:47.070
<v Speaker 1>shake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even as people get older,</v>

2518
01:49:47.530 --> 01:49:48.363
<v Speaker 1>they still,</v>

2519
01:49:48.610 --> 01:49:53.220
<v Speaker 2>they still cling to this thought that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a piece of shit because they are</v>

2520
01:49:53.221 --> 01:49:56.680
<v Speaker 2>a piece of shit in someone's eyes when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were eight or 10.</v>

2521
01:49:57.730 --> 01:49:59.260
<v Speaker 2>That's a real problem with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2522
01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:03.970
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the reasons why when</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone gets bullied when they're young,</v>

2523
01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:08.170
<v Speaker 2>it can be so devastating because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening when you're in high school or</v>

2524
01:50:08.171 --> 01:50:11.680
<v Speaker 2>junior high school and it becomes a</v>
<v Speaker 2>defining moment for you.</v>

2525
01:50:13.290 --> 01:50:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Yet I was scared as one kid really also</v>
<v Speaker 2>about this one kid,</v>

2526
01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:20.440
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why I got into</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling this kid,</v>

2527
01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:22.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we had this confrontation and a</v>

2528
01:50:22.931 --> 01:50:26.020
<v Speaker 2>locker room and I didn't think were</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to fight.</v>

2529
01:50:26.021 --> 01:50:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Like I was just totally bluffing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>

2530
01:50:29.170 --> 01:50:31.060
<v Speaker 2>what I said or what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

2531
01:50:31.061 --> 01:50:32.950
<v Speaker 2>But I do remember him getting me in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>headlock,</v>

2532
01:50:33.370 --> 01:50:37.150
<v Speaker 2>throwing me on the ground and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaning like he was gonna Punch me in</v>

2533
01:50:37.151 --> 01:50:37.690
<v Speaker 2>the face.</v>

2534
01:50:37.690 --> 01:50:40.480
<v Speaker 2>But deciding not to and I didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do.</v>

2535
01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:44.410
<v Speaker 2>I had no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no martial arts skills.</v>

2536
01:50:44.411 --> 01:50:46.070
<v Speaker 2>No nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>

2537
01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:48.730
<v Speaker 2>I'd never wrestled anybody before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know anything,</v>

2538
01:50:48.731 --> 01:50:50.860
<v Speaker 2>so there's nothing in you that is like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>new reaction,</v>

2539
01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:54.910
<v Speaker 2>panicked and no idea what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think and I thought,</v>

2540
01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:57.280
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think he was going to do that</v>

2541
01:50:57.281 --> 01:50:59.360
<v Speaker 2>and now here I am on my back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm traveling,</v>

2542
01:50:59.770 --> 01:51:01.510
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to learn how to wrestle.</v>

2543
01:51:01.511 --> 01:51:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I got to learn some martial arts or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2544
01:51:03.041 --> 01:51:06.460
<v Speaker 2>So then I started taking karate and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started taking wrestling like right</v>

2545
01:51:06.461 --> 01:51:10.780
<v Speaker 2>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I avoided that kid every time I saw</v>

2546
01:51:10.781 --> 01:51:12.550
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I see him on the other side of</v>

2547
01:51:12.551 --> 01:51:14.530
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks through the breezeway and I've</v>

2548
01:51:14.531 --> 01:51:16.960
<v Speaker 2>always knew where he was around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to go around.</v>

2549
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:20.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see that guy that threw</v>
<v Speaker 2>me on the ground and could have punched</v>

2550
01:51:20.261 --> 01:51:20.800
<v Speaker 2>me in the face.</v>

2551
01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:22.990
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like more humiliating that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did,</v>

2552
01:51:22.991 --> 01:51:24.550
<v Speaker 2>could have punched me in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't.</v>

2553
01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:28.180
<v Speaker 2>But that bullying and that guy doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2554
01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:32.090
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fear of like being I'm just</v>

2555
01:51:32.110 --> 01:51:34.450
<v Speaker 2>helpless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made me get into martial arts.</v>

2556
01:51:34.570 --> 01:51:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>

2557
01:51:35.801 --> 01:51:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Like I gotta figure out how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want this to happen to me</v>

2558
01:51:38.891 --> 01:51:43.891
<v Speaker 2>anymore to do you see as the benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a lucky situation to look.</v>

2559
01:51:44.741 --> 01:51:47.560
<v Speaker 2>He didn't beat me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could've been way worse.</v>

2560
01:51:47.710 --> 01:51:50.440
<v Speaker 2>It was not that big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an easy school to go to.</v>

2561
01:51:50.441 --> 01:51:52.900
<v Speaker 2>Like my school wasn't hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though there was some criminals</v>

2562
01:51:52.901 --> 01:51:55.390
<v Speaker 2>that were in that school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some kids that get shipped into.</v>

2563
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:58.210
<v Speaker 2>There was some bad kids and one of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>got charged with murder,</v>

2564
01:51:58.211 --> 01:51:59.670
<v Speaker 2>like right after graduating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>

2565
01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:01.000
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our friend Kevin,</v>

2566
01:52:01.001 --> 01:52:02.560
<v Speaker 2>we knew this dude and he killed</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

2567
01:52:02.561 --> 01:52:03.730
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2568
01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:05.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was like,</v>

2569
01:52:05.141 --> 01:52:06.730
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy killed somebody.</v>

2570
01:52:06.970 --> 01:52:09.530
<v Speaker 2>I think he was one year older than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2571
01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:11.830
<v Speaker 2>He murdered somebody like right after</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school.</v>

2572
01:52:12.210 --> 01:52:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a kid.</v>

2573
01:52:13.361 --> 01:52:15.850
<v Speaker 2>We knew he was on the football team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We knew him.</v>

2574
01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:18.220
<v Speaker 2>And then do you ever think he would</v>
<v Speaker 2>murder somebody?</v>

2575
01:52:19.130 --> 01:52:21.960
<v Speaker 2>He was a tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a scary guy for sure.</v>

2576
01:52:21.980 --> 01:52:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Like a powerhouse of a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a tank.</v>

2577
01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.590
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know him well though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2578
01:52:26.591 --> 01:52:27.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say hi to them,</v>

2579
01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:31.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's one of those things where when</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that happens to you and</v>

2580
01:52:31.781 --> 01:52:33.760
<v Speaker 2>for me again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very minor,</v>

2581
01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:37.180
<v Speaker 2>just I was just scared of this guy now</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't do anything to me.</v>

2582
01:52:37.181 --> 01:52:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just threw me on the ground.</v>

2583
01:52:39.070 --> 01:52:40.750
<v Speaker 2>So when somebody's going to beat your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brains,</v>

2584
01:52:40.751 --> 01:52:42.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean if somebody could hold you down</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that I could do,</v>

2585
01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:44.680
<v Speaker 2>could have beat my face and I wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been able to do shit.</v>

2586
01:52:44.710 --> 01:52:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Are you grateful in a weird way that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't or not grateful?</v>

2587
01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:50.270
<v Speaker 2>Looking back on her for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was enough.</v>

2588
01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:52.040
<v Speaker 2>He just let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2589
01:52:52.210 --> 01:52:53.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I said.</v>

2590
01:52:53.241 --> 01:52:55.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a said something stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might've said something stupid and</v>

2591
01:52:55.581 --> 01:52:58.550
<v Speaker 2>wanted me to back down and I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he just grabbed me,</v>

2592
01:52:58.580 --> 01:53:00.710
<v Speaker 2>threw me on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that he,</v>

2593
01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:06.070
<v Speaker 2>that he did it and could do it led me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make one of the biggest decisions of my</v>

2594
01:53:06.231 --> 01:53:08.390
<v Speaker 2>whole life is getting involved in</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.</v>

2595
01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:13.190
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't want that feeling anymore</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like if someone talks like gives me a</v>

2596
01:53:13.191 --> 01:53:17.090
<v Speaker 2>hard time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be the one who can decide</v>

2597
01:53:17.091 --> 01:53:19.490
<v Speaker 2>whether or not this gets violent or who</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets hurt.</v>

2598
01:53:19.850 --> 01:53:21.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to leave that into some</v>
<v Speaker 2>stranger's hand,</v>

2599
01:53:21.741 --> 01:53:24.410
<v Speaker 2>so it might be a fucking psychopath if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in my hands.</v>

2600
01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:25.850
<v Speaker 2>No one's getting hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be finally,</v>

2601
01:53:25.851 --> 01:53:28.340
<v Speaker 2>there's a video of Matt Serra from</v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday.</v>

2602
01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Matt Serra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a drunk and altercation with</v>

2603
01:53:31.341 --> 01:53:35.310
<v Speaker 2>some fucking dude in a food court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt Serra who is a Brazilian Jujitsu</v>

2604
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:37.580
<v Speaker 2>black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who at one point in time when he was</v>

2605
01:53:37.581 --> 01:53:39.440
<v Speaker 2>competing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was one of the best presented to to</v>

2606
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:41.480
<v Speaker 2>artists in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then on top of that,</v>

2607
01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:43.970
<v Speaker 2>he fought mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked out George St.</v>

2608
01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Pierre won the welterweight title and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got some dude on the ground and</v>

2609
01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:50.540
<v Speaker 2>he's just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm down,</v>

2610
01:53:50.541 --> 01:53:53.560
<v Speaker 2>calm down because I'm gonna fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fuck.</v>

2611
01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:56.000
<v Speaker 2>But it's hilarious to watch like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this look good,</v>

2612
01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:57.800
<v Speaker 2>play good and play the volume.</v>

2613
01:54:00.810 --> 01:54:02.580
<v Speaker 9>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to break your fucking face.</v>

2614
01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:06.660
<v Speaker 9>He's holding his wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I love how you have the shirt on the</v>

2615
01:54:06.690 --> 01:54:07.680
<v Speaker 9>guy's face.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He's like,</v>

2616
01:54:07.681 --> 01:54:08.910
<v Speaker 9>calm down,</v>
<v Speaker 9>calm down.</v>

2617
01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:11.340
<v Speaker 9>It's like he's putting a crying baby to</v>
<v Speaker 9>sleep,</v>

2618
01:54:11.341 --> 01:54:13.260
<v Speaker 9>and so the security guard comes over and</v>
<v Speaker 9>says,</v>

2619
01:54:13.261 --> 01:54:14.160
<v Speaker 9>let him go.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He goes,</v>

2620
01:54:14.161 --> 01:54:15.440
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're going to control them.</v>

2621
01:54:23.150 --> 01:54:25.690
<v Speaker 9>You going to control them.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Are you going to control knowing that?</v>

2622
01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:31.240
<v Speaker 9>Are you ready to control them?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like he's not standing up and he's fat?</v>

2623
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.550

01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:46.350

<v Speaker 2>on the planet earth.</v>

2626
01:54:46.410 --> 01:54:50.280
<v Speaker 2>If he has to do this to you in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant and she's a restaurant,</v>

2627
01:54:50.290 --> 01:54:52.830

2629
01:54:55.021 --> 01:54:57.720
<v Speaker 2>you're way better off with Matt Serra in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that position.</v>

2630
01:54:57.721 --> 01:55:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Then that drunk dude on some guy who</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know how to fight.</v>

2631
01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:03.510
<v Speaker 2>It could be that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That drunk dude could just be a real</v>

2632
01:55:03.511 --> 01:55:06.300
<v Speaker 2>mean violent person who wants to beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone up if he gets him down.</v>

2633
01:55:06.630 --> 01:55:08.850
<v Speaker 2>So if there's guys like you who aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>into that.</v>

2634
01:55:09.210 --> 01:55:12.810
<v Speaker 2>So you found getting into martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really kind of lead you in a way where</v>

2635
01:55:12.811 --> 01:55:16.620
<v Speaker 2>you felt more confident in case things</v>
<v Speaker 2>got into an uncomfortable situation that</v>

2636
01:55:16.621 --> 01:55:18.030
<v Speaker 2>you would be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2637
01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always.</v>

2638
01:55:19.470 --> 01:55:22.530
<v Speaker 2>You're always going to be nervous in</v>
<v Speaker 2>life when something's important,</v>

2639
01:55:22.531 --> 01:55:24.910
<v Speaker 2>whether it's going on stage or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to do.</v>

2640
01:55:25.110 --> 01:55:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Difficult things make you nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's an anticipation.</v>

2641
01:55:28.411 --> 01:55:32.490
<v Speaker 2>There's an understanding of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficulty of something you're about to</v>

2642
01:55:32.491 --> 01:55:34.980
<v Speaker 2>pursue and whether or not you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fall short or whether or not you're</v>

2643
01:55:34.981 --> 01:55:37.290
<v Speaker 2>going to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit makes people nervous,</v>

2644
01:55:37.770 --> 01:55:41.910
<v Speaker 2>but the physical confrontation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nervousness is a bad one.</v>

2645
01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 2>That's like dad is</v>

2646
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:48.600
<v Speaker 5>a paralyzing fear when the fear of being</v>
<v Speaker 5>bullied or being hurt and you can't do</v>

2647
01:55:48.601 --> 01:55:50.100
<v Speaker 5>anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That devastates people,</v>

2648
01:55:50.101 --> 01:55:51.690
<v Speaker 5>that puts them in a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deep depression.</v>

2649
01:55:52.290 --> 01:55:57.290
<v Speaker 5>So it's really important to I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think every young man should learn how</v>

2650
01:55:57.871 --> 01:56:00.090
<v Speaker 5>to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there would be way less fights</v>

2651
01:56:00.091 --> 01:56:03.750
<v Speaker 5>because of it and I don't think you have</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be a mean person to learn martial</v>

2652
01:56:03.751 --> 01:56:06.030
<v Speaker 5>arts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a skill and I think you</v>

2653
01:56:06.031 --> 01:56:08.130
<v Speaker 5>learn it and then once you start getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>good at it,</v>

2654
01:56:08.131 --> 01:56:11.940
<v Speaker 5>it started actually starts actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>becoming fun and the people who practice</v>

2655
01:56:11.941 --> 01:56:14.400
<v Speaker 5>it with you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you become close with you,</v>

2656
01:56:14.401 --> 01:56:16.740
<v Speaker 5>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't hate the people that you're</v>

2657
01:56:17.010 --> 01:56:20.130
<v Speaker 5>practicing fighting with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They become some of your closest friends</v>

2658
01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:25.230
<v Speaker 5>and I think it's just a big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a giant confidence boost to know</v>

2659
01:56:25.231 --> 01:56:27.660
<v Speaker 5>that you can do something difficult and</v>
<v Speaker 5>get better at it.</v>

2660
01:56:28.050 --> 01:56:28.980
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

2661
01:56:28.981 --> 01:56:32.310
<v Speaker 5>just that alone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has massive benefits for people.</v>

2662
01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:33.241
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2663
01:56:33.241 --> 01:56:35.580
<v Speaker 5>I can sense that meant I remember</v>
<v Speaker 5>watching a video a couple years ago</v>

2664
01:56:35.590 --> 01:56:37.320
<v Speaker 5>actually if you like getting a belt or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

2665
01:56:37.321 --> 01:56:40.200
<v Speaker 5>they gave you a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some Dojo or I'm not sure what the</v>

2666
01:56:40.201 --> 01:56:43.950
<v Speaker 5>correct terminology is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might've been probably watching when</v>

2667
01:56:43.951 --> 01:56:45.000
<v Speaker 5>I got my black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2668
01:56:45.001 --> 01:56:46.220
<v Speaker 5>maybe that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But anyway.</v>

2669
01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:47.151
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like all,</v>

2670
01:56:47.151 --> 01:56:48.760
<v Speaker 5>like there was a lot of guys around</v>
<v Speaker 5>just.</v>

2671
01:56:49.170 --> 01:56:50.650
<v Speaker 5>And I know that Coco does it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

2672
01:56:50.651 --> 01:56:52.280
<v Speaker 5>he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He loves it and he said,</v>

2673
01:56:52.370 --> 01:56:54.270
<v Speaker 5>why don't you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a strapping man.</v>

2674
01:56:54.271 --> 01:56:56.880
<v Speaker 5>You talked to Eddie about going to do it</v>
<v Speaker 5>one day,</v>

2675
01:56:57.020 --> 01:56:58.200
<v Speaker 5>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he said,</v>

2676
01:56:58.201 --> 01:56:58.981
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>

2677
01:56:58.981 --> 01:56:59.761
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>

2678
01:56:59.761 --> 01:57:01.490
<v Speaker 5>come down one day and he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2679
01:57:01.590 --> 01:57:03.180
<v Speaker 5>get me into like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the beginners classes.</v>

2680
01:57:03.190 --> 01:57:04.330
<v Speaker 5>I think I need to do it.</v>

2681
01:57:04.370 --> 01:57:06.480
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could make me feel a little bit more,</v>

2682
01:57:06.481 --> 01:57:07.520
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2683
01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:09.400
<v Speaker 5>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of them that just a,</v>

2684
01:57:09.610 --> 01:57:10.443
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some.</v>

2685
01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:13.230
<v Speaker 5>And especially like if people get</v>
<v Speaker 5>bullied and then they don't have like a</v>

2686
01:57:13.231 --> 01:57:17.160
<v Speaker 5>brother or they don't have a friend or</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't even have somebody to go talk</v>

2687
01:57:17.161 --> 01:57:18.030
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be like,</v>

2688
01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:19.410
<v Speaker 5>oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then their blooded,</v>

2689
01:57:19.411 --> 01:57:19.821
<v Speaker 5>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2690
01:57:19.821 --> 01:57:20.670
<v Speaker 5>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2691
01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:23.000
<v Speaker 5>like that seat that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that can make you know.</v>

2692
01:57:23.090 --> 01:57:26.130
<v Speaker 5>Then that person gets stuck inside</v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves just feeling like,</v>

2693
01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:28.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they're not going to be okay.</v>

2694
01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:29.760
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2695
01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:31.800
<v Speaker 5>It's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then everywhere you go,</v>

2696
01:57:31.801 --> 01:57:33.390
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just scared of running into this</v>

2697
01:57:33.391 --> 01:57:34.380
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2698
01:57:34.710 --> 01:57:35.400
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

2699
01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:36.560
<v Speaker 5>very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2700
01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:38.700
<v Speaker 5>she'd get into tenements,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do it.</v>

2701
01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:43.830
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucking natural animal</v>
<v Speaker 5>inclination to pick on the weak,</v>

2702
01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:48.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>only humans realize it and stop it.</v>

2703
01:57:48.090 --> 01:57:52.290
<v Speaker 5>And actually tell people not to do it</v>
<v Speaker 5>and understand the effect that it has on</v>

2704
01:57:52.291 --> 01:57:54.450
<v Speaker 5>the people that do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but every animal does it.</v>

2705
01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:56.040
<v Speaker 5>Dogs do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chickens do it.</v>

2706
01:57:56.190 --> 01:57:59.100
<v Speaker 5>Chickens have a pecking order.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They fuck with one chicken and then they</v>

2707
01:57:59.101 --> 01:57:59.821
<v Speaker 5>all decided,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2708
01:57:59.821 --> 01:58:02.790
<v Speaker 5>let's fuck with this bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they all attack her for no reason.</v>

2709
01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:04.320
<v Speaker 5>It's weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you've seen it.</v>

2710
01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:07.590
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's seen dogs do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One dog will blow up and the other dog,</v>

2711
01:58:07.670 --> 01:58:10.230
<v Speaker 5>the dog will cower.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they decided the pecking order.</v>

2712
01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:12.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then that dog will always go near</v>

2713
01:58:12.571 --> 01:58:14.460
<v Speaker 5>that dog and fuck with them and growl at</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

2714
01:58:14.461 --> 01:58:16.100
<v Speaker 5>Maybe bite his year or something like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2715
01:58:16.101 --> 01:58:20.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a weird thing that animals figured</v>

2716
01:58:20.431 --> 01:58:24.990
<v Speaker 5>out how to make sure that the only ones</v>
<v Speaker 5>that get to breed are the ones that are</v>

2717
01:58:24.991 --> 01:58:28.590
<v Speaker 5>confident and powerful and can overcome</v>
<v Speaker 5>problems.</v>

2718
01:58:28.590 --> 01:58:31.640
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the problems is other mating</v>

2719
01:58:32.910 --> 01:58:36.690
<v Speaker 5>viable males that want to meet with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>women that you want to meet with,</v>

2720
01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:39.540
<v Speaker 5>like with this fucking giraffe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They wound up killing those three other</v>

2721
01:58:39.541 --> 01:58:41.410
<v Speaker 5>drafts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy just was like,</v>

2722
01:58:41.411 --> 01:58:44.350
<v Speaker 5>fuck these bitches coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to smash my head into these</v>

2723
01:58:44.351 --> 01:58:45.430
<v Speaker 5>drafts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stop them.</v>

2724
01:58:45.670 --> 01:58:47.320
<v Speaker 5>You ain't fucking these girls when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>get older.</v>

2725
01:58:47.321 --> 01:58:51.040
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is just a natural inclination</v>

2726
01:58:51.041 --> 01:58:55.810
<v Speaker 5>that animals have to find the weak and</v>
<v Speaker 5>force it out and we don't have it.</v>

2727
01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:57.790
<v Speaker 5>Well we do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We did have it.</v>

2728
01:58:57.791 --> 01:58:59.740
<v Speaker 5>Fortunately we haven't less now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2729
01:58:59.741 --> 01:59:01.780
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we realize because of communication,</v>

2730
01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:03.790
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We realized that there's devastating</v>

2731
01:59:03.791 --> 01:59:06.490
<v Speaker 5>effects in this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then we have loving and caring</v>

2732
01:59:06.491 --> 01:59:09.100
<v Speaker 5>communities and we have compassion that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't do that,</v>

2733
01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:13.690
<v Speaker 5>but there's an inclination that people</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to pick on the weak and attack the</v>

2734
01:59:13.691 --> 01:59:13.900
<v Speaker 5>weak.</v>

2735
01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:16.210
<v Speaker 5>It's very.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very disturbing,</v>

2736
01:59:16.330 --> 01:59:19.750
<v Speaker 5>but it's also very logical in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 5>like biology,</v>

2737
01:59:19.930 --> 01:59:22.420
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to make it difficult for</v>

2738
01:59:22.421 --> 01:59:26.560
<v Speaker 5>males to breed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like we have very few people</v>

2739
01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:28.450
<v Speaker 5>and we're trying to make as many people</v>
<v Speaker 5>as we get.</v>

2740
01:59:28.451 --> 01:59:28.661
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2741
01:59:28.661 --> 01:59:32.050
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the highest status mails and</v>

2742
01:59:32.051 --> 01:59:36.850
<v Speaker 5>the dominant males are competing against</v>
<v Speaker 5>these other males in order to be able to</v>

2743
01:59:36.851 --> 01:59:37.970
<v Speaker 5>breed with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2744
01:59:38.460 --> 01:59:41.760
<v Speaker 5>whatever lizards are fucking wolves or</v>
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>

2745
01:59:41.761 --> 01:59:45.850
<v Speaker 5>any in any species.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The high status male wolf is the one who</v>

2746
01:59:45.851 --> 01:59:49.720
<v Speaker 5>gets to breed with the the choice</v>
<v Speaker 5>females and this is how they're carrying</v>

2747
01:59:49.721 --> 01:59:51.850
<v Speaker 5>their genes on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It happens in deer,</v>

2748
01:59:52.050 --> 01:59:54.340
<v Speaker 5>it happens in elk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it happens in all these different</v>

2749
01:59:54.341 --> 01:59:57.500
<v Speaker 5>animals and they fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the reason why these,</v>

2750
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:59.890
<v Speaker 5>these antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Elk.</v>

2751
02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:01.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are for fighting.</v>

2752
02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:05.140
<v Speaker 5>That's all there for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They actually lose those fucking things.</v>

2753
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:07.000
<v Speaker 5>After they're done breeding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really.</v>

2754
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:08.920
<v Speaker 5>They fall off and they grow back again</v>
<v Speaker 5>the next year.</v>

2755
02:00:08.921 --> 02:00:13.921
<v Speaker 5>That is the fastest body part growth</v>
<v Speaker 5>known to man is elk antlers and that,</v>

2756
02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:18.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean when you look at those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks like it would take 70 years to</v>

2757
02:00:18.371 --> 02:00:21.730
<v Speaker 5>grow the grow those motherfuckers at a</v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of months and then it'll grow</v>

2758
02:00:21.731 --> 02:00:26.731
<v Speaker 5>bigger next year up until a point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometime around like age nine or 10.</v>

2759
02:00:26.741 --> 02:00:28.930
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes they taper off and they start</v>
<v Speaker 5>to decline.</v>

2760
02:00:28.931 --> 02:00:31.510
<v Speaker 5>As they get older,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their their antlers actually become</v>

2761
02:00:31.511 --> 02:00:34.420
<v Speaker 5>smaller and smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for the most part as the.</v>

2762
02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:38.170
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the reasons why people</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to shoot a big male is because that</v>

2763
02:00:38.171 --> 02:00:42.160
<v Speaker 5>male with big antlers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that male spread his genetics for many,</v>

2764
02:00:42.161 --> 02:00:46.300
<v Speaker 5>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So his genes are will long passed on.</v>

2765
02:00:46.450 --> 02:00:48.610
<v Speaker 5>He's probably a bread with dozens of</v>
<v Speaker 5>females.</v>

2766
02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:49.241
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

2767
02:00:49.241 --> 02:00:51.820
<v Speaker 5>So if it has a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's obviously been alive a long time</v>

2768
02:00:51.821 --> 02:00:54.220
<v Speaker 5>and it has that family treat is hanging</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of the front of its head.</v>

2769
02:00:54.250 --> 02:00:55.510
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2770
02:00:55.750 --> 02:00:57.100
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this thing is already.</v>

2771
02:00:57.130 --> 02:00:58.600
<v Speaker 5>It's already prospered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2772
02:00:58.601 --> 02:01:02.060
<v Speaker 5>And the idea also is that to only shoot</v>
<v Speaker 5>those mails,</v>

2773
02:01:02.090 --> 02:01:03.670
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those high status,</v>

2774
02:01:03.671 --> 02:01:06.040
<v Speaker 5>big males,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's actually better for the population</v>

2775
02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:09.730
<v Speaker 5>because then the younger males get a</v>
<v Speaker 5>chance to become older because they'll</v>

2776
02:01:09.731 --> 02:01:11.860
<v Speaker 5>kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They killed young males.</v>

2777
02:01:11.861 --> 02:01:15.190
<v Speaker 5>If a young male gets fucking frisky and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he thinks he's a bad ass,</v>

2778
02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:17.020
<v Speaker 5>the big old bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck him up.</v>

2779
02:01:17.021 --> 02:01:21.040
<v Speaker 5>And one of the ways they fuck them up as</v>
<v Speaker 5>their antlers are longer so they can get</v>

2780
02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:23.650
<v Speaker 5>the young one when the young one can't</v>
<v Speaker 5>get him.</v>

2781
02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:26.260
<v Speaker 5>Nothing Ms Dot Kinda Kinda evil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but your,</v>

2782
02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:31.060
<v Speaker 5>your weapons are dictated by your age.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really weird,</v>

2783
02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:32.620
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And your strength and like how,</v>

2784
02:01:33.010 --> 02:01:34.330
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much vitality you have.</v>

2785
02:01:34.450 --> 02:01:36.850
<v Speaker 5>That's what grows your antlers out in</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2786
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 5>Fascinating that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how it all</v>

2787
02:01:40.050 --> 02:01:43.580
<v Speaker 2>that it's all put together like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is fucked up and they bullied the</v>

2788
02:01:43.581 --> 02:01:46.330
<v Speaker 2>shit out of those young bowls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They chase them away.</v>

2789
02:01:46.610 --> 02:01:48.760
<v Speaker 2>You get no pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

2790
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:50.950
<v Speaker 2>those young bulls are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call them satellite bowls there.</v>

2791
02:01:50.951 --> 02:01:53.490
<v Speaker 2>So horny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they hanging on the outside of the</v>

2792
02:01:53.530 --> 02:01:56.210
<v Speaker 2>blues?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're susceptible to</v>

2793
02:01:56.211 --> 02:01:59.000
<v Speaker 2>hunters because hunters like make a cow</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling.</v>

2794
02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:02.060
<v Speaker 2>They make this go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2795
02:02:02.061 --> 02:02:04.040
<v Speaker 2>who wants to fuck one to fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they get shot.</v>

2796
02:02:05.330 --> 02:02:06.163
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they get.</v>

2797
02:02:06.210 --> 02:02:09.050
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things about elk</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting that's so interesting,</v>

2798
02:02:09.051 --> 02:02:13.850
<v Speaker 2>so that you call them in actually make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds to try to bring them towards you.</v>

2799
02:02:13.851 --> 02:02:16.640
<v Speaker 2>So they think they're going to get some</v>
<v Speaker 2>pussy or they think there's a fight.</v>

2800
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make a bugle and they have these</v>

2801
02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:22.960
<v Speaker 2>horns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you blow bugles and then the,</v>

2802
02:02:23.050 --> 02:02:24.260
<v Speaker 2>the elk will go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2803
02:02:24.290 --> 02:02:27.220
<v Speaker 2>You want someone to bitch and I'll come</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the corner for.</v>

2804
02:02:27.330 --> 02:02:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for another elk to fuck up and</v>

2805
02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:32.900
<v Speaker 2>then shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you ever get in like a suit or</v>

2806
02:02:32.901 --> 02:02:35.080
<v Speaker 2>anything like that into it and pretend</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be an l,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So like say if you were shooting your</v>

<v Speaker 2>you've got your bow here.</v>

2811
02:02:45.950 --> 02:02:49.240
<v Speaker 2>Extending in front of your bow is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2812
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:51.520
<v Speaker 2>an it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2813
02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:54.380
<v Speaker 2>like a female elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a deep.</v>

2814
02:02:54.410 --> 02:02:58.010
<v Speaker 2>And you're actually shooting through her</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the ELC.</v>

2815
02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a decor that you put on in</v>

2816
02:03:01.161 --> 02:03:03.470
<v Speaker 2>front of your boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're drawing back your bow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't think their vision is very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2832
02:03:39.441 --> 02:03:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think their vision is a.</v>

2833
02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:44.760
<v Speaker 2>have you ever watched any of them have</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex or they don't?</v>

2834
02:03:44.810 --> 02:03:45.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2835
02:03:45.711 --> 02:03:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I saw one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a male,</v>

2836
02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:50.350
<v Speaker 2>a elk fuck a female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

2837
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it pretty cool or is it mashed?</v>

2838
02:03:52.670 --> 02:03:54.500
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He smashed it so hard.</v>

2839
02:03:54.501 --> 02:03:57.950
<v Speaker 2>She went flying forward when she got</v>
<v Speaker 2>tackled and went down to a front knees.</v>

2840
02:03:58.490 --> 02:04:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just climbed on top and he's a one</v>

2841
02:04:00.981 --> 02:04:02.420
<v Speaker 2>pump chump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

2842
02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:05.330
<v Speaker 2>He just slammed into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you tell?</v>

2843
02:04:05.331 --> 02:04:06.820
<v Speaker 2>He felt good after it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He seemed like whatever.</v>

2844
02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:10.880
<v Speaker 2>He was screaming when they're fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when they're in heat,</v>

2845
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:13.430
<v Speaker 2>in the breeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Rut they call it.</v>

2846
02:04:14.630 --> 02:04:16.070
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2847
02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:18.200
<v Speaker 2>this is something they only do once a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

2848
02:04:18.290 --> 02:04:21.650
<v Speaker 2>so</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 11 months out of the year,</v>

2849
02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:24.710
<v Speaker 2>they're cool with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all just hanging out together</v>

2850
02:04:24.850 --> 02:04:28.820
<v Speaker 2>and one month out of the year to chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fighting to the death with other</v>

2851
02:04:28.821 --> 02:04:31.990
<v Speaker 2>males smashing into it and then every</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl they get a chance,</v>

2852
02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:36.140
<v Speaker 2>they bang it out and then when it's over</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>

2853
02:04:36.380 --> 02:04:39.360
<v Speaker 2>And then this is a cycle of life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then in the spring the new calves are</v>

2854
02:04:39.361 --> 02:04:44.361
<v Speaker 2>born and then they grow up and then a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year later they're hanging around in the</v>

2855
02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:48.000
<v Speaker 2>pack and then they get older as they get</v>
<v Speaker 2>older.</v>

2856
02:04:48.001 --> 02:04:51.390
<v Speaker 2>The challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old bowl for dominance and chases</v>

2857
02:04:51.391 --> 02:04:53.160
<v Speaker 2>them away and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2858
02:04:53.161 --> 02:04:56.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating sort of a ecosystem</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you want.</v>

2859
02:04:56.731 --> 02:04:58.980
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always rules and there's always</v>

2860
02:04:58.981 --> 02:05:01.620
<v Speaker 2>bears and there's all these things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to eat them and mountain lions</v>

2861
02:05:01.621 --> 02:05:03.150
<v Speaker 2>are killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2862
02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:07.020
<v Speaker 6>That's wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's neat that you're so in tune with</v>

2863
02:05:07.021 --> 02:05:09.870
<v Speaker 6>all of that stuff and that you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2864
02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:12.660
<v Speaker 6>you're into those worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That sounds like a lot of fun,</v>

2865
02:05:12.661 --> 02:05:13.680
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2866
02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if I never ever hunted again,</v>

2867
02:05:18.250 --> 02:05:21.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would still be fascinated by wildlife.</v>

2868
02:05:21.550 --> 02:05:25.420
<v Speaker 2>It is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the more interesting things</v>

2869
02:05:25.421 --> 02:05:28.030
<v Speaker 2>about being alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's these other things that are</v>

2870
02:05:28.031 --> 02:05:30.400
<v Speaker 2>alive too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're nothing like us.</v>

2871
02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:33.950
<v Speaker 2>They are nothing like us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the outliers really.</v>

2872
02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2873
02:05:35.710 --> 02:05:38.380
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we're the ones who are separated</v>

2874
02:05:38.381 --> 02:05:40.900
<v Speaker 2>from them so completely that if we see</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

2875
02:05:40.901 --> 02:05:43.930
<v Speaker 2>it's like a bird sitting on a flag pole</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it's,</v>

2876
02:05:43.931 --> 02:05:45.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking coyote and your</v>

2877
02:05:45.701 --> 02:05:46.660
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2878
02:05:46.661 --> 02:05:48.010
<v Speaker 2>What's he doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2879
02:05:48.011 --> 02:05:49.330
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a dog,</v>

2880
02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:51.460
<v Speaker 2>which is like our friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2881
02:05:51.461 --> 02:05:53.110
<v Speaker 2>dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even count them as animals.</v>

2882
02:05:53.111 --> 02:05:55.510
<v Speaker 2>I know they're animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're our friends.</v>

2883
02:05:55.540 --> 02:05:58.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you have dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either they're dependent upon us for</v>

2884
02:05:58.451 --> 02:06:00.250
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're part of the family.</v>

2885
02:06:00.251 --> 02:06:04.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different deal than like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pet wolf or a pet bear or some shit.</v>

2886
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:07.520
<v Speaker 6>There's an episode where somebody's dog</v>
<v Speaker 6>plays family feud with them,</v>

2887
02:06:08.840 --> 02:06:10.480
<v Speaker 6>know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's A.</v>

2888
02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:13.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you what other animals going to do that?</v>

2889
02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:18.370
<v Speaker 2>I saw a dude online who had talked is he</v>
<v Speaker 2>trained his dog to get him a beer and he</v>

2890
02:06:19.101 --> 02:06:21.650
<v Speaker 2>put a t.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tied a towel to the door of the</v>

2891
02:06:21.651 --> 02:06:22.970
<v Speaker 2>refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd say,</v>

2892
02:06:22.971 --> 02:06:25.130
<v Speaker 2>go get me a beer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the dog would go there.</v>

2893
02:06:25.131 --> 02:06:27.200
<v Speaker 2>She would grab a hold of towel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull on it.</v>

2894
02:06:27.201 --> 02:06:30.200
<v Speaker 2>It would open up the door to the fridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should reach in,</v>

2895
02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:34.490
<v Speaker 2>grab a can of beer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>run over hand the can of beer to him.</v>

2896
02:06:34.491 --> 02:06:35.250
<v Speaker 2>He'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good now.</v>

2897
02:06:35.250 --> 02:06:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Go close the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she would go close the door.</v>

2898
02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:40.970
<v Speaker 2>She would go grab that towel and use it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to shut that door.</v>

2899
02:06:40.971 --> 02:06:42.500
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is insane.</v>

2900
02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:45.050
<v Speaker 2>That is a super trained animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2901
02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:47.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I never had a dog.</v>

2902
02:06:47.031 --> 02:06:49.280
<v Speaker 6>I knew we were talking last night at the</v>
<v Speaker 6>company or about your dog and you,</v>

2903
02:06:49.281 --> 02:06:49.861
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2904
02:06:49.861 --> 02:06:51.550
<v Speaker 6>you guys always seem to be super happy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2905
02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:53.460
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when y'all go running and everything</v>

2906
02:06:53.461 --> 02:06:54.370
<v Speaker 6>we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's cool.</v>

2907
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:55.540
<v Speaker 6>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2908
02:06:55.540 --> 02:06:57.370
<v Speaker 6>ever have any pets?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2909
02:06:57.371 --> 02:06:59.800
<v Speaker 6>I never had any pets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were grown up a lot of</v>

2910
02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:02.670
<v Speaker 6>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had scary dogs,</v>

2911
02:07:02.710 --> 02:07:05.200
<v Speaker 6>like they had loose dogs and our</v>
<v Speaker 6>neighborhoods like rottweilers,</v>

2912
02:07:06.250 --> 02:07:07.370
<v Speaker 6>Dobermans,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2913
02:07:07.390 --> 02:07:08.710
<v Speaker 6>so it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't.</v>

2914
02:07:08.711 --> 02:07:12.130
<v Speaker 6>Nobody had a pet like everybody had,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like there were two dogs that were like,</v>

2915
02:07:12.131 --> 02:07:12.964
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2916
02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:15.310
<v Speaker 6>you'd see him fucking and sometimes like</v>
<v Speaker 6>attack.</v>

2917
02:07:16.220 --> 02:07:18.160
<v Speaker 6>So it was kind of exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't like.</v>

2918
02:07:19.020 --> 02:07:22.660
<v Speaker 6>And then a lot of animals got hit by my</v>
<v Speaker 6>house by this highway by trucks and so</v>

2919
02:07:22.661 --> 02:07:24.790
<v Speaker 6>we'd go bury the animals sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>

2920
02:07:24.791 --> 02:07:26.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we'd go get the animal,</v>

2921
02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:28.180
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pull them right off this little highway</v>

2922
02:07:28.181 --> 02:07:29.560
<v Speaker 6>and Barium.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>

2923

<v Speaker 6>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I never had a pet,</v>

2924
02:07:31.661 --> 02:07:33.940
<v Speaker 6>but I would like to have one if I can</v>
<v Speaker 6>get a home one time,</v>

2925

<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're going to need somebody to watch</v>

<v Speaker 1>pick that up.</v>

2935
02:07:56.201 --> 02:07:58.620
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna have to pick that shit up,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But I remember them dog shit.</v>

2958
02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid that had a blend or</v>

2959
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:06.190
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood named Mario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2960
02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:08.140
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2961
02:09:08.350 --> 02:09:10.170
<v Speaker 1>and he was dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ended up dying actually.</v>

2962
02:09:10.170 --> 02:09:11.980
<v Speaker 1>He did some pills and drove into an</v>
<v Speaker 1>embankment,</v>

2963
02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:15.040
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was young he would shit in his</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's how I was allowed to be friends</v>

2966

<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did he make you bury it?</v>

2967
02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:24.730
<v Speaker 1>He just asked me to do it and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid not to do it.</v>

2968

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3004
02:10:44.091 --> 02:10:47.870
<v Speaker 1>it came to it because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know my brother probably wasn't around</v>

3005
02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:51.560
<v Speaker 1>and I wanted somebody to play with and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was older so I was hanging out and he</v>

3006

<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

3012
02:11:03.801 --> 02:11:05.990
<v Speaker 1>200 plus times.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The same color on the outside of design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inside of his.</v>

3019
02:11:16.671 --> 02:11:18.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you first found yourself,</v>

3020
02:11:18.590 --> 02:11:22.760
<v Speaker 1>do you remember the feeling that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>first found when you were digging a hole</v>

3021
02:11:22.761 --> 02:11:23.840
<v Speaker 1>for a dude?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

3024
02:11:27.081 --> 02:11:29.390
<v Speaker 1>What if he keeps asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I stop this?</v>

3025
02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:32.330
<v Speaker 1>How did you wind up stopping?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's maybe a better question.</v>

3026
02:11:32.900 --> 02:11:34.610
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how it kind of,</v>

3027
02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:35.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pat,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how it kind of tapered</v>

3030
02:11:40.671 --> 02:11:42.830
<v Speaker 1>off to his parents ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

02:11:47.190 --> 02:11:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you know that's what I think it was.</v>

3034
02:11:48.561 --> 02:11:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I think he was lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was serious and he shut outside</v>

3035
02:11:52.521 --> 02:11:55.430
<v Speaker 1>behind his slide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a slide in his yard because</v>

3036
02:11:55.431 --> 02:11:55.851
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3037
02:11:55.851 --> 02:11:59.990
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of money and he shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside behind the slot is a great word</v>

3038
02:11:59.991 --> 02:12:00.500
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

3039
02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:04.460
<v Speaker 1>And it was silty kind of soil and sand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember going over then I still</v>

3040
02:12:04.461 --> 02:12:06.470
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the shade of it</v>

3041
02:12:06.471 --> 02:12:07.710
<v Speaker 1>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it look like,</v>

3042
02:12:09.770 --> 02:12:12.620
<v Speaker 1>I would say like a tope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a little with a little more brown</v>

3043
02:12:12.650 --> 02:12:16.670
<v Speaker 1>and you can always find coyote shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it has like little berries in</v>

3044
02:12:16.671 --> 02:12:18.860
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times coyotes eat all kinds of</v>

3045
02:12:18.861 --> 02:12:19.610
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3046
02:12:19.610 --> 02:12:20.660

<v Speaker 1>Eat some berries.</v>

3047
02:12:20.661 --> 02:12:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'll see these logs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these little red berries in and I'm</v>

3048
02:12:23.631 --> 02:12:24.910
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

3049
02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always a dark brown to their shit's</v>

3050
02:12:28.121 --> 02:12:29.720
<v Speaker 1>super consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

3051
02:12:30.230 --> 02:12:32.800
<v Speaker 1>Goose has have fancy shit sometimes I</v>
<v Speaker 1>see him.</v>

3052
02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:34.970
<v Speaker 1>You mean disgusting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3053
02:12:34.971 --> 02:12:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I never liked it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems creatures.</v>

3054
02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a bait and switch by mother</v>

3055
02:12:40.581 --> 02:12:42.200
<v Speaker 1>nature because if you see a goose you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

3056
02:12:42.201 --> 02:12:43.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fun,</v>

3057
02:12:43.130 --> 02:12:46.040
<v Speaker 1>this can be exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll fucking choke out an</v>

3058
02:12:46.041 --> 02:12:46.820
<v Speaker 1>infant at a park.</v>

3059
02:12:46.820 --> 02:12:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean gooses are violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're violent,</v>

3060
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:51.050
<v Speaker 1>extremely violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

3061
02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:52.640
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fight impacts,</v>

3062
02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:58.800
<v Speaker 1>impacts where they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who had a house on a</v>

3063
02:12:59.361 --> 02:13:03.050
<v Speaker 1>lake and they had a wire all around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lake.</v>

3064
02:13:03.330 --> 02:13:05.630
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the wire for delegates to keep</v>

3065
02:13:05.631 --> 02:13:09.500
<v Speaker 1>the goose from going into the water?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want them to waddle and into</v>

3066
02:13:09.501 --> 02:13:11.090
<v Speaker 1>the water of the things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3067
02:13:11.091 --> 02:13:13.160
<v Speaker 1>is that electric?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of fence is that?</v>

3068
02:13:13.850 --> 02:13:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if it's electric.</v>

3069
02:13:16.521 --> 02:13:19.970
<v Speaker 1>It might give them a little shock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea was to try to keep the.</v>

3070
02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Because they shit all over their lawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shit all over near where the.</v>

3071
02:13:23.190 --> 02:13:26.660
<v Speaker 1>They had a pond in their yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looks like the ultimate,</v>

3072
02:13:26.830 --> 02:13:29.100
<v Speaker 1>like the Kid Marissa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like that kid Mario.</v>

3073
02:13:29.101 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 1>But a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bollinger you and have a pond in your</v>

3074
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:34.080
<v Speaker 2>yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you want to go fishing?</v>

3075
02:13:34.081 --> 02:13:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take five steps out of my</v>

3076
02:13:35.910 --> 02:13:37.630
<v Speaker 2>backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3077
02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:40.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is like the ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's it.</v>

3078
02:13:40.531 --> 02:13:43.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't think if you have a natural hill</v>
<v Speaker 2>in new yard kind of.</v>

3079
02:13:43.230 --> 02:13:46.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's that expensive to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get water would it?</v>

3080
02:13:46.210 --> 02:13:49.950
<v Speaker 2>And to get a pump put in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's that drastic man.</v>

3081
02:13:49.951 --> 02:13:52.590
<v Speaker 2>I would think that'd be a nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to make sure it</v>

3082
02:13:52.591 --> 02:13:54.450
<v Speaker 2>doesn't leak like you had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3083
02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:59.460
<v Speaker 2>what's going to keep the water there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a special kind of bottom,</v>

3084
02:13:59.550 --> 02:14:04.550
<v Speaker 2>like when you go to a natural lake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's the water is pulled up there</v>

3085
02:14:04.861 --> 02:14:07.320
<v Speaker 2>for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's an unusual ground.</v>

3086
02:14:07.321 --> 02:14:09.410
<v Speaker 2>You got to realize if you're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a natural leg,</v>

3087
02:14:09.411 --> 02:14:12.960
<v Speaker 2>unless it's a glacial lake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>waters decide to stay there.</v>

3088
02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the same amount of water's</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably landed everywhere,</v>

3089
02:14:16.770 --> 02:14:19.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's decided to stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what the hell is different between</v>

3090
02:14:19.741 --> 02:14:22.170
<v Speaker 2>that ground and all the other ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>around it.</v>

3091
02:14:22.350 --> 02:14:25.650
<v Speaker 2>So when you want to make a pond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just can't make a pond everywhere.</v>

3092
02:14:25.651 --> 02:14:28.200
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why there's not a pond</v>
<v Speaker 2>there because that's not the kind of</v>

3093
02:14:28.201 --> 02:14:30.960
<v Speaker 2>ground for a pond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they would have to put a liner in.</v>

3094
02:14:31.050 --> 02:14:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to teen mother.</v>

3095
02:14:31.970 --> 02:14:34.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like taming mother nature almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to do something.</v>

3096
02:14:34.771 --> 02:14:37.350
<v Speaker 2>You can't just pour water in there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to do something.</v>

3097
02:14:37.380 --> 02:14:39.270
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that they do in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of places,</v>

3098
02:14:39.271 --> 02:14:41.910
<v Speaker 2>they use this really thick Koi pond</v>
<v Speaker 2>liner.</v>

3099
02:14:41.911 --> 02:14:45.510
<v Speaker 2>It's basically a plastic liner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you got a bullshit ass fake pond is</v>

3100
02:14:45.511 --> 02:14:47.070
<v Speaker 2>what you got that's going to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty.</v>

3101
02:14:47.071 --> 02:14:48.810
<v Speaker 2>Go above ground pool.</v>

3102
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3103
02:14:49.590 --> 02:14:51.750
<v Speaker 2>basically the above ground pool of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ponds.</v>

3104
02:14:51.751 --> 02:14:53.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not even organized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3105
02:14:53.190 --> 02:14:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once they get the liner in place,</v>

3106
02:14:55.861 --> 02:15:00.450
<v Speaker 2>then they put surface levels of dirt and</v>
<v Speaker 2>rocks and stuff over the line or.</v>

3107
02:15:00.451 --> 02:15:04.440
<v Speaker 2>So it looks like a regular pond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is what's holding the</v>

3108
02:15:04.441 --> 02:15:08.760
<v Speaker 2>water in place in some places they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll use those Koi pond you ever</v>

3109
02:15:08.761 --> 02:15:09.594
<v Speaker 2>seen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what a coin.</v>

3110
02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:11.131
<v Speaker 2>It's big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

3111
02:15:11.131 --> 02:15:12.180
<v Speaker 2>At a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3112
02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:16.950
<v Speaker 2>They have very thick liner that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>used for the base of that Shit.</v>

3113
02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Used that stuff on float tanks to</v>
<v Speaker 2>flotation tanks.</v>

3114
02:15:22.651 --> 02:15:24.150
<v Speaker 2>We floated them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh Nah.</v>

3115
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've heard you talk about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

3116
02:15:27.050 --> 02:15:28.980
<v Speaker 2>The liner of those things is the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3117
02:15:28.981 --> 02:15:31.290
<v Speaker 2>It's Koi pond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a liner.</v>

3118
02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:33.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like a real thick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>durable,</v>

3119
02:15:33.031 --> 02:15:34.950
<v Speaker 2>tough plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it feel like you're alive when</v>

3120
02:15:34.951 --> 02:15:35.784
<v Speaker 2>you're in the tank?</v>

3121
02:15:36.450 --> 02:15:38.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like you're relaxing.</v>

3122
02:15:38.790 --> 02:15:39.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good feeling.</v>

3123
02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:42.510
<v Speaker 2>It feels good on your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just alleviates tension,</v>

3124
02:15:42.511 --> 02:15:45.030
<v Speaker 2>but it also feels like you're in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditative state.</v>

3125
02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:47.010
<v Speaker 2>You relax and you think about things</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

3126
02:15:47.011 --> 02:15:49.890
<v Speaker 2>There you get a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good thought of,</v>

3127
02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:51.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3128
02:15:51.010 --> 02:15:53.640
<v Speaker 2>how you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to look at things from an outside</v>

3129
02:15:53.670 --> 02:15:55.470
<v Speaker 2>looking in perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3130
02:15:55.950 --> 02:15:59.130
<v Speaker 2>You get a chance to be away from your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body really because you're not thinking</v>

3131
02:15:59.131 --> 02:16:00.600
<v Speaker 2>about your body just floating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3132
02:16:00.601 --> 02:16:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not feeling your body at all.</v>

3133
02:16:02.650 --> 02:16:05.070
<v Speaker 2>The water is the same temperature as</v>
<v Speaker 2>your skin,</v>

3134
02:16:05.071 --> 02:16:07.470
<v Speaker 2>so you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even tell where the water is</v>

3135
02:16:07.471 --> 02:16:09.780
<v Speaker 2>and where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where your body is.</v>

3136
02:16:09.781 --> 02:16:11.140
<v Speaker 2>So I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3137
02:16:11.141 --> 02:16:14.400
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like you're flying through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air and it's all dark and you don't</v>

3138
02:16:14.401 --> 02:16:16.290
<v Speaker 2>see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear anything because your</v>

3139
02:16:16.291 --> 02:16:17.124
<v Speaker 2>ears are underwater.</v>

3140
02:16:17.130 --> 02:16:19.350
<v Speaker 2>Does it feel dead?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like might be dead or not?</v>

3141
02:16:19.380 --> 02:16:20.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely not.</v>

3142
02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:23.910
<v Speaker 2>I like that he worried about the feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dead.</v>

3143
02:16:24.510 --> 02:16:26.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm just worried about how does the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fizz.</v>

3144
02:16:26.161 --> 02:16:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Any like does your brain keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3145
02:16:28.921 --> 02:16:30.700
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That keeps us going in our.</v>

3146
02:16:30.710 --> 02:16:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Like when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he like,</v>

3147
02:16:32.110 --> 02:16:34.780
<v Speaker 2>does our consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it just leave out of this shell and</v>

3148
02:16:34.781 --> 02:16:36.520
<v Speaker 2>then we're just part of this straight up</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

3149
02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:40.240
<v Speaker 2>I think part of the thing is when we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about consciousness,</v>

3150
02:16:40.241 --> 02:16:43.060
<v Speaker 2>we're thinking about language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're thinking about the way we talk</v>

3151
02:16:43.070 --> 02:16:46.030
<v Speaker 2>and think about a feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3152
02:16:46.090 --> 02:16:48.640
<v Speaker 2>because I think what we think of as</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

3153
02:16:49.210 --> 02:16:51.920
<v Speaker 2>when I think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when my own limited mind,</v>

3154
02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:55.630
<v Speaker 2>when I think of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of consciousness as me using</v>

3155
02:16:55.631 --> 02:16:58.570
<v Speaker 2>language to interpret how I feel about</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

3156
02:16:59.460 --> 02:17:04.460
<v Speaker 2>I have this a language touch to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if something happens when you</v>

3157
02:17:06.131 --> 02:17:10.660
<v Speaker 2>die in your soul goes to another place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say a soul as a real thing or</v>

3158
02:17:10.661 --> 02:17:11.770
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real thing.</v>

3159
02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:15.910
<v Speaker 2>I bet it goes there with no language and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet that's real similar.</v>

3160
02:17:15.911 --> 02:17:19.060
<v Speaker 2>I bet to what it feels like when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>really tripping,</v>

3161
02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:25.180
<v Speaker 2>when you're on some heavy psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just melt into the universe and</v>

3162
02:17:25.181 --> 02:17:27.520
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sort of ceased to exist on some of</v>

3163
02:17:27.521 --> 02:17:30.900
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like five Meo dmt been,</v>

3164
02:17:31.130 --> 02:17:34.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>melt into the center of the universe.</v>

3165
02:17:34.420 --> 02:17:38.350
<v Speaker 2>You feel like you don't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet death and that feels like you're</v>

3166
02:17:38.351 --> 02:17:39.184
<v Speaker 2>dying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

3167
02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:40.570
<v Speaker 2>That's a scary one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five.</v>

3168
02:17:40.571 --> 02:17:44.890
<v Speaker 2>MEO DMT is a universally disturbing one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lot of people have problem with that one</v>

3169
02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:46.510
<v Speaker 2>because it really does feel like you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying.</v>

3170
02:17:46.690 --> 02:17:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Can senior citizens do it or not?</v>

3171
02:17:48.430 --> 02:17:49.450
<v Speaker 2>I think they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3172
02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:51.550
<v Speaker 2>I think the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only problem would be if you had a</v>

3173
02:17:51.551 --> 02:17:55.600
<v Speaker 2>heart attack freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm think it's toxic because your body</v>

3174
02:17:55.601 --> 02:17:57.470
<v Speaker 2>makes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body knows what to do with it too.</v>

3175
02:17:57.471 --> 02:18:01.240
<v Speaker 2>You know your body knows how to bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>you back down to sobriety levels in like</v>

3176
02:18:01.241 --> 02:18:02.320
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes.</v>

3177
02:18:02.590 --> 02:18:04.570
<v Speaker 2>Do you know when you're going into those</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of,</v>

3178
02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:08.140
<v Speaker 2>when you're ill and some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you get a feeling that if you're a</v>

3179
02:18:08.141 --> 02:18:10.330
<v Speaker 2>good or bad person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you get.</v>

3180
02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Do you get like an ant that like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get a feeling if there's</v>

3181
02:18:14.771 --> 02:18:17.050
<v Speaker 2>things that are bothering you about your</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

3182
02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:19.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a.</v>

3183
02:18:19.870 --> 02:18:23.860
<v Speaker 2>If you have something that's that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>haunting you and maybe with a lot of</v>

3184
02:18:23.861 --> 02:18:26.950
<v Speaker 2>people it really comes down to life</v>
<v Speaker 2>choices,</v>

3185
02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:29.260
<v Speaker 2>not just in terms of like their</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

3186
02:18:29.261 --> 02:18:32.650
<v Speaker 2>but even like what they're doing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>for living and how they're living their</v>

3187
02:18:32.651 --> 02:18:35.650
<v Speaker 2>life and sometimes those experiences.</v>

3188
02:18:35.650 --> 02:18:38.920
<v Speaker 2>The psychedelic experiences can</v>
<v Speaker 2>highlight these things that are</v>

3189
02:18:38.921 --> 02:18:41.380
<v Speaker 2>bothering you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that you're suppressing and then you</v>

3190
02:18:41.381 --> 02:18:42.490
<v Speaker 2>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3191
02:18:42.491 --> 02:18:47.491
<v Speaker 2>this a suppressing of these feelings and</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts is actually making me lash out</v>

3192
02:18:47.561 --> 02:18:52.561
<v Speaker 2>in these other ways and I've got shitty</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior and aggressive in this way and</v>

3193
02:18:55.031 --> 02:18:58.000
<v Speaker 2>it's really because of this lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really because of.</v>

3194
02:18:58.180 --> 02:18:58.941
<v Speaker 2>And then you might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3195
02:18:58.941 --> 02:19:02.350
<v Speaker 2>might also come to realization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about something that happened when</v>

3196
02:19:02.351 --> 02:19:06.190
<v Speaker 2>you were a child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about feeling unprotected or</v>

3197
02:19:06.191 --> 02:19:09.670
<v Speaker 2>unloved as a child and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never developed properly,</v>

3198
02:19:09.671 --> 02:19:14.020
<v Speaker 2>so you never felt totally secure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you want to do something to make you</v>

3199
02:19:14.021 --> 02:19:16.360
<v Speaker 2>feel secure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's drinking or something.</v>

3200
02:19:16.570 --> 02:19:19.540
<v Speaker 2>And then you'll see that in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experience,</v>

3201
02:19:19.541 --> 02:19:21.250
<v Speaker 2>you'd be able to like see the root of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

3202
02:19:21.340 --> 02:19:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For a lot of people its cessation of um,</v>

3203
02:19:25.780 --> 02:19:27.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of smoking comes from that feeling like,</v>

3204
02:19:27.891 --> 02:19:30.110
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is killing myself because I hate</v>

3205
02:19:30.111 --> 02:19:30.590
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

3206
02:19:30.590 --> 02:19:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3207
02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:34.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm literally poisoning myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how could I not see this?</v>

3208
02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:36.740
<v Speaker 2>And then through having a mushroom</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

3209
02:19:36.741 --> 02:19:38.540
<v Speaker 2>they've just completely quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

3210
02:19:38.541 --> 02:19:40.190
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a real common one,</v>

3211
02:19:40.550 --> 02:19:42.350
<v Speaker 2>real common ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of other stuff that I</v>

3212
02:19:42.351 --> 02:19:47.270
<v Speaker 2>haven't done that also like Ibogaine is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big one for getting people off drugs.</v>

3213
02:19:47.271 --> 02:19:48.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard about that.</v>

3214
02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:52.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one that has an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>success rate,</v>

3215
02:19:52.850 --> 02:19:57.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's supposed to be really brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as far as like how you feel like</v>

3216
02:19:57.950 --> 02:19:59.840
<v Speaker 2>look it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it runs you through the ringer</v>

3217
02:19:59.841 --> 02:20:02.570
<v Speaker 2>psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you get through it it's worth</v>

3218
02:20:02.571 --> 02:20:04.460
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's 24 hours.</v>

3219
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And who do you have to go with by</v>

3220
02:20:06.351 --> 02:20:09.110
<v Speaker 2>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of clinics that do it,</v>

3221
02:20:09.111 --> 02:20:11.840
<v Speaker 2>particularly in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people go down to Mexico and go</v>

3222
02:20:11.841 --> 02:20:16.841
<v Speaker 2>to these clinics and their 24 hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinics of this Ibogaine experience.</v>

3223
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Jre field trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Hey man,</v>

3224
02:20:19.041 --> 02:20:22.420
<v Speaker 2>if you had a son and if you like Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my son is hooked on oxygen,</v>

3225
02:20:22.421 --> 02:20:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would 100 percent recommend you do</v>

3226
02:20:24.981 --> 02:20:25.670
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3227
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:27.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I know so many people that have</v>

3228
02:20:27.081 --> 02:20:31.040
<v Speaker 2>done it and it's helped them and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>rewires the way your brain connects to</v>

3229
02:20:31.041 --> 02:20:32.780
<v Speaker 2>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really fast.</v>

3230
02:20:32.781 --> 02:20:35.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a fascinating drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton Morris,</v>

3231
02:20:35.330 --> 02:20:40.160
<v Speaker 2>who is the host of vices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton's Pharmacopia.</v>

3232
02:20:40.161 --> 02:20:43.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a essentially a show that's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>just about drugs.</v>

3233
02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:48.170
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about it last week about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how fascinating it is and in low doses</v>

3234
02:20:48.171 --> 02:20:52.190
<v Speaker 2>that actually is like a nootropic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually enhances your consciousness</v>

3235
02:20:52.191 --> 02:20:55.720
<v Speaker 2>and low doses makes you smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3236
02:20:55.730 --> 02:20:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3237
02:20:56.350 --> 02:20:57.183
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3238
02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:58.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get into some of that kind of</v>

3239
02:20:58.611 --> 02:20:59.230
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

3240
02:20:59.230 --> 02:21:00.063
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3241
02:21:00.110 --> 02:21:01.640
<v Speaker 2>so right now I don't party or anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

3242
02:21:01.641 --> 02:21:02.630
<v Speaker 2>so I struggle with that.</v>

3243
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:03.463
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3244
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:04.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't,</v>

3245
02:21:05.770 --> 02:21:08.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tough because I do want to be able</v>

3246
02:21:08.211 --> 02:21:10.820
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do things that are beneficial for myself</v>

3247
02:21:11.090 --> 02:21:12.590
<v Speaker 2>and things that I didn't have a problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

3248
02:21:12.591 --> 02:21:14.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard just hard to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>

3249
02:21:14.350 --> 02:21:15.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to stay sober.</v>

3250
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:16.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3251
02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:17.091
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3252
02:21:17.091 --> 02:21:22.091
<v Speaker 2>sobriety is a worthwhile goal and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can go from being a person who's doing a</v>

3253
02:21:23.781 --> 02:21:27.320
<v Speaker 2>lot of drugs and ruining their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person who is like yourself that's</v>

3254
02:21:27.321 --> 02:21:29.780
<v Speaker 2>on a great path and you're sober and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're disciplined,</v>

3255
02:21:30.140 --> 02:21:34.100
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't want to break that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to have that bad feeling.</v>

3256
02:21:34.560 --> 02:21:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's ways that you can achieve</v>

3257
02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:38.660
<v Speaker 2>certain psychedelic states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3258
02:21:38.690 --> 02:21:41.630
<v Speaker 2>without any drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the big ones is yoga and</v>

3259
02:21:41.631 --> 02:21:43.490
<v Speaker 2>meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are two big ones.</v>

3260
02:21:43.530 --> 02:21:44.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3261
02:21:44.930 --> 02:21:48.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't do the kind of yoga that gives</v>
<v Speaker 2>you a psychedelic experience.</v>

3262
02:21:48.530 --> 02:21:52.790
<v Speaker 2>I think mostly that's Kundalini Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the kind of yoga that I do,</v>

3263
02:21:52.791 --> 02:21:54.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that beaker from hot yoga shit,</v>

3264
02:21:54.711 --> 02:21:57.740
<v Speaker 2>it's just this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this what it does to your body and</v>

3265
02:21:57.741 --> 02:22:01.460
<v Speaker 2>chills you out afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it has a pretty profound effect</v>

3266
02:22:01.461 --> 02:22:05.990
<v Speaker 2>on the way the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you experience the world after</v>

3267
02:22:05.991 --> 02:22:08.180
<v Speaker 2>the classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's something that people</v>

3268
02:22:08.181 --> 02:22:13.181
<v Speaker 2>don't take into consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one way in which you can change the</v>

3269
02:22:13.701 --> 02:22:17.630
<v Speaker 2>world around you is to change how you</v>
<v Speaker 2>interface with the world and how you</v>

3270
02:22:17.631 --> 02:22:19.970
<v Speaker 2>experience the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you viewing it?</v>

3271
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:23.570
<v Speaker 2>What is your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your behavior of a flavored by?</v>

3272
02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Is your behavior motivated by</v>
<v Speaker 2>frustration and weirdness and insecurity</v>

3273
02:22:28.831 --> 02:22:33.831
<v Speaker 2>and anger or is your behavior motivated</v>
<v Speaker 2>by love and confidence and happiness and</v>

3274
02:22:35.521 --> 02:22:39.240
<v Speaker 2>are you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you quenched physically?</v>

3275
02:22:39.241 --> 02:22:44.200
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel good physically and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do and if you've experienced like a</v>

3276
02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:47.700
<v Speaker 2>strong yoga class and then you run into</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

3277
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:50.370
<v Speaker 2>you might be more relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more compassionate,</v>

3278
02:22:50.430 --> 02:22:52.380
<v Speaker 2>more easily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that'll change the way that</v>

3279
02:22:52.381 --> 02:22:53.310
<v Speaker 2>person thinks about you.</v>

3280
02:22:53.310 --> 02:22:55.080
<v Speaker 2>That'll change your interaction with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in the future.</v>

3281
02:22:55.081 --> 02:22:59.310
<v Speaker 2>That might change your whole life and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you continue to act that way and you</v>

3282
02:22:59.311 --> 02:23:03.360
<v Speaker 2>continue to look at the world through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the eyes of this very particular</v>

3283
02:23:03.361 --> 02:23:04.830
<v Speaker 2>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really good for your body.</v>

3284
02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:07.590
<v Speaker 2>It really can change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People change a lot of people.</v>

3285
02:23:07.591 --> 02:23:10.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a definite butterfly</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect from that.</v>

3286
02:23:10.510 --> 02:23:12.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you want to just do something for</v>

3287
02:23:12.541 --> 02:23:13.590
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just meditate.</v>

3288
02:23:13.591 --> 02:23:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Men Learn how to meditate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3289
02:23:15.371 --> 02:23:17.190
<v Speaker 2>I just got a new meditation chair</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually yesterday,</v>

3290
02:23:17.191 --> 02:23:19.860
<v Speaker 2>so I might have to start getting maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting into it too.</v>

3291
02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:20.551
<v Speaker 2>Why not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

3292
02:23:20.551 --> 02:23:22.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were interested in doing drugs</v>

3293
02:23:22.351 --> 02:23:24.210
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not just be interested in doing</v>

3294
02:23:24.211 --> 02:23:27.500
<v Speaker 2>something that you know you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely do and it's not going to fuck</v>

3295
02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:31.860
<v Speaker 2>you up and it's only gonna help you</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were,</v>

3296
02:23:31.861 --> 02:23:33.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were partying,</v>

3297
02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:36.390
<v Speaker 2>what was your thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just doing cocaine by myself at the</v>

3298
02:23:36.391 --> 02:23:37.080
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3299
02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all cocaine.</v>

3300
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:40.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about Bu's?</v>

3301

<v Speaker 2>The Bu's bother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3302
02:23:41.371 --> 02:23:43.330
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't have a drink because I'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>be afraid that I would buy.</v>

3303
02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:46.530
<v Speaker 2>I would buy a coke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you got drunk then it would loosen</v>

3304
02:23:46.531 --> 02:23:49.500
<v Speaker 2>your inhibitions and you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the coke with the fucking coke?</v>

3305
02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:50.453
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>So here's what happened.</v>

3308
02:23:55.550 --> 02:23:57.100
<v Speaker 6>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3309
02:23:57.101 --> 02:23:58.790
<v Speaker 6>I would get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would do some cocaine at thousand,</v>

3310
02:23:58.791 --> 02:24:00.140
<v Speaker 6>put on these different vests.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I many.</v>

3311
02:24:00.141 --> 02:24:02.660
<v Speaker 6>Did you buy it again?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3312
02:24:02.661 --> 02:24:05.570
<v Speaker 6>I spent too much on them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I would probably say</v>

3313
02:24:07.170 --> 02:24:10.220
<v Speaker 6>the priciest one I had was probably</v>
<v Speaker 6>about $210.</v>

3314
02:24:10.390 --> 02:24:11.010
<v Speaker 6>Nine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Damn.</v>

3315
02:24:11.010 --> 02:24:14.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so I would get fucked up and put</v>

3316
02:24:14.241 --> 02:24:16.940
<v Speaker 6>these vests on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And put on sunglasses and not know like</v>

3317
02:24:16.941 --> 02:24:19.280
<v Speaker 6>Buffalo Bill Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but at least party and by myself,</v>

3318
02:24:19.310 --> 02:24:21.620
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and one time I was making a smoothie,</v>

3319
02:24:21.621 --> 02:24:22.311
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I,</v>

3320
02:24:22.311 --> 02:24:23.144
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have,</v>

3321
02:24:23.380 --> 02:24:25.340
<v Speaker 6>I got like a new unknown what kind of</v>
<v Speaker 6>blender it is,</v>

3322
02:24:25.341 --> 02:24:28.790
<v Speaker 6>but it's pretty nice and I was making</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a nice smoothie and I'm fucking</v>

3323
02:24:28.791 --> 02:24:33.050
<v Speaker 6>coked up on party and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>living high on the hog to vests on</v>

3324
02:24:33.051 --> 02:24:33.320
<v Speaker 6>maybe.</v>

3325
02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:34.160
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I thought,</v>

3326
02:24:34.750 --> 02:24:36.710
<v Speaker 6>I thought I heard something outside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3327
02:24:36.711 --> 02:24:40.100
<v Speaker 6>Which is kind of weird to even think of</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you have a blender going.</v>

3328
02:24:40.101 --> 02:24:42.170
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'll leave out of my apartment to go</v>

3329
02:24:42.171 --> 02:24:45.740
<v Speaker 6>in the hallway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>lock myself out with the blender going</v>

3330
02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:49.640
<v Speaker 6>in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>coked up out of my brain.</v>

3331
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:55.070
<v Speaker 6>Now I have to go to my landlord dude who</v>
<v Speaker 6>lives right down the hall and tell him</v>

3332
02:24:56.091 --> 02:24:57.110
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>

3333
02:24:58.190 --> 02:25:00.270
<v Speaker 6>I got logged out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Blenders on.</v>

3334
02:25:01.310 --> 02:25:02.990
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he must have hated you.</v>

<v Speaker 6>what's going on?</v>

3339
02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:18.410
<v Speaker 6>And I didn't know what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I told him that I was throwing a late</v>

3340
02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:19.820
<v Speaker 6>Christmas party.</v>

<v Speaker 6>it's on [inaudible] that show that he</v>
<v Speaker 6>had.</v>

<v Speaker 6>This is not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3362
02:26:24.860 --> 02:26:26.100
<v Speaker 6>and I ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3363
02:26:26.510 --> 02:26:31.400
<v Speaker 6>doing coke all night driving a taxi.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was in a taxi driver.</v>

3364
02:26:31.490 --> 02:26:32.600
<v Speaker 6>This dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Luigi</v>

3365
02:26:34.250 --> 02:26:37.040
<v Speaker 6>got me an escort,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't want to escort.</v>

3366
02:26:37.041 --> 02:26:41.010
<v Speaker 6>We're doing cocaine and like Harlem or</v>
<v Speaker 6>something North Harlem and the cab</v>

3367
02:26:41.011 --> 02:26:44.510
<v Speaker 6>driver doing coke and I just had,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was taking a cab from a party to my</v>

3368
02:26:44.511 --> 02:26:47.900
<v Speaker 6>hotel and so we end up off on this other</v>
<v Speaker 6>excursion.</v>

3369
02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:49.970
<v Speaker 6>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm driving the taxi,</v>

3370
02:26:49.971 --> 02:26:53.570
<v Speaker 6>he's in the back with the hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's 5:30 in the morning and I got to be</v>

3371
02:26:53.571 --> 02:26:56.720
<v Speaker 6>on the radio station at 6:30 or</v>
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

3372
02:26:57.050 --> 02:26:59.240
<v Speaker 6>So I get to the radio and I can't even</v>
<v Speaker 6>talk.</v>

3373
02:26:59.780 --> 02:27:03.260
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and darryl strawberry's the other guest,</v>

3374
02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:06.590
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who the baseball player who also had</v>

3375
02:27:06.591 --> 02:27:09.620
<v Speaker 6>drug problem,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's like 13 years sober.</v>

3376
02:27:09.621 --> 02:27:11.570
<v Speaker 6>And so it was this weird moment where</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3377
02:27:11.930 --> 02:27:14.840
<v Speaker 6>I thought I was kind of cool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then here's a man who like,</v>

3378
02:27:15.230 --> 02:27:16.820
<v Speaker 6>I'd always in my head maybe somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 6>thought,</v>

3379
02:27:16.821 --> 02:27:19.280
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that caused like a cokehead within here</v>

<v Speaker 6>put together successful.</v>

3381
02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:24.140
<v Speaker 6>And here I am,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't even talk.</v>

3382
02:27:24.410 --> 02:27:26.640
<v Speaker 6>And I'm with two men that I admire.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3383
02:27:26.970 --> 02:27:28.010
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>opie and Jim Norton.</v>

3384
02:27:28.011 --> 02:27:29.690
<v Speaker 6>Just to be honored and to be on the</v>
<v Speaker 6>show,</v>

3385
02:27:29.691 --> 02:27:30.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so I was like,</v>

3386
02:27:30.711 --> 02:27:31.700
<v Speaker 6>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

3387
02:27:32.300 --> 02:27:34.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm not making choices.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's some,</v>

3388
02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:35.930
<v Speaker 6>there's some unevenness here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

3389
02:27:36.190 --> 02:27:38.480
<v Speaker 6>So what did you do after the 2012 step</v>
<v Speaker 6>programs?</v>

3390
02:27:38.481 --> 02:27:39.800
<v Speaker 6>One 12 step program.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3391
02:27:40.430 --> 02:27:42.740
<v Speaker 6>And then so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I've been in that.</v>

3392
02:27:42.741 --> 02:27:44.060
<v Speaker 6>Then since then it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's helped me out,</v>

3393
02:27:44.090 --> 02:27:45.260
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3394
02:27:45.710 --> 02:27:48.080
<v Speaker 6>I would definitely say don't do coke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3395
02:27:48.140 --> 02:27:51.380
<v Speaker 6>The problem with drugs is they're all</v>
<v Speaker 6>under the same blanket.</v>

3396
02:27:51.410 --> 02:27:53.600
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know when someone says drugs,</v>

3397
02:27:53.601 --> 02:27:57.260
<v Speaker 6>you think of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you think of pills,</v>

3398
02:27:57.261 --> 02:27:59.840
<v Speaker 6>you think of smoking it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you think of coke,</v>

3399
02:27:59.841 --> 02:28:02.450
<v Speaker 6>you think a pot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you think of mushrooms.</v>

3400
02:28:02.510 --> 02:28:03.680
<v Speaker 6>Think of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3401
02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:06.470
<v Speaker 6>But obviously they're not all the same</v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

3402
02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:09.020
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's weird to call them all drugs.</v>

3403
02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:11.270
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They affect you very differently.</v>

3404
02:28:11.450 --> 02:28:14.390
<v Speaker 6>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think if you did mushrooms you</v>

3405
02:28:14.391 --> 02:28:17.360
<v Speaker 6>would all of a sudden be doing blow and</v>
<v Speaker 6>know.</v>

3406
02:28:17.390 --> 02:28:19.130
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so either from Luigi cab</v>

3407
02:28:19.131 --> 02:28:19.964
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3408
02:28:19.970 --> 02:28:23.330
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so either so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think I wouldn't want to be the</v>

3409
02:28:23.331 --> 02:28:26.330
<v Speaker 6>guy that told you to do now I don't feel</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you are,</v>

3410
02:28:26.690 --> 02:28:27.231
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3411
02:28:27.231 --> 02:28:31.370
<v Speaker 6>I feel like it's something that I think</v>
<v Speaker 6>about sometimes and um,</v>

3412
02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.841
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3413
02:28:32.841 --> 02:28:35.750
<v Speaker 6>I don't know because I also do want to</v>
<v Speaker 6>have experiences where like I'm able to</v>

3414
02:28:35.751 --> 02:28:36.650
<v Speaker 6>get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3415
02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:39.980
<v Speaker 6>unique experiences out of my car,</v>
<v Speaker 6>out of my mind and think about other</v>

3416
02:28:39.981 --> 02:28:41.600
<v Speaker 6>stuff and like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3417
02:28:41.601 --> 02:28:44.190
<v Speaker 6>I do remember times where mushrooms</v>
<v Speaker 6>would just clear my conscience.</v>

3418
02:28:44.190 --> 02:28:46.130
<v Speaker 6>They would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone came up to the chalkboard where</v>

3419
02:28:46.131 --> 02:28:48.810
<v Speaker 6>everybody written all these math</v>
<v Speaker 6>problems and bullshit and somebody's</v>

3420
02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:51.500
<v Speaker 6>drawn a dick and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody fucking cutting off somebodies</v>

3421
02:28:51.501 --> 02:28:53.780
<v Speaker 6>head,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just stupid shit and just cleaned it all</v>

3422
02:28:53.781 --> 02:28:54.501

<v Speaker 2>mushrooms and Jesus are always kind of</v>

3428
02:29:08.431 --> 02:29:13.431
<v Speaker 2>connected in folklore and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's ideas because they're both very</v>

<v Speaker 2>forgiving.</v>

<v Speaker 2>naked.</v>

3433
02:29:26.641 --> 02:29:28.170
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard of that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real man?</v>

3434
02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lived in Liberia and he's a famous</v>

3435
02:29:31.681 --> 02:29:35.460
<v Speaker 2>character in Liberia because of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>exploits.</v>

3436
02:29:35.610 --> 02:29:38.580
<v Speaker 2>When he was in the middle of war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>

3437
02:29:38.581 --> 02:29:42.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would go and fight naked.</v>

3438
02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was a cannibal.</v>

3439
02:29:44.191 --> 02:29:48.720
<v Speaker 2>He would kill innocent children on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other side in eat pieces of their heart.</v>

3440
02:29:49.170 --> 02:29:51.570
<v Speaker 2>And he believed that it would protect</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in battle and talks about it</v>

3441
02:29:51.571 --> 02:29:52.404
<v Speaker 2>openly.</v>

3442
02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:57.000
<v Speaker 2>After doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he found Jesus and he came over here.</v>

3443
02:29:57.780 --> 02:30:00.840
<v Speaker 2>He is this him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have actual photos?</v>

3444
02:30:01.350 --> 02:30:03.000
<v Speaker 2>Photos of him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know either.</v>

3445
02:30:04.050 --> 02:30:06.270
<v Speaker 2>So then he became he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3446
02:30:06.271 --> 02:30:08.120
<v Speaker 2>he's killed thousands of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3447
02:30:08.121 --> 02:30:10.080
<v Speaker 2>he's apparently in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in war.</v>

3448
02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:15.800
<v Speaker 2>And then according to what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then afterwards became a preacher</v>

3449
02:30:17.130 --> 02:30:21.390
<v Speaker 2>and talks openly about the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's killed innocent children and eating</v>

3450
02:30:21.391 --> 02:30:26.130
<v Speaker 2>pieces of their heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people forgive him because he's a</v>

3451
02:30:26.131 --> 02:30:31.131
<v Speaker 2>preacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his love of Jesus is so complete that</v>

3452
02:30:31.741 --> 02:30:33.450
<v Speaker 2>people forgive him to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>

3453
02:30:33.451 --> 02:30:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Forgive the fact that he ate kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3464
02:31:05.970 --> 02:31:10.970
<v Speaker 2>really eye opening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of a view into what Liberia is</v>

<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Light.</v>

<v Speaker 2>really poor,</v>

3467
02:31:15.211 --> 02:31:20.211
<v Speaker 2>dangerous part of Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was originally when slaves</v>

3468
02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:22.440
<v Speaker 1>left America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were set free,</v>

3469
02:31:22.441 --> 02:31:25.020
<v Speaker 1>they went back to Liberia and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they settled.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like that's from some spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what language is that?</v>

3539
02:34:24.540 --> 02:34:25.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

3540
02:34:25.470 --> 02:34:28.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready for it all man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Language was a Japanese.</v>

3541
02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That looks like it should be on.</v>

3542
02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

3543
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:36.590
<v Speaker 1>don't go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Translate it.</v>

3544
02:34:37.050 --> 02:34:38.950
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The language looks.</v>

3545
02:34:38.951 --> 02:34:41.260
<v Speaker 1>It does look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's from space.</v>

3546
02:34:42.070 --> 02:34:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Like if you saw that on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know anything about Asian</v>

3547
02:34:45.251 --> 02:34:47.580
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you saw that on a spaceship?</v>

3548
02:34:47.581 --> 02:34:48.550
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3549
02:34:48.610 --> 02:34:51.550
<v Speaker 1>do you think Japanese people could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>from space and not know that they are</v>

3550
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:54.700
<v Speaker 1>the people that are really into</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

3551
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm like the Zacharias situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about all that shit?</v>

3552
02:35:00.510 --> 02:35:05.510
<v Speaker 1>There's people that believe that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a planet that's out far outside of</v>

3553
02:35:06.251 --> 02:35:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Pluto that comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an on an elliptical orbit and it</v>

3554
02:35:10.841 --> 02:35:13.420
<v Speaker 1>comes near Earth every like 3000 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

3555
02:35:13.421 --> 02:35:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I forget the exact number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's called Nibiru and on the bureau</v>

3556
02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:22.090
<v Speaker 1>there are these people called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and what they are is an</v>

3557
02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:27.120
<v Speaker 1>alien race and that this alien race</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineered us and they took,</v>

3558
02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:34.750
<v Speaker 1>they took these old monkeys like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient hominids and then they added</v>

3559
02:35:34.751 --> 02:35:37.180
<v Speaker 1>their DNA to him and created a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

3560
02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:39.990
<v Speaker 1>This is the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the guys,</v>

3561
02:35:40.100 --> 02:35:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Zechariah wrote all these books on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and there's a lot of people that</v>

3562
02:35:44.911 --> 02:35:46.390
<v Speaker 1>think he's full of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting.</v>

3563
02:35:46.410 --> 02:35:48.220
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to.</v>

3564
02:35:48.610 --> 02:35:50.340
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to speculate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3565
02:35:50.410 --> 02:35:54.970
<v Speaker 1>but the idea was that different groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people got different level of alien.</v>

3566
02:35:55.300 --> 02:35:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3567
02:35:56.950 --> 02:35:58.180
<v Speaker 1>I could get will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3568
02:35:58.181 --> 02:36:00.010
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'm talking to somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3569
02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:02.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this dude's like a full</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

3570
02:36:02.111 --> 02:36:04.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3571
02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:05.473
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

3572
02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:08.700
<v Speaker 1>who do we know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell mom.</v>

3573
02:36:09.220 --> 02:36:10.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's anybody that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

3574
02:36:12.220 --> 02:36:13.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh Martin,</v>

3575
02:36:13.300 --> 02:36:15.550
<v Speaker 1>that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it takes me for a ride,</v>

3576
02:36:15.551 --> 02:36:18.850
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know it be an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if there was one just living</v>

3577
02:36:18.851 --> 02:36:20.170
<v Speaker 1>amongst us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3578
02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:23.500
<v Speaker 1>the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just getting our chain yanked.</v>

3579
02:36:24.390 --> 02:36:25.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

3580
02:36:25.001 --> 02:36:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's some chick out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucked an alien.</v>

3581
02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:33.790
<v Speaker 1>I think when I really think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that would be the first</v>

3582
02:36:34.150 --> 02:36:36.400
<v Speaker 1>inbreeding would be a chick would let an</v>
<v Speaker 1>alien fucker.</v>

3583
02:36:36.401 --> 02:36:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be a dude who fucked an alien</v>

3584
02:36:38.171 --> 02:36:40.720

<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

3585

3588
02:36:47.051 --> 02:36:51.910

3606
02:37:35.570 --> 02:37:40.570
<v Speaker 1>that movie where they escaped from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental health facility and Michael</v>

3607
02:37:41.901 --> 02:37:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Keaton's in it and it's like four dudes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go to a baseball game.</v>

3609
02:37:48.540 --> 02:37:51.230

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3612
02:37:54.021 --> 02:37:56.180

<v Speaker 1>people will be upset.</v>

3613
02:37:56.300 --> 02:38:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always dudes in movies would</v>

3614
02:38:00.801 --> 02:38:05.801
<v Speaker 1>play those guys that would play someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart who is mentally challenged.</v>

3615
02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a common thing dudes would</v>

3616
02:38:09.621 --> 02:38:11.240
<v Speaker 1>always do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't Sean Penn play?</v>

3617
02:38:11.241 --> 02:38:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Someone challenged?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3621
02:38:21.620 --> 02:38:23.210

<v Speaker 1>Dustin Hoffman was probably the first</v>

3622
02:38:23.211 --> 02:38:27.260
<v Speaker 1>guy to play a super autistic man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did great.</v>

3623
02:38:27.261 --> 02:38:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Rosie O'donnell did it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>enemies finding out</v>

3629
02:38:44.961 --> 02:38:47.930
<v Speaker 1>have a real person with the disease on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the side of the stage.</v>

<v Speaker 1>do that without having somebody there to</v>

3635
02:39:01.461 --> 02:39:03.350
<v Speaker 1>verify if it's legit or not.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering if you could do that movie</v>

3654
02:39:42.471 --> 02:39:45.230
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might not be able to do it like 12</v>

3655
02:39:45.231 --> 02:39:47.660
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's a different world,</v>

3656
02:39:47.661 --> 02:39:50.000
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely was a different world,</v>

3657
02:39:50.001 --> 02:39:51.860
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even barely breathe out there.</v>

3658
02:39:51.870 --> 02:39:53.060
<v Speaker 1>They know it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3659
02:39:53.210 --> 02:39:55.510
<v Speaker 1>But dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I'm going to China and</v>

3660
02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:58.190
<v Speaker 1>they're wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do anything.</v>

3661
02:39:58.490 --> 02:40:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Can you do anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as like comedy material trouble.</v>

3662
02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just think of all the different</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff they have.</v>

3663
02:40:04.281 --> 02:40:05.960
<v Speaker 1>The animals are treated differently</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3664
02:40:05.990 --> 02:40:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

3665
02:40:06.670 --> 02:40:07.491
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3666
02:40:07.491 --> 02:40:11.480
<v Speaker 1>But I think you get in trouble if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>google certain websites,</v>

3667
02:40:11.510 --> 02:40:13.630
<v Speaker 1>like they have a different version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their.</v>

3668
02:40:13.790 --> 02:40:15.780
<v Speaker 1>They're censored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3669
02:40:15.870 --> 02:40:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna do anything drastic like</v>

3670
02:40:17.461 --> 02:40:18.510
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Crazy.</v>

3671
02:40:18.511 --> 02:40:22.260
<v Speaker 1>You get sensor a billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the hell did you do that?</v>

3672
02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:24.540
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

3673
02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I remember going when I was a student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went to Cuba when I was a student in</v>

3674
02:40:27.601 --> 02:40:30.660
<v Speaker 1>college right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember we went to a bookstore and</v>

3675
02:40:30.661 --> 02:40:34.320
<v Speaker 1>all the books just started at like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain year and that was it.</v>

3676
02:40:34.660 --> 02:40:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Like there was no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that,</v>

3677
02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:42.320
<v Speaker 1>and it was like in the 19 whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Castro took over [inaudible].</v>

3678
02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:45.630
<v Speaker 1>This is going on today in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>World Cup,</v>

3679
02:40:45.631 --> 02:40:46.900
<v Speaker 1>kiss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spark,</v>

3680
02:40:46.901 --> 02:40:49.800
<v Speaker 1>social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate on sexual harassment in China.</v>

3681
02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Why a male reporter in these two Russian</v>
<v Speaker 1>fans gave him a kiss while he was</v>

3682
02:40:56.191 --> 02:41:00.990
<v Speaker 1>recuperating and it's caused like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse sexual harassment debate and</v>

3683
02:41:00.991 --> 02:41:02.130
<v Speaker 1>transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal.</v>

3684
02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks so.</v>

3685
02:41:03.121 --> 02:41:07.620
<v Speaker 1>What's a big deal that in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like you're not allowed to show</v>

3686
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:10.140
<v Speaker 1>public affection like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what the big debate is?</v>

3687
02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It came after a bunch of female</v>

3688
02:41:12.601 --> 02:41:16.470
<v Speaker 1>journalists have been assaulted and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started assaulting the dude the</v>

3689
02:41:16.471 --> 02:41:17.304
<v Speaker 1>other way around.</v>

3690
02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go out on a limb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be okay.</v>

3691
02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:24.450
<v Speaker 1>He looks fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks actually better than kissed on</v>

3692
02:41:24.451 --> 02:41:27.540
<v Speaker 1>the cheek by attractive women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not hurting them.</v>

3693
02:41:27.541 --> 02:41:29.460
<v Speaker 1>They can't rape him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going to be okay.</v>

3694
02:41:29.610 --> 02:41:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Let's watch on boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get mauled by these hot Russian broads</v>

3695

3697
02:41:36.540 --> 02:41:38.760
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

3698
02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:40.380
<v Speaker 1>He's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's laughing.</v>

3699
02:41:40.530 --> 02:41:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're done.</v>

3700
02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:44.010
<v Speaker 1>He's laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're done.</v>

3701
02:41:44.011 --> 02:41:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Stop this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are fucking crazy.</v>

3702
02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:48.870
<v Speaker 1>The guys laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought it was cute.</v>

3703
02:41:49.380 --> 02:41:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would anybody make a deal out of</v>

3704
02:41:51.211 --> 02:41:52.770
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a zero tolerance.</v>

3705
02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:57.480
<v Speaker 1>That girl literally had a plastic Red</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cup in her hand,</v>

3706
02:41:57.630 --> 02:42:00.810
<v Speaker 1>which is the universal sign for being</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up in public.</v>

3707
02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Have you got that Plastic Red Cup in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hand?</v>

3708
02:42:04.230 --> 02:42:06.760
<v Speaker 1>That chick's probably lit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She kissed that guy.</v>

3709
02:42:06.761 --> 02:42:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was cute.</v>

3710
02:42:08.370 --> 02:42:11.610
<v Speaker 1>They didn't move them around or push</v>
<v Speaker 1>them or assault him.</v>

3711
02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:14.490
<v Speaker 1>It was a friendly gesture on the cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This love.</v>

3712
02:42:14.491 --> 02:42:17.580
<v Speaker 1>I think while we trying to shut down</v>
<v Speaker 1>people enjoying each other,</v>

3713
02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we are anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3714
02:42:19.321 --> 02:42:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I think things are actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think things are getting in a lot better</v>

3715
02:42:21.961 --> 02:42:24.090
<v Speaker 1>place in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just on in the media.</v>

3716
02:42:24.091 --> 02:42:26.590
<v Speaker 1>It seems like they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you know well that,</v>

3717
02:42:26.591 --> 02:42:30.240
<v Speaker 1>that that seemed like the not the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone's making a big deal out of</v>

3718
02:42:30.241 --> 02:42:31.110
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

3719
02:42:31.230 --> 02:42:33.930
<v Speaker 1>You can't look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't compare that to a bunch of</v>

3720
02:42:33.931 --> 02:42:36.180
<v Speaker 1>guys doing that to a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same.</v>

3721
02:42:36.450 --> 02:42:38.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy's going to be fine.</v>

3722
02:42:39.150 --> 02:42:41.160
<v Speaker 1>It is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men and women are different.</v>

3723
02:42:41.161 --> 02:42:44.670
<v Speaker 1>In that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a very clear cut case of no one</v>

3724
02:42:44.671 --> 02:42:47.790
<v Speaker 1>got hurt there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they interrupt his broadcast?</v>

3725
02:42:47.910 --> 02:42:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they ruin what he was trying to say</v>

3726
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:51.840
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what.</v>

3727
02:42:51.860 --> 02:42:55.680
<v Speaker 1>He might have had a serious message and</v>
<v Speaker 1>these taught Russian broads come over</v>

3728
02:42:55.681 --> 02:42:59.070
<v Speaker 1>and kiss him on the cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they fucked up his little project</v>

3729
02:42:59.071 --> 02:43:03.360
<v Speaker 1>and what he's trying to accomplish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no crime there.</v>

3730
02:43:03.361 --> 02:43:05.820
<v Speaker 1>That's not a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same.</v>

3731
02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:08.130
<v Speaker 1>If there was a bunch of dudes doing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a pretty girl,</v>

3732
02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:10.860
<v Speaker 1>some gorilla looking fucking football</v>
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>

3733
02:43:11.230 --> 02:43:14.310
<v Speaker 1>fucking corn fed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iowa boys came over and kissed her and</v>

3734
02:43:14.311 --> 02:43:15.144
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

3735
02:43:15.910 --> 02:43:18.370
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember when they were trying to</v>

3736
02:43:18.371 --> 02:43:22.000
<v Speaker 1>make it a big deal because Katy Perry</v>
<v Speaker 1>kiss some guy on American idol.</v>

3737
02:43:22.270 --> 02:43:23.051
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>she kissed him.</v>

3739
02:43:25.310 --> 02:43:28.240

<v Speaker 1>She kissed him.</v>

3740
02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:29.890
<v Speaker 1>She brought him over and kissed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was like,</v>

3741
02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:32.620
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what if worth Katy Perry was a man</v>

3742
02:43:32.950 --> 02:43:34.310
<v Speaker 1>that was a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's</v>

3743
02:43:35.830 --> 02:43:38.500
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's Katy Perry,</v>

3744
02:43:38.770 --> 02:43:41.050
<v Speaker 1>and if that guy is really complained</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Carrie,</v>

<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No one's going to love you.</v>

3747
02:43:47.591 --> 02:43:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't appreciate Katy Perry</v>

3748

<v Speaker 1>kissing you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She was pretty and more people will love</v>

3750
02:43:55.361 --> 02:44:00.361
<v Speaker 1>that man because Katy Perry kissed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idol contestant shuts down Katy Perry.</v>

3751
02:44:02.130 --> 02:44:06.310
<v Speaker 1>He shut down the Katy Perry backlash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kissed her to listen.</v>

3752
02:44:06.311 --> 02:44:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at,</v>

3753
02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:09.960
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3754
02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:13.330
<v Speaker 1>look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could be from Idaho pushing him and</v>

3755
02:44:13.331 --> 02:44:15.290
<v Speaker 1>he fell down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not a male movie.</v>

3756
02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:16.510
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

02:44:16.511 --> 02:44:17.350
<v Speaker 1>he could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3758
02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:23.580
<v Speaker 1>It might be that he's avoiding a that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kiss until he really did find the woman</v>

3759
02:44:25.271 --> 02:44:30.271
<v Speaker 1>that made him feel like you wanted to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>kissed and maybe she stole that from</v>

3760

3762
02:44:31.690 --> 02:44:35.140

<v Speaker 1>Imagine if a 33 year old male artists</v>

<v Speaker 1>tricked and 19 year old female or do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids like Katy Perry.</v>

<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

3828
02:47:32.740 --> 02:47:36.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like 980.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing more to let's go.</v>

3829
02:47:36.341 --> 02:47:38.710
<v Speaker 1>2,000 [inaudible].</v>

02:47:38.711 --> 02:47:41.680
<v Speaker 1>That ain't that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Says it's set in Roman times.</v>

3831
02:47:41.681 --> 02:47:44.450
<v Speaker 1>So could we get back there you think was</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3832
02:47:45.710 --> 02:47:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3833
02:47:46.970 --> 02:47:51.970

<v Speaker 1>The people were fucking 8,100.</v>

3834
02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:57.320
<v Speaker 1>One 81 88.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Rome a couple of years back and</v>

3835
02:47:57.411 --> 02:47:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I went to the coliseum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing,</v>

3836
02:47:59.771 --> 02:48:01.990
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to be there just to feel it</v>

3837
02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:07.060
<v Speaker 1>and then most of it's missing like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>stripped down a lot of the stone people</v>

3838
02:48:07.061 --> 02:48:10.540
<v Speaker 1>stole things from it and it's like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all dilapidated and falling apart,</v>

3839
02:48:10.541 --> 02:48:12.370
<v Speaker 1>but they go on a tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis,</v>

3840
02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:15.400
<v Speaker 1>they take you through the catacombs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort of explained all the different</v>

3841
02:48:15.401 --> 02:48:17.860
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had these animals they'd gotten</v>

3842
02:48:17.861 --> 02:48:22.120
<v Speaker 1>from Africa and they had kept them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the see that hole in the ground.</v>

3843
02:48:22.300 --> 02:48:24.730
<v Speaker 1>That's really real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really how they did it,</v>

3844
02:48:24.731 --> 02:48:26.890
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These animals would come out out of a</v>

3845
02:48:26.891 --> 02:48:30.370
<v Speaker 1>fucking hole in the ground and you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>that first layer of people,</v>

3846
02:48:30.430 --> 02:48:32.590
<v Speaker 1>the first seat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first row seats,</v>

3847
02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:36.580
<v Speaker 1>they had to put up fucking fences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's shit because the Tigers would leap</v>

3848
02:48:36.581 --> 02:48:39.430
<v Speaker 1>through the hair and kill the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were in the first row.</v>

3849
02:48:39.660 --> 02:48:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Stub hub</v>
<v Speaker 1>people up those stubhub,</v>

3850
02:48:44.290 --> 02:48:49.290
<v Speaker 1>those season pass holders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you get that Nice ticket and you</v>

3851
02:48:49.721 --> 02:48:52.870
<v Speaker 1>fucked your buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Get up to get a soda and you come</v>

3852
02:48:52.871 --> 02:48:55.590
<v Speaker 1>back and your buddies just in pieces do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3853
02:48:55.990 --> 02:48:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Just the fact that people did do stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

3854
02:48:59.890 --> 02:49:01.570
<v Speaker 1>We did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in us.</v>

3855
02:49:01.571 --> 02:49:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's crazy,</v>

3856
02:49:03.641 --> 02:49:04.960
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what your show makes me think</v>

3857
02:49:04.961 --> 02:49:05.771
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like that.</v>

3858
02:49:05.771 --> 02:49:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's DNA inside of us that remembers</v>

3859
02:49:09.391 --> 02:49:09.901
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3860
02:49:09.901 --> 02:49:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I think when people get into situations</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they need entertainment and back</v>

3861
02:49:14.251 --> 02:49:16.680
<v Speaker 1>then right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like would you rather go to a play or</v>

3862
02:49:16.681 --> 02:49:18.810
<v Speaker 1>see a dude have a sword fight against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tiger.</v>

3863
02:49:20.190 --> 02:49:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Tiger?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3864
02:49:21.510 --> 02:49:23.400
<v Speaker 1>All Day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends on what plays are.</v>

3865
02:49:23.460 --> 02:49:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Boring couple plays will be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what,</v>

3866
02:49:28.500 --> 02:49:29.990
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Playing Neverland.</v>

3867
02:49:30.030 --> 02:49:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if there's a line and on the left</v>

3868
02:49:33.270 --> 02:49:37.980
<v Speaker 1>you get to see a guy fight align with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sword and on the right you see a bunch</v>

3869
02:49:37.981 --> 02:49:39.000
<v Speaker 1>of people pretend to be cast.</v>

3870
02:49:42.690 --> 02:49:46.950
<v Speaker 1>That's going to say a lot about humanity</v>
<v Speaker 1>salesman or whatever the fuck you going</v>

3871
02:49:46.951 --> 02:49:47.790
<v Speaker 1>to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

3872
02:49:48.060 --> 02:49:50.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go see that guy get eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta watch it.</v>

3873
02:49:50.820 --> 02:49:52.370
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

3874
02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:57.840
<v Speaker 1>the shock and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the just the entertainment value before</v>

3875
02:49:58.640 --> 02:50:03.640
<v Speaker 1>death of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fights we.</v>

3876
02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got tickets to be the worst.</v>

3877
02:50:06.890 --> 02:50:09.090
<v Speaker 1>The good stories have been written yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what the hell do you think they were</v>

3878
02:50:09.091 --> 02:50:10.360
<v Speaker 1>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had plays,</v>

3879
02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:15.150
<v Speaker 1>they had great stories and I'm sure they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had great stories but just not as good</v>

3880
02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:20.010
<v Speaker 1>like and also the value of human life</v>
<v Speaker 1>was so much lower than people were</v>

3881
02:50:20.011 --> 02:50:22.470
<v Speaker 1>constantly going to war and the war that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fought,</v>

3882
02:50:22.471 --> 02:50:25.110
<v Speaker 1>they fought with bows and arrows and</v>
<v Speaker 1>spears and swords.</v>

3883
02:50:25.470 --> 02:50:28.830
<v Speaker 1>So there's just bloodiness horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloodiness.</v>

3884
02:50:28.850 --> 02:50:31.770
<v Speaker 1>There's probably four or five dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>people on the street at the moment.</v>

3885
02:50:31.771 --> 02:50:32.940
<v Speaker 1>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you're like,</v>

3886
02:50:32.941 --> 02:50:36.780
<v Speaker 1>am I going to go see somebody else die</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there and we see this play and part</v>

3887
02:50:36.781 --> 02:50:39.410
<v Speaker 1>of the problem was the way they got rid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this shit too,</v>

3888
02:50:39.450 --> 02:50:41.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the streets would be contaminated</v>

3889
02:50:41.671 --> 02:50:45.560
<v Speaker 1>with shit should have buried it like we</v>
<v Speaker 1>did around my neighborhood.</v>

3890
02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the blow back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone in some country did put</v>

3891
02:50:53.341 --> 02:50:56.700
<v Speaker 1>together a coliseum and then people</v>
<v Speaker 1>started traveling there and it became</v>

3892
02:50:56.701 --> 02:51:00.360
<v Speaker 1>like the new hot spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if I lived in Africa I would do</v>

3893
02:51:00.361 --> 02:51:01.700
<v Speaker 1>that because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3894
02:51:01.710 --> 02:51:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I know that some places are so starved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have so many animals.</v>

3895
02:51:04.650 --> 02:51:06.750
<v Speaker 1>I think they have a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in reincarnation.</v>

3896
02:51:06.900 --> 02:51:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just do it a million dollars to</v>

3897
02:51:09.931 --> 02:51:13.560
<v Speaker 1>have a sword fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had a purse of a million dollars</v>

3898
02:51:13.800 --> 02:51:15.410
<v Speaker 1>for someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a sword fight in the.</v>

3899
02:51:15.420 --> 02:51:19.680

<v Speaker 1>and a helmet.</v>

3900
02:51:20.640 --> 02:51:22.170
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have a sword fight with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tiger.</v>

3901
02:51:23.490 --> 02:51:25.430
<v Speaker 1>People would sign up for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3902
02:51:25.440 --> 02:51:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you had known was better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than anybody because you guys spend,</v>

3903
02:51:28.350 --> 02:51:30.650

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3904
02:51:30.870 --> 02:51:33.480
<v Speaker 1>the closest kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we have some type of gladiators.</v>

<v Speaker 1>lawn chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a shield.</v>

3916
02:51:58.980 --> 02:52:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a giant line.</v>

3917
02:52:03.220 --> 02:52:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This actually happened.</v>

3918
02:52:05.810 --> 02:52:09.700
<v Speaker 1>It says 100 percent live like recorded</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos on CBS news.</v>

02:52:09.970 --> 02:52:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy get jacked or what isn't.</v>

3920
02:52:15.070 --> 02:52:18.620
<v Speaker 1>That's not showing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must have been a long fight and it</v>

3921
02:52:18.630 --> 02:52:22.010
<v Speaker 1>was probably subdued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3922
02:52:22.280 --> 02:52:24.040
<v Speaker 1>be a tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously happening.</v>

3923
02:52:24.220 --> 02:52:26.310
<v Speaker 1>If this guy recorded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's probably happened.</v>

3924
02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:29.590
<v Speaker 1>He had to do like a two minutes or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something with it a bit.</v>

3925
02:52:29.980 --> 02:52:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the line seems fine.</v>

3926
02:52:33.020 --> 02:52:35.650
<v Speaker 1>He's going to climb on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a wrestler.</v>

3927
02:52:36.870 --> 02:52:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to do like a fucking cage</v>

3928
02:52:38.591 --> 02:52:40.780
<v Speaker 1>drop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drop down on that line.</v>

3929
02:52:40.890 --> 02:52:45.670
<v Speaker 1>You imagine that the ball's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to leap down with a spear and</v>

3930
02:52:45.671 --> 02:52:50.671
<v Speaker 1>drive it through the lions brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the top rope</v>

3931
02:52:55.230 --> 02:52:56.980
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spray all over the place.</v>

3932
02:52:57.100 --> 02:52:59.470
<v Speaker 1>You could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone would do it.</v>

3933
02:52:59.490 --> 02:53:01.750
<v Speaker 1>If that dummy got in there with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion you.</v>

3934
02:53:01.760 --> 02:53:04.420
<v Speaker 1>He could definitely get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you gave someone a million dollars,</v>

3935
02:53:04.770 --> 02:53:07.930
<v Speaker 1>he gave them a shield and a sword in</v>
<v Speaker 1>armor.</v>

3936
02:53:07.990 --> 02:53:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Given some armor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not all armor.</v>

3937
02:53:13.380 --> 02:53:17.770
<v Speaker 1>You can pick the neck of the loin piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>at lion would leap on you so fast.</v>

3938
02:53:17.771 --> 02:53:19.780
<v Speaker 1>You're sore to be knocked out of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

3939
02:53:19.781 --> 02:53:22.320
<v Speaker 1>It would just crush your fucking head</v>
<v Speaker 1>with its teeth.</v>

3940
02:53:22.330 --> 02:53:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one man would do it.</v>

3941
02:53:23.740 --> 02:53:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One man would win</v>

3942
02:53:28.260 --> 02:53:32.080
<v Speaker 1>maybe the mountain from game of thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The giant dude.</v>

3943
02:53:32.120 --> 02:53:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give that guy like a battleax,</v>

3944
02:53:34.960 --> 02:53:39.960
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking 85 pound acts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who would do it in UFC?</v>

3945
02:53:42.791 --> 02:53:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Who would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you think could win</v>

3946
02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:48.670
<v Speaker 1>and it's not saying that that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest or the best,</v>

3947
02:53:48.671 --> 02:53:51.670
<v Speaker 1>but who could do that would have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest guys who don't have to be</v>

3948
02:53:51.671 --> 02:53:54.550
<v Speaker 1>like the heavyweight champ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'd have to be steep meo chick or</v>

3949
02:53:54.551 --> 02:53:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Francis in Ghana or someone giant who'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be a big powerful person because</v>

3950
02:53:59.321 --> 02:54:02.560
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to be able to swing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking sword fast and you have to be</v>

3951
02:54:02.561 --> 02:54:05.740
<v Speaker 1>able to take a hit from a 500 pound cat.</v>

3952
02:54:06.460 --> 02:54:08.350
<v Speaker 1>You're probably gonna get fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>either way though.</v>

3953
02:54:08.380 --> 02:54:10.620
<v Speaker 1>You need one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may be able to take one good hit.</v>

3954
02:54:10.740 --> 02:54:14.440
<v Speaker 1>You're going to take one good hit my</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to feel like you're just going to</v>

3955
02:54:14.441 --> 02:54:16.900
<v Speaker 1>get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't think you have a chance.</v>

3956
02:54:16.901 --> 02:54:19.210
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of debates about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was reading it earlier,</v>

3957
02:54:19.211 --> 02:54:21.440
<v Speaker 1>of course people's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people just as stupid as mean</v>

3958
02:54:21.500 --> 02:54:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Theo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The line wouldn't have a good technique</v>

3959
02:54:25.061 --> 02:54:27.640
<v Speaker 1>so you can fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if it has good</v>

3960
02:54:27.641 --> 02:54:30.220
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The physical power of a lion,</v>

3961
02:54:30.221 --> 02:54:31.850
<v Speaker 1>it's just so overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

3962
02:54:31.990 --> 02:54:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think people understand how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much force it can generate,</v>

3963
02:54:35.740 --> 02:54:38.260
<v Speaker 1>how quickly it can move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how quickly he could get you.</v>

3964
02:54:38.261 --> 02:54:40.750
<v Speaker 1>It'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would just fucking scramble on you</v>

3965
02:54:40.751 --> 02:54:43.960
<v Speaker 1>and it will be on you so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3966
02:54:43.990 --> 02:54:47.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious video of a bunch of dudes</v>

3967
02:54:47.411 --> 02:54:48.050
<v Speaker 1>running away.</v>

3968
02:54:48.050 --> 02:54:52.180
<v Speaker 1>One in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A leopard is 150 pounds or something</v>

3969
02:54:52.181 --> 02:54:57.010
<v Speaker 1>like that and these fucking people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>running left and right and this thing's</v>

3970
02:54:57.011 --> 02:54:59.860
<v Speaker 1>coming after them and you realize like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The leopard is going so fast.</v>

3975
02:55:08.811 --> 02:55:13.430
<v Speaker 1>It's running on the walls on the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the middle of the wall,</v>

3976
02:55:13.431 --> 02:55:15.800
<v Speaker 1>above his fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch.</v>

3977
02:55:15.801 --> 02:55:18.860
<v Speaker 1>How has he starts running forward and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leopard comes into the picture?</v>

3978
02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:23.240
<v Speaker 1>The leopard is literally running on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vertical wall,</v>

3979
02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:26.060
<v Speaker 1>like watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch when it comes around the corner,</v>

3980

<v Speaker 1>It's running on the wall.</v>

3981
02:55:30.350 --> 02:55:35.350
<v Speaker 1>It's got so much power that it's running</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the side of the wall like you can't</v>

3982
02:55:36.471 --> 02:55:41.240
<v Speaker 1>even imagine the kind of physical speed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and strength that that thing has in its</v>

3983
02:55:41.241 --> 02:55:41.990
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

3984
02:55:41.990 --> 02:55:45.530
<v Speaker 1>It's bouncing from the side of the wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the other side of the wall and just</v>

3985
02:55:45.650 --> 02:55:49.790

<v Speaker 1>of a lion.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just a fraction.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's not much you could do.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just bit them.</v>

4001
02:56:28.371 --> 02:56:30.890

<v Speaker 1>He got lucky.</v>

4002
02:56:33.170 --> 02:56:37.280
<v Speaker 1>He got lucky that there was all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people and the commotion and 4</v>

4003
02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:38.500
<v Speaker 1>million people have watched that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So would it.</v>

4004
02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:43.190
<v Speaker 1>So as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as people were ready to see that 4</v>

4005
02:56:43.190 --> 02:56:46.070
<v Speaker 1>million people who have safely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why Shad and they're not crying at a</v>

<v Speaker 1>center right now or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have.</v>

4007
02:56:48.631 --> 02:56:50.810
<v Speaker 1>But watching that doesn't seem real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4008
02:56:50.811 --> 02:56:53.810
<v Speaker 1>we watched that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were there in real life,</v>

4009
02:56:54.410 --> 02:56:59.330
<v Speaker 1>like if you're in the hockey rink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit in those excellent Goldstar seats</v>

4010
02:56:59.360 --> 02:57:01.750
<v Speaker 1>were in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're in China somewhere.</v>

4011
02:57:01.890 --> 02:57:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have been doing that in China.</v>

4012
02:57:03.710 --> 02:57:07.030
<v Speaker 8>Is this how I got the guy or not?</v>
<v Speaker 8>This one here.</v>

4013
02:57:07.160 --> 02:57:09.580
<v Speaker 8>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh Wow.</v>

4014
02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:14.830
<v Speaker 8>Coming around here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Try to climb the fence and.</v>

4015
02:57:15.530 --> 02:57:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4016
02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dragged him down.</v>

4017
02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

4018
02:57:21.190 --> 02:57:23.410
<v Speaker 1>It just wants to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't know what it wants.</v>

4019
02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:28.120
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't know what the fuck it wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to jump in.</v>

4020
02:57:28.121 --> 02:57:30.280
<v Speaker 1>The water didn't think they swim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swim.</v>

4021
02:57:30.340 --> 02:57:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not good.</v>

4022
02:57:31.181 --> 02:57:32.830
<v Speaker 1>I think he's bleeding or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4023
02:57:32.831 --> 02:57:34.300
<v Speaker 1>He's getting his legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his arms,</v>

4024
02:57:34.301 --> 02:57:35.650
<v Speaker 1>his legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's getting torn up.</v>

4025
02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:37.060
<v Speaker 1>All that shit's on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's blood.</v>

4026
02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:39.910
<v Speaker 1>It's his blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that on there.</v>

4027
02:57:39.911 --> 02:57:42.880
<v Speaker 1>We definitely don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think we really need to</v>

4028
02:57:42.881 --> 02:57:46.870
<v Speaker 1>understand when you talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a large predatory</v>

4029
02:57:46.871 --> 02:57:49.420
<v Speaker 1>animals really need to understand what</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitches we are.</v>

4030
02:57:50.350 --> 02:57:55.000
<v Speaker 1>The toughest men that's ever lived is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>weak ass bitch compared to a leopard.</v>

4031
02:57:55.600 --> 02:57:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Just the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus,</v>

4032
02:58:01.380 --> 02:58:03.810
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's doing all this?</v>

4033
02:58:04.820 --> 02:58:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this one.</v>

4034
02:58:05.640 --> 02:58:06.810
<v Speaker 1>This is in India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4035
02:58:07.240 --> 02:58:09.330
<v Speaker 1>What happens in these areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4036
02:58:09.331 --> 02:58:11.580
<v Speaker 1>these cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get into these villages and just</v>

4037
02:58:11.581 --> 02:58:14.760
<v Speaker 1>start fucking people up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

4038
02:58:14.761 --> 02:58:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that as a small animal compared</v>
<v Speaker 1>to align in comparison.</v>

4039
02:58:21.470 --> 02:58:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Anything else you before we wrap this</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch up and bring it home?</v>

4040
02:58:25.070 --> 02:58:27.470
<v Speaker 1>I think I've seen enough today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4041
02:58:28.280 --> 02:58:30.290
<v Speaker 1>you realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4042
02:58:30.350 --> 02:58:32.930
<v Speaker 1>if you're ever in a confrontation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those animals,</v>

4043
02:58:34.280 --> 02:58:37.730
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you realize that you have that in</v>

4044
02:58:37.731 --> 02:58:39.530
<v Speaker 1>your mind now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4045
02:58:39.770 --> 02:58:43.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it's not a game as much as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was more of a game.</v>

4046
02:58:44.170 --> 02:58:44.931
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this,</v>

4047
02:58:44.931 --> 02:58:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be neat to go out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt some type of an animal with a knife</v>

4048
02:58:48.120 --> 02:58:52.340
<v Speaker 1>to start to get my Garda hunt an animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a knife.</v>

4049
02:58:52.600 --> 02:58:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you could even have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>raccoon with a knife?</v>

4050
02:58:54.860 --> 02:58:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you could 150 percent,</v>

4051
02:58:58.370 --> 02:59:00.110
<v Speaker 1>do you think they recommend might fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>you up though?</v>

4052
02:59:00.680 --> 02:59:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Fuck no man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How quick do you think a raccoon moves?</v>

4053
02:59:05.240 --> 02:59:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Like if you don't get that first stab</v>
<v Speaker 1>into that,</v>

4054
02:59:08.680 --> 02:59:12.050
<v Speaker 1>that you do that double up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long do you think it takes for that</v>

4055
02:59:12.051 --> 02:59:14.930
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is latched a hold of your face cloth on</v>

4056
02:59:14.931 --> 02:59:17.530
<v Speaker 1>your eyeballs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of your fucking head and you're</v>

4057
02:59:17.590 --> 02:59:22.250
<v Speaker 1>feeling your eyeballs getting socked out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your skull because it tears through</v>

4058
02:59:22.251 --> 02:59:23.570
<v Speaker 1>your tissue paper.</v>

4059
02:59:23.570 --> 02:59:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Thin eyelids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're nothing and it just biting</v>

4060
02:59:27.100 --> 02:59:28.940
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chewing your eyes out.</v>

4061
02:59:28.970 --> 02:59:31.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if it got on,</v>

4062
02:59:31.911 --> 02:59:33.800
<v Speaker 1>you will do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tough part is if it gets on you,</v>

4063
02:59:33.801 --> 02:59:35.840
<v Speaker 1>you can't stab it because you'll stab</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

4064
02:59:35.841 --> 02:59:38.950
<v Speaker 1>This is Kevin rose is Kevin rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a raccoon,</v>

4065
02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.380
<v Speaker 1>chucked it down the stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he?</v>

4066
02:59:41.480 --> 02:59:42.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fucked that.</v>

4067
02:59:42.171 --> 02:59:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Recognize the record was fucking his dog</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

4068
02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:46.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a guy who loves his dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he didn't even realize he was</v>

4069
02:59:46.881 --> 02:59:48.560
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just doing it before he even knew</v>

4070
02:59:48.561 --> 02:59:50.090
<v Speaker 1>it was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look how he did it.</v>

4071
02:59:50.260 --> 02:59:52.640
<v Speaker 1>He hooked it like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pillow,</v>

4072
02:59:52.760 --> 02:59:55.220
<v Speaker 1>woof pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

4073
02:59:55.580 --> 02:59:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went after it.</v>

4074
02:59:59.630 --> 03:00:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go out there with a gangster.</v>

4075
03:00:02.380 --> 03:00:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4076
03:00:03.460 --> 03:00:04.340
<v Speaker 1>it's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

4077
03:00:04.341 --> 03:00:08.330
<v Speaker 1>it's just a natural instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the basic instinct of a man,</v>

4078
03:00:08.331 --> 03:00:08.890
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

4079
03:00:08.890 --> 03:00:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I was saying was with those guys</v>

4080
03:00:11.361 --> 03:00:13.850
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered that grizzly bear that you</v>

4081
03:00:13.851 --> 03:00:18.851
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you reached this survival mode and you</v>

4082
03:00:19.220 --> 03:00:24.140
<v Speaker 1>have your regular operating system and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's survival default mode when</v>

4083
03:00:24.141 --> 03:00:27.410
<v Speaker 1>some real shit goes down like a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bears right next to you.</v>

4084
03:00:27.920 --> 03:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would hate that.</v>

4085
03:00:29.150 --> 03:00:30.140
<v Speaker 1>It will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

4086
03:00:30.160 --> 03:00:31.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back to like what we were saying</v>

4087
03:00:31.611 --> 03:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's the moment you'd find out</v>

4088
03:00:34.041 --> 03:00:38.270
<v Speaker 1>who you are and I would hate to find out</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that moment that I'm not a fighter,</v>

4089
03:00:38.300 --> 03:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that,</v>

4090
03:00:39.580 --> 03:00:41.450
<v Speaker 1>that all could be built up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4091
03:00:41.810 --> 03:00:44.270
<v Speaker 1>You can build that up through martial</v>
<v Speaker 1>arts that you like.</v>

4092
03:00:44.360 --> 03:00:49.310
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are just naturally</v>
<v Speaker 1>inclined to never quit and then there's</v>

4093
03:00:49.311 --> 03:00:51.500
<v Speaker 1>people that have to learn it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can learn it.</v>

4094
03:00:51.640 --> 03:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4095
03:00:52.540 --> 03:00:55.580
<v Speaker 1>I want to start learning some of it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have just a little bit more that I'm</v>

4096
03:00:56.090 --> 03:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>just to fill in whatever that space</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of me and sometimes that feels a</v>

4097
03:00:59.170 --> 03:01:00.100
<v Speaker 1>bit inferior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't</v>

4098
03:01:00.100 --> 03:01:03.340
<v Speaker 2>need to feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>invincible,</v>

4099
03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:04.240
<v Speaker 2>invincible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4100
03:01:04.300 --> 03:01:06.940
<v Speaker 2>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't mind getting a little call in</v>

4101
03:01:06.941 --> 03:01:08.740
<v Speaker 2>some of those areas where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4102
03:01:08.741 --> 03:01:11.200
<v Speaker 2>if somebody grabs me like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that I'll be able to grab them</v>

4103

<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4108
03:01:18.670 --> 03:01:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Take some beginner classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Start slow.</v>

4109
03:01:20.650 --> 03:01:22.750
<v Speaker 2>It's fun to man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really enjoy it.</v>

4110
03:01:22.930 --> 03:01:25.240
<v Speaker 2>As long as you're a healthy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like mentally,</v>

4111
03:01:25.241 --> 03:01:29.560
<v Speaker 2>like as far as your ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so long as you don't try to not tap.</v>

4112
03:01:30.130 --> 03:01:30.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4113
03:01:30.761 --> 03:01:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I.</v>

4114
03:01:31.611 --> 03:01:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I've just been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd be happy to have the</v>

4115
03:01:33.221 --> 03:01:36.940
<v Speaker 2>comradery and that would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the tapping is probably some</v>

4116
03:01:36.941 --> 03:01:38.560
<v Speaker 2>humility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably good for you.</v>

4117
03:01:38.630 --> 03:01:40.570
<v Speaker 2>It is definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just hard to do.</v>

4118
03:01:41.170 --> 03:01:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're in the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll try to resist and try to resist</v>

4119
03:01:45.731 --> 03:01:48.010
<v Speaker 2>an arm bar that maybe you should tap and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get hurt.</v>

4120
03:01:48.430 --> 03:01:50.740
<v Speaker 2>That's how you can get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get hurt from not tapping.</v>

4121
03:01:50.770 --> 03:01:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Especially other beginners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how hard like a black</v>

4122
03:01:54.551 --> 03:01:57.340
<v Speaker 2>belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more safe rolling with the black</v>

4123
03:01:57.341 --> 03:02:00.340
<v Speaker 2>belt and with anybody because they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be able to tap you if</v>

4124
03:02:00.341 --> 03:02:02.680
<v Speaker 2>they want to and when they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to hurt you.</v>

4125
03:02:02.900 --> 03:02:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you might get in there with some</v>

4126
03:02:05.290 --> 03:02:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Herculean white belt who's just learning</v>
<v Speaker 2>the techniques.</v>

4127
03:02:08.831 --> 03:02:11.350
<v Speaker 2>He grabs a hold of your arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fucking yanks on it.</v>

4128
03:02:11.351 --> 03:02:12.460
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

4129
03:02:12.790 --> 03:02:15.850
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have a chance to tap in</v>
<v Speaker 2>to and you're hurt.</v>

4130
03:02:15.940 --> 03:02:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4131
03:02:17.051 --> 03:02:18.130
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

4132
03:02:18.160 --> 03:02:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'll see if Eddie can help me out</v>

4133
03:02:19.691 --> 03:02:20.950
<v Speaker 2>to get me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can.</v>

4134
03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can do.</v>

4135
03:02:24.150 --> 03:02:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Last night was weird at the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>store,</v>

4136
03:02:25.781 --> 03:02:27.460
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it was so weird.</v>

4137
03:02:27.461 --> 03:02:29.650
<v Speaker 2>They fourth of July as a strange night</v>
<v Speaker 2>to perform.</v>

4138
03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:31.150
<v Speaker 2>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we here?</v>

4139
03:02:31.151 --> 03:02:32.320
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you here?</v>

4140
03:02:34.990 --> 03:02:36.940
<v Speaker 2>It was a weird crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a great crowd.</v>

4141
03:02:36.970 --> 03:02:38.010
<v Speaker 2>It looked good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

4142
03:02:38.230 --> 03:02:41.680
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also felt odd that they were at a</v>

4143
03:02:41.681 --> 03:02:42.281
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4144
03:02:42.281 --> 03:02:44.170
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize it until you said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

4145
03:02:44.620 --> 03:02:45.311
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4146
03:02:45.311 --> 03:02:47.590
<v Speaker 2>these people are thinking it's fourth of</v>
<v Speaker 2>July with the fuck.</v>

4147
03:02:48.940 --> 03:02:50.410
<v Speaker 2>It's not wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not right,</v>

4148
03:02:50.411 --> 03:02:52.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does my calendar even work?</v>

4149
03:02:52.900 --> 03:02:55.720
<v Speaker 2>The weirdest crowd you'll ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience as Christmas?</v>

4150
03:02:55.750 --> 03:02:57.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever do Christmas shows at the</v>

4151
03:02:57.461 --> 03:02:59.620
<v Speaker 2>store?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did one Christmas show,</v>

4152
03:02:59.621 --> 03:03:01.030
<v Speaker 2>the store like 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4153
03:03:01.060 --> 03:03:03.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking the night off for the rest of</v>

4154
03:03:03.281 --> 03:03:05.770
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking crowd's weird,</v>

4155
03:03:05.771 --> 03:03:07.420
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were weird.</v>

4156
03:03:07.421 --> 03:03:10.720
<v Speaker 2>It was more than 10 years ago because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to be like 2006.</v>

4157
03:03:11.140 --> 03:03:13.540
<v Speaker 2>You had fun though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't been feeling weird.</v>

4158
03:03:13.660 --> 03:03:14.291
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last night.</v>

4159
03:03:14.291 --> 03:03:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last night was fun.</v>

4160
03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:16.233
<v Speaker 2>Last time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fun.</v>

4161
03:03:16.350 --> 03:03:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a good time,</v>

4162
03:03:17.660 --> 03:03:20.470
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different feeling.</v>

4163
03:03:20.620 --> 03:03:24.760
<v Speaker 2>But I think people are feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>differently about comedy now.</v>

4164
03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because so many people are really</v>

4165
03:03:28.601 --> 03:03:32.290
<v Speaker 2>politically correct outside of comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and almost forced into it like you're</v>

4166
03:03:32.291 --> 03:03:36.460
<v Speaker 2>hearing so many things about people</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting fired from their jobs because of</v>

4167
03:03:36.461 --> 03:03:40.450
<v Speaker 2>sexual harassment or from a sexually</v>
<v Speaker 2>harassing joke.</v>

4168
03:03:40.451 --> 03:03:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Like someone would say jokes in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>office that were inappropriate.</v>

4169
03:03:43.540 --> 03:03:46.900
<v Speaker 2>So they got fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is happening left and right</v>

4170
03:03:47.090 --> 03:03:49.780
<v Speaker 2>here about the guy from Netflix that got</v>
<v Speaker 2>fired for doing.</v>

4171
03:03:49.781 --> 03:03:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's having a conversation about</v>

4172
03:03:51.881 --> 03:03:54.970
<v Speaker 2>offensive words that you shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>using in comedy.</v>

4173
03:03:55.120 --> 03:03:57.320
<v Speaker 2>And because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this conversation during this</v>

4174
03:03:57.321 --> 03:03:57.980
<v Speaker 2>conversation about</v>

4175
03:03:57.980 --> 03:04:01.850
<v Speaker 1>this subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used the word Nigger,</v>

4176
03:04:01.940 --> 03:04:04.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he was in this conversation and</v>

4177
03:04:04.821 --> 03:04:07.700
<v Speaker 1>did it one other time apparently because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

4178
03:04:08.030 --> 03:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Not Calling anybody that saying it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>loud was fired from Netflix.</v>

4179
03:04:14.210 --> 03:04:17.450
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless less,</v>

4180
03:04:18.600 --> 03:04:21.350
<v Speaker 1>if he was saying it like he likes having</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good time with,</v>

4181
03:04:21.360 --> 03:04:23.180
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was like,</v>

4182
03:04:23.181 --> 03:04:25.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

4183
03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:27.300
<v Speaker 1>like how was he saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was He,</v>

4184
03:04:27.470 --> 03:04:28.730
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4185
03:04:29.210 --> 03:04:34.210
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange that that word is only</v>

4186
03:04:34.251 --> 03:04:39.080
<v Speaker 1>for bitten by the people that can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't be used on,</v>

4187
03:04:39.430 --> 03:04:43.610
<v Speaker 1>you can't use the n word on you work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you could use it on someone and</v>

4188
03:04:43.611 --> 03:04:46.400
<v Speaker 1>they happen to be a person of color than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person,</v>

4189
03:04:46.670 --> 03:04:48.270
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4190
03:04:48.350 --> 03:04:50.960
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I remember when I would go,</v>

4191
03:04:50.961 --> 03:04:53.480
<v Speaker 1>when I would ride my bike to school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of my black friends would get on</v>

4192
03:04:53.481 --> 03:04:54.650
<v Speaker 1>my bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4193
03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:56.270
<v Speaker 1>and they get on and I would ride.</v>

4194
03:04:56.270 --> 03:04:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4195
03:04:57.650 --> 03:05:01.610
<v Speaker 1>and they used to call me the Nigga bus</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I rolled up and they would all</v>

4196
03:05:01.611 --> 03:05:05.570
<v Speaker 1>call me that and I honestly felt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were my friends.</v>

4197
03:05:05.571 --> 03:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

4198
03:05:07.150 --> 03:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>But you couldn't say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4199
03:05:08.390 --> 03:05:09.680
<v Speaker 1>and I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't say it.</v>

4200
03:05:09.860 --> 03:05:10.820
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4201
03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:11.990
<v Speaker 1>I find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4202
03:05:11.991 --> 03:05:14.630
<v Speaker 1>when somebody says anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's something to do with,</v>

4203
03:05:14.631 --> 03:05:15.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

4204
03:05:15.440 --> 03:05:16.041
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>

4205
03:05:16.041 --> 03:05:20.930
<v Speaker 1>anything and they have malice or ill</v>
<v Speaker 1>intent and these days I think if you do</v>

4206
03:05:20.931 --> 03:05:23.210
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's going to correct you really</v>

4207
03:05:23.211 --> 03:05:25.940
<v Speaker 1>fucking quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I agree and in a bit,</v>

4208
03:05:25.970 --> 03:05:27.230
<v Speaker 1>but in a business setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4209
03:05:27.231 --> 03:05:28.490
<v Speaker 1>and that type of setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

4210
03:05:29.430 --> 03:05:30.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4211
03:05:30.340 --> 03:05:32.540
<v Speaker 1>you make people so aware that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

4212
03:05:33.100 --> 03:05:35.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the fuck it is.</v>

4213
03:05:35.001 --> 03:05:36.800
<v Speaker 1>It is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also,</v>

4214
03:05:37.070 --> 03:05:40.370
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about forbidden words and</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments.</v>

4215
03:05:40.580 --> 03:05:43.730
<v Speaker 1>It's his business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're saying you can't make a sound</v>

4216
03:05:44.090 --> 03:05:45.890
<v Speaker 1>with his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what you're saying.</v>

4217
03:05:45.891 --> 03:05:48.350
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not calling someone that name.</v>

4218
03:05:48.560 --> 03:05:52.940
<v Speaker 1>He's using that word and people file</v>
<v Speaker 1>complaints about him using that word.</v>

4219
03:05:52.941 --> 03:05:55.130
<v Speaker 1>So the people that he worked with ratted</v>
<v Speaker 1>him out.</v>

4220
03:05:55.780 --> 03:05:58.110
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't allowed to say the word right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4221
03:05:58.310 --> 03:06:00.530
<v Speaker 1>but the car then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it gets real crazy.</v>

4222
03:06:00.860 --> 03:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're a black guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say it all day and it's funny,</v>

4223
03:06:04.950 --> 03:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>you could say it in front of white</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and they can laugh,</v>

4224
03:06:07.870 --> 03:06:09.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they can't say it,</v>

4225
03:06:09.590 --> 03:06:12.860
<v Speaker 1>but they can't say they can't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're Chris Rock,</v>

4226
03:06:12.890 --> 03:06:17.890
<v Speaker 1>you can go up with the overall tonight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just have like 15 different use of</v>

4227
03:06:18.231 --> 03:06:21.800
<v Speaker 1>that word in a half hour set and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4228
03:06:21.801 --> 03:06:23.270
<v Speaker 1>And everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was great.</v>

4229
03:06:23.570 --> 03:06:25.760
<v Speaker 1>That was a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4230
03:06:25.761 --> 03:06:26.311
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4231
03:06:26.311 --> 03:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>but then it'll be the same people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>say we should never say or hear this</v>

4232
03:06:29.151 --> 03:06:29.750
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

4233
03:06:29.750 --> 03:06:31.580
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people learn it from different</v>

4234
03:06:31.581 --> 03:06:33.500
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people learn it from black people,</v>

4235
03:06:33.501 --> 03:06:36.170
<v Speaker 1>some people learn it from white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a different feel,</v>

4236
03:06:36.260 --> 03:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>a different meaning to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4237
03:06:38.170 --> 03:06:40.760
<v Speaker 1>and I was even talking with Mr Peterson</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day,</v>

4238
03:06:40.850 --> 03:06:43.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I was saying,</v>

4239
03:06:43.251 --> 03:06:44.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the toughest thing I find that,</v>

4240
03:06:44.890 --> 03:06:46.850
<v Speaker 1>especially coming from the area where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>came from were,</v>

4241
03:06:47.090 --> 03:06:48.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of racism was probably</v>

4242
03:06:48.681 --> 03:06:51.110
<v Speaker 1>kind of went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was popular when I was young,</v>

4243
03:06:51.111 --> 03:06:53.090
<v Speaker 1>but it was a part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was part of the,</v>

4244
03:06:53.420 --> 03:06:55.830
<v Speaker 1>of the cloth and the in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the area,</v>

4245
03:06:55.930 --> 03:06:56.030
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

4246
03:06:56.030 --> 03:06:56.551
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was poor,</v>

4247
03:06:56.551 --> 03:06:58.530
<v Speaker 6>black and poor white.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

4248
03:06:58.560 --> 03:07:00.600
<v Speaker 6>poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like to fucking fight as you know,</v>

4249
03:07:00.630 --> 03:07:02.190
<v Speaker 6>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

4250
03:07:02.191 --> 03:07:02.671
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

4251
03:07:02.671 --> 03:07:04.380
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's be on the same team for a minute,</v>

4252
03:07:04.440 --> 03:07:07.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we can change the love that you have</v>

4253
03:07:07.351 --> 03:07:08.490
<v Speaker 6>about white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4254
03:07:08.491 --> 03:07:10.260
<v Speaker 6>thanks man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hilarious bit.</v>

4255
03:07:11.120 --> 03:07:12.420
<v Speaker 6>But did you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>did you,</v>

4256
03:07:13.010 --> 03:07:16.250
<v Speaker 5>I find it fun talking to someone like</v>
<v Speaker 5>Peterson does.</v>

4257
03:07:16.340 --> 03:07:17.360
<v Speaker 5>Was it challenging?</v>

4258
03:07:17.390 --> 03:07:19.010
<v Speaker 6>It was challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I felt nervous.</v>

4259
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:21.920
<v Speaker 6>I felt nervous because,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4260
03:07:21.921 --> 03:07:23.840
<v Speaker 6>I'm not as smart as him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4261
03:07:23.990 --> 03:07:25.160
<v Speaker 6>most people aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4262
03:07:25.520 --> 03:07:27.190
<v Speaker 6>But I also felt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4263
03:07:27.320 --> 03:07:29.480
<v Speaker 6>I know that um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4264
03:07:29.481 --> 03:07:32.120
<v Speaker 6>he really admired you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He mentioned at the beginning.</v>

4265
03:07:32.121 --> 03:07:34.340
<v Speaker 6>So that made me feel a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 6>comfortable because we had something in</v>

4266
03:07:34.341 --> 03:07:35.930
<v Speaker 6>common.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>

4267
03:07:35.931 --> 03:07:37.760
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then,</v>

4268
03:07:37.820 --> 03:07:40.490
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a nice guy and I thought he is a.</v>

4269
03:07:40.910 --> 03:07:44.150
<v Speaker 6>I tried as much as I could to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't trying to pick them apart or</v>

4270
03:07:44.151 --> 03:07:47.420
<v Speaker 6>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just wanted to see what he cared about</v>

4271
03:07:47.421 --> 03:07:49.880
<v Speaker 6>and he just genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I swear to God,</v>

4272
03:07:49.881 --> 03:07:52.580
<v Speaker 6>he genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe more than anyone I'd ever met.</v>

4273
03:07:52.581 --> 03:07:53.550
<v Speaker 6>He genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

4274
03:07:53.630 --> 03:07:58.300
<v Speaker 6>cares about trying to help young men</v>
<v Speaker 6>feel better for it and that,</v>

4275
03:07:58.310 --> 03:07:59.960
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we didn't get into anything political or</v>

4276
03:07:59.961 --> 03:08:01.610
<v Speaker 6>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was mostly about,</v>

4277
03:08:02.030 --> 03:08:04.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a take a small step,</v>

4278
03:08:04.491 --> 03:08:06.770
<v Speaker 6>take a small step and you can change</v>
<v Speaker 6>your life.</v>

4279
03:08:06.960 --> 03:08:08.180
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4280
03:08:08.210 --> 03:08:10.160
<v Speaker 6>if you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you have accurate goals,</v>

4281
03:08:10.161 --> 03:08:12.400
<v Speaker 6>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a real clinical psychologist and he</v>

4282
03:08:12.460 --> 03:08:16.000
<v Speaker 5>understands the traps that the mind</v>
<v Speaker 5>leaves for itself.</v>

4283
03:08:16.020 --> 03:08:18.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we all fall into those traps.</v>

4284
03:08:18.100 --> 03:08:19.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all do.</v>

4285
03:08:19.900 --> 03:08:21.380
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I've fallen into a lot of them and,</v>

4286
03:08:21.520 --> 03:08:22.090
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

4287
03:08:22.090 --> 03:08:23.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it was nice.</v>

4288
03:08:23.231 --> 03:08:23.710
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4289
03:08:23.710 --> 03:08:27.010
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as I think of him as like a,</v>

4290
03:08:27.020 --> 03:08:29.020
<v Speaker 6>I thought a with Vera,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4291
03:08:29.021 --> 03:08:30.100
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Chegg Rivera,</v>

4292
03:08:30.101 --> 03:08:34.780
<v Speaker 6>but like Canadian collect,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I know he's not like,</v>

4293
03:08:34.810 --> 03:08:36.760
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to tell him that so bad and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>forgot,</v>

4294
03:08:38.790 --> 03:08:41.010
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was supposed to be a murderous</v>

4295
03:08:41.020 --> 03:08:41.650
<v Speaker 6>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4296
03:08:41.650 --> 03:08:43.840
<v Speaker 6>And he's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's not a socialist like that.</v>

4297
03:08:43.841 --> 03:08:45.490
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he,</v>

4298
03:08:45.491 --> 03:08:47.280
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's like the,</v>

4299
03:08:47.350 --> 03:08:51.160
<v Speaker 6>he's kind of like the dad that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 6>us didn't here and we need to hear again</v>

4300
03:08:51.161 --> 03:08:53.380
<v Speaker 6>and it's like we need those reminders of</v>
<v Speaker 6>some of those things.</v>

4301
03:08:53.381 --> 03:08:54.820
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think he genuinely,</v>

4302
03:08:54.821 --> 03:08:58.360
<v Speaker 6>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he genuinely wants humanity to be,</v>

4303
03:08:58.361 --> 03:09:00.150
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what I felt from him does.</v>

4304
03:09:00.190 --> 03:09:02.500
<v Speaker 6>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you want</v>

4305
03:09:02.660 --> 03:09:05.870
<v Speaker 5>men to feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women will think you want them to feel</v>

4306
03:09:05.871 --> 03:09:07.820
<v Speaker 5>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is the problem that we have</v>

4307
03:09:07.821 --> 03:09:12.821
<v Speaker 5>with this whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>right versus left male versus female.</v>

4308
03:09:12.951 --> 03:09:15.320
<v Speaker 5>Black versus white.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anytime there's two groups and there's</v>

4309
03:09:15.321 --> 03:09:19.130
<v Speaker 5>supposedly pitted against each other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything positive for one side becomes</v>

4310
03:09:19.131 --> 03:09:21.530
<v Speaker 5>negative for the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think it's the opposite.</v>

4311
03:09:21.531 --> 03:09:25.700
<v Speaker 5>I think that if men feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll be nicer to women.</v>

4312
03:09:26.120 --> 03:09:28.040
<v Speaker 5>And I think that if they get their shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>together,</v>

4313
03:09:28.041 --> 03:09:31.040
<v Speaker 5>it's better for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that if someone's looking</v>

4314
03:09:31.070 --> 03:09:35.480
<v Speaker 5>for men's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like looking at men's values or men's</v>

4315
03:09:35.481 --> 03:09:38.750
<v Speaker 5>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not disregarding women,</v>

4316
03:09:38.751 --> 03:09:40.310
<v Speaker 5>but what we look at it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4317
03:09:40.311 --> 03:09:41.870
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should be paying attention to women.</v>

4318
03:09:42.020 --> 03:09:44.600
<v Speaker 5>You're obviously a misogynist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're focusing on men's rights,</v>

4319
03:09:44.601 --> 03:09:48.350
<v Speaker 5>like it's an insult to call someone an</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mra,</v>

4320
03:09:48.380 --> 03:09:52.820
<v Speaker 5>which is a men's rights activist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of Hilarious,</v>

4321
03:09:52.990 --> 03:09:53.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what is</v>

4322
03:09:54.400 --> 03:09:55.930
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone was a women's rights</v>

4323
03:09:55.931 --> 03:09:57.760
<v Speaker 2>activist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you ever say that it would be an</v>

4324
03:09:57.761 --> 03:10:00.790
<v Speaker 2>insult to call someone a women's right</v>
<v Speaker 2>activist or advocate?</v>

4325
03:10:00.791 --> 03:10:05.791
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's openly dismissed from the</v>

4326
03:10:06.311 --> 03:10:08.650
<v Speaker 2>feminine side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making fun of the masculine side.</v>

4327
03:10:08.651 --> 03:10:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Like men's rights activists are openly</v>
<v Speaker 2>dismissed.</v>

4328
03:10:11.590 --> 03:10:12.910
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange.</v>

4329
03:10:13.560 --> 03:10:14.910
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like to think I'm,</v>

4330
03:10:14.911 --> 03:10:15.620
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4331
03:10:15.620 --> 03:10:16.453
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4332
03:10:16.560 --> 03:10:18.750
<v Speaker 6>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a lot of women's rights activists</v>

4333
03:10:18.930 --> 03:10:20.040
<v Speaker 6>and look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the strongest,</v>

4334
03:10:20.460 --> 03:10:22.500
<v Speaker 6>hardest working man I've ever known was</v>
<v Speaker 6>my mother,</v>

4335
03:10:22.590 --> 03:10:24.540
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'll say that to the end of the</v>

4336
03:10:24.541 --> 03:10:24.991
<v Speaker 6>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4337
03:10:24.991 --> 03:10:26.940
<v Speaker 6>my mother delivered newspapers since I</v>
<v Speaker 6>was born,</v>

4338
03:10:26.941 --> 03:10:28.080
<v Speaker 6>still does,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4339
03:10:28.320 --> 03:10:32.130
<v Speaker 6>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and she sacrificed a lot of raising her</v>

4340
03:10:32.131 --> 03:10:33.990
<v Speaker 6>children.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She wasn't there for us emotionally</v>

4341
03:10:33.991 --> 03:10:35.790
<v Speaker 6>because she had to work all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4342
03:10:35.850 --> 03:10:38.490
<v Speaker 6>she didn't even have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she didn't have the opportunity to be.</v>

4343
03:10:39.420 --> 03:10:43.350
<v Speaker 6>But you want to talk about a feminist?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I'd never known one more in my</v>

4344
03:10:43.351 --> 03:10:44.400
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think,</v>

4345
03:10:44.610 --> 03:10:45.660
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4346
03:10:45.930 --> 03:10:48.210
<v Speaker 6>she had to play a man and a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4347
03:10:48.211 --> 03:10:49.800
<v Speaker 6>in a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a lot of instances.</v>

4348
03:10:50.040 --> 03:10:51.030
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>

4349
03:10:51.150 --> 03:10:52.830
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's great that you appreciate her.</v>

4350
03:10:53.170 --> 03:10:55.140
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it to the end.</v>

4351
03:10:55.390 --> 03:10:57.660
<v Speaker 6>But that means so much to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4352
03:10:57.661 --> 03:10:59.700
<v Speaker 6>And we started even like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I started doing this thing where like we</v>

4353
03:10:59.701 --> 03:11:02.590
<v Speaker 6>try and treat a single mom out to like a</v>
<v Speaker 6>weekend when I'm at a,</v>

4354
03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:04.380
<v Speaker 6>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on a weekend of shows,</v>

4355
03:11:04.381 --> 03:11:05.750
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pay for the sitter,</v>

4356
03:11:05.760 --> 03:11:07.020
<v Speaker 6>pay for the dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4357
03:11:07.320 --> 03:11:09.750
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and not to object a single day as you</v>

4358
03:11:09.751 --> 03:11:10.584
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

4359
03:11:11.090 --> 03:11:12.000
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for me,</v>

4360
03:11:12.001 --> 03:11:13.140
<v Speaker 6>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4361
03:11:14.400 --> 03:11:16.200
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I was even talking with Ms Dot</v>

4362
03:11:16.200 --> 03:11:18.330
<v Speaker 6>Peterson about this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I never got to make like the reason</v>

4363
03:11:18.331 --> 03:11:20.580
<v Speaker 6>I think I got into comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I never got to make my mom laugh,</v>

4364
03:11:20.581 --> 03:11:22.140
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like she was always,</v>

4365
03:11:22.141 --> 03:11:24.810
<v Speaker 6>she was always tired and he was always</v>
<v Speaker 6>working hard and tired and we just</v>

4366
03:11:24.811 --> 03:11:26.750
<v Speaker 6>didn't have that connection,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

4367
03:11:26.790 --> 03:11:28.950
<v Speaker 6>And so I think that's one of the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got into comedy.</v>

4368
03:11:28.951 --> 03:11:31.170
<v Speaker 6>The only person I've ever really</v>
<v Speaker 6>probably wanted to make laugh as my</v>

4369
03:11:31.171 --> 03:11:32.150
<v Speaker 6>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4370
03:11:32.520 --> 03:11:36.000
<v Speaker 6>and then here I am like just doing all</v>
<v Speaker 6>this other chicane re on the outside.</v>

4371
03:11:36.030 --> 03:11:38.220
<v Speaker 6>Does your mom think that you were</v>
<v Speaker 6>fondling when you were,</v>

4372
03:11:38.221 --> 03:11:39.570
<v Speaker 6>when you first started?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

4373
03:11:39.571 --> 03:11:40.770
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think he,</v>

4374
03:11:41.940 --> 03:11:43.710
<v Speaker 6>I don't think she thought if anything</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>

4375
03:11:43.740 --> 03:11:46.440
<v Speaker 6>My mom literally said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just don't think you're very funny.</v>

4376
03:11:47.250 --> 03:11:49.080
<v Speaker 6>Oh Mom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

4377
03:11:49.081 --> 03:11:51.210
<v Speaker 6>I saw that yoga video,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the young video.</v>

4378
03:11:51.211 --> 03:11:53.990
<v Speaker 6>You're doing comedy with the longest</v>
<v Speaker 6>hair on the sides and stuff.</v>

4379
03:11:54.010 --> 03:11:56.160
<v Speaker 6>That was a little cutie dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was the best.</v>

4380
03:11:56.161 --> 03:12:00.720
<v Speaker 6>And that was a really cool video.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was probably like 24,</v>

4381
03:12:00.750 --> 03:12:03.600
<v Speaker 6>23,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe 23,</v>

4382
03:12:03.630 --> 03:12:04.320
<v Speaker 6>one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two,</v>

4383
03:12:04.320 --> 03:12:06.210
<v Speaker 6>three,</v>
<v Speaker 6>somewhere in that range.</v>

4384
03:12:06.211 --> 03:12:07.620
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Crazy.</v>

4385
03:12:07.960 --> 03:12:09.750
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think,</v>

4386
03:12:09.751 --> 03:12:10.800
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to,</v>

4387
03:12:10.801 --> 03:12:11.550
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of,</v>

4388
03:12:11.550 --> 03:12:12.890
<v Speaker 6>some of these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4389
03:12:13.350 --> 03:12:17.340
<v Speaker 6>aggressive sometimes angry feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not mothers either.</v>

4390
03:12:17.750 --> 03:12:20.760
<v Speaker 6>And that's odd to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm,</v>

4391
03:12:21.510 --> 03:12:22.343
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get,</v>

4392
03:12:22.730 --> 03:12:26.210
<v Speaker 2>they get into something because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel there's an imbalance and if it</v>

4393
03:12:26.330 --> 03:12:29.670
<v Speaker 2>isn't true feminism or they get into</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a men's rights activist,</v>

4394
03:12:29.880 --> 03:12:32.520
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad for those guys because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think a lot of those guys are just been</v>

4395
03:12:32.521 --> 03:12:37.521
<v Speaker 2>fucked over by bad relationships or</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty divorces are shitty laws in terms</v>

4396
03:12:38.521 --> 03:12:42.720
<v Speaker 2>of like a child custody and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4397
03:12:42.950 --> 03:12:47.070
<v Speaker 2>this is their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their response and it's what we would</v>

4398
03:12:47.071 --> 03:12:50.230
<v Speaker 2>really like is for everyone to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>treated as an individual and,</v>

4399
03:12:50.530 --> 03:12:54.200
<v Speaker 2>and no groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no male versus female,</v>

4400
03:12:54.201 --> 03:12:57.260
<v Speaker 2>no fucking right versus left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just all human beings,</v>

4401
03:12:57.410 --> 03:12:59.930
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's like the ultimate</v>

4402
03:12:59.931 --> 03:13:02.360
<v Speaker 2>goal for society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for healthy society.</v>

4403
03:13:02.750 --> 03:13:05.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not to not eliminate judging</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

4404
03:13:05.871 --> 03:13:08.690
<v Speaker 2>but judge people based on their actions</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their words and their deeds,</v>

4405
03:13:09.170 --> 03:13:11.550
<v Speaker 2>not their sex or their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

4406
03:13:11.900 --> 03:13:14.120
<v Speaker 2>But then you're always going to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that want to fuck the opposite</v>

4407
03:13:14.121 --> 03:13:14.860
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>

4408
03:13:14.860 --> 03:13:17.930
<v Speaker 2>And you're always gonna have people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to fuck the same sex to make them</v>

4409
03:13:17.931 --> 03:13:20.630
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've been hit on by dudes before</v>

4410
03:13:20.690 --> 03:13:22.700
<v Speaker 2>and been made to feel very</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>

4411
03:13:23.030 --> 03:13:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only difference is a,</v>

4412
03:13:26.200 --> 03:13:29.480
<v Speaker 2>I know how to fight and when the dude</v>
<v Speaker 2>was hitting on me I was like,</v>

4413
03:13:29.481 --> 03:13:31.950
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut the shit like this.</v>

4414
03:13:32.050 --> 03:13:35.120
<v Speaker 2>This wasn't a scene where I was worried</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to get raped.</v>

4415
03:13:35.330 --> 03:13:36.680
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was worried I was going to go to jail</v>

4416
03:13:36.681 --> 03:13:39.050
<v Speaker 2>for fucking somebody up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't want to have to hurt you</v>

4417
03:13:39.051 --> 03:13:40.520
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't touch my dick again.</v>

4418
03:13:40.710 --> 03:13:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Like I've been in situations before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was never a situation where it</v>

4419
03:13:43.430 --> 03:13:46.520
<v Speaker 2>was like a woman where I was worried I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to get held down.</v>

4420
03:13:46.790 --> 03:13:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can understand them when those</v>

4421
03:13:50.211 --> 03:13:50.730
<v Speaker 2>situations.</v>

4422
03:13:50.730 --> 03:13:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Like I can easily see how women feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>

4423
03:13:52.851 --> 03:13:54.710
<v Speaker 2>Like way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way Worse.</v>

4424
03:13:54.740 --> 03:13:55.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that too.</v>

4425
03:13:55.431 --> 03:13:59.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'll get like dick pics and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff from men into my instagrams and</v>

4426
03:13:59.271 --> 03:14:02.330
<v Speaker 2>stuff bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's fucking like,</v>

4427
03:14:02.580 --> 03:14:07.400
<v Speaker 2>some are aggressive with that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's zero defects.</v>

4428
03:14:07.430 --> 03:14:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you're going to get them right now.</v>

4429
03:14:09.370 --> 03:14:12.150
<v Speaker 2>They come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People feel bad for Theo that were</v>

03:15:02.951 --> 03:15:03.800
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see how you feel.</v>

4453
03:15:03.830 --> 03:15:06.560
<v Speaker 2>I see now it's all women feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they get that you get,</v>

4454
03:15:06.620 --> 03:15:11.060
<v Speaker 2>there's a door that you could look</v>
<v Speaker 2>through where you could see a mile away</v>

4455
03:15:11.061 --> 03:15:12.850
<v Speaker 2>maybe where this could go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4456
03:15:13.010 --> 03:15:16.520
<v Speaker 2>But to be the person that feels that</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a dude wants to stick his dick in</v>

4457
03:15:16.521 --> 03:15:19.310
<v Speaker 2>you and shoot loads into your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

4458
03:15:19.311 --> 03:15:22.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like a video game</v>
<v Speaker 2>patient.</v>

4459
03:15:23.650 --> 03:15:25.300
<v Speaker 2>No memory go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

4460
03:15:28.030 --> 03:15:29.620
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4461
03:15:30.020 --> 03:15:33.980
<v Speaker 2>that's the difference between men and</v>
<v Speaker 2>women and this is also why there's more</v>

4462
03:15:33.981 --> 03:15:38.570
<v Speaker 2>anger because women have experienced so</v>
<v Speaker 2>many guys trying to do that to them that</v>

4463
03:15:38.571 --> 03:15:42.020
<v Speaker 2>they developed this bad taste for men</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I understand that and we need to be</v>

4464
03:15:42.021 --> 03:15:43.010
<v Speaker 2>better men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4465
03:15:43.160 --> 03:15:45.440
<v Speaker 2>and I believe that honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the reasons why,</v>

4466
03:15:45.640 --> 03:15:46.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listen to your show.</v>

4467
03:15:46.671 --> 03:15:48.350
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4468
03:15:48.351 --> 03:15:49.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited.</v>

4469
03:15:49.711 --> 03:15:49.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4470
03:15:49.980 --> 03:15:53.740
<v Speaker 1>I was intrigued to listen to Mr Peterson</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reading his book and um,</v>

4471
03:15:54.090 --> 03:15:55.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do want to be a better man and it's</v>

4472
03:15:55.621 --> 03:15:59.390
<v Speaker 1>hard to even be a better human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does it or a woman or what,</v>

4473
03:15:59.430 --> 03:16:01.620
<v Speaker 1>whoever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all want to do better.</v>

4474
03:16:01.621 --> 03:16:03.630
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't want to do better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably going to have a fucked</v>

4475
03:16:03.631 --> 03:16:05.970
<v Speaker 1>up life because then you're not trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not perfect.</v>

4476
03:16:05.971 --> 03:16:08.370
<v Speaker 1>It's no way you're perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one who's ever lived has been</v>

4477
03:16:08.371 --> 03:16:09.990
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ever want to pay.</v>

4478
03:16:10.620 --> 03:16:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every day you have to pay attention.</v>

4479
03:16:12.841 --> 03:16:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Every day you got to pay attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday,</v>

4480
03:16:14.370 --> 03:16:16.590

<v Speaker 1>To the way you think and you have to</v>

4481
03:16:16.591 --> 03:16:20.940
<v Speaker 1>constantly be assessing it and moving it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the right direction and when you are</v>

4482
03:16:20.941 --> 03:16:23.280
<v Speaker 1>moving in a positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generous,</v>

4483
03:16:23.310 --> 03:16:25.140
<v Speaker 1>loving direction,</v>
