00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.010
<v Speaker 1>So before they started modifying genes,</v>

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>how do they select,</v>

4
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>like say,</v>

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.330
<v Speaker 1>how do they.</v>

6
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Cause before any genetic modifications were done in laboratories,</v>

7
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>they had turned this Goc,</v>

8
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>what did I say?</v>

9
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.850
<v Speaker 1>A Toc,</v>

10
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Toc or maize as we used to call it,</v>

11
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.821
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

12
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>That was the Indian word for it.</v>

13
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.321
<v Speaker 1>Even now,</v>

14
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:22.610
<v Speaker 1>even according to that commercial that says its.</v>

15
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

16
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>well the maze is kind of a general term for everything from a field corn,</v>

17
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>which is what we think about,</v>

18
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>which is fed to animals,</v>

19
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.850
<v Speaker 1>which 80 percent of GM crops go to animal feed and we differentiate that versus</v>

20
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>a what is typically done by humans,</v>

21
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>which is usually sweet corn varieties.</v>

22
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>So how did they turn it before there was any genetic modifications done in</v>

23
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:44.310
<v Speaker 1>laboratories?</v>

24
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>How did they turn that corn into what we now,</v>

25
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>which is delicious and sweet and you put butter on it.</v>

26
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>It's fantastic.</v>

27
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.081
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit,</v>

28
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>how did they do that?</v>

29
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

30
00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:53.251
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

31
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>But it was all just random mutations.</v>

32
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>DNA random.</v>

33
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 1>DNA replication is a sloppy process and funny things happen when you,</v>

35
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>from a environment.</v>

37
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>So in the process of replication of DNA itself,</v>

38
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>you can make errors.</v>

39
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm cosmic radiation,</v>

40
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>just the chemicals in our environment,</v>

42
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>natural chemicals that are out there can induce changes in DNA and these kinds</v>

43
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 1>of mutations sometimes very rarely result in a change in the plant that's</v>

44
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>beneficial and at least,</v>

45
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 1>or at least from a human perspective.</v>

46
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>So in all the plants that we've had,</v>

47
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>all the plants that we have,</v>

48
00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:32.031
<v Speaker 1>the significant amount of change has come from random mutations that change</v>

49
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>genes in ways we don't understand pieces of DNA that get up out of the genome</v>

50
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>and sit down somewhere else randomly.</v>

51
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>They do this all the time.</v>

52
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Viruses in the plants that get into the genome and sit down and places that we</v>

53
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>have no idea where.</v>

54
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.980
<v Speaker 1>So genetic modification is something that's ongoing and constant in a factor in</v>

55
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:53.311
<v Speaker 1>every genome,</v>

56
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>including our own.</v>

57
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 1>And so what we're seeing today is just the,</v>

58
00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 1>the longterm effect that of humans who have been able to put all the good traits</v>

60
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:02.574
<v Speaker 1>in one place.</v>

61
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>So when you see those tomatoes that are in the supermarket that are Pale and you</v>

62
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>could play basketball with them,</v>

63
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>those hard tomatoes and then you compare them to like heirloom tomatoes.</v>

64
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.290
<v Speaker 1>The only difference between those two is that someone had found some tomatoes</v>

65
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:23.361
<v Speaker 1>that had grown extra firm and selected those and use the seeds from those to</v>

66
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>create more similar tomatoes and only select the dose.</v>

67
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.471
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

68
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:30.270
<v Speaker 1>So you frame two cool things here.</v>

69
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:34.650
<v Speaker 1>So heirloom what does an heirloom and an heirloom tomato without standing eating</v>

70
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>qualities that can't work in production commercially because it's too mushy.</v>

71
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.391
<v Speaker 1>It's too mushy.</v>

72
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 1>They don't last long and they break down.</v>

73
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.090
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>

74
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>so this is what the problem is with our food.</v>

75
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about tomatoes,</v>

76
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:46.201
<v Speaker 1>strawberries,</v>

77
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:46.621
<v Speaker 1>blueberries,</v>

78
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>things that these are non gmo by the way,</v>

79
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>there is no gmo tomatoes or strawberries.</v>

80
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.713
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

81
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>People would say there are.</v>

82
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that plant breeding over the last 50 years or say over the</v>

83
00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.183
<v Speaker 1>last 100,</v>

84
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.260
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

85
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>The objectives of the breeders has been bigger.</v>

86
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Fruit uniformity,</v>

87
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.613
<v Speaker 1>big yield,</v>

88
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>disease resistance,</v>

89
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>nothing about flavor and aroma.</v>

90
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>So to meet production characteristics,</v>

91
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>which is what we've been selecting for breeders,</v>

92
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>have been looking for these kinds of characteristics that don't involve the</v>

93
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>consumer and so our decline in the flavors and the quality of fruits and</v>

94
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>vegetables is directly related to the mass breeding,</v>

95
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>not anything to do with GMO.</v>

96
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>So when you say genetic modified in,</v>

97
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>in that,</v>

98
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.753
<v Speaker 1>in those terms,</v>

99
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>they are kind of genetically modified,</v>

100
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 1>but they're not modified in terms of being in a laboratory and human beings</v>

101
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>doing some funky stuff with jeans.</v>

102
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.200
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of modified almost naturally and just selected for those</v>

103
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>modifications.</v>

104
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

105
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

106
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>and some of the things that we've selected for have been the ones that didn't</v>

107
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>kill us when we ate them or the things that didn't make a poison that,</v>

108
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

109
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>or something that tasted horrible.</v>

110
00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

111
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.620
<v Speaker 1>plants make lots of funky compounds.</v>

112
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.040
<v Speaker 1>And so this was an opportunity for us.</v>

113
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.720
<v Speaker 1>So what we've seen in our stores right now is the residue of,</v>

114
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>of thousands of years of human selection and when we can call it genetic</v>

115
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>modification if we want to,</v>

116
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>but we can differentiate it from what we do in the laboratory,</v>

117
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>which is now we can call adding a transgene where a transgenesis moving a gene</v>

118
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:23.671
<v Speaker 1>from one background of genetics to another via laboratory and these selections</v>

119
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 1>that people have moaned about and I have as well.</v>

120
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:30.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

121
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible when you get a sandwich and has a pale tomato on it because they</v>

122
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:35.180
<v Speaker 1>just taste awful though.</v>

123
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 1>So there's no science involved in any of that other than selection is no,</v>

124
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.503
<v Speaker 1>there's no.</v>

125
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.600
<v Speaker 1>There's no like injection of some alien sort of genetics into those things.</v>

126
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Alien to the plant.</v>

127
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.171
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

128
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:47.561
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

129
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>there's no syringes.</v>

130
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm nothing like that.</v>

131
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:50.321
<v Speaker 1>And it actually,</v>

132
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:50.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 1>it is more an art than a science.</v>

134
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Being a plant breeder is the most kick ass career these days and has been for a</v>

135
00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:58.714
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

136
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

137
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>plant breeding is essentially inventing the next generation of food.</v>

138
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 1>And all we're talking about is a mixing pollen from things that maybe normally</v>

139
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:10.390
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't cross together like something that nature would never cross,</v>

140
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.710
<v Speaker 1>but you got this cool tomato from Europe that has great qualities and we can mix</v>

141
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>it with this great production quality tomato for that grows in Florida where</v>

142
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 1>nothing else can grow.</v>

143
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 1>And now you mix these two together and you get this beautiful tomato that works</v>

144
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:24.700
<v Speaker 1>well and everybody's garden.</v>

145
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.410
<v Speaker 1>That's where we're going now.</v>

146
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>But that's not gmo,</v>

147
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:32.320
<v Speaker 1>that's just using other types of technology to facilitate this net,</v>

148
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 1>this breeding process that breeders do.</v>

149
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

150
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.350
<v Speaker 1>but I think masculine aggression has also given us so many of the goodies.</v>

151
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.760
<v Speaker 1>You want to go through the list of heaps of fresh vegetables in the middle of</v>

152
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 1>the wintertime.</v>

153
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

154
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>all the inventions that push us beyond our biology,</v>

155
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 1>they takes.</v>

156
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>It requires a little aggression.</v>

157
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.170
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes,</v>

158
00:05:56.171 --> 00:05:57.004
<v Speaker 1>and even,</v>

159
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.801
<v Speaker 1>God forbid,</v>

160
00:05:57.801 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I say</v>

161
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

162
00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>

163
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 2>ruthless competition,</v>

164
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.901
<v Speaker 2>things progressed.</v>

165
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:05.510
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is that people are going to lose and people don't like</v>

166
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:07.410
<v Speaker 2>lose them because they think losing is a bad feeling.</v>

167
00:06:07.411 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 2>So they think of competition and competitive people as being negative.</v>

168
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:10.971
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

169
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 2>So that's what,</v>

170
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 2>that's my worry about the feminization quote unquote,</v>

171
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 2>of our society.</v>

172
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.380
<v Speaker 2>I think that we have to be very careful that we don't forget the positive</v>

173
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 2>aspects of what you'd call unoriginal macho energy.</v>

174
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:32.030
<v Speaker 2>I think the problem is that it's not masculine energy.</v>

175
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem that people were upset about.</v>

176
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 2>I think it gets misconstrued.</v>

177
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 2>I think the problem that we all have is with assholes.</v>

178
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 2>That is the problem across the board,</v>

179
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:46.010
<v Speaker 2>whether it's women or it's men when you see like these crazy radical feminists</v>

180
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:46.440
<v Speaker 2>who uh,</v>

181
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.440
<v Speaker 2>a attack speakers because they want to support men's rights in divorce court and</v>

182
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:56.260
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fucking reason is that the really aggressive,</v>

183
00:06:56.261 --> 00:07:01.261
<v Speaker 2>like there's this archetypal video of this super aggressive feminist outside of</v>

184
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 2>this thing in Toronto and she's got red hair and she's screaming at people like</v>

185
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:08.030
<v Speaker 2>what she wants and what she doesn't want from men and when they can shut the</v>

186
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 2>fuck up and you know,</v>

187
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 2>and she's telling people in the honest,</v>

188
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:12.760
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up the people that,</v>

189
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 2>that exist like that.</v>

190
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.830
<v Speaker 2>Then they become the problem because the problem is not like the idea that women</v>

191
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.700
<v Speaker 2>deserve everything that men deserve and that we should have equal treatment by</v>

192
00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>

193
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.010
<v Speaker 2>The problem is assholes.</v>

194
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Assholes representing a point of view that I probably don't disagree with,</v>

195
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.100
<v Speaker 2>but I disagree with her and I disagree with someone who is generalizing about an</v>

196
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 2>entire gender because that's ridiculous.</v>

197
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Of course it is.</v>

198
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Or generalizing about a type of person that is in that gender like you can't it.</v>

199
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is entitled to start from zero and as soon as you are prejudice,</v>

200
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 2>whether you're prejudice against white people or whether you're prejudice</v>

201
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 2>against men or with your prejudice against gays are transgenders or whatever the</v>

202
00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:56.894
<v Speaker 2>fuck it is.</v>

203
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.400
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you stop treating that person as like an you come at them from a</v>

204
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:02.540
<v Speaker 2>totally even spot,</v>

205
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.461
<v Speaker 2>then he,</v>

206
00:08:03.461 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 2>you're the asshole.</v>

207
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

208
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.530
<v Speaker 2>And I would suggest that,</v>

209
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

210
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:12.401
<v Speaker 2>we benefit also enjoy a lot about life at based on people who created things,</v>

211
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:18.110
<v Speaker 2>whose motives their motives may have been less than stellar.</v>

212
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:18.411
<v Speaker 2>Show.</v>

213
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:21.020
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people that are driven by just pure ego,</v>

214
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.190
<v Speaker 2>domination,</v>

215
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.203
<v Speaker 2>greed,</v>

216
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.130
<v Speaker 2>and those things are not.</v>

217
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Those things do not always create bad things.</v>

218
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:28.551
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

219
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times they create incredible innovations,</v>

220
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 2>better ways to do things.</v>

221
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.770
<v Speaker 2>You know so much.</v>

222
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:34.070
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

223
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.600
<v Speaker 2>what's another word for innovation?</v>

224
00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 2>Another word for innovation is destruction.</v>

225
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:43.210
<v Speaker 2>You're destroying how people used to do it when we came up with a the combustion</v>

226
00:08:44.931 --> 00:08:48.170
<v Speaker 2>internal combustion engine and put it in a vehicle and turn it into a car.</v>

227
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.560
<v Speaker 2>People that he made a lot of money making,</v>

228
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 2>buggy whips went out of fucking business.</v>

229
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:59.070
<v Speaker 2>So I don't need your fucking Buggy whip because my car doesn't respond to buggy</v>

230
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 2>whips in response to what I call rock oil,</v>

231
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.300
<v Speaker 2>which turned out to be oil.</v>

232
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 2>So that's the other thing to keep in mind.</v>

233
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Innovation is,</v>

234
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 2>is isn't aggressive competition thing.</v>

235
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:12.390
<v Speaker 2>It's competition.</v>

236
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 2>It's destruction.</v>
