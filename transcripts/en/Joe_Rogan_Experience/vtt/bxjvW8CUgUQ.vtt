00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a funky thing.</v>

120
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>But also I got to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been sent some things.</v>

121
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where the fuck they came</v>
<v Speaker 1>from and I put it up just because I</v>

122
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>thought it was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I didn't try to say it was mine and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not making a living off of doing that.</v>

124
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.970
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to share something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

125
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 1>but you can do that and go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where this came from,</v>

126
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:51.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

127
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>But it's weird because somebody must</v>
<v Speaker 1>have made it.</v>

128
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>And how the fuck do you find who made</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

129
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

130
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 1>I've only made one instagram thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like did.</v>

131
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which was a,</v>

132
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.890
<v Speaker 1>it was a picture of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivanka trump and that silver dress.</v>

133
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.150
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

134
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When she released it,</v>

135
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

136
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I got to do something about this.</v>

137
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.490
<v Speaker 1>And I said to my girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what does this look like?</v>

138
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>She's like a chipotle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Burrito.</v>

139
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.850
<v Speaker 1>So I found like a chipotle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a burrito wrapped in tin foil it and I</v>

140
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wore it better?</v>

141
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 1>And it did really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like the only time I did</v>

142
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>something on instagram because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>times I put a joke on instagram and like</v>

143
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:27.800
<v Speaker 1>get ready Internet about to break you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then nobody likes it.</v>

144
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.280
<v Speaker 1>But that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that one I actually saw other people</v>

145
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>posting without crediting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

146
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean you don't really</v>

147
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.193
<v Speaker 1>trust?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This?</v>

148
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Looks like it looks just like she looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Burrito.</v>

149
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.830
<v Speaker 1>He's an odd look and fellow too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the man that</v>

150
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 1>named Jared cushner commissioner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

151
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>something about him where I'm like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's like,</v>

152
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.490
<v Speaker 1>he's like a character in a Kubrick movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

153
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Speaker 1>And he to me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

154
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a New York Italian Jew but I grew up</v>

155
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 1>with dudes like jared cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's like the rich version of where</v>

156
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:00.540
<v Speaker 1>I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's like,</v>

157
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rich Jewish kid from the city,</v>

158
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>like went to a private school and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>like got in that world.</v>

159
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 1>And now he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he's like running the country.</v>

160
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I could have gone to camp</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>

161
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean he really is running the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the guys.</v>

162
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the main people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know that I've read stuff</v>

163
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:16.694
<v Speaker 1>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have as much say as one might</v>

165
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:23.240
<v Speaker 1>hope manager would have a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

166
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would imagine the big boss is</v>

167
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:28.730
<v Speaker 1>the dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Bannon is trump and then</v>

168
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:29.564
<v Speaker 1>bannon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

169
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>But he's doing trump's bidding.</v>

170
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.860
<v Speaker 1>You mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

171
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 1>he's the brother in law under the sun</v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

172
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 1>He's got a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a big part.</v>

173
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 1>He does look at that dark darks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got a big part of running the country.</v>

174
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:43.850
<v Speaker 1>So it does fucking scored though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations sir.</v>

175
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 1>You've made out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he,</v>

176
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>he stepped in a big pile of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's hot as fuck too.</v>

177
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 1>I bet she's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet she's probably pretty cool.</v>

178
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Reasonable person too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She seems like she seems like shit.</v>

179
00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 1>I think she's probably a little bit like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>

180
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I feel the same way about Melania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Melania is.</v>

181
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I did not sign up to be the first lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

182
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 1>well she's not even doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

183
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 1>she's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except for that one day she read the</v>

184
00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Lord's prayer off of a piece of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

185
00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 1>well how about the one day she</v>
<v Speaker 1>plagiarized Michelle Obama speech?</v>

186
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

187
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 1>That was the thing when I started</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading the Lord's prayer.</v>

188
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like my instinct was like,</v>

189
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.350
<v Speaker 1>did she think Michelle Obama wrote the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord's for herself?</v>

190
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.810
<v Speaker 1>So she's reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure that that joke was made a</v>

191
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 1>thousand times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's be honest,</v>

192
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Michelle Obama probably didn't write</v>
<v Speaker 1>that speech either.</v>

193
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.250
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a speech writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

194
00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:32.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

195
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do think that if you're going to</v>

196
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:37.490
<v Speaker 1>steal from a first lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it from one,</v>

197
00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 1>from like know years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

198
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:41.250
<v Speaker 1>The one who is still first lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

199
00:07:41.251 --> 00:07:44.180
<v Speaker 1>do you remember when Joe Biden got</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught for stealing Kennedy's speeches?</v>

200
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.010
<v Speaker 1>That was surprising to me when everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>started talking about,</v>

201
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everyone got so excited.</v>

202
00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Biden might run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

203
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.870
<v Speaker 1>am I the only one who has been like</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to Joe?</v>

204
00:07:54.871 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 1>But he's constantly doing those trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

205
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:58.550
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

206
00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.570
<v Speaker 1>get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

207
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:00.990
<v Speaker 1>stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guys that are wheelchair,</v>

208
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.630
<v Speaker 1>he's like such a buffoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

209
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.780
<v Speaker 1>he's an odd guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

210
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.670
<v Speaker 1>the memes about him were fucking genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Joe Biden means at the end of the</v>

211
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 1>term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goodbye means that's what I'm</v>

212
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's funny,</v>

213
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I.</v>

214
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.620
<v Speaker 1>for me it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.970
<v Speaker 1>the daily show when I used to be at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>daily show was like we were doing stuff</v>

216
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.340
<v Speaker 1>and it always felt like we were the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fastest ones doing it.</v>

217
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Now with memes and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going,</v>

218
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.363
<v Speaker 1>they're instantaneous.</v>

219
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 1>You have a broadcast time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you could keep up.</v>

220
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an the speed by which things are</v>

221
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.110
<v Speaker 1>launched and are good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not crappy.</v>

222
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Like the mockups are funny and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>graphics are funny and like people are</v>

223
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how fast people are editing</v>

224
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>photos on their phone or like photoshop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instantaneous.</v>

225
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they happen during podcast while we're</v>

226
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:53.540
<v Speaker 1>doing podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make a meme about something</v>

227
00:08:53.541 --> 00:08:56.910
<v Speaker 1>said on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be up before the podcast is over.</v>

228
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment for me,</v>

229
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 1>like it was the summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at the nightly show and I started</v>

230
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:05.890
<v Speaker 1>to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in a little bit of trouble here.</v>

231
00:09:05.891 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 1>It was when that dude was climbing trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>tower when the suction cups and it was</v>

232
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:11.150
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

233
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 1>it was like 5:00 and we tape it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>

234
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.940
<v Speaker 1>We did tape it six and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we were rewriting that night show</v>

235
00:09:16.941 --> 00:09:20.610
<v Speaker 1>when I made a little joke just to one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the researchers about the Suction Cup</v>

<v Speaker 1>Olympics and Phelps was getting such a</v>

238
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.480
<v Speaker 1>stupid joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the kind of thing for a late night</v>

<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

245
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.840

<v Speaker 1>made.</v>

247

<v Speaker 1>have been retweeted like 60,000 times</v>

248
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:48.540

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:49.890
<v Speaker 1>we're in trouble.</v>

251
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 1>This shows a trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy Writers and Comedians as well,</v>

252
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.780
<v Speaker 1>like to think that they're the only ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are funny.</v>

253
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you're a neurosurgeon</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a race car.</v>

254
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.150
<v Speaker 1>You have some skill that no one else</v>
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>

255
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.310
<v Speaker 1>People are funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's fucking funny people that are</v>

00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 1>dentists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's funny people.</v>

257
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the funniest people I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever met in my fucking life is my former</v>

258
00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave Dolan.</v>

259
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.720
<v Speaker 1>He was a private investigator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dude was fucking hilarious and his</v>

260
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:16.380
<v Speaker 1>cousin was build down to own the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection in Boston.</v>

261
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.480
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was working for him,</v>

262
00:10:18.481 --> 00:10:20.490
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lost his license from drinking and</v>

263
00:10:20.491 --> 00:10:22.040
<v Speaker 1>driving and he needed a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

264
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an assistant in quotes who,</v>

265
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.950
<v Speaker 1>who did basically it was a driver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

266
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.560
<v Speaker 1>my thought you meant that Pei,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pei,</v>

267
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Pei,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pei lost his license.</v>

268
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.290
<v Speaker 1>And so I started working for them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd get it.</v>

269
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:36.600
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to get up at like 5:00 in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and like show up at people's</v>

270
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:38.580
<v Speaker 1>houses to catch them working when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were supposed to.</v>

271
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you doing a pie assistant work.</v>

272
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.370
<v Speaker 1>How is that not a TV show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>

273
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Pii assistant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

274
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it could be.</v>

275
00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:51.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna do it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So still the idea anybody's listening to</v>

276
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.440
<v Speaker 1>this guy was fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just had a comics mind.</v>

277
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.080
<v Speaker 1>He would just start talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this scumbag,</v>

278
00:10:58.081 --> 00:11:00.390
<v Speaker 1>you know the fuck he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he started saying crazy shit</v>

279
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.920
<v Speaker 1>like writing life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

280
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would be crying like tears</v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling down my eyes laughing and</v>

281
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:08.340
<v Speaker 1>thinking like I'm the one that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking comedian and this,</v>

282
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Speaker 1>my boss is way funnier than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

283
00:11:10.681 --> 00:11:12.250
<v Speaker 1>All the guys that grew up with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

284
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.850
<v Speaker 1>like I grew up in like with funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

285
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.100
<v Speaker 1>like some of my friends are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very funny.</v>

286
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they just didn't know who the hell</v>

287
00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 1>thinks to do this and do stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people asked me that when</v>

288
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.710
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the hardest thing about doing</v>

289
00:11:25.711 --> 00:11:26.341
<v Speaker 1>standup?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

290
00:11:26.341 --> 00:11:31.080
<v Speaker 1>it's admitting you're an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you like if you walked into a</v>

291
00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:33.300
<v Speaker 1>party and it was full of people and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were all hanging out and we're like,</v>

292
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:34.320
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet down everybody.</v>

293
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I got funny shit to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>

294
00:11:36.301 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 1>who brought the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'd be like,</v>

295
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:38.550
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not done.</v>

296
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Not only do one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to talk.</v>

297
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.850
<v Speaker 1>I want you to pay me for my thoughts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and put a light on me,</v>

298
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.430
<v Speaker 1>a letter and if you talk I'm going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>an asshole about it to you because it's</v>

299
00:11:47.431 --> 00:11:50.730
<v Speaker 1>my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's the whole impulse to do that is</v>

300
00:11:50.731 --> 00:11:52.500
<v Speaker 1>very much like not only do I think I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

301
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 1>I think I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

302
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.990
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then every now and then you meet a</v>

303
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 1>comedian who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wasn't funny when they were growing</v>

304
00:11:58.511 --> 00:11:59.344
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

305
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 1>What were you thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason I did this is because I</v>

306
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:06.370
<v Speaker 1>always was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was good at baseball would've been.</v>

307
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I would've been tried baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some guys are just funny and then</v>

308
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:12.670
<v Speaker 1>they just become accountants will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody said something funny at one</v>

309
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 1>point in their life and one of the weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>things about being a comedian as it</v>

310
00:12:15.461 --> 00:12:16.030
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

311
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a special skill that doesn't look</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a special skill.</v>

312
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Like if I walked up to somebody who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a mma,</v>

313
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making us,</v>

314
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 1>making a sculpture or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

315
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>

316
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:27.120
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

317
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.270
<v Speaker 1>what are you using?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

318
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:29.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what tools?</v>

319
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Like how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you start it.</v>

320
00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you map it out on paper?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how you do it.</v>

321
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Like it would be confusing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

322
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I'd want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's the process?</v>

323
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.990
<v Speaker 1>If I see a guy go on stage and start</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

324
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 1>I go walk and fucking do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guys just standing there like</v>

325
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 1>literally standing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not Cirque du Solei and he's not</v>

326
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:45.880
<v Speaker 1>juggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

327
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.150
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have a Hulu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have a poodle with no</v>

328
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 1>spitting fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Gene Simmons.</v>

329
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything seems really straightforward.</v>

330
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:52.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

331
00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:53.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

332
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:56.910
<v Speaker 1>one of the things is so deceptive about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then you watch someone who's like</v>

333
00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.330
<v Speaker 1>really good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got like,</v>

334
00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that seems so effortless.</v>

335
00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:01.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's up there,</v>

336
00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:03.590
<v Speaker 1>kill him like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

337
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.670
<v Speaker 1>it's the year I always feel like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of it or,</v>

338
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.530
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or being on stage,</v>

339
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:11.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you have to become as close to</v>

340
00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:14.740
<v Speaker 1>you as you can be in front of a group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

341
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.240
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:16.840
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>

343
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.950
<v Speaker 1>everything I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always found in the beginning of the</v>

345
00:13:19.511 --> 00:13:23.200
<v Speaker 1>hardest stuff about it was you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize like how much super human</v>

346
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:24.870
<v Speaker 1>hearing and stuff you have when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>on stage.</v>

347
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.620
<v Speaker 1>It's all these things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

348
00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:29.740
<v Speaker 1>it's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to think of the analogy.</v>

349
00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:30.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when like,</v>

350
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.040
<v Speaker 1>like you'll never see it like a movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>where someone discovers they have super</v>

351
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:34.990
<v Speaker 1>powers but they're overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like that.</v>

352
00:13:34.991 --> 00:13:38.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like you start get onstage and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear like a fork drop in the back of the</v>

353
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:41.230
<v Speaker 1>room stuff nobody else is hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're a rookie,</v>

354
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:41.831
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

355
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:44.280
<v Speaker 1>hold on to your fork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people like what we said,</v>

356
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.120
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like only you hear it,</v>

357
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:46.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

358
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.940
<v Speaker 1>hey sneezy people like did the guy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>knees,</v>

359
00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:49.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching you.</v>

360
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.740
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that for me in the beginning was</v>

361
00:13:53.741 --> 00:13:56.590
<v Speaker 1>like an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember like emceeing clubs and</v>

362
00:13:56.591 --> 00:13:58.580
<v Speaker 1>like thinking I was like being sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

363
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.240
<v Speaker 1>when people have been like we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did not experience that same</v>

364
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:03.850
<v Speaker 1>sensation you experience because</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning how to relax,</v>

365
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.290
<v Speaker 1>learning how to actually be yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of all those people.</v>

366
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Like it's fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a buddy of mine who's</v>

367
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.950
<v Speaker 1>thinking about doing stand up now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've known him forever and he's been</v>

<v Speaker 1>working on is his act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's to z 39 these journeys for the</v>

369
00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:20.860
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not tate tate Fletcher.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Every time I see him he's in a movie</v>

372
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:28.210
<v Speaker 1>getting shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

374
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.230
<v Speaker 1>If he's in John Wick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's getting shot in the head,</v>

386

<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please welcome Tait Fletcher and he gets</v>

389
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:06.104
<v Speaker 1>up on stage.</v>

390
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Has he done it yet or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hasn't done it yet,</v>

391
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to be interesting to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's the,</v>

392
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.910
<v Speaker 1>the whole process of like learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like becoming so comfortable that you</v>

393
00:15:16.911 --> 00:15:19.740
<v Speaker 1>can relax while you're on stage in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all those people.</v>

394
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Just see that's what takes the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

395
00:15:21.551 --> 00:15:22.790
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

396
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:24.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being comfortable,</v>

397
00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the Malcolm gladwell thing,</v>

398
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 1>it takes 10,000 hours to master</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's 10 years.</v>

399
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:34.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like you've got to be on stage a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of hours to be yourself and be</v>

400
00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:36.930
<v Speaker 1>comfortable and not and even eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

401
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.450
<v Speaker 1>And then when you watch yourself back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

402
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.210
<v Speaker 1>especially in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't realize you're doing stuff.</v>

403
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.160
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching myself back early on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>

404
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.880
<v Speaker 1>am I touching my nose the whole time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

405
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:48.590
<v Speaker 1>why isn't anyone telling me I'm touching</v>
<v Speaker 1>my nose?</v>

406
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.453
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

407
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.480
<v Speaker 1>people must think I do coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

408
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

409
00:15:52.311 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 1>but I don't probably do to do right back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the day,</v>

410
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.420
<v Speaker 1>but I never did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had.</v>

411
00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.750
<v Speaker 1>But it's like those are the little</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous ticks you develop and you have</v>

412
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:00.590
<v Speaker 1>to learn over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

413
00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:02.150
<v Speaker 1>just got to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

414
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you,</v>

415
00:16:03.261 --> 00:16:03.661
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

416
00:16:03.661 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've transitioned from doing the daily</v>

417
00:16:06.021 --> 00:16:07.280
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't take transition,</v>

418
00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 2017.</v>

419
00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:10.190
<v Speaker 1>People are just now going to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

420
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 1>it's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

421
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird term now.</v>

422
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say transition,</v>

423
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.280
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms medical officer,</v>

424
00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.220
<v Speaker 1>he can't say transition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transition.</v>

425
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on your journey now to say that</v>

426
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.040
<v Speaker 1>like what kind of journey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A journey of sexual experimentation.</v>

427
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.550
<v Speaker 1>You can't ask me about it because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not supposed to and you can't answer.</v>

428
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.730
<v Speaker 1>You have to accept a lot of um.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

429
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.900
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say something but on the</v>

430
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.900
<v Speaker 1>transition from going to throw somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the bus,</v>

431
00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:41.580
<v Speaker 1>but it was no need to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

432
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

433
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.770
<v Speaker 1>this whole journey of like going from</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you started off as a comic and then</v>

434
00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:49.070
<v Speaker 1>you worked for the daily show for so</v>
<v Speaker 1>long and you kind of miss comedy.</v>

435
00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:50.990
<v Speaker 1>I did comedy while you were doing it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

436
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.480
<v Speaker 1>like a half hour special when I was at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the daily show,</v>

437
00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:57.870
<v Speaker 1>but it was weak because I was putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>working 95 percent of my energy and that</v>

438
00:16:57.871 --> 00:17:00.970
<v Speaker 1>the daily show yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now you're out now you're like,</v>

439
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left the daily show in like 2013 last</v>

440
00:17:05.181 --> 00:17:06.400
<v Speaker 1>time I did your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

441
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I was living out here in about to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to do the nightly show and the</v>

442
00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:13.240
<v Speaker 1>nightly show was I said yes because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to produce anymore.</v>

443
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.140
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to perform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the deal for the nightly show was I</v>

444
00:17:15.141 --> 00:17:16.350
<v Speaker 1>got to be on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

445
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.920
<v Speaker 1>So that's Larry Wilmore to Larry wilmore</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

446
00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went back to,</v>

447
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:21.890
<v Speaker 1>at the time it was called the minority</v>
<v Speaker 1>report,</v>

448
00:17:21.891 --> 00:17:26.891
<v Speaker 1>but then it became the nightly show</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of fox lawsuits and what's the</v>

449
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:28.850
<v Speaker 1>loss?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because remember the minority report,</v>

450
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:31.910
<v Speaker 1>the Tom Cruise movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a Philip k dot dick book</v>

451
00:17:31.911 --> 00:17:33.980
<v Speaker 1>and Fox had just bought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

452
00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:36.200
<v Speaker 1>you said Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I automatically think Fox News.</v>

453
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.093
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

454
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.880
<v Speaker 1>associate parent company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parent company should change your</v>

455
00:17:40.881 --> 00:17:42.090
<v Speaker 1>fucking name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

456
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.011
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

457
00:17:43.011 --> 00:17:45.400
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because even when you see it come up,</v>

458
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:45.891
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

459
00:17:45.891 --> 00:17:48.560
<v Speaker 1>is this going to be pointless?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was working for the UFC.</v>

460
00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Still do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't do the Fox things anymore.</v>

461
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.460
<v Speaker 1>And when I was doing the Fox things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

462
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>

463
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.340
<v Speaker 1>you're working on Fox now.</v>

464
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.290
<v Speaker 1>What's that like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they like super right wing?</v>

465
00:17:58.291 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so funny.</v>

466
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking cage fighting,</v>

467
00:18:00.751 --> 00:18:02.320
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a cage fighting commentator.</v>

468
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are right wing.</v>

469
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.410
<v Speaker 1>But that's not what this now it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was fox didn't always used to be</v>

470
00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:10.050
<v Speaker 1>right when they're actually not and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody is right wing.</v>

471
00:18:10.051 --> 00:18:12.450
<v Speaker 1>But now there is a place where it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

472
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.950
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

473
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:18.000
<v Speaker 1>with Fox where it's like if somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like the right likes,</v>

474
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.820
<v Speaker 1>says something anti-trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they just want them off the</v>

475
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:21.830
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

476
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened twice.</v>

477
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Shep Smith said something about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said something recently that was</v>

478
00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:29.010
<v Speaker 1>really good and people we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he went on a rant about it and then</v>

479
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:32.540
<v Speaker 1>people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of my favorite thing right</v>

480
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:36.360
<v Speaker 1>now is there's a group of people calling</v>
<v Speaker 1>another group of people snowflakes for</v>

481
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:38.700
<v Speaker 1>over sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I love that term.</v>

482
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I think is very funny and I agree</v>

483
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.770
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get in trouble right now for</v>

484
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:45.930
<v Speaker 1>saying anything and I'm sure like just</v>
<v Speaker 1>this conversation,</v>

485
00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:48.060
<v Speaker 1>people are mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if some fucking liberal guy on</v>

486
00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 1>twitter that was like in all caps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop calling people snowflakes and</v>

487
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:52.201
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

488
00:18:52.201 --> 00:18:53.430
<v Speaker 1>now I want to do it more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

489
00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:56.700
<v Speaker 1>it's tantamount to psychological torture</v>
<v Speaker 1>for these young children.</v>

490
00:18:56.701 --> 00:18:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

491
00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.450
<v Speaker 1>fucking snowflake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got into trouble with,</v>

492
00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:01.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

493
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.250
<v Speaker 1>when trump won because they kept showing</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this footage on the news.</v>

494
00:19:05.251 --> 00:19:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grown men crying.</v>

495
00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.670
<v Speaker 1>So I just said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

496
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.520
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm immature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me every time if I see a grown</v>

497
00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 1>man crying on the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not if he's crying because his kid</v>

498
00:19:14.701 --> 00:19:17.970
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like if you lost the election and</v>

499
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:19.350
<v Speaker 1>you're a grown man and you're crying.</v>

500
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.580
<v Speaker 1>And so I made a joke about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

501
00:19:20.581 --> 00:19:21.870
<v Speaker 1>how?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's funny.</v>

502
00:19:21.871 --> 00:19:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Every time people got so mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

503
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.710
<v Speaker 1>men can't cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

504
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.370
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men can cry over that pussy.</v>

505
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.283
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

506
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.590
<v Speaker 1>people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

507
00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:32.550
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it funny?</v>

508
00:19:32.551 --> 00:19:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

509
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess because he's crying over an</v>

510
00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:39.780
<v Speaker 1>election and he's a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't know where I grew up.</v>

511
00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:41.190
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still funny to me.</v>

512
00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.310
<v Speaker 1>It is funny because that's not a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>can keep it together.</v>

513
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a national disaster.</v>

514
00:19:46.501 --> 00:19:49.690
<v Speaker 1>It might become a national,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't at the time it was just a loss.</v>

515
00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Certainly a moment for concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

516
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.590
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get it.</v>

517
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.341
<v Speaker 1>And then people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

518
00:19:53.341 --> 00:19:54.240
<v Speaker 1>what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about,</v>

519
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:54.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay man?</v>

520
00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:55.441
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

521
00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:56.700
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are scared.</v>

522
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.110
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna lose your rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're scared.</v>

523
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

524
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I got scolded for grown men crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny to me,</v>

525
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:04.300
<v Speaker 1>not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

526
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's so many people</v>

527
00:20:06.691 --> 00:20:08.610
<v Speaker 1>making a grown man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crying is not funny.</v>

528
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:10.920
<v Speaker 1>What's funny is a grown man crying when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he shouldn't be crying.</v>

529
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's funny.</v>

530
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

531
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

532
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's still an instinct.</v>

533
00:20:15.121 --> 00:20:18.440
<v Speaker 1>You still have like a kind of a knee</v>
<v Speaker 1>jerk instinct to things sometimes that</v>

534
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.100
<v Speaker 1>just makes you laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you share that feeling at</v>

535
00:20:21.101 --> 00:20:22.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the wrong time,</v>

536
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.430
<v Speaker 1>you're immature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

537
00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:25.800
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll use charts and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flip side is,</v>

538
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.520
<v Speaker 1>is the right man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're killing everybody.</v>

539
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Snowflakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you say one thing that they</v>

540
00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:35.120
<v Speaker 1>don't want to hear and they want you on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox News talking about snowflakes to</v>

541
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.850
<v Speaker 1>like why chef Smith teaching go with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meghan Kelly the m and the lame stream.</v>

542
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.170
<v Speaker 1>NBC Indigo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

543
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that make you a snowflake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the same thing happened with Chris</v>

544
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Wallace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shepherd interview with rents,</v>

545
00:20:47.711 --> 00:20:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Priebus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people were like,</v>

546
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.560
<v Speaker 1>get him Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

547
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:51.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Wallace,</v>

548
00:20:51.371 --> 00:20:52.060
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

549
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.640
<v Speaker 1>his dad was Mike Wallace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's actually a journalist.</v>

550
00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:56.540
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

551
00:20:56.541 --> 00:20:58.570
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird time when you see</v>

552
00:20:58.571 --> 00:21:00.510
<v Speaker 1>journalists getting excluded from press</v>
<v Speaker 1>gaggle.</v>

553
00:21:00.511 --> 00:21:02.900
<v Speaker 1>So when you get the New York Times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

554
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.230
<v Speaker 1>who else was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was never a times la times.</v>

555
00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:06.760
<v Speaker 1>And then there was another big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

556
00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:07.594
<v Speaker 1>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN,</v>

557
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.850
<v Speaker 1>fuck the fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck.</v>

558
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when Obama was</v>
<v Speaker 1>considering removing Fox News from</v>

559
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:15.670
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Fox News is essentially</v>

560
00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:18.130
<v Speaker 1>propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to Sean Hannity,</v>

561
00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I've heard Sean Hannity is a wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

562
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I've heard he's a really nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you meet them with that</v>

563
00:21:23.181 --> 00:21:26.230
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker is spewing straight hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda.</v>

564
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:31.120
<v Speaker 1>He was the best point man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the grab my pussy shit came up.</v>

565
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:36.100
<v Speaker 1>He was the best because he just went</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking straight to Bengazi.</v>

566
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.000
<v Speaker 1>He went straight to the email scandal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he fucking hammered it constantly to</v>

567
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:41.020
<v Speaker 1>the point where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

568
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:42.580
<v Speaker 1>locker room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk aside,</v>

569
00:21:42.581 --> 00:21:43.900
<v Speaker 1>he circled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could certainly say that was</v>

570
00:21:43.901 --> 00:21:45.670
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get to the facts.</v>

571
00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Your let's get to what's important and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just Bam.</v>

572
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Bam is a big trump ally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

573
00:21:50.521 --> 00:21:53.070
<v Speaker 1>but he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's good at what he does now.</v>

574
00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.610
<v Speaker 1>He is very good at what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean when that was going on with</v>

575
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.070
<v Speaker 1>against Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

576
00:21:58.071 --> 00:21:59.800
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck are we having these people?</v>

577
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Even why we even pretending they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>press.</v>

578
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.750
<v Speaker 1>This is not journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

579
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.800
<v Speaker 1>this is a propaganda network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

580
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

581
00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:10.690
<v Speaker 1>You remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 2009 in Obama almost had them</v>

582
00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:11.900
<v Speaker 1>removed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people protested.</v>

583
00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:12.371
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

584
00:22:12.371 --> 00:22:14.020
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Trump.</v>

585
00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Know he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

586
00:22:15.881 --> 00:22:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even going to the press</v>
<v Speaker 1>correspondents' dinner.</v>

587
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.800
<v Speaker 1>That to me is he talked about being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy dude.</v>

588
00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're scared,</v>

589
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.550
<v Speaker 1>you're scared to get made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's him being scared.</v>

590
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.920
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking the whole time like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

591
00:22:26.921 --> 00:22:29.080
<v Speaker 1>what comedian gets to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great gig.</v>

592
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy will go after you.</v>

593
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem is you make fun of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dude and then like you'll all of a</v>

594
00:22:34.991 --> 00:22:39.040
<v Speaker 1>sudden like you have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting all of this more than</v>

595
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:42.100
<v Speaker 1>audited men more than audited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're probably search your emails and</v>

596
00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.770
<v Speaker 1>find some incriminating shit that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might've did when you were in high</v>

597
00:22:44.771 --> 00:22:46.270
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then.</v>

598
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.420
<v Speaker 1>But then part of me is like kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth it to get standup.</v>

599
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Kind of kind of stand up on the stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>next to trump and just be like,</v>

600
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:53.440
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

601
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would definitely get mad press for</v>

602
00:22:56.261 --> 00:22:57.390
<v Speaker 1>doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

603
00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would.</v>

604
00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.340
<v Speaker 1>He would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

605
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.020
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't handle it well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when Obama was roast him</v>

606
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.530
<v Speaker 1>and he just sat there and stared in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>face?</v>

607
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's,</v>

608
00:23:06.891 --> 00:23:08.050
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird time,</v>

609
00:23:08.051 --> 00:23:10.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like when Obama said,</v>

610
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.320
<v Speaker 1>we have video of my actual birth for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time,</v>

611
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:16.510
<v Speaker 1>we're going to release this and they go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the lion king,</v>

612
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:18.730
<v Speaker 1>lion king cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>

613
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Obama was fucking good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty funny,</v>

614
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.480
<v Speaker 1>funny president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

615
00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:26.650
<v Speaker 1>You mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

616
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I still to this day I think that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably as far as like as a human</v>

617
00:23:31.511 --> 00:23:34.750
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not not as like I hate presidential</v>

618
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:38.350
<v Speaker 1>speeches because I hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate that whole political talk.</v>

619
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I hate the way people talk right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not a real person and he is</v>

620
00:23:43.661 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 1>like the king of the pause is a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake,</v>

621
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:48.830
<v Speaker 1>stupid artistic five second pause.</v>

622
00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I mean he's just good at that kind</v>

623
00:23:51.101 --> 00:23:55.070
<v Speaker 1>of shit and there's a thing too that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't particularly like that but I get</v>

624
00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:57.260
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean as far as like being like a</v>

625
00:23:57.261 --> 00:24:00.050
<v Speaker 1>representative of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was intelligent.</v>

626
00:24:00.051 --> 00:24:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Well read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget his policies aside.</v>

627
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:07.520
<v Speaker 1>There's something about who the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in charge is what it says about the</v>

628
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:10.970
<v Speaker 1>rest of us and what it says about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of us now as it were,</v>

629
00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:13.820
<v Speaker 1>a disorganized mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what it says.</v>

630
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

631
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.840
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could tell you this though.</v>

632
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Trump is not wrong about CNN hating him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's not wrong.</v>

633
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.250
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watch the election and everything</v>

634
00:24:25.251 --> 00:24:28.130
<v Speaker 1>leading up to the election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did not like him.</v>

635
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Even the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the images they use of him and they</v>

636
00:24:30.171 --> 00:24:34.320
<v Speaker 1>were pretty openly against him and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

637
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.750
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked at the daily show.</v>

638
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I watched a lot of CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched a lot of MSNBC.</v>

639
00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.470
<v Speaker 1>There's problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have problems with all of those cable</v>

640
00:24:40.471 --> 00:24:42.340
<v Speaker 1>news now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you because you and,</v>

641
00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:47.240
<v Speaker 1>and I really think that like the cult of</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality media thing.</v>

642
00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:50.210
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my biggest issue with cable news is that</v>

643
00:24:50.211 --> 00:24:53.180
<v Speaker 1>there are in the same rating system as</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Big Bang theory.</v>

644
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.390
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like they're trying to get.</v>

645
00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're trying to get numbers.</v>

646
00:24:59.601 --> 00:25:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all they're trying to do.</v>

647
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the goal of Sean Hannity show</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

648
00:25:04.551 --> 00:25:08.780
<v Speaker 1>or ac three 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of these shows is to get people to</v>

649
00:25:08.781 --> 00:25:11.540
<v Speaker 1>watch so they can sell ad time because</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they can make money.</v>

650
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:14.090
<v Speaker 1>So that's my issue with it more than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

651
00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.450
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them were bad at journalism.</v>

652
00:25:17.451 --> 00:25:18.284
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

653
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me to forget things like</v>

654
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:25.300
<v Speaker 1>balloon boy when we were at war in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan and Iraq and like they think</v>

655
00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:29.960
<v Speaker 1>a kid stuck in a weather balloon and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have like seven hours of coverage of a</v>

656
00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:32.640
<v Speaker 1>weather balloon floating down the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a live chop recovered.</v>

657
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:33.950
<v Speaker 1>And then it turned out the kid was</v>
<v Speaker 1>hiding,</v>

658
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:38.180
<v Speaker 1>the dad was a prankster or whatever for</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the point is done.</v>

659
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did I have to watch that for four</v>

660
00:25:40.521 --> 00:25:41.660
<v Speaker 1>hours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

661
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:46.510
<v Speaker 1>So it's like if a shiny thing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they run towards the shiny thing they</v>

662
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.930
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're immature,</v>

663
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.820
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking to be the first.</v>

664
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.670
<v Speaker 1>They never talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like flint,</v>

665
00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

666
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:55.950
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when was the last time,</v>

667
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.150
<v Speaker 1>like people that don't have water still</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they live in America still,</v>

668
00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.590
<v Speaker 1>but the media is not talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

669
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:04.590
<v Speaker 1>they're talking right now about Kelly</v>
<v Speaker 1>conway putting their feet,</v>

670
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.620
<v Speaker 1>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet,</v>

671
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:05.570
<v Speaker 1>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes on.</v>

672
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:07.730
<v Speaker 1>It's what I want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in another words,</v>

673
00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.290
<v Speaker 1>God Damn White House,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couch pitch.</v>

674
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.580
<v Speaker 1>So if they get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get,</v>

675
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.730
<v Speaker 1>they get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people are mad about that</v>

676
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.090
<v Speaker 1>like they're like disrespect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespectful.</v>

677
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.550
<v Speaker 1>If the guy was sitting like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you got to imagine this scotch</v>

678
00:26:16.551 --> 00:26:17.240
<v Speaker 1>guarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit.</v>

679
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.670
<v Speaker 1>If Obama was sitting like that on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>couch,</v>

680
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:21.530
<v Speaker 1>do you want me to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gay rumors would come out about him.</v>

681
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Shell Obama was sitting like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>

682
00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People be so angry.</v>

683
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.730
<v Speaker 1>I would say about the things people say</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Michelle Obama.</v>

684
00:26:28.731 --> 00:26:31.160
<v Speaker 1>She has her shoes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

685
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:35.600
<v Speaker 1>That is just UNAMERICAN shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bubble gum all over the fucking White</v>

686
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.140
<v Speaker 1>House couch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dare You lady dog shit.</v>

687
00:26:39.141 --> 00:26:42.320
<v Speaker 1>And bubblegum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real problem with what the news</v>

688
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:47.160
<v Speaker 1>is because it's not really the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an entertainment show featuring</v>

689
00:26:47.161 --> 00:26:50.820
<v Speaker 1>events in the news and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are 100 percent bias.</v>

690
00:26:50.821 --> 00:26:54.090
<v Speaker 1>There's no real journalism on television</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to TV news.</v>

691
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:58.920
<v Speaker 1>PBS is they're pretty liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also very boring.</v>

692
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.170
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not trying to Zazi you know,</v>

693
00:27:01.171 --> 00:27:02.280
<v Speaker 1>they'll look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's happening.</v>

694
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.490
<v Speaker 1>That's what we need though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to be able to formulate your</v>

695
00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:08.100
<v Speaker 1>own opinions and when you're being</v>
<v Speaker 1>steered in one way or another,</v>

696
00:27:08.101 --> 00:27:12.750
<v Speaker 1>whether it's steered by bill o'reilly or</v>
<v Speaker 1>steered by someone on the left,</v>

697
00:27:12.751 --> 00:27:15.750
<v Speaker 1>it's the who the fuck is like a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>reporter for CNN.</v>

698
00:27:15.751 --> 00:27:17.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Cooper.</v>

699
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:18.910
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll put it.</v>

700
00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.820
<v Speaker 1>We'll put her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a wolf blitzer the other day in</v>

701
00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran into him.</v>

702
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

703
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe he doesn't like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit his head for hookers with him.</v>

704
00:27:27.631 --> 00:27:30.390
<v Speaker 1>He's walking into the did and high five</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

705
00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to smoke a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I will say about Fox is</v>

706
00:27:34.051 --> 00:27:36.930
<v Speaker 1>like their opinion guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>o'reilly Hannity,</v>

707
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.190
<v Speaker 1>that kind of have them under opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

708
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Versus like Anderson Cooper is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>

709
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:44.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>

710
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.480
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think Anderson?</v>

711
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I think Anderson Cooper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my take on him is clearly,</v>

712
00:27:50.491 --> 00:27:52.020
<v Speaker 1>he's very left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

713
00:27:52.021 --> 00:27:53.960
<v Speaker 1>He's a gay guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

714
00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

715
00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.680
<v Speaker 1>but he's also a vanderbilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

716
00:27:58.681 --> 00:28:00.930
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also worked for the CIA when he</v>

717
00:28:00.931 --> 00:28:02.220
<v Speaker 1>was in college that I did not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

718
00:28:02.221 --> 00:28:02.610
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

719
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.111
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

720
00:28:03.111 --> 00:28:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

721
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:08.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the big concern is that Anderson</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cooper is embedded CIA journalist.</v>

722
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the big CIA conspiracy theory.</v>

723
00:28:11.731 --> 00:28:12.391
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

724
00:28:12.391 --> 00:28:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that once you work for</v>

725
00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:17.790
<v Speaker 1>the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the fucking CIA.</v>

726
00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you always have a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact.</v>

727
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who used to be in the</v>

728
00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:23.750
<v Speaker 1>CIA and I still consider him and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>CIA,</v>

729
00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:24.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

730
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.521
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

731
00:28:25.521 --> 00:28:29.580
<v Speaker 1>another guy whose dad was in the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking dad still in the CIA</v>

732
00:28:29.581 --> 00:28:30.060
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

733
00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.220
<v Speaker 1>We'd figure you got to know a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>people over at this.</v>

734
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

735
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any CIA context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

736
00:28:34.951 --> 00:28:36.720
<v Speaker 1>it's like I used to work there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably have a few,</v>

737
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:40.860
<v Speaker 1>and this is the shitty comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I left the UFC I'd still be with</v>

738
00:28:40.861 --> 00:28:42.450
<v Speaker 1>the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

739
00:28:42.451 --> 00:28:43.261
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>

740
00:28:43.261 --> 00:28:46.950
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a giant bond that you've got to</v>

741
00:28:46.951 --> 00:28:49.890
<v Speaker 1>have with the fucking Central</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence Agency.</v>

742
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:51.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't fuck with those guys.</v>

743
00:28:51.541 --> 00:28:53.260
<v Speaker 1>You don't fuck them over and if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>call you,</v>

744
00:28:53.261 --> 00:28:55.070
<v Speaker 1>you answer the Goddamn phone hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

745
00:28:55.071 --> 00:28:55.904
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

746
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm still like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

747
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:59.460
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I really got rid of that when</v>

748
00:28:59.461 --> 00:29:01.190
<v Speaker 1>trump was being so hard on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

749
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.581
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

750
00:29:02.581 --> 00:29:05.160
<v Speaker 1>like I don't know man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all of those guys that the</v>

751
00:29:05.161 --> 00:29:08.310
<v Speaker 1>intelligence community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're the reasons we're safe.</v>

752
00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.380
<v Speaker 1>And when I say we're safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in New York City.</v>

753
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my attitude on terrorism is if you</v>

754
00:29:13.921 --> 00:29:17.390
<v Speaker 1>live in New York or a city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

755
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:20.760
<v Speaker 1>I always take issue with people and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveled to stand up and you know,</v>

756
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I make a joke about isis or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people go,</v>

757
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in small towns.</v>

758
00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:26.320
<v Speaker 1>But in big cities they laugh and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

759
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:29.940
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing to me that people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky,</v>

760
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.560
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's someone in the cave</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we've got to get Louis,</v>

761
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:34.080
<v Speaker 1>like it's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I mean?</v>

762
00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's this weird thing that starts</v>

763
00:29:36.181 --> 00:29:39.900
<v Speaker 1>to happen where people are using.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep seeing people post nine slash 11.</v>

764
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.360
<v Speaker 1>The World Trade Center is fire go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why the Muslim band makes sense.</v>

765
00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:45.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was their man like you,</v>

766
00:29:45.201 --> 00:29:47.280
<v Speaker 1>you can't just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to use that like you.</v>

767
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something very odd to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

768
00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about you.</v>

769
00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone hates New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everyone,</v>

770
00:29:54.161 --> 00:29:56.980
<v Speaker 1>but like real America doesn't consider</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York real,</v>

771
00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:58.690
<v Speaker 1>but the terrorist attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

772
00:29:58.691 --> 00:30:01.630
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very odd thing that's happened in</v>

773
00:30:01.631 --> 00:30:03.100
<v Speaker 1>the country and I know what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

774
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.050
<v Speaker 1>It feels like divided in the sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

775
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.940
<v Speaker 1>we hate everything you guys are about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll use that thing that impacted</v>

776
00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:13.600
<v Speaker 1>your lives as a way to gain our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make our point.</v>

777
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.880
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious what you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're saying we hate everything</v>

778
00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:17.950
<v Speaker 1>you're about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds just like the terrorists,</v>

779
00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:18.813
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

780
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.620
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking about someone from</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

781
00:30:20.621 --> 00:30:22.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very conservative part of the country</v>

782
00:30:22.121 --> 00:30:25.810
<v Speaker 1>saying we hate New York because New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the liberal elite and then you say,</v>

783
00:30:25.811 --> 00:30:29.320
<v Speaker 1>well the terrorists on the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist,</v>

784
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.550
<v Speaker 1>he fucked her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

785
00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird and there was a.</v>

786
00:30:32.841 --> 00:30:34.810
<v Speaker 1>There was a weird thing happening right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

787
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.340
<v Speaker 1>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do feel like the country is divided to</v>

788
00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:42.820
<v Speaker 1>a point of like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

789
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.280
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

790
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:46.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't see it on the Internet.</v>

791
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.860
<v Speaker 1>It's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got my.</v>

792
00:30:47.861 --> 00:30:52.861
<v Speaker 1>I got my news a lot from the daily show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I would watch the daily show and I</v>

793
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:56.070
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like John Stewart obviously I'm</v>

794
00:30:56.071 --> 00:30:59.020
<v Speaker 1>very left leaning guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also a very smart guy and a</v>

795
00:30:59.021 --> 00:31:01.840
<v Speaker 1>very funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he would talk about like events</v>

796
00:31:01.841 --> 00:31:05.260
<v Speaker 1>in the news and mock them and show clips</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mock the clips,</v>

797
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:08.770
<v Speaker 1>that to me is a way better version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would get.</v>

798
00:31:08.771 --> 00:31:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Like I can discern what's a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can discern how he's making fun,</v>

799
00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:16.660
<v Speaker 1>but then I will also get the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>information of these events from him as</v>

800
00:31:16.661 --> 00:31:17.200
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

801
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:21.310
<v Speaker 1>That to me is a way better version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>news entertainment than what fucking CNN</v>

802
00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:25.450
<v Speaker 1>is doing because with CNN is doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>having what are essentially actors like</v>

803
00:31:25.451 --> 00:31:28.720
<v Speaker 1>really boring people that are reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>some stupid shit off a teleprompter.</v>

804
00:31:28.721 --> 00:31:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Like you take fucking Anderson Cooper</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from the news.</v>

805
00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:32.980
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was Anderson Cooper?</v>

806
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.270
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting Dude,</v>

807
00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have him talk.</v>

808
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Have him give a speech somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have him talk to people,</v>

809
00:31:39.851 --> 00:31:42.250
<v Speaker 1>have him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have him do a standup routine.</v>

810
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.150
<v Speaker 1>He's boring as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you know what I'm saying.</v>

811
00:31:45.151 --> 00:31:47.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're watching an</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainer,</v>

812
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:50.330
<v Speaker 1>give you the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially what CNN is doing.</v>

813
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking John Stewart should be on CNN.</v>

814
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he'd have to like go to work</v>

815
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:55.510
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't want to do that.</v>

816
00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Is that what his deal is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to work,</v>

817
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

818
00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean he doesn't want the daily show</v>
<v Speaker 1>after so many years.</v>

819
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there for a long,</v>

820
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I talked to John a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it is just the feeling</v>

821
00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:08.660
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

822
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.800
<v Speaker 1>doing a talk show four nights a week</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day and calling through all that</v>

823
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:15.700
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we were giving people the little</v>

824
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:17.410
<v Speaker 1>golden nuggets that happened throughout</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>

825
00:32:17.411 --> 00:32:19.270
<v Speaker 1>But like we have to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

826
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:21.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were absorbing a lot of radiation</v>

827
00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:23.740
<v Speaker 1>from all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

828
00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:25.300
<v Speaker 1>like the closer you are to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>radiation,</v>

829
00:32:25.301 --> 00:32:28.570
<v Speaker 1>the more you know your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hair gets great and your soul hurts</v>

830
00:32:28.571 --> 00:32:29.980
<v Speaker 1>after a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think for John,</v>

831
00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:33.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think him leaving when he left</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a good way to do it.</v>

832
00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.110
<v Speaker 1>You can just make a bunch of money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

833
00:32:35.111 --> 00:32:35.740
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

834
00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:36.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even the money.</v>

835
00:32:36.701 --> 00:32:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he felt like.</v>

836
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 1>And he said it on the last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't there for the,</v>

837
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:41.870
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd stopped working there before he</v>

838
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.600
<v Speaker 1>retired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you just got to a point</v>

839
00:32:44.601 --> 00:32:46.850
<v Speaker 1>where he said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing this at the level I could</v>

840
00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:49.580
<v Speaker 1>do it at anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore someone else should do it.</v>

841
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

842
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.163
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

843
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.670
<v Speaker 1>he was just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did it,</v>

844
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:54.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think if you waited through this</v>

845
00:32:54.531 --> 00:32:55.580
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which people are like,</v>

846
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.810
<v Speaker 1>I wish he was still on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

847
00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now trump would be in and then</v>

848
00:32:58.941 --> 00:33:00.200
<v Speaker 1>everyone would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't quit now.</v>

849
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:01.243
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he'd be,</v>

850
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.930
<v Speaker 1>he'd be stuck in it forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

851
00:33:02.931 --> 00:33:06.170
<v Speaker 1>and I think he just wanted to walk away</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on the top,</v>

852
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way,</v>

853
00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like retire after a super bowl win kind</v>

854
00:33:09.801 --> 00:33:10.930
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

855
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.710
<v Speaker 1>people forget that he wasn't the</v>
<v Speaker 1>original hosts.</v>

856
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that fascinating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

857
00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Kilborne was what happened to that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

858
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.530
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never worked there with Gilbert and I</v>

859
00:33:18.531 --> 00:33:21.650
<v Speaker 1>started like six months after John</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stewart started and uh,</v>

860
00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.590
<v Speaker 1>so I've heard a lot of like funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>kilborne stories.</v>

861
00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Like he was a good dude and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>really funny guy,</v>

862
00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:30.410
<v Speaker 1>but like definitely much more of a read</v>
<v Speaker 1>the teleprompter.</v>

863
00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:35.570
<v Speaker 1>He read what they put in the prompts or</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of ragging Ron Burgundy style.</v>

864
00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Diego.</v>

865
00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

866
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.370
<v Speaker 1>when John came on and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really a writer,</v>

867
00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:46.850
<v Speaker 1>producer mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was definitely a sea change that</v>

868
00:33:46.851 --> 00:33:50.060
<v Speaker 1>the show of like the writers wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The original writers go like,</v>

869
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:51.890
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Buddy,</v>

870
00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:53.330
<v Speaker 1>don't ruin our little show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

871
00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.980
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you understand how this</v>

872
00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:56.060
<v Speaker 1>is gonna work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

873
00:33:56.061 --> 00:33:58.380
<v Speaker 1>there was a little hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like a clash a little bit,</v>

874
00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:58.940
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

875
00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.760
<v Speaker 1>What was their vision that he was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to read whatever they wrote.</v>

876
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:02.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>

877
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

878
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.440
<v Speaker 1>But he's a really funny comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't they want him to contribute</v>

879
00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:07.970
<v Speaker 1>and make it funnier?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

880
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it worked out in his favor and his</v>

881
00:34:09.951 --> 00:34:12.290
<v Speaker 1>contributions ended up making the show</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty obviously.</v>

882
00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.330
<v Speaker 1>But Egos are a motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

883
00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:16.490
<v Speaker 1>It's an odd thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

884
00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Comedy writers are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

885
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:22.400
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a thing with comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>writers where it's we have this special</v>

886
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:24.470
<v Speaker 1>unique skill and it is a skill and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

887
00:34:24.471 --> 00:34:25.304
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

888
00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.810
<v Speaker 1>I've done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do it like,</v>

889
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.240
<v Speaker 1>it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

890
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.750
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

891
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:33.680
<v Speaker 1>the Internet to me taught me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Internet was when it really</v>

892
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:35.780
<v Speaker 1>became the Internet the last 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

893
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.660
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet like there's just some funny dudes</v>

894
00:34:38.661 --> 00:34:41.840
<v Speaker 1>who live in the middle of nowhere and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's as funny as anyone I've ever met</v>

895
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:43.400
<v Speaker 1>and they just never had access to this.</v>

896
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:48.400
<v Speaker 1>They never had access to la or tv or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even knew how to the wildest dreams.</v>

897
00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.760
<v Speaker 1>How do you get into this business?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like we don't have to</v>

898
00:34:52.761 --> 00:34:56.510
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea is just to get your</v>

899
00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.930
<v Speaker 1>message out or get your comedy out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just do that on instagram now.</v>

900
00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was super lucky in that.</v>

901
00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on a really unusual sitcom in news</v>

902
00:35:04.961 --> 00:35:06.620
<v Speaker 1>radio and not unusual in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was funny,</v>

903
00:35:06.621 --> 00:35:09.710
<v Speaker 1>but unusual in that Paul Simms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the executive producers,</v>

904
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:14.780
<v Speaker 1>he has almost zero ego and so if Dave</v>
<v Speaker 1>Foley came up with a funnier line or</v>

905
00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Stephen root came up with a funnier</v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

906
00:35:16.371 --> 00:35:16.851
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

907
00:35:16.851 --> 00:35:19.880
<v Speaker 1>go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like instantaneously would drop whatever</v>

908
00:35:19.881 --> 00:35:24.881
<v Speaker 1>the old line was and go with their line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my whole take on comedy on television</v>

909
00:35:25.521 --> 00:35:30.521
<v Speaker 1>was poisoned like early on by dare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generosity and lack of ego.</v>

910
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.600
<v Speaker 1>So like when I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we would do that show,</v>

911
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:37.500
<v Speaker 1>like Dave Foley would rewrite whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking scenes when we do genius genius,</v>

912
00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:40.040
<v Speaker 1>secret producer of that show in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways in.</v>

913
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.790
<v Speaker 1>But they wanted him to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

914
00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:44.520
<v Speaker 1>let's just make the best show we can and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody would contribute.</v>

915
00:35:44.521 --> 00:35:47.340
<v Speaker 1>So there was never any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would do other things and when I</v>

916
00:35:47.341 --> 00:35:49.700
<v Speaker 1>would do other things and when someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have a better line and the right</v>

917
00:35:49.701 --> 00:35:50.340
<v Speaker 1>it's got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

918
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.390
<v Speaker 1>let's stick with the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

919
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.070
<v Speaker 1>that aligns way better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

920
00:35:53.071 --> 00:35:54.300
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't,</v>

921
00:35:54.301 --> 00:35:56.010
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to try that line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

922
00:35:56.011 --> 00:35:58.140
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some weird ego shit going on</v>

923
00:35:58.141 --> 00:36:02.880
<v Speaker 1>here were the writers didn't want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced by some standup comic who is on</v>

924
00:36:02.881 --> 00:36:06.060
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that some David spade type</v>

925
00:36:06.061 --> 00:36:09.880
<v Speaker 1>character or whatever they've been had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been rendered irrelevant at that.</v>

926
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants somebody else to come in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do the thing they think that they</v>

927
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.340
<v Speaker 1>need to be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to protect their existence.</v>

928
00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.730
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean every show like for me at the</v>

929
00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:19.560
<v Speaker 1>daily show and then the nightly show you</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was running,</v>

930
00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I didn't start running the daily show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started as a PA,</v>

931
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:25.530
<v Speaker 1>but like I ultimately ended up being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>executive producer before I left and</v>

932
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:29.100
<v Speaker 1>same with the nightly show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My attitude with all of those shows was</v>

933
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.520
<v Speaker 1>all I cared about was the show being as</v>
<v Speaker 1>good as it could be.</v>

934
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really care where the idea came</v>

935
00:36:34.741 --> 00:36:38.730
<v Speaker 1>from or that the goal was every night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best show possible now.</v>

936
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.170
<v Speaker 1>What was your experience doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nightly show?</v>

937
00:36:40.171 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 1>How long did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we did it,</v>

938
00:36:41.491 --> 00:36:43.290
<v Speaker 1>we were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were on the air for a year and a</v>

939
00:36:43.291 --> 00:36:43.500
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>

940
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.190
<v Speaker 1>My experience there was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved the people.</v>

941
00:36:45.191 --> 00:36:46.140
<v Speaker 1>What happened to the show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

942
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it didn't work because,</v>

943
00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.910
<v Speaker 1>well there's a lot of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it didn't work,</v>

944
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:55.210
<v Speaker 1>but mainly it takes a talk show a while</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what it,</v>

945
00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:58.320
<v Speaker 1>what it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you watched the last six</v>

946
00:36:58.321 --> 00:37:01.980
<v Speaker 1>months of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really like started nailing it.</v>

947
00:37:01.981 --> 00:37:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Like we really had something special and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we figured it out.</v>

948
00:37:05.491 --> 00:37:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Like we got the groove down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We figured out what the,</v>

949
00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.320
<v Speaker 1>what the acts were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were the kind of stories we were</v>

950
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:14.100
<v Speaker 1>tackling and it takes that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in figuring that out,</v>

951
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Stewart left the daily show.</v>

952
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.450
<v Speaker 1>So our lead in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

953
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:23.160
<v Speaker 1>this is another new trevor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our leading was now a new host of</v>

954
00:37:23.161 --> 00:37:25.770
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the audience gave us a chance</v>

955
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.840
<v Speaker 1>which any audience would when we first</v>
<v Speaker 1>aired.</v>

956
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:31.050
<v Speaker 1>And the show wasn't quite there yet as</v>
<v Speaker 1>no show is,</v>

957
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.560
<v Speaker 1>but they gave us a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when John Left,</v>

958
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I think they had already given us our</v>
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>

959
00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:41.370
<v Speaker 1>So by the time we found the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like meaning within the show,</v>

960
00:37:41.371 --> 00:37:43.650
<v Speaker 1>but by the time we made it good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>really figured out what it was,</v>

961
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.820
<v Speaker 1>the audience was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy,</v>

962
00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.410
<v Speaker 1>now we already tried that yet we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>

963
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.200
<v Speaker 1>And to come back now and try it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better now.</v>

964
00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:50.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a ratings issue.</v>

965
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ratings,</v>

966
00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.460
<v Speaker 1>ratings for both shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

967
00:37:53.461 --> 00:37:54.600
<v Speaker 1>late nights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tough right now man.</v>

968
00:37:54.601 --> 00:37:57.320
<v Speaker 1>And also don't forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the nightly show was on 11 slash</v>

969
00:37:57.321 --> 00:37:59.000
<v Speaker 1>30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It replaced co bear.</v>

970
00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:02.670
<v Speaker 1>But coverity didn't go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just went to a bigger show at 1130.</v>

971
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:06.120
<v Speaker 1>So now you have an unknown dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry.</v>

972
00:38:06.121 --> 00:38:07.890
<v Speaker 1>One more who's amazing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he wasn't.</v>

973
00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.200
<v Speaker 1>He do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just didn't know.</v>

974
00:38:10.201 --> 00:38:11.520
<v Speaker 1>What does he do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See a comic.</v>

975
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Larry was a producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a comic originally and it</v>

976
00:38:14.641 --> 00:38:16.470
<v Speaker 1>producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he created the Bernie Mac show.</v>

977
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.200
<v Speaker 1>He created it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been producing and writing</v>

978
00:38:19.201 --> 00:38:21.360
<v Speaker 1>television like every show you've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>liked.</v>

979
00:38:21.361 --> 00:38:22.260
<v Speaker 1>He's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

980
00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:26.340
<v Speaker 1>So how did he get behind the camera?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he was on the daily show,</v>

981
00:38:26.341 --> 00:38:31.341
<v Speaker 1>he was our senior black correspondent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he would come in like once a month</v>

982
00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:35.830
<v Speaker 1>and do like a thing about racial issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>in America and then really stewart</v>

983
00:38:35.831 --> 00:38:38.410
<v Speaker 1>really wanted to do a show about race</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

984
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson was going on,</v>

985
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:42.580
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he wanted to do a show that was more</v>

986
00:38:42.581 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 1>of a conversation about race minority</v>
<v Speaker 1>report.</v>

987
00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.740
<v Speaker 1>And when John called me I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

988
00:38:47.741 --> 00:38:48.401
<v Speaker 1>that sounds fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

989
00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:49.990
<v Speaker 1>and I want you to be the token white</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

990
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:52.720
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like meaning I could be the dude on the</v>

991
00:38:52.721 --> 00:38:57.721
<v Speaker 1>panel who's either playing the defensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>role or the aggressive role in talking</v>

992
00:38:58.301 --> 00:39:00.940
<v Speaker 1>about some of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it ended up being a lot more of a</v>

993
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:05.260
<v Speaker 1>daily show kind of show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we had like much more of an act one</v>

994
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.570
<v Speaker 1>footage news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

995
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.330
<v Speaker 1>we did a lot of sketches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for me it was a great experience.</v>

996
00:39:10.331 --> 00:39:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I got like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a real now,</v>

997
00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I real?</v>

998
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:14.680
<v Speaker 1>It's on my website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like me,</v>

999
00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I was wearing mustaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing accents,</v>

1000
00:39:17.251 --> 00:39:19.480
<v Speaker 1>like I was playing w we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started doing fuse.</v>

1001
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:24.510
<v Speaker 1>What for me was my dream of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the daily show topics with the</v>

1002
00:39:24.731 --> 00:39:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Conan O'brien and absurdity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we would do stuff like,</v>

1003
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of my favorites was when that,</v>

1004
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Bernardino shooting happened and</v>

1005
00:39:32.831 --> 00:39:34.240
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to get in that guy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

1006
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Larry notes that everyone in the news</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going,</v>

1007
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.320
<v Speaker 1>we've got to get back door access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>backdoor access,</v>

1008
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:39.850
<v Speaker 1>backdoor access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>backdoor access.</v>

1009
00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.000
<v Speaker 1>So we did a bit where I was a backdoor</v>
<v Speaker 1>access expert,</v>

1010
00:39:43.001 --> 00:39:44.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was like just a creepy dude in a</v>

1011
00:39:44.741 --> 00:39:47.230
<v Speaker 1>basement with like a mustache and like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mesh shirt.</v>

1012
00:39:47.231 --> 00:39:48.220
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah baby,</v>

1013
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.930
<v Speaker 1>you want to get in the back door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry,</v>

1014
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:51.580
<v Speaker 1>you can't come at it so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1015
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:55.270
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were talking about real issues and</v>

1016
00:39:55.271 --> 00:39:58.570
<v Speaker 1>then playing with like sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it really got funny and good.</v>

1017
00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:02.440
<v Speaker 1>But I think by the time it got funny and</v>
<v Speaker 1>good comedy central was like,</v>

1018
00:40:02.441 --> 00:40:03.580
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got other problems.</v>

1019
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Are you happier now just doing standup?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1020
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Now when I ran into you in Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a fucking fun night,</v>

1021
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.040
<v Speaker 1>that was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1022
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.460
<v Speaker 1>It was a fun night of Roy was there the</v>
<v Speaker 1>night that Chappelle showed up at my,</v>

1023
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late show on Friday night.</v>

1024
00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.840
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching you so sick because I</v>

1025
00:40:16.841 --> 00:40:19.960
<v Speaker 1>knew we were going to go on afterwards</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have some drinks and chat and then</v>

1026
00:40:19.961 --> 00:40:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Chappelle came in and at the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>cellar in New York,</v>

1027
00:40:22.841 --> 00:40:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Chappelle comes in a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he comes down with a seller,</v>

1028
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.673
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1029
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.060
<v Speaker 1>he'll be on stage for seven hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1030
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll go on stage sometimes for like</v>

1031
00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:34.120
<v Speaker 1>five hours and five hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five hours.</v>

1032
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like regularly.</v>

1033
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Not regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it happens to the point where like</v>

1034
00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:41.330
<v Speaker 1>some dude in the back of sweeping up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1035
00:40:41.331 --> 00:40:42.540
<v Speaker 1>It'd be crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Denver people don't have the stamina</v>

1048
00:41:00.221 --> 00:41:03.160
<v Speaker 1>that New York City people have to think.</v>

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.660
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never really hung out with them.</v>

1060

<v Speaker 1>it was one of those things where I'm</v>

1068
00:41:35.901 --> 00:41:37.010
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I say like,</v>

1071
00:41:42.351 --> 00:41:43.550
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was definitely like,</v>

1072
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.890
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you ever have that where you can't</v>

1073
00:41:45.891 --> 00:41:48.320

1077
00:41:54.981 --> 00:41:58.160
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting because I don't see</v>

<v Speaker 1>Make a left.</v>

1090
00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.330
<v Speaker 1>And then she just drives away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

<v Speaker 1>UFC legend Joe Rogan,</v>

00:42:46.761 --> 00:42:47.620
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>smoking weed to two different places</v>

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.610
<v Speaker 1>he's like missing A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:22.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's why he's so good on stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he really doesn't give a shit.</v>

1114

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:12.400
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about those</v>
<v Speaker 2>Improv's that like,</v>

1264
00:49:12.401 --> 00:49:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Houston used to have like a big scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to have the laptop stop in</v>

1265
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:18.640
<v Speaker 2>river oaks was a huge scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennison started out there,</v>

1266
00:49:18.641 --> 00:49:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Bill Hicks was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those guys were there,</v>

1267
00:49:20.321 --> 00:49:25.321
<v Speaker 2>like Hicks did one of his early dvds at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the laptop and then it became,</v>

1268
00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.410
<v Speaker 2>the Improv was in town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the laptop went under,</v>

1269
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.650
<v Speaker 2>they moved locations and they went under</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the Improv opened up and then</v>

1270
00:49:32.651 --> 00:49:34.840
<v Speaker 2>it was like a headliner club where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1271
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Tracy Morgan wanted to be there or this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy would be there,</v>

1272
00:49:37.181 --> 00:49:40.030
<v Speaker 2>but it would always be big name</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians and that was it.</v>

1273
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.220
<v Speaker 2>And so like the local scene sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dwindled.</v>

1274
00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:44.200
<v Speaker 2>I've heard it's sort of started making a</v>
<v Speaker 2>comeback,</v>

1275
00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.320
<v Speaker 2>but the windled but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1276
00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:49.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think when you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I feel like I'm doing.</v>

1277
00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing laugh out loud in San Antonio.</v>

1278
00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:52.690
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1279
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:53.800
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1280
00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:55.360
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're touring everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1281
00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:55.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1282
00:49:55.841 --> 00:49:57.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hopefully taping an hour in the</v>

1283
00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:58.180
<v Speaker 2>spring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1284
00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.300
<v Speaker 2>for who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1285
00:49:59.360 --> 00:49:59.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1286
00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:02.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm allowed to say or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not can say an official.</v>

1287
00:50:02.521 --> 00:50:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1288
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:04.930
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1289
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:06.890
<v Speaker 2>here's what you're saying with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1290
00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:08.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how this business works.</v>

1291
00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Like until I see it on the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tell him like I don't believe I have</v>

1292
00:50:13.001 --> 00:50:16.240
<v Speaker 2>anything until I have it until you sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yet we're even just like,</v>

1293
00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:20.330
<v Speaker 2>once it's like taped and I'm sitting at</v>
<v Speaker 2>home and I go everyone turn on Blah Blah</v>

1294
00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Blah Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1295
00:50:21.311 --> 00:50:25.450
<v Speaker 2>this business always feels like you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>one head of a network getting fired away</v>

1296
00:50:25.451 --> 00:50:27.170
<v Speaker 2>from not having the thing you thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have.</v>

1297
00:50:27.171 --> 00:50:28.004
<v Speaker 2>So I try</v>

1298
00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:31.190
<v Speaker 1>to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only superstitious but just like,</v>

1299
00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like one way or the other.</v>

1300
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Ob tape tape in my era in the spring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

1301
00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:36.740
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>

1302
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:39.430
<v Speaker 1>When the nightly show ended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was bummed.</v>

1303
00:50:39.431 --> 00:50:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted the show to be on for 10 years</v>

1304
00:50:41.421 --> 00:50:44.030
<v Speaker 1>or 20 for everybody who worked there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but personally speaking,</v>

1305
00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:47.770
<v Speaker 1>my goal with the nightly show was never</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay there as the executive producer</v>

1306
00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:49.310
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My goal was to launch it and get it</v>

1307
00:50:49.311 --> 00:50:52.220
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of teach everyone how to do it</v>

1308
00:50:52.221 --> 00:50:54.530
<v Speaker 1>because it was the daily show model that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

1309
00:50:54.531 --> 00:50:56.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know how to do that very well.</v>

1310
00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:02.020
<v Speaker 1>And then my hope was I would just be on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show and like slowly relinquished my</v>

1311
00:51:02.631 --> 00:51:05.930
<v Speaker 1>authority of running it to other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I could work from like noon to three</v>

1312
00:51:05.931 --> 00:51:08.490
<v Speaker 1>and then just do stand up goal a three</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>

1313
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.640
<v Speaker 1>three hour workday and being on time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1314
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.650
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not my,</v>

1315
00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:16.850
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't my goal yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My goal was to get the show successful</v>

1316
00:51:16.851 --> 00:51:18.950
<v Speaker 1>before I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when it got canceled I was,</v>

1317
00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:20.960
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty bummed and I was pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointed.</v>

1318
00:51:20.961 --> 00:51:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I put a lot of time into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1319
00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:24.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me it was like,</v>

1320
00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:25.970
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I want to go on the road anyway.</v>

1321
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.940
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had my whole fall book so I didn't</v>

1322
00:51:28.941 --> 00:51:30.690
<v Speaker 1>really know how I was going to manage</v>
<v Speaker 1>both anyway.</v>

1323
00:51:30.691 --> 00:51:31.221
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1324
00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:33.440
<v Speaker 1>well there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got my real and got my own camera</v>

1325
00:51:33.441 --> 00:51:35.600
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which to me is just the thing you need</v>

1326
00:51:35.601 --> 00:51:37.010
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w when you're pitching something to</v>

1327
00:51:37.011 --> 00:51:37.790
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

1328
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:39.420
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to be in this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been on TV?</v>

1329
00:51:39.421 --> 00:51:39.810
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1330
00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:40.643
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

1331
00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Like you just need proof of your ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

1332
00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:44.760
<v Speaker 1>And I got that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1333
00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:47.720
<v Speaker 1>that's the fucked up thing about doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything on a network because you have</v>

1334
00:51:47.721 --> 00:51:51.040
<v Speaker 1>to get someone to agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree to use you agree to this,</v>

1335
00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:52.550
<v Speaker 1>agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all these people that aren't the</v>

1336
00:51:52.551 --> 00:51:55.370
<v Speaker 1>creative people but they have the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet and they're the ones that you have</v>

1337
00:51:55.371 --> 00:51:56.540
<v Speaker 1>to talk to about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1338
00:51:56.541 --> 00:51:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we've got this idea.</v>

1339
00:51:57.921 --> 00:51:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see your right there.</v>

1340
00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give you a money.</v>

1341
00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I should give you the covet at</v>
<v Speaker 1>8:00 PM slot.</v>

1342
00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1343
00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Kiss my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that gatekeeper model is dying,</v>

1344
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:11.420
<v Speaker 1>it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

1345
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.900
<v Speaker 1>And what you need now is a room with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>

1346
00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's literally all you need is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the space to fail and whatever you're</v>

1347
00:52:18.261 --> 00:52:22.190
<v Speaker 1>filming the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the budget to afford cameras and the</v>

1348
00:52:22.191 --> 00:52:25.050
<v Speaker 1>ability to stream and upload things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just need to adjust it.</v>

1349
00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.440
<v Speaker 1>A little venture capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just did this thing even need a</v>

1350
00:52:27.441 --> 00:52:28.550
<v Speaker 1>venture capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1351
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:31.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean you just need somebody to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like 100 grand unless you have it,</v>

1352
00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:33.230
<v Speaker 1>you need a 100 grand to do what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1353
00:52:33.231 --> 00:52:34.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on what you're looking to</v>

1354
00:52:34.581 --> 00:52:35.391
<v Speaker 1>shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1355
00:52:35.391 --> 00:52:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying if you want like a sag</v>

1356
00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:39.440
<v Speaker 1>aftra level thing with like good camera</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

1357
00:52:39.450 --> 00:52:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Like you have a bunch of your friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you write it and you use a fucking</v>

1358
00:52:42.351 --> 00:52:44.480
<v Speaker 1>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of these things that you don't</v>

1359
00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:47.390
<v Speaker 1>need any of this feel like this is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange time when it comes to that</v>

1360
00:52:47.391 --> 00:52:49.160
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of people that are</v>

1361
00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:52.550
<v Speaker 1>still treating it as if it's like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>filming some movie.</v>

1362
00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their television show,</v>

1363
00:52:54.321 --> 00:52:57.170
<v Speaker 1>the big budget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also find too like the digital spaces</v>

1364
00:52:57.171 --> 00:52:59.720
<v Speaker 1>now or being taken over by the old</v>
<v Speaker 1>guard,</v>

1365
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.530
<v Speaker 1>so in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden like if you,</v>

1366
00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:03.900
<v Speaker 1>if you want to pitch something to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

1367
00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:06.260
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's a branch of NBC.</v>

1368
00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:10.380
<v Speaker 1>NBC is NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>NBC Business Affairs has to get,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well now I know I'm right back to where</v>

1371
00:53:13.101 --> 00:53:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I started when I don't want to just</v>
<v Speaker 1>pitching this to NBC,</v>

1372
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:18.710
<v Speaker 1>but they're doing a lot of standup</v>
<v Speaker 1>specials and standup specials for guys</v>

1373
00:53:18.711 --> 00:53:22.250
<v Speaker 1>like Stan hope and ideas and people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nick Depaulo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1384
00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:46.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I remembered that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>just came out on CSO and CSO.</v>

1386
00:53:49.201 --> 00:53:50.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

1387
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:54.600
<v Speaker 1>it is a branch of NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're uncentered and they're doing</v>

1388
00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:55.440
<v Speaker 1>great stuff.</v>

1389
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that.</v>

1390
00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a crazy statistic that I just</v>

1391
00:53:59.551 --> 00:54:00.720
<v Speaker 1>read yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ready for this.</v>

1392
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Netflix takes up one third of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth of the United States of</v>

1393
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.860
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One third one.</v>

1394
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:10.950
<v Speaker 1>All of the Internet bandwidth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One third of the bandwidth it's being</v>

1395
00:54:10.951 --> 00:54:13.860
<v Speaker 1>used in the United States of America is</v>
<v Speaker 1>through Netflix.</v>

1396
00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1397
00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

1398
00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:21.240
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With the other third,</v>

1399
00:54:21.241 --> 00:54:23.370
<v Speaker 1>like Pornhub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all two thirds corn,</v>

1400
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:28.020
<v Speaker 1>one aboves feet as buzzfeed dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the one that got killed by Hulk</v>

1401
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Hogan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gawker.</v>

1402
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Gawker killed by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget which one.</v>

1403
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Which one of those salacious sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So funny.</v>

1404
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's it.</v>

1405
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:41.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like those sites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like tmz is probably like one eighth pmc</v>

1406
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:45.450
<v Speaker 1>man juggernauts almost those little news</v>
<v Speaker 1>stations and you know,</v>

1407
00:54:45.451 --> 00:54:48.960
<v Speaker 1>youtube is probably a big chunk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook to people love facebook,</v>

1408
00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:50.360
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third Man,</v>

1409
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:52.680
<v Speaker 1>a third one that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1410
00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.780
<v Speaker 1>that's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you looked at a pie of the</v>

1411
00:54:54.781 --> 00:54:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one third is Netflix.</v>

1412
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:59.520
<v Speaker 1>That's what a lot of it's got to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're streaming video,</v>

1413
00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:01.650
<v Speaker 1>another word that that takes up a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth,</v>

1414
00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:04.470
<v Speaker 1>so it's not necessarily that that many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are using Netflix,</v>

1415
00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:06.780
<v Speaker 1>it's just that that the stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're using on Netflix,</v>

1416
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:09.180
<v Speaker 1>is that thick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1417
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:12.000
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's definitely a lot of people,</v>

1418
00:55:12.001 --> 00:55:14.040
<v Speaker 1>but it is definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's growing constantly.</v>

1419
00:55:14.041 --> 00:55:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Netflix is a goddamn snowball rolling</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1420
00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:19.770
<v Speaker 1>It has completely revolutionized and re</v>
<v Speaker 1>re invigorated.</v>

1421
00:55:19.771 --> 00:55:22.920
<v Speaker 1>This whole entertainment industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went and met with those guys while I</v>

1422
00:55:22.921 --> 00:55:26.240
<v Speaker 1>was out here because I've been out here</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like a month and a book.</v>

1423
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:30.460
<v Speaker 1>You want to talk about the difference of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take a meeting at like like a viacom</v>

1424
00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:33.210
<v Speaker 1>type place versus like a Netflix type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like netflix.</v>

1425

<v Speaker 1>Something that did $93.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Million people today is what I heard on</v>

<v Speaker 1>So 93 million people.</v>

1443
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:18.444

<v Speaker 1>$900 million a month.</v>

1445
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:24.020
<v Speaker 1>It's close to a billion dollars a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Printing money.</v>

1449
00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I did my first comedy special on Netflix</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2005.</v>

1450
00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.390
<v Speaker 2>That was my very first special was on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Netflix.</v>

1451
00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Getting a comedy special on Netflix now</v>
<v Speaker 2>is near impossible because it's</v>

1452
00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle and Chris Rock and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1453
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1454
00:56:46.701 --> 00:56:48.310

<v Speaker 2>but you're famous.</v>

1455
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:49.330
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1456
00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think they're doing some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>

1457
00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:54.220
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1458
00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:57.550
<v Speaker 2>they buy some to look if you do want and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you could sell it to them like they</v>

1459
00:56:57.551 --> 00:56:59.030
<v Speaker 2>bought Tony Hinchcliffe slash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1460
00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:01.870

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1464
00:57:06.071 --> 00:57:08.590
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd probably have to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger name.</v>

1465
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:11.080
<v Speaker 2>We'll say here's the trailer for the new</v>

<v Speaker 1>It wasn't good</v>

1538
00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:43.150
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shop twist,</v>

1539
00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:46.550
<v Speaker 1>watchable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made one good movie and then fucked</v>

1540
00:59:46.551 --> 00:59:48.370
<v Speaker 1>us all repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't.</v>

1541
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:50.700
<v Speaker 1>They can't stop giving them movies to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you.</v>

1542
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:54.760
<v Speaker 1>How many chances do you get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is the new one's supposed to split?</v>

1543
00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Personality one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is supposed to be in a good.</v>

1544
00:59:56.550 --> 00:59:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good.</v>

1545
00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.513
<v Speaker 1>Did you see it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1546
00:59:58.570 --> 01:00:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you see the one with mark?</v>

1547
01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Mark markets chased by the wind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was plants that were trying</v>

1548
01:00:03.651 --> 01:00:06.490
<v Speaker 1>to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was the wind might be of.</v>

1549
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:09.110
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the greatest bad movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen in my life.</v>

1550
01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just more Walberg running around.</v>

1551
01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.111
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1552
01:00:12.111 --> 01:00:13.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get in the fucking house.</v>

1553
01:00:13.311 --> 01:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the second house.</v>

1554
01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:19.220
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a branch closes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a second wind.</v>

1555
01:00:19.221 --> 01:00:22.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy in that movie who runs</v>

1556
01:00:22.011 --> 01:00:26.000
<v Speaker 1>himself over with his own lawnmower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mowed his lawn and then they cut</v>

1557
01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>away and they looked back and he's under</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1558
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.550
<v Speaker 1>The wind got them tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the wind's targeting individuals,</v>

1559
01:00:31.551 --> 01:00:33.860
<v Speaker 1>but when wants you to kill yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is what it is.</v>

1560
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably nature wanted you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill yourself.</v>

1561
01:00:36.711 --> 01:00:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like a smell that it was</v>

1562
01:00:37.911 --> 01:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>putting out or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1563
01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:41.930
<v Speaker 1>All I know is there's a scene where he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>running in a field and he's panicking</v>

1564
01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:43.880
<v Speaker 1>and the only thing that's happening is</v>
<v Speaker 1>grasses.</v>

1565
01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.650
<v Speaker 1>If nature to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen some of those giant</v>

1566
01:00:48.651 --> 01:00:52.630
<v Speaker 1>storm clouds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They photograph over the Kansas</v>

1567
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Cornfield and shit that are as big as</v>
<v Speaker 1>cities and these like,</v>

1568
01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.920
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't nature just do that thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it already does?</v>

1569
01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have to do some targets?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lawnmowers makes them run over asshole.</v>

1570
01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Like people are always trying to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>some new hook,</v>

1571
01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:13.070
<v Speaker 1>like the village or these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that it's 16,</v>

1572
01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:17.060
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really 2015 and they're living</v>

1573
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:19.840
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of a place where they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not allowed to fly planes.</v>

1574
01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:24.850
<v Speaker 1>They can't fly planes over this area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a no fly zone works.</v>

1575
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.090
<v Speaker 1>How big is this fucking no fly zone</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know if you know this,</v>

1576
01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.010
<v Speaker 1>but planes fly everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

1577
01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Even if they're outside the zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably still here one.</v>

1578
01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.970
<v Speaker 1>But here's the stupid thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walk in a,</v>

1579
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>in a short amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're at a road and then cars drive</v>

1580
01:01:40.161 --> 01:01:40.950
<v Speaker 1>by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

1581
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I ever saw the village and</v>

1582
01:01:42.591 --> 01:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>you should say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking terrible.</v>

1583
01:01:44.151 --> 01:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>I was taking a break from [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile and it took a little shy,</v>

1584
01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:49.370

1585
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:52.180
<v Speaker 1>But he did devil the one about a haunted</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevator.</v>

1586
01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:54.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did that.</v>

1587
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:55.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was him.</v>

1588
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't stop haunted.</v>

1589
01:01:56.871 --> 01:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Elevated the health insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1590
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.810
<v Speaker 1>you know what you should do if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1591
01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:01.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1592
01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Jordan peals horror movies supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be incredible.</v>

1593
01:02:05.271 --> 01:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1594
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:09.170
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I tried doing a comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1595
01:02:09.171 --> 01:02:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Why not mix it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try taking a nap break,</v>

1596
01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:15.250
<v Speaker 1>take a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made one good movie that's six slash</v>

1597
01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:17.900
<v Speaker 1>movie was good though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good movie.</v>

1598
01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>But often that happens with people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>how</v>

1599

<v Speaker 2>many bands have come out with one great</v>
<v Speaker 2>album and then they follow up is dog</v>

1600

01:02:31.231 --> 01:02:33.080
<v Speaker 2>then they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always put a nut.</v>

1603
01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge tennis fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I always pointed out to him he's the</v>

1604
01:02:36.001 --> 01:02:38.520
<v Speaker 2>best example of a guy who came out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gate,</v>

1605
01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:41.090
<v Speaker 2>like with the greatest of all time or</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest of all time.</v>

1606
01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I think priors the greatest of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But kennison is right up there like</v>

1607
01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:46.230
<v Speaker 2>number two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because people don't bring</v>

1608
01:02:46.231 --> 01:02:48.170
<v Speaker 2>him up in those conversations enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1609
01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:52.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying when you have the WHO's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best conversation about standup kinisons</v>

1610
01:02:52.171 --> 01:02:53.490
<v Speaker 2>name isn't even like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1611
01:02:53.491 --> 01:02:57.360
<v Speaker 2>they go with Carlin and all due respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think they're comparable.</v>

1612
01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:02.570
<v Speaker 2>Carlin was a great comic and his body of</v>
<v Speaker 2>work is fantastic and he just did a new</v>

1613
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.290
<v Speaker 2>hour every year for decades and.</v>

1614
01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:06.760
<v Speaker 2>But he had a lot of duds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1615
01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:09.720
<v Speaker 2>in the later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The later years were tough.</v>

1616
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:14.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of his later specials were</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot less.</v>

1617
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.700
<v Speaker 2>He was a lot less charming and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a lot more like we're all going to</v>

1618
01:03:18.701 --> 01:03:20.540
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are.</v>

1619
01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we definitely do it.</v>

1620
01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.490
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're older and have been watching you</v>

1621
01:03:23.491 --> 01:03:26.250
<v Speaker 2>for years and it doesn't look up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love but I love to.</v>

1622
01:03:26.251 --> 01:03:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean it jamming in New York to me is</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best hours of.</v>

1623
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1624
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.010
<v Speaker 2>he's got fantastic work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong,</v>

1625
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as funny as kinesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Best work.</v>

1626
01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Kinisons best work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he was doing like that bit about</v>

1627
01:03:38.371 --> 01:03:42.200
<v Speaker 2>the homosexual necrophilia acts are</v>
<v Speaker 2>paying money to spend a few hours of</v>

<v Speaker 2>And it kind of made me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was inspired.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't you guys just be with me all</v>

<v Speaker 2>looks good.</v>

1703
01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's still 10 years ago they were</v>

1704
01:06:21.821 --> 01:06:24.700
<v Speaker 2>in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like 10 years ago this whole thing</v>

1705
01:06:24.701 --> 01:06:25.660
<v Speaker 2>was kicking off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1706
01:06:25.661 --> 01:06:29.230
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago you look into 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was really the launch of the</v>

1707
01:06:29.231 --> 01:06:30.400
<v Speaker 2>digital space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1708
01:06:30.401 --> 01:06:33.100
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my netflix specials in 2005.</v>

1709
01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:38.130
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had netflix in 2005 and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at as like a joke and that's sort</v>

1710
01:06:38.171 --> 01:06:41.140
<v Speaker 2>of where at 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2007 things start ramping up.</v>

1711
01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.180
<v Speaker 2>And then digital became more and more of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big deal.</v>

1712
01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.710
<v Speaker 2>I remember people there was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>NBC had a different thing before cso</v>

1713
01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:49.630

<v Speaker 2>There was another name.</v>

1715
01:06:51.731 --> 01:06:54.420
<v Speaker 2>We had actually a deal with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burley bear was what?</v>

1716
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:56.140
<v Speaker 2>That was like a college thing they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

1717
01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:56.710
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1718
01:06:56.710 --> 01:07:00.010
<v Speaker 2>it was a crackle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crackle still around,</v>

1719
01:07:00.011 --> 01:07:01.650
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it.</v>

1720
01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.700
<v Speaker 2>I will if it's NBC anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I see crackle come up on</v>

1721
01:07:04.701 --> 01:07:05.190
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1722
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:06.570
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

1723
01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.480
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when we had a deal with them,</v>

1724
01:07:10.481 --> 01:07:13.090
<v Speaker 2>but a bunch of shit fell through and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to just give me money for</v>

1725
01:07:13.091 --> 01:07:13.960
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

1726
01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:14.471
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1727
01:07:14.471 --> 01:07:16.240
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those weird things where</v>

1728
01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:18.630
<v Speaker 2>like nothing happened but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you got paid.</v>

1729
01:07:18.631 --> 01:07:19.540
<v Speaker 2>He gave me money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1730
01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:20.530
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty cool.</v>

1731
01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:21.533
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1732
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:23.200
<v Speaker 2>I could go for one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Critical if you're.</v>

1733
01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.510
<v Speaker 2>If you're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1734
01:07:24.530 --> 01:07:26.410
<v Speaker 2>It was like an interview show we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do.</v>

1735
01:07:26.411 --> 01:07:30.490
<v Speaker 2>It was like similar to like a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like in a weird location just</v>

1736
01:07:30.491 --> 01:07:33.550
<v Speaker 2>sitting down with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way is not the best move.</v>

1737
01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.690
<v Speaker 2>The best move is have like a place like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this where it's quiet and you just sit</v>

1738
01:07:37.691 --> 01:07:40.390
<v Speaker 2>down and talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody wants to like how about we</v>

1739
01:07:40.391 --> 01:07:44.030
<v Speaker 2>do it in a park when people feel weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>in to park and there's birds chirping</v>

1740
01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:47.740
<v Speaker 2>and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking drive by in the background.</v>

1741
01:07:47.741 --> 01:07:50.500
<v Speaker 2>Sirens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joggers and shit dog.</v>

1742
01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.610
<v Speaker 2>I remember I did a show with Neil</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brennan for Sundance a couple of years</v>

1743
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:58.000
<v Speaker 2>ago and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had never done a show like it was</v>

1744
01:07:58.001 --> 01:07:59.170
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a studio show,</v>

1745
01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:02.470
<v Speaker 2>but they wanted to shoot it in a loft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1746
01:08:02.471 --> 01:08:03.304
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1747
01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:07.560
<v Speaker 2>we could get a studio and then make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like a loft and that way it sound</v>

1748
01:08:07.561 --> 01:08:08.710
<v Speaker 2>proof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1749
01:08:08.711 --> 01:08:09.180
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1750
01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:10.280
<v Speaker 2>we really want it to feel like a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>firm.</v>

1751
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:10.601
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1752
01:08:10.601 --> 01:08:12.940
<v Speaker 2>the friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't really in a loft,</v>

1753
01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:13.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>

1754
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:14.500
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1755
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:14.810
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1756
01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:15.800
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it.</v>

1757
01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 2>They were</v>

1758
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:18.200
<v Speaker 1>so desperate for like it to feel and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1759
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:23.270
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have the loudest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most unsuitable show if you go find a</v>

1760
01:08:23.271 --> 01:08:25.760
<v Speaker 1>loft in Soho,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just wire it with lights.</v>

1761
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:27.970
<v Speaker 1>So we ended up getting a studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like that.</v>

1762
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:31.970
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad instinct doing stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of a professional area.</v>

1763
01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Someone said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do a podcast at starbucks.</v>

1764
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.650
<v Speaker 1>How about you just know and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1765
01:08:36.651 --> 01:08:38.360
<v Speaker 1>but we just get starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to a studio,</v>

1766
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:42.080
<v Speaker 1>why would you want to go to starbucks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to take the chance and</v>

1767
01:08:42.081 --> 01:08:46.790
<v Speaker 1>people next to you having arguments with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their agent on the phone or screaming at</v>

1768
01:08:46.791 --> 01:08:49.970
<v Speaker 1>their dog walker or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't find fluffy like that,</v>

1769
01:08:49.971 --> 01:08:51.950
<v Speaker 1>that's all going to be on your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that cool?</v>

1770
01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations in public places like</v>

1771
01:08:55.611 --> 01:08:55.820
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1772
01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:58.070
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody wants to do something</v>

1773
01:08:58.071 --> 01:08:59.960
<v Speaker 1>crafty and creative and different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1774
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:02.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I always think I find that too is</v>

1775
01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:04.620
<v Speaker 1>like with standups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times younger stand ups will</v>

1776
01:09:04.621 --> 01:09:07.280
<v Speaker 1>say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really trying to be outside the box.</v>

1777
01:09:07.281 --> 01:09:08.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a buck first.</v>

1778
01:09:08.221 --> 01:09:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Have a fucking box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a box first.</v>

1779
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:10.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1780
01:09:10.701 --> 01:09:12.860
<v Speaker 1>like Jackson pollock knew how to paint</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bowl of fruit.</v>

1781
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.903
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like go.</v>

1782
01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.110
<v Speaker 1>I think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1783
01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:19.250
<v Speaker 1>like in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to start with some sort of basic</v>

1784
01:09:19.251 --> 01:09:22.190
<v Speaker 1>skillset before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now it's like start a podcast.</v>

1785
01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:23.600
<v Speaker 1>You hit a sore spot with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>

1786
01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not as Jackson pollock fan?</v>

1787
01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1788
01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I'm a fan of his.</v>

1789
01:09:28.311 --> 01:09:32.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying he was a painter before</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started splattering shit.</v>

1790
01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched that movie,</v>

1791
01:09:33.771 --> 01:09:36.320
<v Speaker 1>the Ed Harris Movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

1792
01:09:36.321 --> 01:09:37.030
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this,</v>

1793
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:38.690
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing exceptional here going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1794
01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy's throwing paint around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm watching a movie about a guy</v>

1795
01:09:41.181 --> 01:09:44.210
<v Speaker 1>throwing paint around and it's got some</v>
<v Speaker 1>trials and tribulations.</v>

1796
01:09:44.211 --> 01:09:44.601
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1797
01:09:44.601 --> 01:09:46.340
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not.</v>

1798
01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:50.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not the worst looking art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of cool to have like in the</v>

1799
01:09:50.271 --> 01:09:54.000
<v Speaker 1>lobby of a hotel or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of it personally.</v>

1800
01:09:54.001 --> 01:09:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I like community by like if you bought a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jackson pollock,</v>

1801
01:09:56.301 --> 01:09:57.740
<v Speaker 1>you're spending hundreds of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>

1802
01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:00.980
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be millions,</v>

1803
01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:01.813
<v Speaker 1>millions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions first.</v>

1804
01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:04.640
<v Speaker 1>If I know the artist's name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be worth millions of dollars.</v>

1805
01:10:04.670 --> 01:10:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

1806
01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck you.</v>

1807
01:10:08.970 --> 01:10:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For every one of these,</v>

1808
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:13.010
<v Speaker 1>if you have to pay a million dollars for</v>
<v Speaker 1>every one of these,</v>

1809
01:10:13.011 --> 01:10:13.910
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click on that one.</v>

1810
01:10:13.911 --> 01:10:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Where your cursor is right there at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

1811
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is chaos.</v>

1812
01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.060
<v Speaker 1>You could go to the Jackson pollock</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

1813
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:22.010
<v Speaker 1>It's out in east Hampton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1814
01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:24.620
<v Speaker 1>my nephews went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jackson pollock house,</v>

1815
01:10:24.621 --> 01:10:26.600
<v Speaker 1>the house he painted and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a museum now,</v>

1816
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:30.950
<v Speaker 1>but for little kids you can paint the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jackson pollock and my nephew and my</v>

1817
01:10:30.951 --> 01:10:33.230
<v Speaker 1>nephew did one and it looks exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1818
01:10:33.231 --> 01:10:35.100
<v Speaker 1>probably looks better than he was five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did it.</v>

1819
01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I went to my old agents house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My old agent had this beautiful house in</v>

1820
01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Aspen and he had this thing on his wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>

1821
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:46.520
<v Speaker 1>is this something your kid did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And someone goes,</v>

1822
01:10:46.521 --> 01:10:48.120
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a world war.</v>

1823
01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:49.510
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1824
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:50.780
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1825
01:10:50.781 --> 01:10:52.730
<v Speaker 1>do you know anything about modern art?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1826
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.170
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>

1827
01:10:54.171 --> 01:10:56.420
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy explained it to me that that</v>

1828
01:10:56.421 --> 01:10:58.880
<v Speaker 1>was probably like a $35,000 painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1829
01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:02.420
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was literally like 12 by 14.</v>

1830
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:05.660
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a little kids first grade</v>
<v Speaker 1>class project.</v>

1831
01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:07.210
<v Speaker 1>So I thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh this is cute.</v>

1832
01:11:07.211 --> 01:11:09.380
<v Speaker 1>He puts up his kids artwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like in a nice frame.</v>

1833
01:11:09.381 --> 01:11:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like some tissue paper that was</v>

1834
01:11:11.181 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 1>glued to some other paper and some paint</v>
<v Speaker 1>splattered</v>

1835
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.903
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1836
01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:16.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moderate.</v>

1837
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:20.400
<v Speaker 2>Let's look more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fascinating to me.</v>

1838
01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:25.140
<v Speaker 2>And people get so upset if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what they like.</v>

1839
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Like if I've talked about Jackson</v>
<v Speaker 2>pollock before and you get these Jackson</v>

1840
01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:30.990
<v Speaker 2>pollock fans and believers and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1841
01:11:30.991 --> 01:11:34.920
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The layers of paint and the way his</v>

1842
01:11:34.921 --> 01:11:39.921
<v Speaker 2>vision was manifested on to canvas</v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds,</v>

1843
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:43.500
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like the aliens from galaxy</v>
<v Speaker 2>quest,</v>

1844
01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:45.960
<v Speaker 2>that's actually kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give him 500 bucks for that.</v>

1845
01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean again,</v>

1846
01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:51.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of it but I try as hard as</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can with stuff too.</v>

1847
01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Especially now to go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what that looks like.</v>

1848
01:11:53.341 --> 01:11:54.610
<v Speaker 2>But like what they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1849
01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.510
<v Speaker 2>When the dude goes to the hospital and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find that he has like intestinal</v>

1850
01:11:57.511 --> 01:11:59.700
<v Speaker 2>worms and they pull them all out onto</v>
<v Speaker 2>the operating table.</v>

1851
01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:02.480
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are like white intestine warm data</v>

1852
01:12:02.481 --> 01:12:03.690
<v Speaker 2>is actually a cool painting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1853
01:12:03.691 --> 01:12:06.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to change my opinion here</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that one is actually kinda cool.</v>

1854
01:12:06.691 --> 01:12:08.490
<v Speaker 2>What about that one up above it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That green one?</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1856
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:12.520
<v Speaker 2>right above it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1857
01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:14.510
<v Speaker 2>That looks like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1858
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.620
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Jackson pollock to.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's a pollock.</v>

1860
01:12:18.930 --> 01:12:19.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1861
01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:21.010
<v Speaker 2>So even splattery we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1862
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:24.120
<v Speaker 2>no it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that one looks like he was splatting</v>

1863
01:12:24.121 --> 01:12:25.690
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1864
01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:28.410

<v Speaker 2>different pills.</v>

1865
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:29.540

<v Speaker 2>She Wolf.</v>

1868
01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.500
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a wolf?</v>

1869
01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's teeth and the tongue</v>
<v Speaker 2>down the lower left hand corner.</v>

1870
01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:43.120
<v Speaker 2>I bet he banged a lot of confused older</v>
<v Speaker 2>ladies with money.</v>

1871
01:12:43.170 --> 01:12:44.460
<v Speaker 2>The older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1873
01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:47.790
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think younger.</v>

1874
01:12:47.791 --> 01:12:50.580
<v Speaker 2>Two younger two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was like a lot of 50 year</v>

1875
01:12:50.581 --> 01:12:52.230
<v Speaker 2>old hot ladies that would by his</v>
<v Speaker 2>paintings.</v>

1876
01:12:52.231 --> 01:12:55.410
<v Speaker 2>He would fuck them in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what I think happened.</v>

1877
01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:58.270
<v Speaker 2>He may have done some 50 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fucking</v>

1878
01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:01.410
<v Speaker 2>was that in the movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't watch the movie.</v>

1879
01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>

1880
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:07.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do any of the bud</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking look at that $140,000,000.</v>

1881
01:13:07.131 --> 01:13:10.620
<v Speaker 2>I told you the intestinal worms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 40.</v>

1882
01:13:10.621 --> 01:13:12.780
<v Speaker 2>How much is she wolf?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much does she will go for?</v>

1883
01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.210
<v Speaker 2>He made that in 1948.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1884
01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She will 43.</v>

1886
01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:24.870

<v Speaker 2>That is really interesting though,</v>

1887
01:13:24.871 --> 01:13:28.800
<v Speaker 2>because back then you know like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a completely</v>

1888
01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:31.300
<v Speaker 2>different time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is World War II.</v>

1889
01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:34.970
<v Speaker 2>Yet to think about like dudes are like</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumping out of planes in,</v>

1890
01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:37.480
<v Speaker 2>in Germany and he's like splatter</v>
<v Speaker 2>painting in the Hamptons,</v>

1891
01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:42.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making cash and banging war widows.</v>

1892
01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Now he's banging divorcees of heads of</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry now.</v>

1893
01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of money that you would have</v>

1894
01:13:51.421 --> 01:13:55.590
<v Speaker 2>to have to spend $140 million dollars on</v>
<v Speaker 2>some splattery paint.</v>

1895
01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have netflix money.</v>

1896
01:13:57.990 --> 01:14:00.900
<v Speaker 2>A billion a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The netflix executive.</v>

1897
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:05.130
<v Speaker 2>The head guys probably putting one up</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now at his house in Brentwood.</v>

1898
01:14:05.230 --> 01:14:08.370
<v Speaker 2>I think he's putting it up for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for his painting hanger is putting</v>

1899
01:14:08.371 --> 01:14:09.870
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get painting hangers for sure.</v>

1900
01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

1901
01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 2>He's probably</v>

1902
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.590
<v Speaker 1>got white maids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1903
01:14:14.591 --> 01:14:16.960
<v Speaker 1>that's money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real money.</v>

1904
01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must.</v>

1905
01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:22.570
<v Speaker 1>You must.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must get a lot of you must you say</v>

1906
01:14:22.571 --> 01:14:24.910
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like why I like you so much is</v>

1907
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:28.840
<v Speaker 1>you are not a partisan person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do the thing I tried to do with</v>

1908
01:14:28.841 --> 01:14:31.000
<v Speaker 1>politics and everyone thinks because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the daily show,</v>

1909
01:14:31.890 --> 01:14:35.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm very left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get accused of being all right lately.</v>

1910
01:14:35.021 --> 01:14:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like.</v>

1911
01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:37.560
<v Speaker 1>But it's like it's just having an</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion is like.</v>

1912
01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:39.680
<v Speaker 1>So I always try to have an opinion per</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue almost.</v>

1913
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:45.070
<v Speaker 1>I really got confused when this country</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to a place where you have to be all</v>

1914
01:14:45.071 --> 01:14:46.080
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on either side.</v>

1915
01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:46.660
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1916
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:48.430
<v Speaker 1>I feel like most people aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1917
01:14:48.431 --> 01:14:53.431
<v Speaker 1>like some people are pro choice and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay with guns like well it's just the</v>

1918
01:14:53.441 --> 01:14:57.370
<v Speaker 1>people that are pro one way or the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>way or very laughed the loudest.</v>

1919
01:14:57.370 --> 01:15:00.170
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of us that are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>scattered across the board.</v>

1920
01:15:00.171 --> 01:15:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

1921
01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.140
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's some things that are</v>

1922
01:15:02.141 --> 01:15:03.580
<v Speaker 1>reasonable and some things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable,</v>

1923
01:15:03.610 --> 01:15:05.200
<v Speaker 1>but you are one of those people who sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

1924

1925
01:15:10.001 --> 01:15:12.000
<v Speaker 1>hour and I've really tried to structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hour that I,</v>

1926
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I hit everybody in and like it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like hit both sides and then like</v>

<v Speaker 1>right and then the minute I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

01:15:23.471 --> 01:15:27.910
<v Speaker 1>now let's talk about you guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>within 12 seconds,</v>

1931

1933
01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:33.370
<v Speaker 1>He now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same thing that's happened</v>

1934
01:15:33.371 --> 01:15:33.971
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1935
01:15:33.971 --> 01:15:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Fox News.</v>

1936
01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:36.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like Dave said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something I disagree with.</v>

1937
01:15:36.881 --> 01:15:39.080
<v Speaker 1>I can no longer watch that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

1938
01:15:39.081 --> 01:15:41.230
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird time to be doing comedy for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that reason.</v>

1939
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:44.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a great time to be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy is so much chaos because you can</v>

1940
01:15:44.921 --> 01:15:46.600
<v Speaker 1>point all that nonsense out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1941
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:49.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to San Antonio in two</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks and I'm like,</v>

1942
01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:52.120
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be fun,</v>

1944
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:56.050

1980
01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:05.620
<v Speaker 1>I got to the fucking big gates papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living with one for 50 years.</v>

1981
01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.290
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>

1982
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:11.910
<v Speaker 1>And you know that they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do a,</v>

1983
01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:13.970
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do like a.</v>

1984
01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.590
<v Speaker 1>They give you a little poke in the penis</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like they got draw blood from your</v>

1985
01:17:18.591 --> 01:17:21.840
<v Speaker 1>penis to Jesus fucking told me that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1986
01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:23.420
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going on with people.</v>

1987
01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Ticks cutting decks and make digs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bleeding,</v>

1988
01:17:26.611 --> 01:17:30.900
<v Speaker 1>cut and baby dicks and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Circumcisions is weird.</v>

1989
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:33.020
<v Speaker 1>It feels like the kind of thing you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have a say in,</v>

1990
01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you should go,</v>

1991
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:36.200
<v Speaker 1>you should get on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1992
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:37.430
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

1993
01:17:37.530 --> 01:17:41.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just they just take this thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you needed or away and they don't even.</v>

1994
01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:42.741
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

1995
01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:46.520
<v Speaker 1>it's being done now for purely aesthetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons and people say something about</v>

1996
01:17:46.521 --> 01:17:50.150
<v Speaker 1>aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bowls of [inaudible] crucis was fuck</v>

1997
01:17:50.151 --> 01:17:50.984
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

1998
01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:52.070
<v Speaker 1>It does not.</v>

1999
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:55.130
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely a lie and that's just</v>

2000
01:17:55.131 --> 01:17:58.370
<v Speaker 1>some nonsense that people have said to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make up for the fact that it's still</v>

2001
01:17:58.371 --> 01:18:02.300
<v Speaker 1>this horrific fucking practice and by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way is probably money in it.</v>

2002
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably a significant business</v>

2003
01:18:05.751 --> 01:18:09.350
<v Speaker 1>and cut and baby dicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're probably trying to protect</v>

2004
01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:13.010
<v Speaker 1>that significant business and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to justify the baby.</v>

2005
01:18:13.011 --> 01:18:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Dick's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've cut in the past,</v>

2006
01:18:14.091 --> 01:18:16.820
<v Speaker 1>so if they have three sons and they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut all the sons Dicks,</v>

2007
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:17.511
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2008
01:18:17.511 --> 01:18:19.880
<v Speaker 1>it's really important to prevent aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something.</v>

2009
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:21.860
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to get aids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get it from having a</v>

2010
01:18:21.861 --> 01:18:23.060
<v Speaker 1>dirty for skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2011
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're good.</v>

2012
01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

2013
01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:27.230
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's getting aids from dirty forest.</v>

2014
01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:28.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about the disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2015
01:18:28.941 --> 01:18:32.820
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as a guy who wears button flies,</v>

2016
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:36.740
<v Speaker 1>it would be nice to have one more layer</v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting my penis from just smacking</v>

2017
01:18:36.741 --> 01:18:37.574
<v Speaker 1>around my jeans.</v>

2018
01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Don't wear underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You weirdo.</v>

2019
01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I do wear underwear,</v>

2020

<v Speaker 1>doll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got this fresh.</v>

2025
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:53.600
<v Speaker 1>I got this pair of boxers from the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were doing because there was a scene</v>

2026
01:18:53.601 --> 01:18:55.510
<v Speaker 1>where my dick gets pulled off in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

2027
01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:59.540
<v Speaker 1>gets pulled off of a robotic penis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to spoil it,</v>

2028
01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.800
<v Speaker 1>but already put the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the.</v>

2029
01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:03.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if anyone's going to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2030
01:19:03.381 --> 01:19:04.490
<v Speaker 1>so it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2031
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:08.300
<v Speaker 1>but they gave me a pair of underwear so</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to wreck my own underwear</v>

2032
01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:10.820
<v Speaker 1>and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was the most comfortable</v>

2033
01:19:10.821 --> 01:19:11.720
<v Speaker 1>underwear ever wore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2034
01:19:11.721 --> 01:19:13.910
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then my girlfriend came out to visit</v>

2035
01:19:13.911 --> 01:19:15.470
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she sends me a text and she goes,</v>

2036
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:18.140
<v Speaker 1>why is there a pair of ladies' underwear</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your suitcase?</v>

2037
01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:18.973
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>

2038
01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.470
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out this underwear that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought was the best underwear,</v>

2039
01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like ladies underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2040
01:19:23.961 --> 01:19:26.350
<v Speaker 1>I was at belt to buy like 50 pairs of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2041
01:19:26.690 --> 01:19:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Who Decides?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2042
01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm on it.</v>

2043
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Like it just felt because they were like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2044
01:19:33.621 --> 01:19:34.454
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2045
01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.080
<v Speaker 1>I guess they're like a leggings</v>
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>

2046
01:19:36.081 --> 01:19:38.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just made my penis like float.</v>

2047
01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Like it was like in limbo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was like it was in Jello.</v>

2048
01:19:41.890 --> 01:19:45.710
<v Speaker 1>It was very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And are they designed for a vagina and</v>

2049
01:19:45.711 --> 01:19:46.970
<v Speaker 1>not for a penis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2050
01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.890
<v Speaker 1>All I know is I wore them and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2051
01:19:48.891 --> 01:19:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I got to get more of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she was,</v>

2052
01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.310
<v Speaker 1>she was like my girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2053
01:19:52.311 --> 01:19:54.590
<v Speaker 1>she didn't get mad first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just thought I was cheating on her.</v>

2054
01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.290
<v Speaker 1>And then she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the ladies line at target,</v>

2055
01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:57.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2056
01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:58.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there you go.</v>

2057
01:19:58.791 --> 01:20:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Now I know where to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said.</v>

2058
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:01.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

2059
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Go pick me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six pairs.</v>

2060
01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:04.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain things that are like,</v>

2061
01:20:04.521 --> 01:20:06.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a gender associated like</v>

2062
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:08.080
<v Speaker 1>tube socks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2063
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.260
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you have like the little palm</v>

2064
01:20:10.261 --> 01:20:11.990
<v Speaker 2>palm and the back of the heel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2065
01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:13.410
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2066
01:20:13.411 --> 01:20:17.100
<v Speaker 2>like little ankle socks for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ankle socks were only chicks.</v>

2067
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Only chicks were ankles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're right.</v>

2068
01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Doozy and wear ankle socks in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties and nineties.</v>

2069
01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.550
<v Speaker 2>That was a chick thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was this little tiny socks.</v>

2070
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2071
01:20:24.631 --> 01:20:25.411
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2072
01:20:25.411 --> 01:20:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Now it feels weird to wear shorts with</v>
<v Speaker 2>socks.</v>

2073
01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me it does.</v>

2074
01:20:29.671 --> 01:20:30.840
<v Speaker 2>It feels weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Line.</v>

2075
01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:32.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like the way it looks.</v>

2076
01:20:32.341 --> 01:20:35.940
<v Speaker 2>It just feels very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I wear socks that they're not</v>

2077
01:20:35.970 --> 01:20:38.190
<v Speaker 2>totally ankle socks and people mock my</v>
<v Speaker 2>socks.</v>

2078
01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.930
<v Speaker 2>Like these socks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I check these out.</v>

2079
01:20:39.931 --> 01:20:43.230
<v Speaker 2>See they go above the ankle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you doing?</v>

2080
01:20:43.410 --> 01:20:47.160
<v Speaker 2>I see an extra inch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but will you wear those shorts?</v>

2081
01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.990
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit.</v>

2082
01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:50.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm married and wear a fanny pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2083
01:20:50.911 --> 01:20:51.990
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost 50.</v>

2084
01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2085
01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:55.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen to me?</v>

2086
01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's gonna like me less because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like good.</v>

2087
01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to cut people out of my life.</v>

2088
01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:01.680
<v Speaker 2>If you have a problem with me because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>my socks.</v>

2089
01:21:01.681 --> 01:21:05.520
<v Speaker 2>My socks are an interesting that I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk to fuck off with your shitty</v>

2090
01:21:05.521 --> 01:21:08.090
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just too many people with just</v>

2091
01:21:08.091 --> 01:21:10.650
<v Speaker 2>like weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rigid ideas about what people should and</v>

2092
01:21:10.651 --> 01:21:11.740
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't do in this life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2093
01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:12.950
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2094
01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:15.780
<v Speaker 2>it's constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're constantly being told like that.</v>

2095
01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:16.850
<v Speaker 2>We don't say that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2096
01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:18.300
<v Speaker 2>when did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2097
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.070
<v Speaker 2>I can't keep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my biggest problem is I can't</v>

2098
01:21:20.071 --> 01:21:22.590
<v Speaker 2>keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the latest one people told you</v>

2099
01:21:22.591 --> 01:21:23.440
<v Speaker 2>not to say anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2100
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:24.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eskimo,</v>

2101
01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.310
<v Speaker 2>but that's not true.</v>

2102
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:29.040
<v Speaker 2>See in certain parts of the country and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

2103
01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Eskimo is what they prefer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2104
01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:33.390
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in you.</v>

2105
01:21:33.391 --> 01:21:35.460
<v Speaker 2>It is in certain parts of the world they</v>
<v Speaker 2>prefer.</v>

2106
01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:36.510
<v Speaker 2>But ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2107
01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.010
<v Speaker 2>is what they prefer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And other parts of the world,</v>

2108
01:21:38.011 --> 01:21:39.750
<v Speaker 2>like people that say that Eskimos the</v>
<v Speaker 2>slur,</v>

2109
01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:42.990
<v Speaker 2>that is not always true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might decide it's true for your</v>

2110
01:21:42.991 --> 01:21:45.600
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Rinella was explaining this to me.</v>

2111
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I believe in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eskimo is the correct term,</v>

2112
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:53.970
<v Speaker 2>but in Alaska they prefer to see if</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's correct.</v>

2113
01:21:53.971 --> 01:21:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make sure we get that right.</v>

2114
01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:58.300
<v Speaker 2>But that's just people deciding that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I mean.</v>

2115
01:21:58.320 --> 01:21:59.210
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>

2116
01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:01.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to be disrespectful to you.</v>

2117
01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:02.430
<v Speaker 2>It's our Eskimos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2118
01:22:02.431 --> 01:22:05.360
<v Speaker 2>it's just a problem when you decide all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden that something's</v>

2119
01:22:05.370 --> 01:22:08.490
<v Speaker 2>disrespectful after people have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>using like language is supposed to</v>

2120
01:22:08.491 --> 01:22:09.750
<v Speaker 2>always convey intent.</v>

2121
01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.220
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it's supposed to be about.</v>

2122
01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:13.500
<v Speaker 2>So when you just make these hot button</v>
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>

2123
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not talking about like,</v>

2124
01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.680
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like japs,</v>

2125
01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:20.520
<v Speaker 2>the japs that was a derogatory term used</v>
<v Speaker 2>in world war two and people throw it</v>

2126
01:22:20.521 --> 01:22:24.240
<v Speaker 2>around wildly and they didn't realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty offensive and that makes</v>

2127
01:22:24.241 --> 01:22:25.110
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2128
01:22:25.111 --> 01:22:25.561
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2129
01:22:25.561 --> 01:22:27.930
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a term from World War II that</v>

2130
01:22:27.931 --> 01:22:29.940
<v Speaker 2>was used like geeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an interim.</v>

2131
01:22:29.941 --> 01:22:31.230
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2132
01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:32.520
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those things make sense,</v>

2133
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:35.290
<v Speaker 2>but when you get to things that don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2134
01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.590
<v Speaker 2>there's certain expressions that don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sense.</v>

2135
01:22:37.591 --> 01:22:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Like how the fuck is it still the</v>
<v Speaker 2>National Association for the advancement</v>

2136
01:22:40.381 --> 01:22:41.490
<v Speaker 2>of colored people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2137
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:42.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

2138
01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:43.690
<v Speaker 2>I talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2139
01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:46.650
<v Speaker 2>it's tough to give a donation to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Canada,</v>

2140
01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:50.820
<v Speaker 2>the term Eskimo has largely been</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplanted by the term in Hewitt while</v>

2141
01:22:50.821 --> 01:22:54.720
<v Speaker 2>in you it can accurately be applied to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eskimo peoples in Canada and Greenland</v>

2142
01:22:54.721 --> 01:22:58.710
<v Speaker 2>is not true in Alaska and Siberia and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alaska Determined X.</v>

2143
01:22:58.710 --> 01:23:01.290
<v Speaker 2>Eskimo is commonly used because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>includes both.</v>

2144
01:23:01.290 --> 01:23:03.610
<v Speaker 2>You pick an inupiat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so okay.</v>

2145
01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:08.900
<v Speaker 2>In Alaska in youit is not accepted as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>collective term and is not used,</v>

2146
01:23:09.341 --> 01:23:11.020
<v Speaker 2>especially in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

2147
01:23:11.021 --> 01:23:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in Canada you're supposed to use the</v>

2148
01:23:13.631 --> 01:23:15.250
<v Speaker 2>term nun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Alaska,</v>

2149
01:23:15.251 --> 01:23:19.150
<v Speaker 2>you can still use the term Eskimo and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want you to use it because it does</v>

2150
01:23:19.151 --> 01:23:22.840
<v Speaker 2>not refer to a certain type of a native</v>
<v Speaker 2>person that lives up there.</v>

2151
01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Those are fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the real natives,</v>

2152
01:23:25.271 --> 01:23:26.140
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2153
01:23:26.141 --> 01:23:28.570
<v Speaker 2>if you really think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the people that not only did</v>

2154
01:23:28.571 --> 01:23:31.900
<v Speaker 2>they cross the bering strait but they</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking stayed in the cold spot.</v>

2155
01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

2156
01:23:33.090 --> 01:23:34.360
<v Speaker 2>They got there and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2157
01:23:34.361 --> 01:23:36.880
<v Speaker 2>this is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting is how do you not</v>

2158
01:23:36.881 --> 01:23:39.340
<v Speaker 2>keep traveling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people don't have any access to</v>

2159
01:23:39.341 --> 01:23:42.820
<v Speaker 2>vegetables and yet they lived almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>entirely free of cancer until we started</v>

2160
01:23:42.821 --> 01:23:45.670
<v Speaker 2>importing cigarettes and booze up there</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I did not know.</v>

2161
01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:51.310
<v Speaker 2>They had an incredibly low instances of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer and what they're basically living</v>

2162
01:23:51.311 --> 01:23:54.400
<v Speaker 2>off his fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're living off seal fat and they</v>

2163
01:23:54.401 --> 01:23:58.660
<v Speaker 2>would take seals and they would take</v>
<v Speaker 2>frozen fish and they would dip frozen</v>

2164
01:23:58.661 --> 01:24:01.480
<v Speaker 2>fish in hot seal oil and eat the frozen</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish.</v>

2165
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:04.750
<v Speaker 2>So they take a frozen fish and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>would slice like,</v>

2166
01:24:04.751 --> 01:24:07.810
<v Speaker 2>almost like Carpaccio thin pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this frozen fish.</v>

2167
01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Then dip it and seal oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how they to this day</v>

2168
01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:13.140
<v Speaker 2>facilitate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2169
01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:14.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not a fondue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

2170
01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:15.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2171
01:24:15.281 --> 01:24:16.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2172
01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:20.260
<v Speaker 2>I could shabu shabu shabu shabu ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a Japanese thing where you</v>

2173
01:24:20.261 --> 01:24:25.261
<v Speaker 2>take meat and dip it in thinly sliced</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat it on oil or something like that,</v>

2174
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:29.530
<v Speaker 2>something along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but but somehow or another that diet is</v>

2175
01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:31.570
<v Speaker 2>really good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really strange.</v>

2176
01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Like I would think you'd have to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>some fucking vegetables in your life.</v>

2177
01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can't be good for your heart if</v>

2178
01:24:35.711 --> 01:24:37.420
<v Speaker 2>you're eating a lot of seal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seal fat,</v>

2179
01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.310
<v Speaker 2>so that's where you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2180
01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:42.700
<v Speaker 2>that's a common misconception and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we've addressed ad</v>

2181
01:24:42.701 --> 01:24:44.080
<v Speaker 2>nauseum on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>

2182
01:24:44.081 --> 01:24:48.340
<v Speaker 2>but I'll get to see the short short</v>
<v Speaker 2>version of fat versus carbohydrates.</v>

2183
01:24:48.670 --> 01:24:53.170
<v Speaker 2>In the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sugar industry paid scientists to</v>

2184
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:57.190
<v Speaker 2>write about saturated fat and to blame</v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat for heart disease and</v>

2185
01:24:57.191 --> 01:24:59.590
<v Speaker 2>heart attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the case at all.</v>

2186
01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:03.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a lie and it was all created by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar industry to take the blame away</v>

2187
01:25:03.641 --> 01:25:05.140
<v Speaker 2>from sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>

2188
01:25:05.170 --> 01:25:07.780
<v Speaker 2>processed sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and simple carbohydrates like breads and</v>

2189
01:25:07.781 --> 01:25:10.630
<v Speaker 2>pastas and all the things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those things are terrible for you and</v>

2190
01:25:10.631 --> 01:25:13.930
<v Speaker 2>that's where you get your fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you get fat bodies.</v>

2191
01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:16.900
<v Speaker 2>That's where people develop like</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardening of the arteries and fucking</v>

2192
01:25:16.901 --> 01:25:20.170
<v Speaker 2>clog this and that and all as long with</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetics and a lot of other things but</v>

2193
01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:25.530
<v Speaker 2>were saturated fats become dangerous is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you mix saturated fats with sugars,</v>

2194
01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:31.450
<v Speaker 2>saturated fats and sugars together</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another accentuate like you</v>

2195
01:25:31.451 --> 01:25:34.270
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fried foods and sugary foods like</v>

2196
01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:39.840
<v Speaker 2>sugary drinks like and fried chicken and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fried deep fried fatty things.</v>

2197
01:25:40.930 --> 01:25:42.940
<v Speaker 2>That's where things get really dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently,</v>

2198
01:25:42.941 --> 01:25:47.941
<v Speaker 2>and this is like a a recent study that</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected saturated fat mixed with</v>

2199
01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:53.500
<v Speaker 2>simple sugars and processed sugars as</v>
<v Speaker 2>being especially dangerous,</v>

2200
01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.890
<v Speaker 2>but on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturated fats are the precursors for</v>

2201
01:25:56.891 --> 01:26:01.720
<v Speaker 2>hormones and in fact a diet high in</v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated fats and cholesterol actually</v>

2202
01:26:01.721 --> 01:26:04.670
<v Speaker 2>raises your hormone levels and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthier for your body.</v>

2203
01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:08.300
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat and dietary cholesterol in</v>

2204
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:12.020
<v Speaker 2>particular food you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol from food doesn't raise your</v>

2205
01:26:12.021 --> 01:26:15.800
<v Speaker 2>blood cholesterol at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It barely moves the needle on blood</v>

2206
01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:18.560
<v Speaker 2>lipids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all super confusing because we grew</v>

2207
01:26:18.561 --> 01:26:21.110
<v Speaker 2>up with this idea that when you eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol,</v>

2208
01:26:21.111 --> 01:26:24.690
<v Speaker 2>you get high cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the case in factoring.</v>

2209
01:26:25.050 --> 01:26:27.050
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of evidence that way where</v>

2210
01:26:27.130 --> 01:26:29.530
<v Speaker 2>you're really getting this bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2211
01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:32.900
<v Speaker 2>extra fat and your body is from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from process sugars.</v>

2212
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because your body can't get rid of it.</v>

2213
01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's not net.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

2214
01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:40.280
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to ever be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a spoonful of sugar and shove it in</v>

2215
01:26:40.281 --> 01:26:42.530
<v Speaker 2>your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's doesn't exist in a Mary poppins.</v>

2216
01:26:42.610 --> 01:26:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Do that dirty bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

2217
01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Take the spoon full of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say no.</v>

2218
01:26:47.770 --> 01:26:48.251
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

2219
01:26:48.251 --> 01:26:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that much about nutrition</v>

2220
01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:51.710
<v Speaker 2>fell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an here man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>this place is the bomb.</v>

2230
01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:13.280
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:15.100
<v Speaker 2>a tongue case idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>

2232
01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:15.973
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

2233
01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:17.710
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2234
01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'd eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everyone's speaking Spanish,</v>

2235
01:27:20.451 --> 01:27:22.070
<v Speaker 2>they barely understand you when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>ordering.</v>

2236
01:27:22.071 --> 01:27:24.290
<v Speaker 2>If you try to order in English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

2237
01:27:24.291 --> 01:27:26.210
<v Speaker 2>It's good though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's legit as fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Don't.</v>

2239
01:27:27.831 --> 01:27:30.200
<v Speaker 2>Don't give the address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want trump to take him out.</v>

2240
01:27:30.201 --> 01:27:32.750
<v Speaker 2>I know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a legal person that joined.</v>

2241
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:35.090
<v Speaker 2>I went down with my family the other day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

2242
01:27:35.091 --> 01:27:38.330
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then a legal person that have your</v>

2243
01:27:38.331 --> 01:27:41.210
<v Speaker 2>license at the ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring a passport when you go.</v>

2244
01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:45.350
<v Speaker 2>I really do think food is the key to</v>
<v Speaker 2>making people like each other.</v>

2245
01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:46.760
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's the case,</v>

2246
01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:48.620
<v Speaker 2>why are people kicking out Mexico?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2247
01:27:48.621 --> 01:27:51.260
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep wanting to send like the west</v>

2248
01:27:51.261 --> 01:27:52.880
<v Speaker 2>coast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Arizona doing shows,</v>

2249
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:56.570
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexican food down there was so good and</v>

2250
01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to just send like a little case</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Dhea triangle to trump with a note,</v>

2251
01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:01.100
<v Speaker 2>you know like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you sure?</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know like take a nibble dude because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it got so hot.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Cold bowls they made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever see that picture of with the</v>

2254
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Taco Bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Hispanics and I was like,</v>

2255
01:28:09.411 --> 01:28:11.230
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So weird.</v>

2256
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:12.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2257
01:28:12.450 --> 01:28:15.260
<v Speaker 2>but I feel that's how I feel about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think New York,</v>

2258
01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:18.560
<v Speaker 2>we've got so many different cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were at so many different foods</v>

2259
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:20.810
<v Speaker 2>that you like always eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2260
01:28:20.811 --> 01:28:22.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get rid of those people that</v>

2261
01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:26.450
<v Speaker 2>this is the best falafels in town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's certain spots where you</v>

2262
01:28:26.451 --> 01:28:28.010
<v Speaker 2>can go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the best trucks.</v>

2263
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like you said,</v>

2264
01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:34.700
<v Speaker 2>like anytime you go into a place that</v>
<v Speaker 2>has that race of people in it,</v>

2265
01:28:34.730 --> 01:28:35.420
<v Speaker 2>eating there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2266
01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've chosen wisely.</v>

2267
01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:40.130
<v Speaker 2>There's a good Indian food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone said there's an Indian place</v>

2268
01:28:40.131 --> 01:28:43.580
<v Speaker 2>that I go to as well that is in like an</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indian supermarket.</v>

2269
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:46.610
<v Speaker 2>It's an Indian supermarket that has all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these bizarre smells.</v>

2270
01:28:46.611 --> 01:28:49.550
<v Speaker 2>You go in as a weird curry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smells and shit and then in the back</v>

2271
01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:53.120

<v Speaker 2>talked me through all this stuff.</v>

01:29:21.781 --> 01:29:23.940
<v Speaker 2>authentic food from people that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2284
01:29:23.970 --> 01:29:25.290
<v Speaker 2>came from there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2285
01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:26.370
<v Speaker 2>this is what we miss.</v>

2286
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:29.070
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to set up shop here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just make it a little India,</v>

2287
01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:29.993
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2288
01:29:30.330 --> 01:29:32.910
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I like living in a city.</v>

2289
01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:33.270
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2290
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:36.120
<v Speaker 2>there's some good spots in la too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a great little.</v>

2291
01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:38.610
<v Speaker 2>You ever been to little Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a little,</v>

2292
01:29:38.611 --> 01:29:41.940
<v Speaker 2>a little Vietnamese area that has some</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking awesome little Vietnamese</v>

2293
01:29:41.941 --> 01:29:44.640
<v Speaker 2>restaurants and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always find it fascinating how people</v>

2294
01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:47.010
<v Speaker 2>pull pool up in groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2295
01:29:47.370 --> 01:29:50.310
<v Speaker 2>they get together and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they all sort of buy property</v>

2296
01:29:50.311 --> 01:29:52.890
<v Speaker 2>or rent property in this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is it zone?</v>

2297
01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:55.470
<v Speaker 2>I never like to me like China town in</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York.</v>

2298
01:29:55.471 --> 01:29:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I always felt like zoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is because he can</v>

2299
01:29:57.810 --> 01:30:00.450
<v Speaker 2>happen organically like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all the Chinese people over here</v>

2300
01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:03.710
<v Speaker 2>like a little Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2301
01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:05.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always assumed so,</v>

2302
01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I could read about it and the</v>

2303
01:30:06.781 --> 01:30:08.650
<v Speaker 2>upper east side is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was no,</v>

2304
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:10.180
<v Speaker 2>they're like put some Jews uptown.</v>

2305
01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:11.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2306
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that,</v>

2307
01:30:13.730 --> 01:30:14.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always,</v>

2308
01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:19.070
<v Speaker 2>it's always a weird thing to me to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>put that cities have that and it was,</v>

2309
01:30:19.071 --> 01:30:20.790
<v Speaker 2>it still feels weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels antiquated,</v>

2310
01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:22.650
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time like Chinatown in</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York,</v>

2311
01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:24.040
<v Speaker 2>it was fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2312
01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Like you go down there looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Restaurants,</v>

2313
01:30:26.071 --> 01:30:28.800
<v Speaker 2>there's like little alleyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can track it down,</v>

2314
01:30:28.801 --> 01:30:33.510
<v Speaker 2>you can get different cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only sort of food resources you</v>

2315
01:30:33.511 --> 01:30:34.730
<v Speaker 2>could get in China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

2316
01:30:34.770 --> 01:30:36.450
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soup markets that have.</v>

2317
01:30:37.090 --> 01:30:40.050
<v Speaker 2>You've never seen anything in store</v>
<v Speaker 2>before because you're not from China.</v>

2318
01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Bucket of dried fish heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is this big barrels of</v>

2319
01:30:44.371 --> 01:30:45.270
<v Speaker 2>things and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

2320
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:48.060
<v Speaker 2>what is that guy scooping out of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>barrel and why is it moving?</v>

2321
01:30:48.150 --> 01:30:50.400
<v Speaker 2>You know what I like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like those restaurants where they</v>

2322
01:30:50.401 --> 01:30:51.630
<v Speaker 2>reluctantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2323
01:30:51.630 --> 01:30:55.470
<v Speaker 2>The name below the Chinese name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they reluctantly write something in</v>

2324
01:30:55.471 --> 01:30:56.830
<v Speaker 2>English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2325
01:30:56.910 --> 01:31:00.320
<v Speaker 2>half moon villa above it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's picking it up.</v>

2326
01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Please let her know we're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going for spelling for a half</v>

2327
01:31:04.770 --> 01:31:05.660
<v Speaker 2>to right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2328
01:31:05.670 --> 01:31:08.090
<v Speaker 2>there's places where you have to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in,</v>

2329
01:31:08.091 --> 01:31:12.210
<v Speaker 2>in Quebec and come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to write in French like you</v>

2330
01:31:12.211 --> 01:31:14.070
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have laws.</v>

2331
01:31:14.071 --> 01:31:16.320
<v Speaker 2>We have to write things in French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

2332
01:31:16.321 --> 01:31:17.580
<v Speaker 2>You can't just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't go.</v>

2333
01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's allowed.</v>

2334
01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:22.500
<v Speaker 2>I think Rebecca is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very,</v>

2335
01:31:22.770 --> 01:31:25.620
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're clinging strong to their French</v>

2336
01:31:25.621 --> 01:31:28.200
<v Speaker 2>heritage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I completely understand because</v>

2337
01:31:28.201 --> 01:31:30.960
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they mean they have a long history of</v>

2338
01:31:30.961 --> 01:31:33.570
<v Speaker 2>French speaking people living in Quebec.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2339
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:36.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really unusual part of Canada.</v>

2340
01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:38.310
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think of Canadians like,</v>

2341
01:31:38.370 --> 01:31:40.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take off a little,</v>

2342
01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this about?</v>

2343
01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:43.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not Montreal.</v>

2344
01:31:43.651 --> 01:31:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Montreal is very much like a European</v>
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>

2345
01:31:45.781 --> 01:31:47.700
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2346
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like Canada.</v>

2347
01:31:49.651 --> 01:31:52.710
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a bad experience in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada doing shows or I feel like the</v>

2348
01:31:52.711 --> 01:31:55.350
<v Speaker 2>people up there or there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2349
01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:56.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels like it's like,</v>

2350
01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:57.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>

2351
01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:01.060
<v Speaker 2>This isn't diminishing Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's like a component of it's</v>

2352
01:32:01.061 --> 01:32:03.170
<v Speaker 2>like America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like people would just seem like</v>

2353
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:05.140
<v Speaker 2>friendlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think about that with Chicago.</v>

2354
01:32:05.141 --> 01:32:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Like I just did gigs in Chicago and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like chicken.</v>

2355
01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.640
<v Speaker 2>I was like New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this big dirty,</v>

2356
01:32:09.641 --> 01:32:11.710
<v Speaker 2>smelly city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But everyone there is nice because</v>

2357
01:32:11.711 --> 01:32:14.390
<v Speaker 2>they're from the mid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're just nicer pa.</v>

2358
01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:19.300
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting like there they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendly and they and they like say hi</v>

2359
01:32:19.301 --> 01:32:21.250
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we went over this on a recent</v>

2360
01:32:21.251 --> 01:32:22.270
<v Speaker 2>podcast that Canon has.</v>

2361
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:26.380
<v Speaker 2>So few people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's actually 36 million people in</v>

2362
01:32:26.381 --> 01:32:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty 9 million people in California.</v>

2363
01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly entire country of Canada has</v>

2364
01:32:31.751 --> 01:32:36.400
<v Speaker 2>less people than just the state will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia has a but like $25 million</v>

2365
01:32:36.401 --> 01:32:39.280
<v Speaker 2>people and it's as big as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>continental United States,</v>

2366
01:32:39.670 --> 01:32:41.900
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it's uninhabitable though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was challenged.</v>

2367
01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Dangerous as fuck my friends go to Adam</v>
<v Speaker 2>Green trees.</v>

2368
01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend Adam Green tree on instagram.</v>

2369
01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Adam.green.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tree bowhunting.</v>

2370
01:32:50.801 --> 01:32:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I think it is a fucking snake to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

2371
01:32:53.411 --> 01:32:55.210
<v Speaker 2>So dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lives into Australia there.</v>

2372
01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Always trying to get me to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A fucking snake literally ate a snake.</v>

2373
01:32:59.230 --> 01:33:04.230
<v Speaker 2>It's own size and he had it and couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>swallow it and died because of this.</v>

2374
01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.760
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a snake crawling out of a snake.</v>

2375
01:33:06.761 --> 01:33:09.580
<v Speaker 2>It's own size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that snake's mouth shit?</v>

2376
01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:12.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a fucking snake ate a snake.</v>

2377
01:33:12.610 --> 01:33:16.000
<v Speaker 2>It's own size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he filmed the one snake that tried</v>

2378
01:33:16.001 --> 01:33:16.900
<v Speaker 2>to eat it dying.</v>

2379
01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:20.020
<v Speaker 2>And then the other one wiggles out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>its fucking body.</v>

2380
01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what in the hell,</v>

2381
01:33:21.821 --> 01:33:24.460
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is the craziest Shit I've</v>

2382
01:33:24.461 --> 01:33:27.220
<v Speaker 2>ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to talk about a hard scrabble</v>

2383
01:33:27.221 --> 01:33:29.230
<v Speaker 2>world when he first put it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

2384
01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:31.150
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a skin thought?</v>

2385
01:33:31.210 --> 01:33:32.043
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2386
01:33:32.110 --> 01:33:34.900
<v Speaker 2>That's a full ass fucking snake at</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>

2387
01:33:34.930 --> 01:33:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Another snake that is essentially the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same size as it.</v>

2388
01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:40.970
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone pulling it out or how.</v>

2389
01:33:42.490 --> 01:33:44.170
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just coming out.</v>

2390
01:33:44.171 --> 01:33:44.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Died.</v>

2391
01:33:44.951 --> 01:33:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Trying to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this one.</v>

2392
01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Is the other one dead though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2393
01:33:47.681 --> 01:33:48.750
<v Speaker 2>The other one's pulling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

2394
01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:50.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell if someone's pulling it</v>

2395
01:33:50.741 --> 01:33:51.910
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is.</v>

2396
01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:54.580
<v Speaker 2>It might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>of the world?</v>

2431
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:25.970
<v Speaker 2>And what's really fascinating about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the world is they didn't really</v>

2432
01:35:25.971 --> 01:35:30.710
<v Speaker 2>have animals there other than like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kangaroos and wallabies and shit.</v>

2433
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:33.350
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of the animals that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have there were important.</v>

2434
01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Well they are also one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries that did that thing where they</v>

2435
01:35:36.921 --> 01:35:40.730
<v Speaker 2>were being overrun by a certain plant</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they put like rabbits out there</v>

2436
01:35:40.731 --> 01:35:42.280
<v Speaker 2>to eat the plant and then the rabbits</v>
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>

2437
01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:43.213
<v Speaker 2>went rampant.</v>

2438
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Fox is to get the rabbit and the Fox is</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked them up in different cat cats.</v>

2439

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they made a disaster out.</v>

2478
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:14.820
<v Speaker 2>An hour later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Viacom flight.</v>

2479
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:16.390
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2481
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:21.290
<v Speaker 2>vimeo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then through my,</v>

2482
01:37:21.291 --> 01:37:23.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than through my website,</v>

2483
01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.300
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny how quick they are though,</v>

2484
01:37:25.330 --> 01:37:28.580
<v Speaker 2>a new contact Viacom's since you were an</v>
<v Speaker 2>employee and get permission,</v>

2485
01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:30.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you to go through proper</v>

2486
01:37:30.381 --> 01:37:32.120
<v Speaker 2>channels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seemed like a lot of,</v>

2487
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:34.520
<v Speaker 2>a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it though because this is the</v>

2488
01:37:34.521 --> 01:37:35.420
<v Speaker 2>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild west.</v>

2489
01:37:35.421 --> 01:37:39.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have a lot of websites that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are taking our clips from this podcast</v>

2490
01:37:39.261 --> 01:37:41.750
<v Speaker 2>and they put it up and then they put</v>
<v Speaker 2>advertises on it and then they make</v>

2491
01:37:41.751 --> 01:37:42.080
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

2492
01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:43.140
<v Speaker 2>They're making money off it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2493
01:37:43.170 --> 01:37:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2494
01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:46.100
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really weird right now because</v>

2495
01:37:46.101 --> 01:37:48.560
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to figure out what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>legal and what's not legal to do.</v>

2496
01:37:48.561 --> 01:37:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Like there's entire channels that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>just dedicated to this podcast and then</v>

2497
01:37:52.161 --> 01:37:54.830
<v Speaker 2>they take clips from this podcast and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make money off of it.</v>

2498
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:58.200
<v Speaker 2>It's real sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's websites that now are</v>

2499
01:37:58.201 --> 01:38:00.630
<v Speaker 2>popping up that have taken clips off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

2500
01:38:00.631 --> 01:38:03.540
<v Speaker 2>They put them on their website and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have pop up ads and Google ads all</v>

2501
01:38:03.541 --> 01:38:06.300
<v Speaker 2>over their website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the only content that they have is</v>

2502
01:38:06.301 --> 01:38:09.620
<v Speaker 2>content that I've created,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet they're making money off it so I</v>

2503
01:38:09.630 --> 01:38:11.100
<v Speaker 2>get with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to me it's like,</v>

2504
01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:15.000
<v Speaker 2>well you canceled the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so obviously you're not making money on</v>

2505
01:38:15.001 --> 01:38:15.631
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are.</v>

2506
01:38:15.631 --> 01:38:18.010
<v Speaker 2>They're going to sell it somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll definitely sell it someone.</v>

2507
01:38:18.050 --> 01:38:18.960
<v Speaker 2>But the nightly show.</v>

2508
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's nothing to sell it because</v>

2509
01:38:20.431 --> 01:38:24.390
<v Speaker 2>they to every episode they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll sell those episodes 100 percent</v>

2510
01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:27.150
<v Speaker 2>and plus if anybody wants to use them in</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2511
01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:29.100
<v Speaker 2>do you want to use one of those clips?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll have it.</v>

2512
01:38:29.101 --> 01:38:30.780
<v Speaker 2>It's intellectual property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

2513
01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:33.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean how much do they spell it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the other thing,</v>

2514
01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:35.730
<v Speaker 2>if you do a show for a year and a half</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it gets canceled,</v>

2515
01:38:35.850 --> 01:38:38.670
<v Speaker 2>they lost a fuck load of much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sure did 100 percent.</v>

2516
01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:39.540
<v Speaker 2>So they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2517
01:38:39.541 --> 01:38:43.470
<v Speaker 2>we're going to figure out a way to stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>this bleeding and then to just try to</v>

2518
01:38:43.471 --> 01:38:45.810
<v Speaker 2>patch up something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way around it.</v>

2519
01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:46.170
<v Speaker 2>Nelson</v>

2520
01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:47.370
<v Speaker 4>just happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going on.</v>

2521
01:38:47.371 --> 01:38:50.400
<v Speaker 4>Actually right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Youtube is going to be putting tv shows</v>

2522
01:38:50.401 --> 01:38:52.470
<v Speaker 4>on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're going to make some sort of</v>

2523
01:38:52.471 --> 01:38:56.130
<v Speaker 4>deal where you're gonna be paying less</v>
<v Speaker 4>than you pay for direct TV or Hulu.</v>

2524
01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:59.610
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna be able to get TV shows</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like you're getting now and other</v>

2525
01:38:59.611 --> 01:39:01.140
<v Speaker 4>services directly on you</v>

2526
01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:02.690
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that red too though?</v>

2527
01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Is that going to be a cheaper version</v>
<v Speaker 2>than you?</v>

2528
01:39:05.210 --> 01:39:06.620
<v Speaker 4>To Brad?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because Youtube Red's about nine,</v>

2529
01:39:06.621 --> 01:39:07.191
<v Speaker 4>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>$9 a month.</v>

2530
01:39:07.191 --> 01:39:08.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like the same price as Netflix</v>

2531
01:39:08.890 --> 01:39:09.401
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2532
01:39:09.401 --> 01:39:12.250
<v Speaker 2>so you're saying like current television</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows that are out now</v>

2533
01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.400
<v Speaker 4>is literally happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it says,</v>

2534
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:16.470
<v Speaker 2>that's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's inevitable.</v>

2535
01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:17.650
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

2536
01:39:17.650 --> 01:39:19.190
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy Kimmel and cold bear will be able</v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

2537
01:39:20.850 --> 01:39:23.100
<v Speaker 2>Something like that's death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2538
01:39:23.210 --> 01:39:25.580
<v Speaker 2>this is the fucking death bell I'd be</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening right now.</v>

2539
01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Is the death bell to the networks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2540
01:39:27.591 --> 01:39:31.200
<v Speaker 2>They're climbing</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2541
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:33.950
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be historic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of shit,</v>

2542
01:39:34.190 --> 01:39:36.140
<v Speaker 2>because he was going to be no reason to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have television.</v>

2543
01:39:36.141 --> 01:39:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Now if once this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will literally be no reason to have</v>

2544
01:39:40.161 --> 01:39:42.680
<v Speaker 2>television if this becomes universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agreed.</v>

2545
01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Except for sporting events like you want</v>

2546
01:39:45.101 --> 01:39:47.000
<v Speaker 2>to watch the basketball game starts at</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

2547
01:39:47.001 --> 01:39:49.610
<v Speaker 2>you got to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like tv might become the live</v>

2548
01:39:49.611 --> 01:39:50.930
<v Speaker 2>sports network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2549
01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:52.420
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really all you need and</v>

2550
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:54.040
<v Speaker 2>news maybe news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2551
01:39:54.041 --> 01:39:55.910
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very similar to the model of what</v>

2552
01:39:55.911 --> 01:39:58.730
<v Speaker 2>you're doing with the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you drop the podcast and then</v>

2553
01:39:58.731 --> 01:40:00.050
<v Speaker 2>people listen to it when they want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to it.</v>

2554
01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube reveals viewers watch a billion</v>

2555
01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:08.290
<v Speaker 2>hours of video a day as firm prepares to</v>
<v Speaker 2>unveil it's unplugged TV service.</v>

2556
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2557
01:40:10.611 --> 01:40:13.340
<v Speaker 2>once they make a deal with networks like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2558
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:15.170
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking hey,</v>

2559
01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:17.330
<v Speaker 2>but that's really interesting for all</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people,</v>

2560
01:40:17.331 --> 01:40:20.210
<v Speaker 2>like the Poodie pies and the Philip</v>
<v Speaker 2>Defranco's and all these people that</v>

2561
01:40:20.211 --> 01:40:23.090
<v Speaker 2>have shows on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to blow them up even bigger</v>

2562
01:40:23.091 --> 01:40:26.960
<v Speaker 2>because they're essentially now on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>network because the network is just is</v>

2563
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:30.200
<v Speaker 2>just as well connected as Jimmy Kimmel</v>
<v Speaker 2>is now.</v>

2564
01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.260
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're watching Kobe or on youtube and</v>

2565
01:40:32.261 --> 01:40:34.700
<v Speaker 2>then the next thing that comes up is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rory Albany's show.</v>

2566
01:40:34.701 --> 01:40:37.220
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking sitting there smoking</v>
<v Speaker 2>weed in your underwear.</v>

2567
01:40:37.221 --> 01:40:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Your girl's underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My ladies,</v>

2568
01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:40.880
<v Speaker 2>ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ladies boxes.</v>

2569
01:40:40.881 --> 01:40:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your wife's yelling at you in the</v>

2570
01:40:42.111 --> 01:40:42.944
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>

2571
01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:46.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says my.</v>

2572
01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:51.580
<v Speaker 3>This is my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my show shot up that says this</v>

2573
01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 3>is how I live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking it back.</v>

2574
01:40:55.650 --> 01:40:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got to fix that.</v>

2575
01:40:56.591 --> 01:40:59.410
<v Speaker 2>We'd probably New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's New York still not have legal</v>

2576
01:40:59.411 --> 01:41:00.244
<v Speaker 2>weed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2577
01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.730
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is going on now and put Batman.</v>

2578
01:41:02.770 --> 01:41:04.780
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing I've got to say about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denver because it's not.</v>

2579
01:41:04.810 --> 01:41:06.880
<v Speaker 2>You don't even need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to hear anymore.</v>

2580
01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:09.190
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could just get as recreational here.</v>

2581
01:41:09.191 --> 01:41:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can just walk anywhere.</v>

2582
01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a photo of a photo that I have</v>

2583
01:41:14.951 --> 01:41:17.590
<v Speaker 2>to put up on the wall of the moment that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found out.</v>

2584
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Bert Kreischer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We we're doing a podcast during the no</v>

2585
01:41:21.130 --> 01:41:23.010
<v Speaker 2>idea and we did an end of the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

2586
01:41:23.011 --> 01:41:26.020
<v Speaker 2>It was me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Byrd Dug Stan hope.</v>

2587
01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Bert Kreischer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people,</v>

2588
01:41:27.551 --> 01:41:32.320
<v Speaker 2>and we were onstage in the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moment that we'd passed recreational</v>

2589
01:41:32.321 --> 01:41:35.650
<v Speaker 2>weed pass in California and Bert</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kreischer takes his shirt off and he's</v>

2590
01:41:35.651 --> 01:41:38.800
<v Speaker 2>swinging his shirt in front of the crowd</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the whole crowds got their arms up</v>

2591
01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:40.870
<v Speaker 2>in the air and they're going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea</v>

2592
01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.810
<v Speaker 4>crush that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That actually wasn't the exact moment.</v>

2593
01:41:43.811 --> 01:41:47.140
<v Speaker 4>That was an exciting moment of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When that actual moment happened,</v>

2594
01:41:47.141 --> 01:41:49.120
<v Speaker 4>I was sitting next to Burton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't have his shirt off yet.</v>

2595
01:41:49.121 --> 01:41:50.870
<v Speaker 4>I have a photo of that moment when</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone is like,</v>

2596
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:52.820
<v Speaker 4>someone told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was going to ignore that,</v>

2597
01:41:52.821 --> 01:41:54.210
<v Speaker 4>but it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a really.</v>

2598
01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:55.750
<v Speaker 4>It looks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty close to happen right</v>

2599
01:41:55.751 --> 01:41:56.584
<v Speaker 4>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2600
01:41:56.660 --> 01:42:00.070
<v Speaker 2>dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck over there and</v>

2601
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:03.590
<v Speaker 2>that is the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that makes it even.</v>

2602
01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:05.450
<v Speaker 2>I really didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you still needed a jerk.</v>

2603
01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:06.430
<v Speaker 2>No card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2604
01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:09.490
<v Speaker 2>you can totally get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that you can't smoke in</v>

2605
01:42:09.491 --> 01:42:11.350
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just be smoking.</v>

2606
01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:12.580
<v Speaker 2>Is it like Denver?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You walk in,</v>

2607
01:42:12.581 --> 01:42:15.010
<v Speaker 2>they can buy edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I had that experience I had in</v>

2608
01:42:15.011 --> 01:42:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Denver was unreal saying th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're called bud tenders and that</v>

2609
01:42:18.581 --> 01:42:20.980
<v Speaker 2>alerus it's so jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell about that place that you went to</v>

2610
01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:22.840
<v Speaker 2>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the genius bar.</v>

2611
01:42:22.930 --> 01:42:24.300

<v Speaker 4>It's actually,</v>

2612
01:42:24.301 --> 01:42:26.370
<v Speaker 4>it's on Santa Monica and you're like</v>
<v Speaker 4>crescent heights.</v>

2613
01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.520
<v Speaker 4>There's most of the stores here and even</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in Denver you can't see anything</v>

2614
01:42:29.521 --> 01:42:32.640
<v Speaker 4>you can't see inside from the street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like big glass windows.</v>

2615
01:42:32.641 --> 01:42:36.570
<v Speaker 4>You can look right inside and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>an apple store tables with ipads on them</v>

2616
01:42:36.571 --> 01:42:39.480
<v Speaker 4>with all the different strains on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little jar to like look inside.</v>

2617
01:42:39.481 --> 01:42:42.660
<v Speaker 4>You can smell it and you walk up to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and they'd bring it out from the</v>

2618
01:42:42.661 --> 01:42:45.030
<v Speaker 4>back like your race or your quarter if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you remember the name of this joint.</v>

2619
01:42:45.031 --> 01:42:46.190
<v Speaker 4>It's called Med men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was.</v>

2620
01:42:46.191 --> 01:42:47.610
<v Speaker 4>What was Med med men</v>

2621

<v Speaker 2>Mad men or something like that.</v>

2622
01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:55.390
<v Speaker 2>There's a cool store where they have it</v>
<v Speaker 2>set up in Denver.</v>

2623
01:42:55.391 --> 01:42:57.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're getting a little line</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they're like,</v>

2624
01:42:57.130 --> 01:42:59.830
<v Speaker 2>next place and then you go up to La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

2625
01:42:59.831 --> 01:43:01.870
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you looking to do?</v>

2626
01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:02.470
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

2627
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:03.640
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess get high,</v>

2628
01:43:03.670 --> 01:43:05.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she helps you through your</v>

2629
01:43:05.831 --> 01:43:09.070
<v Speaker 2>journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my first medical marijuana card,</v>

2630
01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:13.120
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in like 2000 or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2631
01:43:13.121 --> 01:43:15.860
<v Speaker 2>I forget what year it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I used to go to a place called</v>

2632
01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Inglewood wellness center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the only place where you could</v>

2633
01:43:18.281 --> 01:43:21.490
<v Speaker 2>get legal weed that I knew about because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my connections.</v>

2634
01:43:21.491 --> 01:43:25.750
<v Speaker 2>I would go down to Inglewood de Hood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>d a h o d do it.</v>

2635
01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:30.340
<v Speaker 2>And I was going there for a while until</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys that was working there</v>

2636
01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:31.390
<v Speaker 2>got shot.</v>

2637
01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:35.800
<v Speaker 2>They got robbed and he got shot in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach while,</v>

2638
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:37.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I was a patron there,</v>

2639
01:43:37.691 --> 01:43:41.020
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't there the day that it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was the place that I was going.</v>

2640
01:43:41.021 --> 01:43:41.790
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2641
01:43:41.790 --> 01:43:45.460
<v Speaker 2>looks like I'm getting my wheat in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different spot now called doc man,</v>

2642
01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:46.313
<v Speaker 2>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2643
01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.730
<v Speaker 2>they were getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't allowed to buy things with</v>

2644
01:43:48.731 --> 01:43:51.230
<v Speaker 2>credit cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would go there and you would have</v>

2645
01:43:51.231 --> 01:43:53.150
<v Speaker 2>to use cash and I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2646
01:43:53.151 --> 01:43:55.160
<v Speaker 2>they had a bunch of cash on hand and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people getting shot.</v>

2647
01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:57.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they were allowed to use credit cards</v>

2648
01:43:57.261 --> 01:43:58.880
<v Speaker 2>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now you can.</v>

2649
01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:00.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean now it's essentially like full</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

2650
01:44:00.891 --> 01:44:02.840
<v Speaker 2>but in Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2651
01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:07.100
<v Speaker 2>they're having real issues still because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they won't let them deposit money the</v>

2652
01:44:07.101 --> 01:44:10.760
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to get cash for a lot of</v>

2653
01:44:10.761 --> 01:44:11.120
<v Speaker 2>the places.</v>

2654
01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:15.590
<v Speaker 2>We're only allowing them to get cash and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have to bring this cash to safe</v>

2655
01:44:15.591 --> 01:44:18.190
<v Speaker 2>deposit boxes and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

2656
01:44:18.230 --> 01:44:20.750
<v Speaker 2>it was like real sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were hiring Merck's,</v>

2657
01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:23.790
<v Speaker 2>they were hiring mercenaries to carry</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cash around.</v>

2658
01:44:23.791 --> 01:44:27.130
<v Speaker 2>So they have these former,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a shit.</v>

2659
01:44:27.650 --> 01:44:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Karen [inaudible] walking around with</v>
<v Speaker 2>bags of cash worried about being robbed</v>

2660
01:44:32.271 --> 01:44:35.230
<v Speaker 2>and people did get robbed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy sketchy stuff.</v>

2661
01:44:35.231 --> 01:44:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my experience there,</v>

2662
01:44:36.081 --> 01:44:38.810
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I edibles were something I never</v>

2663
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:40.580
<v Speaker 2>really liked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did them once when I was like in</v>

2664
01:44:40.670 --> 01:44:42.680
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the end of college and I was in</v>

2665
01:44:42.681 --> 01:44:45.050
<v Speaker 2>Amsterdam and I ate space cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2666
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:47.570
<v Speaker 2>and it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a great time and then the next day</v>

2667
01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:49.430
<v Speaker 2>we were leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with my friends and we were</v>

2668
01:44:49.431 --> 01:44:53.540
<v Speaker 2>getting on a train to Brussels and I and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ate two space cakes because I was like</v>

2669
01:44:53.541 --> 01:44:54.530
<v Speaker 2>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>space cake.</v>

2670
01:44:54.630 --> 01:44:55.463
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2671
01:44:55.730 --> 01:44:57.740
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on a train for like four hours in</v>

2672
01:44:57.741 --> 01:45:00.190
<v Speaker 2>a tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Gimme.</v>

2673
01:45:00.191 --> 01:45:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I'll just look at trade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2674
01:45:02.150 --> 01:45:04.130
<v Speaker 2>I vividly remembered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2675
01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:06.240
<v Speaker 2>I will never do this again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when,</v>

2676
01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:09.170
<v Speaker 2>but now they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's portioned out.</v>

2677
01:45:09.230 --> 01:45:10.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you go to Denver,</v>

2678
01:45:10.491 --> 01:45:14.430
<v Speaker 2>she's like one gummy bear dry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 10 milligrams of marijuana try.</v>

2679
01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I think they have a rule now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sell them to you in these,</v>

2680
01:45:17.241 --> 01:45:18.650
<v Speaker 2>in when I was in Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2681
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:22.330
<v Speaker 2>I bought these tubes and the tubes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 gummy bears.</v>

2682
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And each one was 10 milligrams.</v>

2683
01:45:24.371 --> 01:45:25.910
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you eat the whole one,</v>

2684
01:45:25.911 --> 01:45:27.740
<v Speaker 2>you go to space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole tube.</v>

2685
01:45:27.741 --> 01:45:30.590
<v Speaker 2>He goes space or you can do it like one</v>
<v Speaker 2>company at a time.</v>

2686
01:45:30.630 --> 01:45:33.050
<v Speaker 2>You actually weren't gum gum drops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't bears.</v>

2687
01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:34.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what it is.</v>

2688
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:36.240
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what that night I was out</v>
<v Speaker 2>with went chappelle.</v>

2689
01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I had a pocket full of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave you one of those,</v>

2690
01:45:38.461 --> 01:45:41.120
<v Speaker 2>so in those tubes I had a bunch of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting back there.</v>

2691
01:45:41.121 --> 01:45:42.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to take these.</v>

2692
01:45:42.490 --> 01:45:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I also had a.</v>

2693
01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:46.880
<v Speaker 2>The little caramels to those things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2694
01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:49.250
<v Speaker 2>You just got to get them from a reliable</v>
<v Speaker 2>source.</v>

2695
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:52.310
<v Speaker 2>You get them from a reliable source and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're consistent.</v>

2696
01:45:52.311 --> 01:45:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Then you're okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you take some big chances when you</v>

2697
01:45:54.741 --> 01:45:56.200
<v Speaker 2>take an edible from somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll kidding.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the other day.</v>

2706
01:46:14.630 --> 01:46:15.800
<v Speaker 2>It was a really good restaurant.</v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2712
01:46:23.721 --> 01:46:26.830
<v Speaker 2>You go through the kitchen to get to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>green room and then they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bring vitamins,</v>

2739
01:47:26.490 --> 01:47:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I bring probiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My company on it has this thing called</v>

2740
01:47:29.250 --> 01:47:32.070
<v Speaker 2>total gut health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I bring these packets of probiotics.</v>

2741
01:47:32.071 --> 01:47:35.460
<v Speaker 2>I think that's super important and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>all live stuff that exists off the</v>

2742
01:47:35.461 --> 01:47:38.460
<v Speaker 2>substrate that's in the capsule so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can actually get real live</v>

2743
01:47:38.461 --> 01:47:42.540
<v Speaker 2>probiotics and then I eat probiotics to</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff is really important if</v>

2744
01:47:42.541 --> 01:47:44.510
<v Speaker 2>you want to maintain your immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2745
01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:45.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that stuff.</v>

2746
01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:48.240
<v Speaker 2>And then just that's what I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggling with salads.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like I'm not sick,</v>

2748

<v Speaker 2>from the flight itself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gross.</v>

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:11.221
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2759
01:48:11.221 --> 01:48:12.031
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2760
01:48:12.031 --> 01:48:14.940
<v Speaker 2>that's the other thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with America right now,</v>

2761
01:48:14.941 --> 01:48:17.670
<v Speaker 2>like I never posted a picture of food in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my entire life.</v>

2762
01:48:17.671 --> 01:48:22.200
<v Speaker 2>I posted a photo of a Jimmy John's</v>
<v Speaker 2>sandwich when I was in Chicago just</v>

2763
01:48:22.201 --> 01:48:23.490
<v Speaker 2>because we don't have Jimmy John's in</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York.</v>

2764
01:48:23.491 --> 01:48:24.180
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh great.</v>

2765
01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:25.040

<v Speaker 2>I lived here.</v>

2766
01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:27.820
<v Speaker 2>People were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't eat Jimmy John's he's at</v>

<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>

01:48:33.690 --> 01:48:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Apparently John Do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

2772
01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:36.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's find out.</v>

2773
01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:38.730
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes and hunts like big game,</v>

2774
01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:41.310
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a big game like elephants and shit,</v>

2775
01:48:41.370 --> 01:48:42.510
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's pull it up.</v>

2776
01:48:42.511 --> 01:48:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Let's find out what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

2777
01:48:43.681 --> 01:48:44.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

2778
01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:46.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then people were going and then</v>

2779
01:48:46.381 --> 01:48:50.230
<v Speaker 2>somebody goes and he's a Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go look at the big game hunting thing</v>

2780
01:48:50.231 --> 01:48:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I,</v>

2781
01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:53.790
<v Speaker 2>if I can't eat food made by a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican,</v>

2782
01:48:53.850 --> 01:48:56.550
<v Speaker 2>which good luck finding a good steak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're talking about.</v>

2783
01:48:57.250 --> 01:48:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Think those ranchers are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love that people think that that's</v>

2784
01:48:59.910 --> 01:49:01.770
<v Speaker 2>evil being a Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>

2785
01:49:02.250 --> 01:49:03.240
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron.</v>

2786
01:49:03.241 --> 01:49:04.074
<v Speaker 2>Paul wasn't evil.</v>

2787
01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:07.890
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>republicans that would fit into a lot of</v>

2788
01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:10.710
<v Speaker 2>people's ideas of what would be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable politician.</v>

2789
01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:13.830
<v Speaker 2>It's just we think of Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think of the right wrist of the right</v>

2790
01:49:13.831 --> 01:49:15.780
<v Speaker 2>wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hardest of the hard sell.</v>

2791
01:49:16.050 --> 01:49:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me the biggest issue is,</v>

2792
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:18.660
<v Speaker 2>is the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2793
01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:21.560
<v Speaker 2>that's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he just farming and human and</v>

2794
01:49:21.570 --> 01:49:22.780
<v Speaker 2>people having rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2795
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:25.230
<v Speaker 2>That's my biggest fear about right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like gay people.</v>

2796
01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm worried that they're gonna be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to get married,</v>

2797
01:49:27.331 --> 01:49:29.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the word gay people aren't gonna be</v>

2798
01:49:29.611 --> 01:49:31.410
<v Speaker 2>able to get married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull up to that microphone a little bit</v>

2799
01:49:31.411 --> 01:49:33.660
<v Speaker 2>closer there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried that like that could go</v>

2800
01:49:33.661 --> 01:49:34.500
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2801
01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:35.220
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2802
01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:36.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2803
01:49:36.241 --> 01:49:38.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think gay people would be psyched,</v>

2804
01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:39.370
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2805
01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:41.370
<v Speaker 2>that bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of paying.</v>

2806
01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:44.370
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like rights to me are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that you can't fuck with,</v>

2807
01:49:44.371 --> 01:49:46.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's one.</v>

2808
01:49:46.231 --> 01:49:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just hope I wish they'd make straight</v>

2809
01:49:48.401 --> 01:49:51.160
<v Speaker 2>marriage illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy John's Gore may sandwiches.</v>

2810
01:49:51.161 --> 01:49:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kills leopards.</v>

2811
01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the ram on the upper left hand</v>

2812
01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:57.910
<v Speaker 2>corner got no problem with that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat rams and they're delicious.</v>

2813
01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:01.510
<v Speaker 2>They're sheep and then also you spend a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of money to hunt one of those things</v>

2814
01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:04.510
<v Speaker 2>and that money directly goes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservation.</v>

2815
01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:06.550
<v Speaker 2>The bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a grizzly bear.</v>

2816
01:50:06.551 --> 01:50:08.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a brown bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't eat those,</v>

2817
01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:12.190
<v Speaker 2>but you do have to kill some of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an issue in North America</v>

2818
01:50:12.191 --> 01:50:14.290
<v Speaker 2>where they have too many grizzly bears</v>
<v Speaker 2>in certain areas.</v>

2819
01:50:14.291 --> 01:50:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Like in Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually have to kill.</v>

2820
01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.850
<v Speaker 2>You have to kill a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in order to keep the Moose</v>

2821
01:50:18.851 --> 01:50:22.220
<v Speaker 2>population stable because the bears eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the moose calves.</v>

2822
01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:24.880
<v Speaker 2>What are you assuming that that's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brown bear?</v>

2823
01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:26.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely a brown bear and that</v>

2824
01:50:26.141 --> 01:50:28.270
<v Speaker 2>looks like Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming that's what that is.</v>

2825
01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most places that you killed brown bears,</v>

2826
01:50:30.370 --> 01:50:32.500
<v Speaker 2>if it is legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he's killing that bear legally,</v>

2827
01:50:32.501 --> 01:50:34.300
<v Speaker 2>which I assume it is because he's taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>a photo of it.</v>

2828
01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:36.370
<v Speaker 2>You have to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's.</v>

2829
01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:38.950
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You spend so much money to kill those</v>

2830
01:50:38.951 --> 01:50:41.890
<v Speaker 2>things and that money directly goes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservation.</v>

2831
01:50:41.891 --> 01:50:45.790
<v Speaker 2>It's a real catch 22 because the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why those things are alive and</v>

2832
01:50:45.791 --> 01:50:50.140
<v Speaker 2>exist in high populations and aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>decimated and then their wildlife</v>

2833
01:50:50.170 --> 01:50:53.440
<v Speaker 2>habitat is protected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially protecting habitat and</v>

2834
01:50:53.441 --> 01:50:56.500
<v Speaker 2>wetlands for birds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for migrating birds.</v>

2835
01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:58.450
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff comes from conservation</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

2836
01:50:58.451 --> 01:51:01.570
<v Speaker 2>which all comes from hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunting is absolutely the number one</v>

2837
01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:05.830
<v Speaker 2>biggest source of conservation for</v>
<v Speaker 2>wildlife in the United States of America</v>

2838
01:51:05.831 --> 01:51:07.960
<v Speaker 2>by far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No debate about it,</v>

2839
01:51:08.170 --> 01:51:10.720
<v Speaker 2>but then you see them in the upper right</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand corner has got a leopard.</v>

2840
01:51:11.170 --> 01:51:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's real tough to defend because he's</v>

2841
01:51:14.921 --> 01:51:17.530
<v Speaker 2>not eating that fucking leopard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you shooting that liberty to</v>

2842
01:51:17.531 --> 01:51:19.090
<v Speaker 2>shooting it for a trophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2843
01:51:19.091 --> 01:51:22.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just so fucked up to me that</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody would do okay,</v>

2844
01:51:22.451 --> 01:51:27.100
<v Speaker 2>but the deer in the law in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low bottom zero problem with that food.</v>

2845
01:51:27.130 --> 01:51:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$2,</v>

2846
01:51:28.751 --> 01:51:31.090
<v Speaker 2>million car accidents in the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States every year,</v>

2847
01:51:31.150 --> 01:51:31.841
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one point,</v>

2848
01:51:31.841 --> 01:51:35.100
<v Speaker 2>5 million car accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The United States every year from people</v>

2849
01:51:35.110 --> 01:51:40.110
<v Speaker 2>hitting deer and 200 people die because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of accidents involving people hitting</v>

2850
01:51:40.810 --> 01:51:44.680
<v Speaker 2>deer with cars and unless you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring in wolves and mountain lions and</v>

2851
01:51:44.710 --> 01:51:47.920
<v Speaker 2>overpopulate the suburbs with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a problem with deer</v>

2852
01:51:47.921 --> 01:51:50.350
<v Speaker 2>populations unless you have hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a fact.</v>

2853
01:51:50.410 --> 01:51:54.370
<v Speaker 2>And in places like the Hamptons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually hiring snipers to go</v>

2854
01:51:54.371 --> 01:51:56.410
<v Speaker 2>out and shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He killed a fucking rhino that's so</v>

2855
01:51:56.411 --> 01:51:57.141
<v Speaker 2>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They killed it.</v>

2856
01:51:57.141 --> 01:51:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Elephant look at it with a double thumbs</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with an elephant will.</v>

2857
01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I found out about that and I can't</v>

2858
01:52:02.321 --> 01:52:03.670
<v Speaker 2>have sandwiches anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2859
01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we killed a fucking giraffe and he just</v>

2860
01:52:06.641 --> 01:52:09.880
<v Speaker 2>kills everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First he killed a rhino.</v>

2861
01:52:09.930 --> 01:52:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Is that alliance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2862
01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2863
01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:16.240
<v Speaker 2>It's all real sketchy stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2864
01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:19.030
<v Speaker 2>It's real sketchy stuff because in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>

2865
01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:24.060
<v Speaker 2>which there's a great documentary that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Louis Theroux did a about African</v>

2866
01:52:24.581 --> 01:52:27.370
<v Speaker 2>hunting farms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these a wildlife sanctuaries that they</v>

2867
01:52:27.371 --> 01:52:29.290
<v Speaker 2>have in Africa where they just hunted on</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2868
01:52:29.291 --> 01:52:32.680
<v Speaker 2>They big high fence operations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa was on the verge.</v>

2869
01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:36.010
<v Speaker 2>These animals were on the verge of</v>
<v Speaker 2>extinction just a few decades ago and</v>

2870
01:52:36.011 --> 01:52:38.560
<v Speaker 2>now they're thriving and unheard of</v>
<v Speaker 2>populations,</v>

2871
01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:42.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's only because people are paying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go over there and hunt them so they</v>

2872
01:52:42.251 --> 01:52:44.620
<v Speaker 2>protect these animals and then what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>even more fucked up.</v>

2873
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:46.970
<v Speaker 2>They use the term poacher all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2874
01:52:46.971 --> 01:52:50.120
<v Speaker 2>these people are poaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time you think of poaching</v>

2875
01:52:50.121 --> 01:52:52.160
<v Speaker 2>you think will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poachers are bad because poachers are</v>

2876
01:52:52.161 --> 01:52:54.020
<v Speaker 2>the people that are killing elephants</v>
<v Speaker 2>for their ivory,</v>

2877
01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:57.620
<v Speaker 2>that killing rhinos for their horns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of what poaching is poor</v>

2878
01:52:57.621 --> 01:52:59.630
<v Speaker 2>people that are just trying to eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2879
01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:01.040
<v Speaker 2>And you know what they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those poachers,</v>

2880
01:53:01.041 --> 01:53:03.440
<v Speaker 2>they fucking murderer man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shoot them onsite.</v>

2881
01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:05.470
<v Speaker 2>So if someone's killing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2882
01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:07.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a black buck or something like that,</v>

2883
01:53:07.611 --> 01:53:09.890
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game animals that they have the eat,</v>

2884
01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:12.860
<v Speaker 2>they're shooting at these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're shooting and killing them left</v>

2885
01:53:12.861 --> 01:53:13.910
<v Speaker 2>and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was crazy.</v>

2886
01:53:13.911 --> 01:53:15.590
<v Speaker 2>They're leaving their bodies for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hyenas to eat.</v>

2887
01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the tiger thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened the other day with the,</v>

2888
01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:21.500
<v Speaker 2>with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even understand that when I was</v>

2889
01:53:21.501 --> 01:53:22.610
<v Speaker 2>reading about it that they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2890
01:53:22.611 --> 01:53:23.820
<v Speaker 2>that's a tiger farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2891
01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:24.673
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

2892
01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:27.140
<v Speaker 2>That bummed me out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2893
01:53:27.410 --> 01:53:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in.</v>

2894
01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:30.830
<v Speaker 2>Do you know this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a fact.</v>

2895
01:53:30.831 --> 01:53:33.020
<v Speaker 2>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll close on this because from my last</v>

2896
01:53:33.021 --> 01:53:34.250
<v Speaker 2>netflix special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>

2897
01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:37.760
<v Speaker 2>There's more tigers in captivity in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas than there are in all of the wild</v>

2898
01:53:37.761 --> 01:53:38.594
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>

2899
01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:39.780
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2900
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:44.660
<v Speaker 2>More Tigers in people's backyards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In private collections in Texas.</v>

2901
01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Then the rest of the people who own pet</v>
<v Speaker 2>tigers.</v>

2902
01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas has no rules.</v>

2903
01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Texas is a really fucked up place for</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that think that the government</v>

2904
01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:57.320
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't own land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of people that think</v>

2905
01:53:57.321 --> 01:53:59.720
<v Speaker 2>that the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>federal government shouldn't own land</v>

2906
01:53:59.721 --> 01:54:01.790
<v Speaker 2>that should give it to the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is a state will</v>

2907
01:54:01.791 --> 01:54:05.330
<v Speaker 2>then sell it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a good example that is Texas of what</v>

2908
01:54:05.331 --> 01:54:08.090
<v Speaker 2>could happen is Texas has very little</v>
<v Speaker 2>public land.</v>

2909
01:54:08.330 --> 01:54:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Texas is almost all private land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I called a lot of the hunting in</v>

2910
01:54:12.201 --> 01:54:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Texas is all on private ranches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then these private ranches,</v>

2911
01:54:15.981 --> 01:54:17.660
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of do whatever the fuck you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

2912
01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:19.880
<v Speaker 2>And they bring in all these animals from</v>
<v Speaker 2>all over the world.</v>

2913
01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:20.893
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2914
01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:25.580
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an animal called a symitar oryx and Orix</v>

2915
01:54:25.730 --> 01:54:26.960
<v Speaker 2>in Africa.</v>

2916
01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:29.780
<v Speaker 2>I think there are Asian animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget where they're from,</v>

2917
01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:33.770
<v Speaker 2>but wherever they're from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe India or wherever they're from,</v>

2918
01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:36.260
<v Speaker 2>they're very endangered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not In Texas,</v>

2919
01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:39.290
<v Speaker 2>in Texas is fucking thousands of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all over the place.</v>

2920
01:54:39.291 --> 01:54:42.620
<v Speaker 2>And these ranches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can go and hunt what in its</v>

2921
01:54:42.621 --> 01:54:46.340
<v Speaker 2>native country you wouldn't hunt because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's small populations of them,</v>

2922
01:54:46.610 --> 01:54:50.450
<v Speaker 2>but in Texas they encourage hunting of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them because they have overpopulation.</v>

2923
01:54:50.451 --> 01:54:52.940
<v Speaker 2>That animal right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>symitar horned oryx.</v>

2924
01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:56.000
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can go to these places in Texas</v>

2925
01:54:56.001 --> 01:54:58.400
<v Speaker 2>and you can fucking shoot those and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're delicious.</v>

2926
01:54:58.420 --> 01:54:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Where?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his name died?</v>

2927
01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a justice.</v>

2928
01:55:01.970 --> 01:55:03.800

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2929
01:55:03.801 --> 01:55:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Died.</v>

2930
01:55:04.701 --> 01:55:07.310
<v Speaker 2>They think they lacked dumb little think</v>
<v Speaker 2>they whacked him.</v>

2931
01:55:07.370 --> 01:55:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he died with a pillow on his face.</v>

2932
01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:11.690
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

2933
01:55:11.950 --> 01:55:13.640
<v Speaker 2>it was a little bit of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what happened?</v>

2934
01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:15.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the naked gun when he throws a pillow</v>

2935
01:55:15.521 --> 01:55:16.354
<v Speaker 2>out of them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2936
01:55:17.650 --> 01:55:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Tell you what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even really old.</v>

2937
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:21.110
<v Speaker 2>He was like 70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't that old?</v>

2938
01:55:21.450 --> 01:55:24.910
<v Speaker 2>He was snoring and his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just you fucking car.</v>

2939
01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:26.360
<v Speaker 2>I think it was alone enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2940
01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:28.160
<v Speaker 2>He probably just had a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of fat.</v>

2941
01:55:28.370 --> 01:55:29.930
<v Speaker 2>What was his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justice Scalia.</v>

2942
01:55:29.931 --> 01:55:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Scalia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scalia.</v>

2943
01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:31.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2944
01:55:31.731 --> 01:55:34.310
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of a Dick though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't always super right wing Guy,</v>

2945
01:55:34.311 --> 01:55:34.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2946
01:55:34.650 --> 01:55:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that just right when you look below,</v>

2947
01:55:37.860 --> 01:55:39.860
<v Speaker 2>there's the dead with a pillow over his</v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

2948
01:55:39.861 --> 01:55:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Ranch over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2949
01:55:40.821 --> 01:55:43.260
<v Speaker 2>he might've put that pillow over his</v>
<v Speaker 2>head because people are talking the</v>

2950
01:55:43.261 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 2>other room and he wanted to be</v>

2951
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.090
<v Speaker 1>quiet and then he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2952
01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:47.430
<v Speaker 1>I've put pillows over my head before</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were talking,</v>

2953
01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:50.060
<v Speaker 1>we discovered a judge in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pillow over his head.</v>

2954
01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:53.100
<v Speaker 1>His clothes were unwrinkled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then he probably just died.</v>

2955
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.280
<v Speaker 1>30,000 Acre luxury ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>El Presidente Day.</v>

2956

01:55:59.521 --> 01:56:01.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,000 acres.</v>

2959
01:56:02.850 --> 01:56:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these people would go to these</v>

2960
01:56:04.051 --> 01:56:06.240
<v Speaker 1>ranches and they still do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go to these ranches and you can</v>

2961
01:56:06.241 --> 01:56:09.090
<v Speaker 1>hunt wild African animals there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nuts man.</v>

2962
01:56:09.091 --> 01:56:10.260
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2963
01:56:10.290 --> 01:56:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Well there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2965
01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Would you be interested in doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be interested in if I ate it,</v>

2966
01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:19.620
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy I had no interest in killing</v>

2967
01:56:19.621 --> 01:56:21.540
<v Speaker 1>something to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it,</v>

2968
01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:23.530
<v Speaker 1>but I eat meat so I always felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you kind of.</v>

2969
01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:27.300
<v Speaker 1>When I was in Australia I spent like</v>
<v Speaker 1>five days on a sheep station,</v>

2970
01:56:27.301 --> 01:56:28.350
<v Speaker 1>which like a big sheet for him.</v>

2971
01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:31.230
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing and I was like herding</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheep on a motorcycle.</v>

2972
01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:34.560
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing and cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while I was there,</v>

2973
01:56:34.561 --> 01:56:37.440
<v Speaker 1>he slaughtered to sheep and I was there</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he slaughtered them and he like,</v>

2974
01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow it into my hand.</v>

2975
01:56:38.521 --> 01:56:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I like brought them to the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like really intense experience.</v>

2976
01:56:41.490 --> 01:56:42.540
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he does.</v>

2977
01:56:42.630 --> 01:56:46.050
<v Speaker 1>That's how this got slaughtered on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot him in the head or the neck,</v>

2978
01:56:46.110 --> 01:56:48.120
<v Speaker 1>cut their Mac and then he like hangs</v>
<v Speaker 1>them upside down.</v>

2979
01:56:48.150 --> 01:56:50.920
<v Speaker 1>It was like a really intense thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say they just shoot them because if they</v>

2980
01:56:50.921 --> 01:56:53.530
<v Speaker 1>shoot them they die instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why would they cut their.</v>

2981
01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what their neck thing seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>so cruel.</v>

2982
01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:56.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was weird.</v>

2983
01:56:56.851 --> 01:56:59.280
<v Speaker 1>It was me and these like for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia and it's like,</v>

2984
01:56:59.290 --> 01:57:00.123
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2985
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I was just standing there drinking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>beer.</v>

2986
01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:02.251
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

2987
01:57:02.251 --> 01:57:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Just cut a cut a sheep snack man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we do it on long island</v>

2988
01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:11.160
<v Speaker 1>was east Hampton where I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2989
01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:13.400
<v Speaker 1>we didn't cut any next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2990
01:57:13.590 --> 01:57:16.510
<v Speaker 1>but I've thought about doing a show</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I take people hunting that I've</v>

2991
01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:18.240
<v Speaker 1>never hunted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe comics,</v>

2992
01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:21.300
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't think it's the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to approach hunting.</v>

2993
01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:25.530
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's too confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too dark and it's also a,</v>

2994
01:57:26.010 --> 01:57:29.490
<v Speaker 1>it would take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would make content a spectacle to me</v>

2995
01:57:29.610 --> 01:57:31.590
<v Speaker 1>versus a what it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2996
01:57:31.670 --> 01:57:33.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would go like if I went with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you when I went with people knew what</v>

2997
01:57:33.841 --> 01:57:35.590
<v Speaker 1>they were doing and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2998
01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:37.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

2999
01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My problem is my also my hunting time is</v>

3000
01:57:40.171 --> 01:57:41.850

3001
01:57:41.851 --> 01:57:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be teaching anybody.</v>

3002
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:45.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure it out myself.</v>
