1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.530
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>So that's the scene.</v>

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.093
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

4
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.590
<v Speaker 1>and when I say where did you get this?</v>

8
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Depp actually hadn't lived a funny line.</v>

10
00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:11.950
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

11
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 1>my dentist.</v>

12
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.983
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

13
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.800
<v Speaker 1>it was funny cause he's turns out he's a very funny guy.</v>

14
00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:21.430
<v Speaker 1>But I did say this when I was filming that scene and it became in my standup,</v>

15
00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:23.760
<v Speaker 1>I hate to be corny and do a story from my standard,</v>

16
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.603
<v Speaker 1>but it is true.</v>

17
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.300
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really know those guys at well at all.</v>

18
00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

19
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.681
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

20
00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>is anybody in this scene not on probation?</v>

21
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.690
<v Speaker 1>And Johnny Depp's like,</v>

22
00:00:34.691 --> 00:00:35.231
<v Speaker 1>what did you do?</v>

23
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:35.561
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

24
00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:35.921
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

25
00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:37.060
<v Speaker 1>the tonight show I'm fired.</v>

26
00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:37.391
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

27
00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:37.721
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

28
00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:38.441
<v Speaker 1>why did you do that?</v>

29
00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:38.711
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

30
00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

31
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.970
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was funny.</v>

32
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm like,</v>

33
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.420
<v Speaker 1>you smashed up that hotel.</v>

34
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.471
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

35
00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:44.711
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

36
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:44.991
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

37
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:45.700
<v Speaker 1>were you drunk?</v>

38
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.930
<v Speaker 1>And Johnny Depp is funny.</v>

39
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:47.500
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

40
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.311
<v Speaker 1>in my defense,</v>

41
00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:49.930
<v Speaker 1>the hotel room made the first move</v>

42
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.330
<v Speaker 1>and this is a true story.</v>

43
00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Cause then I look over at Paul Reubens and he's just trying to ignore the</v>

44
00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:55.810
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

45
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.441
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like,</v>

46
00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:56.681
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

47
00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:57.191
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

48
00:00:57.191 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I rubbed that is a weird rock and roll thing,</v>

49
00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:02.081
<v Speaker 1>the trash,</v>

50
00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:05.740
<v Speaker 1>the hotel room and have accountants pay for it all.</v>

51
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.080
<v Speaker 1>But I've always felt like during,</v>

52
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.720
<v Speaker 1>there was a period where I was trashing television shows,</v>

53
00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:11.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.541
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

55
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:12.520
<v Speaker 1>and it was just,</v>

56
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I had the same kind of frustration and rage and I thought,</v>

57
00:01:15.281 --> 00:01:16.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

58
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.470
<v Speaker 1>if I do it at a Holiday Inn,</v>

59
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:18.671
<v Speaker 1>big deal,</v>

61
00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:20.080
<v Speaker 1>why don't I do it on a TV show?</v>

62
00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:21.430
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of funny at least.</v>

63
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

64
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.551
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

65
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:23.650
<v Speaker 1>That makes no sense to you.</v>

66
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.933
<v Speaker 1>Looking at me</v>

67
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.360
<v Speaker 1>like the RCA victor dog just staring at me.</v>

68
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kind of see your point.</v>

69
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.421
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>

70
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:32.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

71
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:34.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't see the point of doing hotel rooms.</v>

72
00:01:34.941 --> 00:01:35.780
<v Speaker 1>I've never understood it.</v>

73
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.030
<v Speaker 1>He just smashing shit and like,</v>

74
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:38.601
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

75
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>That's just out of boredom.</v>

76
00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:40.904
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

77
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's so stupid to me,</v>

78
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:44.230
<v Speaker 1>just so child me,</v>

79
00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do that because I'd be afraid of waking up people next door.</v>

80
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.443
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>

81
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I have no problems sending the tonight fire or,</v>

82
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.001
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

83
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:54.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

84
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.050
<v Speaker 1>or smashing up the ice Sedenio hall show.</v>

85
00:01:56.051 --> 00:01:57.020
<v Speaker 1>But the idea of,</v>

86
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to put somebody else out to do,</v>

87
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.680
<v Speaker 1>you smashed Arsenio Hall shows too.</v>

88
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.330
<v Speaker 1>What did you do there?</v>

89
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Way crazier than the tonight show.</v>

91
00:02:03.281 --> 00:02:03.670
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

92
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.031
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

93
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:04.331
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

94
00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:04.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

95
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Cause he got fired,</v>

96
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.761
<v Speaker 1>because of,</v>

98
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:08.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.130
<v Speaker 1>they put Chevy Chase on and 70 markets in front of them.</v>

100
00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:14.200
<v Speaker 1>So paramount kind of fucked him over.</v>

101
00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 1>So I went out and I said,</v>

102
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.550
<v Speaker 1>are you really quitting?</v>

103
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Is like the week or two before?</v>

104
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:20.261
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

105
00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:20.561
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

106
00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:20.861
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

107
00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:20.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

108
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:22.720
<v Speaker 1>let's not make it easy on them,</v>

109
00:02:22.721 --> 00:02:23.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:26.230
<v Speaker 1>so I spray painted paramount sucks on the backdrop.</v>

111
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.350
<v Speaker 1>And then I,</v>

112
00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:30.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

113
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I started throwing the couches into the audience and the crowd was going crazy.</v>

114
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.941
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

115
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:37.960
<v Speaker 1>And then I remember I took a television set monitor and just threw it and then</v>

116
00:02:37.961 --> 00:02:38.471
<v Speaker 1>put my,</v>

117
00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:38.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.290
<v Speaker 1>put my work boots through the back of it,</v>

119
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.351
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

120
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:44.860
<v Speaker 1>which is way more expensive than anything I did on the tonight show.</v>

121
00:02:44.861 --> 00:02:45.311
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

122
00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:46.110
<v Speaker 1>So then they,</v>

123
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.620
<v Speaker 1>they like tell Arsenio,</v>

124
00:02:47.621 --> 00:02:47.861
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

125
00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:48.311
<v Speaker 1>get him.</v>

126
00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:50.950
<v Speaker 1>And so he wrestles me down and as he's got me on the ground,</v>

127
00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:51.251
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

128
00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:52.090
<v Speaker 1>thank you man.</v>

129
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.403
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

130
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

131

<v Speaker 1>because it's such a colossal fuck you.</v>

132
00:02:57.491 --> 00:02:58.121
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>

133
00:02:58.121 --> 00:02:58.541

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>and he came in the dressing room and he's like,</v>

138
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:05.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

142
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 1>cause cause they were hoping and I do something fucked up.</v>

143
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.081
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

144
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not blaming them.</v>

145
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean I wasn't asking that was a bit of the green light.</v>

146
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.811
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

147
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean I knew that that was on there to do something screwy but,</v>

148
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

149

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:03:20.961 --> 00:03:23.790
