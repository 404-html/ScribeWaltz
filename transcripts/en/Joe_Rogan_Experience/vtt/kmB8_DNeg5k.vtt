<v Speaker 1>I'm on on it right now.</v>

98
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:20.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing a tee shirt and I'm hopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>up on Alpha brain,</v>

99
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>some fucking Alpha brain dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last night,</v>

100
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go good googly moonlight.</v>

101
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I took Alpha brain with dinner and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to bed about four hours later and</v>

102
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:37.291
<v Speaker 1>had paula deen wrestling dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wrestling Paula Paula Dean on a </v>

103
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:43.351
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic rainbow is the most bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit there was skateboards involved and </v>

104
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>it was the drippings at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're going to get an animation</v>

105
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:51.970
<v Speaker 1>of that now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the birth of that into the ether,</v>

106
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 1>one can only hope if I'm even if Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain didn't,</v>

107
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>it didn't enhance your cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>function,</v>

108
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:04.061
<v Speaker 1>which it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now it's been clinically proven to </v>

109
00:06:04.061 --> 00:06:06.521
<v Speaker 1>do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth taking just for the fucking </v>

110
00:06:06.521 --> 00:06:06.521
<v Speaker 1>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

111
00:06:06.521 --> 00:06:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's Coleen is a Columbian.</v>

112
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Coleen helps regulate the rem state in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your sleep.</v>

113
00:06:10.331 --> 00:06:13.930
<v Speaker 2>And Rem state is the dream state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the more acetylcholine you have,</v>

114
00:06:13.931 --> 00:06:17.590
<v Speaker 2>generally the longer and deeper your rem</v>
<v Speaker 2>states going to be.</v>

115
00:06:17.591 --> 00:06:19.180
<v Speaker 2>So the crazier dreams can get,</v>

116
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 1>so whether or not even want to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain,</v>

117
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.920
<v Speaker 1>double up on that Acetylcholine and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a wild ride and it's a safe ride </v>

118
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

119
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:30.830
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think you're going to die,</v>

120
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure you can die in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

121
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Has that ever been proven can die in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your dreams?</v>

122
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just wake up.</v>

123
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 1>That works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's a fact.</v>

124
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

125
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you could lie about it.</v>

126
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 1>I thought in my dream people will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

127
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 1>well the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if.</v>

128
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Well usually the adrenaline of the pre </v>
<v Speaker 2>death moment usually wakes you up.</v>

129
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

130
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

131
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.900
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I've found with Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain that's really interesting is that </v>

133
00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.560
<v Speaker 1>lucid dreams are much more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're much more durable.</v>

134
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Like I've always found that whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never taken any lucid dream,</v>

135
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>courses.</v>

136
00:07:04.931 --> 00:07:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I've never read any books and lucid </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

137
00:07:06.461 --> 00:07:11.461
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there's a lot of strategies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can use and one of them have </v>

138
00:07:11.461 --> 00:07:12.700
<v Speaker 1>done that I saw in one of those silly </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

139
00:07:12.701 --> 00:07:16.290
<v Speaker 1>like the secret one of those movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the rabbit hole or whatever,</v>

140
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.060
<v Speaker 1>what the bleep do we know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was where a guy was saying,</v>

141
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.440
<v Speaker 1>go to every door that you walk through </v>
<v Speaker 1>and before you walked through a knock on</v>

142
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:24.610
<v Speaker 1>the wall and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I dreaming?</v>

143
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.720
<v Speaker 1>And do it as a habit so that every time </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go through a door you go,</v>

144
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.960
<v Speaker 1>am I dreaming?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One time I did it my dream and it was </v>

145
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:33.960
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoosh.</v>

146
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

147
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.290
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I really did wake up in the middle of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream and it was,</v>

149
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.690
<v Speaker 1>but it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very durable.</v>

150
00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:41.590
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting.</v>

151
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can stay in it and play with it and </v>

152
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 2>see what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see where you can take it.</v>

153
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not normal.</v>

154
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Usually I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

155
00:07:48.391 --> 00:07:52.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm dreaming and I wake up and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>gone parties over instantly.</v>

156
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Like I've had a few where I was flying </v>
<v Speaker 2>for like 15 seconds or something like </v>

157
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the Alpha brain dream.</v>

158
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.020
<v Speaker 2>How long does it take for you to turn to</v>
<v Speaker 2>lucid dream into sex?</v>

159
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.310
<v Speaker 2>Because all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instantly,</v>

160
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.680
<v Speaker 2>instantly I find someone and just start </v>
<v Speaker 2>a rape fast.</v>

161
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the dreams they all want to fuck,</v>

162
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.720
<v Speaker 2>which has reared in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my dreams.</v>

163
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Very exciting since</v>

164
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 1>I've been here last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were finally able to publish some of </v>

165
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

166
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.480
<v Speaker 1>the first of a series of clinical tests </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the first one on Alpha brain.</v>

167
00:08:24.481 --> 00:08:26.370
<v Speaker 1>So tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell some people about that because it's</v>

168
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.070
<v Speaker 1>pretty exciting.</v>

169
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:32.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did a pilot study just to kind of </v>

170
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.231
<v Speaker 2>prove the concept with the Boston Center</v>
<v Speaker 2>for memory and a double blind placebo </v>

171
00:08:34.231 --> 00:08:36.250
<v Speaker 2>controlled study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People took to Alpha brain pills,</v>

172
00:08:36.251 --> 00:08:41.251
<v Speaker 2>which was kind of hard to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we did a survey and a lot of </v>

173
00:08:41.251 --> 00:08:44.341
<v Speaker 2>people take three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the majority is still take to some </v>

174
00:08:44.341 --> 00:08:45.870
<v Speaker 2>people or some people take one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few savages take for you in J.</v>

175
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Hawk take for fees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Averages take four.</v>

176
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.030
<v Speaker 2>So we went with two and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

177
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 2>and did a study testing a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive markers and even with a small </v>

178
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 2>sample size we had 17 people total go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

179
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 2>We're able to achieve statistical </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance in a couple of key tests,</v>

180
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 2>stroop inhibition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>test,</v>

181
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 2>executive cognitive functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some verbal memory tests.</v>

182
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.580
<v Speaker 2>So some really good indications that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alpha brain is having the desired effect</v>

183
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:13.720
<v Speaker 2>that you know all the people who take it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

184
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.740
<v Speaker 2>everybody who likes it as has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about now we have some science </v>

185
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.761
<v Speaker 2>to back it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're currently in a followup study </v>

186
00:09:22.761 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 2>with about 80 patients that's halfway </v>
<v Speaker 2>through right now.</v>

187
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a rolling enrollment and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully we'll get some of that data at</v>

188
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 2>least to us by the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you look at the publication and</v>

189
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 2>presentation scheduled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're stoked.</v>

190
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:38.691
<v Speaker 2>I actually found out after the results </v>
<v Speaker 2>came out that they didn't expect it to </v>

191
00:09:38.691 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not The people who are doing it.</v>

192
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.580
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

193
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:40.950
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

194
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.700
<v Speaker 1>It's really worked well for folks who </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know before we did any studies on </v>

195
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:51.230
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There have been studies done on the </v>

196
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.661
<v Speaker 1>individual individual ingredients of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain and that's something like </v>

197
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.640
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no forgiveness is snake oil.</v>

198
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snake oil did the.</v>

199
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.940
<v Speaker 1>The concept behind Alpha brain was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would work synergistically,</v>

200
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.300
<v Speaker 1>which has proven to be correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ingredients,</v>

201
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 1>the individual ingredients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is science behind it.</v>

202
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:12.330
<v Speaker 1>There's research and references.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of it's available at [inaudible] dot</v>

203
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:14.240

241
00:11:59.001 --> 00:12:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pleasure to meet you.</v>

243
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Pleasure to have you in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

244
00:12:03.741 --> 00:12:04.640
<v Speaker 1>I've heard many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

245
00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:07.820
<v Speaker 1>many fantastic things about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy over here raves,</v>

246
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:12.970
<v Speaker 1>rants and raves and I know you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently on the warrior poet project </v>

247
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.900
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is his podcast and he couldn't say</v>

248
00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.340
<v Speaker 1>enough good things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

249
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to have you in here,</v>

250
00:12:17.661 --> 00:12:20.000
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had to have to learn some stuff.</v>

251
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Have to figure out what you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulated for all your years of </v>

252
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.931
<v Speaker 1>research and writing books and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>books all seemed to be about getting </v>

253
00:12:29.361 --> 00:12:31.970
<v Speaker 1>your shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About producing results.</v>

254
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Starting with the 48 laws of power,</v>

255
00:12:36.211 --> 00:12:41.211
<v Speaker 4>I basically decided to enter the self </v>
<v Speaker 4>help genre with a lot of trepidation </v>

256
00:12:41.641 --> 00:12:43.470
<v Speaker 4>because I think it's full of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>

257
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

258
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:46.830
<v Speaker 1>What are you saying?</v>

259
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that it's filled with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of tree stuff that's gonna make you feel</v>

260
00:12:54.531 --> 00:12:58.100
<v Speaker 4>good about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to boost your ego a bit,</v>

261
00:12:58.101 --> 00:13:03.101
<v Speaker 4>but doesn't get anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing real behind it that </v>

262
00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:06.490
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some things about life that are </v>

263
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.131
<v Speaker 4>harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are people out there that are </v>

264
00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:09.131
<v Speaker 4>dirty and mean that you need to know </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

265
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:14.190
<v Speaker 4>There's all sorts of things that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>being discussed in these books.</v>

266
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.890
<v Speaker 4>And I know for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I started out,</v>

267
00:13:18.891 --> 00:13:20.690
<v Speaker 4>like in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to work in Hollywood,</v>

268
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:26.070
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was really shocked by all of the kind </v>

269
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:29.120
<v Speaker 4>of power maneuvers and the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>passive aggressive games that were going</v>

270
00:13:29.121 --> 00:13:30.560
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did you do in Hollywood?</v>

271
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.150
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't horribly successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a writer.</v>

272
00:13:35.151 --> 00:13:38.720
<v Speaker 4>I was assistant to a producer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>assistant to a director or a researcher,</v>

273
00:13:38.721 --> 00:13:41.360
<v Speaker 4>a story developer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I basically did everything.</v>

274
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.520
<v Speaker 4>So you were where you were connected to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the machine,</v>

275
00:13:43.521 --> 00:13:48.521
<v Speaker 4>you were in there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very much so you got to see the gear </v>

276
00:13:48.521 --> 00:13:48.521
<v Speaker 4>span.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very much so.</v>

277
00:13:48.521 --> 00:13:50.030
<v Speaker 4>And nobody writes about what really goes</v>
<v Speaker 4>on in the world.</v>

278
00:13:50.031 --> 00:13:51.980
<v Speaker 4>I got so sick of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see,</v>

279
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of weird games being played.</v>

280
00:13:54.531 --> 00:13:59.531
<v Speaker 4>The one director,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this one producer who wanted to direct </v>

281
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:03.461
<v Speaker 4>his first film and basically it would </v>
<v Speaker 4>look bad if he was the director of </v>

282
00:14:04.251 --> 00:14:06.860
<v Speaker 4>something that he had sort of put </v>
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>

283
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.920
<v Speaker 4>just wouldn't look good politically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what he did is he hired somebody he </v>

284
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.370
<v Speaker 4>knew would do a terrible job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a director,</v>

285
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.400
<v Speaker 4>first time director,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knew the guy would fail and then he </v>

286
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.580
<v Speaker 4>could go in and rescue him and become </v>
<v Speaker 4>the director on the project.</v>

287
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:24.910
<v Speaker 4>But in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally destroying this other person's </v>

288
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.911
<v Speaker 4>reputation on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could list 100 other sorts of games </v>

289
00:14:27.911 --> 00:14:27.911
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's quite clever.</v>

290
00:14:27.911 --> 00:14:29.870
<v Speaker 4>Move all sorts of things right out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the art of war.</v>

291
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:35.350
<v Speaker 1>That's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just what I can jump in here and </v>

292
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.510
<v Speaker 1>give a bit of my story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found that book,</v>

293
00:14:35.511 --> 00:14:40.511
<v Speaker 1>Robert Greene's 48 laws of power before </v>
<v Speaker 1>I had met you and I was in kind of a </v>

294
00:14:40.511 --> 00:14:44.861
<v Speaker 1>dark time in my own work climate and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started reading it and I started </v>

295
00:14:45.381 --> 00:14:47.930
<v Speaker 1>realizing all of the things that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

296
00:14:47.931 --> 00:14:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

297
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>that's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why this bad shit is happening.</v>

298
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.990
<v Speaker 5>That's why I'm being thwarted in this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in this goal that I have.</v>

299
00:14:56.991 --> 00:15:01.991
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you go in with these good </v>

300
00:15:01.991 --> 00:15:01.991
<v Speaker 5>natured intentions thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to do my best.</v>

301
00:15:01.991 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna wear my heart on my sleeve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's all gonna work out bullshit,</v>

302
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all his.</v>

303
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:11.560
<v Speaker 5>But you can kind of get lucky and get in</v>
<v Speaker 5>touch with the right people to be,</v>

304
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:16.570
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or be in the right in the right </v>

305
00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.191
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But a lot of times if you're in a kind </v>

306
00:15:18.191 --> 00:15:18.350
<v Speaker 5>of politically charged situation or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation with a lot of ego,</v>

307
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his book was like this,</v>

308
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.360
<v Speaker 5>this wake up call of just sheer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unabated truth about what the fuck is </v>

309
00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:28.400
<v Speaker 5>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not so that I could do it myself,</v>

310
00:15:28.401 --> 00:15:32.090
<v Speaker 5>but at least so I could see myself and </v>
<v Speaker 5>see it and identify it.</v>

311
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.420
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

312
00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.370
<v Speaker 1>this move that this producer did in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to.</v>

313
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.830
<v Speaker 1>And that surprise you at all when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

314
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.110
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

315
00:15:40.111 --> 00:15:40.510
<v Speaker 1>you must have</v>

316
00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.350
<v Speaker 5>fucker completely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because he never told me.</v>

317
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.840
<v Speaker 5>Obviously it wasn't going to confide </v>
<v Speaker 5>that this was going on.</v>

318
00:15:45.841 --> 00:15:47.490
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's my interpretation later on.</v>

319
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.200
<v Speaker 5>So you're sure that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened?</v>

320
00:15:49.201 --> 00:15:51.180
<v Speaker 5>Or completely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>100 percent.</v>

321
00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.150
<v Speaker 5>And I've seen him do other things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I saw,</v>

322
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.440
<v Speaker 5>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's that?</v>

323
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.590
<v Speaker 5>I can't date you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't he?</v>

324
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.270
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's no longer among us.</v>

325
00:16:00.271 --> 00:16:05.271
<v Speaker 5>So I don't want to fuck around and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't,</v>

326
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.140
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't a totally awful person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

327
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 5>he had a good side to him that is ripe </v>
<v Speaker 5>with that stuff though.</v>

328
00:16:12.411 --> 00:16:17.411
<v Speaker 5>What really annoyed the hell out of me </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the Hollywood businesses that </v>

329
00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:18.900
<v Speaker 5>people would pretend to be so liberal </v>
<v Speaker 5>and wonderful and good.</v>

330
00:16:18.901 --> 00:16:20.460
<v Speaker 5>I love your project.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're wonderful,</v>

331
00:16:20.461 --> 00:16:25.461
<v Speaker 5>you're great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But at the same time they were so </v>

332
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:25.461
<v Speaker 5>fucking power hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

333
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:29.421
<v Speaker 5>Then nobody really talks about the power</v>
<v Speaker 5>hungry side and about what people are </v>

334
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:29.520
<v Speaker 5>really up.</v>

335
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.300
<v Speaker 1>I worked with a guy on my very first </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitcoms.</v>

336
00:16:32.301 --> 00:16:34.050
<v Speaker 1>The first time I ever did any acting at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

337
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.640
<v Speaker 1>I was like 20 something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 I guess,</v>

338
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.420
<v Speaker 1>or 26 and I was on the show on Fox </v>
<v Speaker 1>called hardball and there was a guy that</v>

339
00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:49.421
<v Speaker 1>was on the show that would insult people</v>
<v Speaker 1>right before it was their time to </v>

340
00:16:50.601 --> 00:16:55.601
<v Speaker 1>perform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you would say something about what </v>

341
00:16:55.601 --> 00:16:55.601
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking gaining Wayne here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like something,</v>

342
00:16:55.601 --> 00:16:56.750
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with the gut?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy would be like,</v>

343
00:16:56.751 --> 00:17:01.751
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd see the guy perform with </v>

344
00:17:01.751 --> 00:17:02.600
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he would fuck with you.</v>

345
00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.270
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>

346
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.940
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bizarre,</v>

347
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really shitty of them,</v>

348
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did it to me once and I went,</v>

349
00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:14.060
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did you say?</v>

350
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.550
<v Speaker 1>And then I cornered him and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

351
00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:18.020
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't insult me.</v>

352
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're an ugly fuck,</v>

353
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.470
<v Speaker 1>you understand who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

354
00:17:21.471 --> 00:17:23.540
<v Speaker 1>we could just start talking about what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with you?</v>

355
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy would go,</v>

356
00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:26.270
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to film the scene.</v>

357
00:17:26.271 --> 00:17:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

358
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:27.920
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a dick.</v>

359
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.020
<v Speaker 1>I just kinda likes to talk shit to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But right before they.</v>

360
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.310
<v Speaker 1>And everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is he doing?</v>

361
00:17:31.311 --> 00:17:33.390
<v Speaker 1>He's calling out the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

362
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.600
<v Speaker 1>this guy's doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to do that.</v>

363
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.550
<v Speaker 1>But he would be like really subtle about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

364
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.480
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>

365
00:17:38.481 --> 00:17:42.380
<v Speaker 1>who picked out that shirt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like weird shit to girls to man.</v>

366
00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:44.570
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just a guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this was his thing.</v>

367
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:49.590
<v Speaker 1>He would be like really catty and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>always reading like entertainment </v>

368
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.590
<v Speaker 1>weekly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was always reading,</v>

369
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I would call the devil's rag,</v>

370
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.530
<v Speaker 6>like the Hollywood reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all that Shitty,</v>

371
00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:57.531
<v Speaker 6>but read those things and you'll see the</v>
<v Speaker 6>little fucking power wheels spinning in </v>

372
00:17:57.531 --> 00:17:58.890
<v Speaker 6>his devious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Luckily he's dropped off the face of the</v>

373
00:17:58.891 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 6>planet fortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you could read some of Robert Green's</v>

374
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:06.951
<v Speaker 6>books,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like strategies of war maybe and </v>

375
00:18:06.951 --> 00:18:08.640
<v Speaker 6>probably find some tactic in there that </v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy was applying in order to weaken</v>

376
00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:11.070
<v Speaker 6>his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his people that gain power probably.</v>

377
00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:11.700
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

378
00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:12.900
<v Speaker 6>does anything come to mind Robert?</v>

379
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.390
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>several come to mind.</v>

380
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.010
<v Speaker 7>Mostly passive aggression</v>

381
00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:20.980
<v Speaker 6>creatively though that stuff is very </v>
<v Speaker 6>ineffective because I firmly,</v>

382
00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:26.040
<v Speaker 6>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wholeheartedly believe that if you put </v>

383
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.040
<v Speaker 6>your effort into diminishing others </v>
<v Speaker 6>creatively,</v>

384
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.530
<v Speaker 6>it diminishes your own creative ability.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really do believe that.</v>

385
00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:33.780
<v Speaker 6>I also believed that performance wise,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you try to diminish someone's </v>

386
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:33.780
<v Speaker 6>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like as an actor,</v>

387
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.560
<v Speaker 6>this is one of the reasons why this guy </v>
<v Speaker 6>sucked.</v>

388
00:18:35.561 --> 00:18:38.830
<v Speaker 6>He was so transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like he's such a shitty person.</v>

389
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.700
<v Speaker 6>You know the guy that he did it with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a guy called fat to wanting to kill him.</v>

390
00:18:42.701 --> 00:18:46.120
<v Speaker 6>I had to talk the guy out a calender </v>
<v Speaker 6>like you want this big fucking guy,</v>

391
00:18:46.121 --> 00:18:47.930
<v Speaker 6>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it shouldn't call them fat.</v>

392
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:52.990
<v Speaker 6>Even if he is fat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like he was doing it to fuck with the </v>

393
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.500
<v Speaker 6>guy right before it's seen because he </v>
<v Speaker 6>wanted to shine.</v>

394
00:18:53.501 --> 00:18:58.501
<v Speaker 6>He wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He wanted to be the guy in the scene </v>

395
00:18:58.501 --> 00:18:58.501
<v Speaker 6>that was really on top of the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

396
00:18:58.501 --> 00:19:03.350
<v Speaker 6>so the key thing is to know these </v>
<v Speaker 6>strategies so you can do with what he </v>

397
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.350
<v Speaker 6>puts in there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's called the reversal,</v>

398
00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.520
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like how to be aware of it and then </v>

399
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:08.520
<v Speaker 6>reverse it.</v>

400
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:08.690
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the main thing is to never get emotional</v>

401
00:19:08.691 --> 00:19:11.870
<v Speaker 7>in these situations.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you're in control of yourself and you</v>

402
00:19:11.871 --> 00:19:16.871
<v Speaker 7>can do like Joe did,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can sort of see the game behind the </v>

403
00:19:16.871 --> 00:19:19.421
<v Speaker 7>game.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then you're in the position to do </v>

404
00:19:19.421 --> 00:19:21.310
<v Speaker 7>something that strategic like he did to </v>
<v Speaker 7>to play the same game back at.</v>

405
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:27.310
<v Speaker 7>It's mostly like a warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I call it kind of a warrior pose where </v>

406
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.421
<v Speaker 7>if you're calm and centered and you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>aware and in the moment of what the </v>

407
00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:35.441
<v Speaker 7>other person is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then you've got strategic options to </v>

408
00:19:35.441 --> 00:19:35.450
<v Speaker 7>play the game back.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But if you get emotional,</v>

409
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.790
<v Speaker 7>you get angry,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you get intimidated,</v>

410
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.500
<v Speaker 7>then forget about it.</v>

411
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.540
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would probably today respond very </v>

412
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:44.540
<v Speaker 6>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when I was in my early twenties,</v>

413
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.120
<v Speaker 6>it was scorched earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every time I was,</v>

414
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.320
<v Speaker 6>I was going to def con nine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every time I'm like,</v>

415
00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:50.880
<v Speaker 6>let's see who can hold their breath the </v>
<v Speaker 6>longest.</v>

416
00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:55.290
<v Speaker 6>I'll drag him in a pool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was always my strategy just because</v>

417
00:19:55.291 --> 00:20:00.291
<v Speaker 6>I was always nice to people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but as soon as people weren't nice to </v>

418
00:20:00.291 --> 00:20:00.930
<v Speaker 6>me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just said that's a good way to be very</v>

419
00:20:00.931 --> 00:20:02.750
<v Speaker 6>bad way of handling it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

420
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:07.910
<v Speaker 6>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that thing that people do seems to be </v>

421
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.550
<v Speaker 6>not just calculated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it seems to be something that's been</v>

422
00:20:11.551 --> 00:20:16.551
<v Speaker 6>going on since the beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As soon as people invented language and </v>

423
00:20:16.551 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 6>they invented the ability to deceive,</v>

424
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.450
<v Speaker 7>you're touching upon the subject of my </v>
<v Speaker 7>next book.</v>

425
00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:21.430
<v Speaker 7>That's why I'm smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is that?</v>

426
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:26.950
<v Speaker 7>It's tentatively called the laws of </v>
<v Speaker 7>human nature and essentially I'm saying </v>

427
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.230
<v Speaker 7>that somewhere around 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>years ago,</v>

428
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.430
<v Speaker 7>maybe 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>are nature was set because we've started</v>

429
00:20:33.431 --> 00:20:36.190
<v Speaker 7>living in groups that were larger than </v>
<v Speaker 7>10,</v>

430
00:20:36.191 --> 00:20:37.750
<v Speaker 7>23,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the size of a tribe,</v>

431
00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:43.020
<v Speaker 7>and once you put 100 people together,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all sorts of political game start </v>

432
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.041
<v Speaker 7>happening and things like envy and </v>
<v Speaker 7>passive aggression and basic</v>

433
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 4>irrational responses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They already occurred in the time of the</v>

434
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:56.851
<v Speaker 4>Bible and so there are these laws of </v>
<v Speaker 4>human nature that are so deeply </v>

435
00:20:56.851 --> 00:21:00.811
<v Speaker 4>ingrained in the third grade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like a chimpanzee will react a </v>

436
00:21:00.811 --> 00:21:04.171
<v Speaker 4>certain way under certain circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to show you what these </v>

437
00:21:04.171 --> 00:21:08.980
<v Speaker 4>were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These laws come from why people are </v>

438
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:08.980
<v Speaker 4>envious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wife,</v>

439
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:08.980
<v Speaker 4>people are insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

440
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.351
<v Speaker 4>Somebody who has a certain exterior of </v>
<v Speaker 4>face that they present to the world </v>

441
00:21:13.441 --> 00:21:18.441
<v Speaker 4>wide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's generally hiding the opposite on </v>

442
00:21:18.441 --> 00:21:18.441
<v Speaker 4>and on and on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have.</v>

443
00:21:18.441 --> 00:21:22.060
<v Speaker 4>You can understand where people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior comes from and not be surprised</v>

444
00:21:22.061 --> 00:21:23.320
<v Speaker 4>by it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

445
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.310
<v Speaker 6>what you present is steps to recognize </v>
<v Speaker 6>cons.</v>

446
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know what?</v>

447
00:21:29.611 --> 00:21:31.590
<v Speaker 4>There's a little bit of cut and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all of us,</v>

448
00:21:31.591 --> 00:21:33.660
<v Speaker 4>including myself and you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

449
00:21:33.661 --> 00:21:34.470
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

450
00:21:34.471 --> 00:21:36.540
<v Speaker 4>And those who deny it and I hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>

451
00:21:36.541 --> 00:21:40.980
<v Speaker 4>One of them deny our are actually are </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually crypto club.</v>

452
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:48.390
<v Speaker 6>I was so excited.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a greatest word.</v>

453
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:52.140
<v Speaker 6>That's a great band name by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can use a crypto conscious.</v>

454
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I was going to start a band,</v>

455
00:21:53.441 --> 00:21:58.441
<v Speaker 6>it might be the crypto can just end up </v>
<v Speaker 6>getting arrested just so they'd have to </v>

456
00:21:58.441 --> 00:21:59.110
<v Speaker 6>talk about it on CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they did pussy riot,</v>

457
00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:04.180
<v Speaker 6>but it was my favorite thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Favorite thing about pussy riot was </v>

458
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:05.890
<v Speaker 6>great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Them talking about it.</v>

459
00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.650
<v Speaker 6>I can name see riot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The members of pussy riot.</v>

460
00:22:08.651 --> 00:22:09.400
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stop.</v>

461
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.030
<v Speaker 6>This can't be real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a beautiful time.</v>

462
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.780
<v Speaker 6>Beautiful time in history.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those girls are fucking bad ass man.</v>

463
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.260
<v Speaker 6>Not just bad ass for their.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Their ability to come up with an awesome</v>

464
00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:21.940
<v Speaker 6>name,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they get arrested.</v>

465
00:22:21.941 --> 00:22:26.941
<v Speaker 6>They spent fucking how many months in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Siberia they get out and start </v>

466
00:22:26.941 --> 00:22:27.880
<v Speaker 6>protesting at the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Horse whipped.</v>

467
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.950
<v Speaker 6>Those chicks are fucking gangster.</v>

468
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.290
<v Speaker 6>They're so gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love pussy riot.</v>

469
00:22:32.291 --> 00:22:35.200
<v Speaker 6>I'm a huge fan of their music sucks and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know if it does.</v>

470
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.040
<v Speaker 6>It probably does live performance on </v>
<v Speaker 6>Jerry Pussy riot make it happen.</v>

471
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.970
<v Speaker 6>So the crypto con,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so that's just my next book.</v>

472
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:43.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone.</v>

473
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:50.070
<v Speaker 6>Does everyone have content in them </v>
<v Speaker 6>because they're reacting to other cons </v>

474
00:22:50.231 --> 00:22:55.231
<v Speaker 6>or do you think that everyone has like a</v>
<v Speaker 6>selfish aspect to them that's </v>

475
00:22:55.231 --> 00:22:55.660
<v Speaker 6>undeniable?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

476
00:22:55.661 --> 00:23:00.661
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is it about people that you think </v>

477
00:23:00.661 --> 00:23:01.060
<v Speaker 6>everyone has a little bit of continuity?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it reactionary or is it.</v>

478
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.680
<v Speaker 6>Is it actionary set?</v>

479
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.800
<v Speaker 4>Both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's both.</v>

480
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:10.400
<v Speaker 4>I suppose there might've been one </v>
<v Speaker 4>saintly figure in our history who </v>

481
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.030
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have any of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe a Jesus or something,</v>

482
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:17.480
<v Speaker 4>but pretty much the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The underlying philosophy of all my </v>

483
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.861
<v Speaker 4>books,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly the 48 laws of power is it </v>

484
00:23:21.861 --> 00:23:22.530
<v Speaker 4>human beings have a primal need for </v>
<v Speaker 4>power and we've.</v>

485
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:24.570
<v Speaker 4>We've used that word power in the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

486
00:23:24.571 --> 00:23:29.571
<v Speaker 4>When we think of power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we think of white men up in the White </v>

487
00:23:29.571 --> 00:23:33.110
<v Speaker 4>House controlling the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try and bring power down to an </v>

488
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.721
<v Speaker 4>everyday level and say the feeling that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have no control over your life,</v>

489
00:23:35.911 --> 00:23:37.890
<v Speaker 4>over your destiny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the people around you,</v>

490
00:23:37.891 --> 00:23:42.891
<v Speaker 4>your children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your wife is the most miserable feeling </v>

491
00:23:42.891 --> 00:23:43.950
<v Speaker 4>that any human can have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have no power over them,</v>

492
00:23:43.951 --> 00:23:47.600
<v Speaker 4>no ability to them and so stunned in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>age of one,</v>

493
00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:51.410
<v Speaker 4>two years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have had this feeling of insecurity,</v>

494
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:56.411
<v Speaker 4>of weakness and we want to have control </v>
<v Speaker 4>and power over the people around us,</v>

495
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:02.320
<v Speaker 4>the events that go on in life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that is the source for a lot of our </v>

496
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:06.440
<v Speaker 4>manipulative behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people are overtly manipulative and</v>

497
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:08.870
<v Speaker 4>very dangerous that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all of us,</v>

498
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.960
<v Speaker 4>all of us engage at some point or </v>
<v Speaker 4>another in something that teeters on </v>

499
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.810
<v Speaker 4>manipulation and my books are about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's just be honest about who we are.</v>

500
00:24:17.811 --> 00:24:22.811
<v Speaker 4>Instead of trying to imagine that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>were somehow descended from angels </v>

501
00:24:22.811 --> 00:24:23.210
<v Speaker 4>instead of primates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

502
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:28.211
<v Speaker 4>we're descended from chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you studied chimpanzees that are </v>

503
00:24:28.211 --> 00:24:30.470
<v Speaker 4>pretty machiavellian creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where we come from.</v>

504
00:24:30.471 --> 00:24:35.471
<v Speaker 4>Let's be honest about the human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead of trying to pretend that we're </v>

505
00:24:35.471 --> 00:24:35.660
<v Speaker 4>all born like Gandhi,</v>

506
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:41.220
<v Speaker 5>well the the chimpanzee has one thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we don't and that's language or we </v>

507
00:24:41.501 --> 00:24:46.501
<v Speaker 5>have one thing that they don't rather,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is language and language is where </v>

508
00:24:46.501 --> 00:24:47.620
<v Speaker 5>things get weird because you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>deception.</v>

509
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.600
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you also get strategy.</v>

510
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:52.480
<v Speaker 5>You were chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have some strategy,</v>

511
00:24:52.481 --> 00:24:54.640
<v Speaker 5>like you ever seen the videos where they</v>
<v Speaker 5>chased monkeys,</v>

512
00:24:54.641 --> 00:24:59.641
<v Speaker 5>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they corner him on the sides and then </v>

513
00:24:59.641 --> 00:24:59.650
<v Speaker 5>other chimps rush them towards them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they climb up and they eat them.</v>

514
00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:02.980
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty radical stuff and until the </v>
<v Speaker 5>19 nineties,</v>

515
00:25:02.981 --> 00:25:05.350
<v Speaker 5>people didn't even know that champs </v>
<v Speaker 5>eight monkeys,</v>

516
00:25:05.351 --> 00:25:10.351
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they thought these beautiful berry </v>

517
00:25:10.351 --> 00:25:10.351
<v Speaker 5>eating friends and they eat bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like curious George.</v>

518
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.650
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not really.</v>

519
00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.970
<v Speaker 5>They fucking rip monkeys apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Needham alive and engaged in warfare.</v>

520
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:21.120
<v Speaker 5>Yes they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They engage in warfare against other </v>

521
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.401
<v Speaker 5>chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get engaged in it in a very </v>

522
00:25:23.401 --> 00:25:26.281
<v Speaker 5>strategic sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have lines where they're not </v>

523
00:25:26.281 --> 00:25:26.310
<v Speaker 5>allowed to cross and when they do cross,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they they,</v>

524
00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:31.490
<v Speaker 5>they take action.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is actually an interesting topic </v>

525
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.081
<v Speaker 5>because if you read Chris Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's had proposes a theory that this </v>

526
00:25:34.081 --> 00:25:38.011
<v Speaker 5>behavior that they've observed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the chimp warring was created by the </v>

527
00:25:38.011 --> 00:25:41.750
<v Speaker 5>artificial production of this food box </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>

528
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.900
<v Speaker 5>in the chimps habitat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When they were observing them,</v>

529
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.390
<v Speaker 5>they would have food around that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were giving the chimps.</v>

530
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.180
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so this is this.</v>

531
00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.040
<v Speaker 5>This is pretty well done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't see any of that prior to the</v>

532
00:25:51.041 --> 00:25:51.580
<v Speaker 5>food box.</v>

533
00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:52.610
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

534
00:25:52.611 --> 00:25:53.090
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

535
00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who Chris Ryan is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

536
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:55.970
<v Speaker 4>I think that's very wrong.</v>

537
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:59.980
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jane Goodall observed this,</v>

538
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.890
<v Speaker 5>but to keep the chimps around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she had a box of food.</v>

539
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.300
<v Speaker 5>So this is a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

540
00:26:04.301 --> 00:26:08.450
<v Speaker 5>And after that it created this zero sum </v>
<v Speaker 5>game where the chimps were competing for</v>

541
00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:12.040
<v Speaker 5>a limited resource of food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which actually goes to the argument that</v>

542
00:26:12.041 --> 00:26:17.041
<v Speaker 5>when you create a civilization and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>not just tribal and it becomes a zero </v>

543
00:26:17.041 --> 00:26:21.541
<v Speaker 5>sum game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's when the war and the strategy </v>

544
00:26:21.541 --> 00:26:22.360
<v Speaker 5>gets to a peak because you're creating a</v>
<v Speaker 5>zero sum game.</v>

545
00:26:22.361 --> 00:26:25.240
<v Speaker 5>There's a limited amount of resource,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a limited amount of crop,</v>

546
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:30.420
<v Speaker 5>or in the case of the chimpanzees a </v>
<v Speaker 5>limited amount of food that was coming </v>

547
00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:34.110
<v Speaker 5>out of this box,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so only a certain number of the chimps </v>

548
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.080
<v Speaker 5>would get the food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So kind of interesting.</v>

549
00:26:35.081 --> 00:26:37.900
<v Speaker 5>I just thought I'd bring that up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>when Dr Ryan's on here,</v>

550
00:26:37.901 --> 00:26:39.850
<v Speaker 5>you can certainly bring that up next </v>
<v Speaker 5>week.</v>

551
00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.820
<v Speaker 5>He'll be on the 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was your issue with what he said?</v>

552
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

553
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:49.100
<v Speaker 7>it's always a zero sum game.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why isn't it a zero sum game and it's </v>

554
00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:49.470
<v Speaker 7>always limited foods,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there's always.</v>

555
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:54.500
<v Speaker 7>There's more resource you can go to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're not competing for one very </v>

556
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.460
<v Speaker 7>specific section.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can go to more acres,</v>

557
00:26:56.461 --> 00:27:01.461
<v Speaker 7>more hectares of land and find the grubs</v>
<v Speaker 7>or the fruits or whatever of that,</v>

558
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:05.450
<v Speaker 7>of that area rather than competing over.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to argue with somebody that</v>

559
00:27:05.451 --> 00:27:07.580
<v Speaker 7>had on red,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so maybe he has a very valid point.</v>

560
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.330
<v Speaker 7>I haven't read it so it's not fair for </v>
<v Speaker 7>me to.</v>

561
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.040
<v Speaker 7>But it does.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't affect your.</v>

562
00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:13.590
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't affect your theory that once </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're in civilization,</v>

563
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:18.710
<v Speaker 7>these games begin and the tighter the </v>
<v Speaker 7>resources in that civilization I bigger </v>

564
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.820
<v Speaker 7>cities and the more closely people </v>
<v Speaker 7>working together,</v>

565
00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.610
<v Speaker 7>the more fever pitch these games.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

566
00:27:23.611 --> 00:27:26.070
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to get on a tangent here,</v>

567
00:27:26.071 --> 00:27:28.890
<v Speaker 7>but there's a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a scientist named Eo Wilson.</v>

568
00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:34.420
<v Speaker 7>I'm a biologist and he's pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 7>demonstrated that are our earliest human</v>

569
00:27:34.501 --> 00:27:38.000
<v Speaker 7>ancestors going back to </v>
<v Speaker 7>Australopithecines.</v>

570
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.400
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're engaging in forms of warfare.</v>

571
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.280
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So he wants to sort of debunk the notion</v>

572
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:49.610
<v Speaker 7>of the happy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>peaceful savage that that goes back to </v>

573
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:49.690
<v Speaker 7>Jacques Rousseau,</v>
<v Speaker 7>etc.</v>

574
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:54.450
<v Speaker 7>That we do have very violent roots.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so maybe chimpanzees,</v>

575
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.380
<v Speaker 7>iT becomes a zero sum if there's </v>
<v Speaker 7>overpopulation and they're fighting over</v>

576
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.590
<v Speaker 7>smaller territories,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which we humans we're doing as we became</v>

577
00:28:01.591 --> 00:28:06.591
<v Speaker 7>more populous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So he was trying to debunk the notion </v>

578
00:28:06.591 --> 00:28:10.640
<v Speaker 7>that it's only at the advent of </v>
<v Speaker 7>agriculture where we started living in </v>

579
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.910
<v Speaker 7>settlements and became civilized at </v>
<v Speaker 7>warfare began.</v>

580
00:28:11.911 --> 00:28:16.911
<v Speaker 7>And he shows very clearly that the </v>
<v Speaker 7>beginnings of warfare go back hundreds </v>

581
00:28:17.371 --> 00:28:18.400
<v Speaker 7>of thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

582
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:23.420
<v Speaker 1>it seems unavoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like all animals who compete </v>

583
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:23.670
<v Speaker 1>for breeding rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who compete for food,</v>

584
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:26.700
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they engage in some form of combat.</v>

585
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Deers regularly kill each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

586
00:28:29.661 --> 00:28:32.100
<v Speaker 1>that happens with elk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens with stables,</v>

587
00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:37.101
<v Speaker 1>stables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with those crazy big horns that they </v>

588
00:28:37.101 --> 00:28:37.101
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fucking,</v>

589
00:28:37.101 --> 00:28:37.590
<v Speaker 1>they spear each other and they kill each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

590
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had louis throw on the podcast </v>

591
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.830
<v Speaker 1>yesterday and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

592
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:47.060
<v Speaker 1>one of his documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had this african hunting camp where </v>

593
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.470
<v Speaker 1>they sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these canned hunts where they have these</v>

594
00:28:49.471 --> 00:28:54.471
<v Speaker 1>high fence operations and they breed all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these animals and they have these </v>

595
00:28:54.471 --> 00:28:54.540
<v Speaker 1>samples in their fucking murdering each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

596
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.380
<v Speaker 1>They knew eAch other and gouge each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other when,</v>

597
00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.940
<v Speaker 1>when the females are invalid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are staples that they're like,</v>

598
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.820
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those crazy fucking deer </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

599
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:07.610
<v Speaker 1>You pull up a picture of a sable jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a one of those african dear,</v>

600
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.140
<v Speaker 1>like creatures with big crazy horns.</v>

601
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:14.310
<v Speaker 1>They have these fucking murder weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>or if they have built in their face,</v>

602
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what they have.</v>

603
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point being is that yeah,</v>

604
00:29:19.951 --> 00:29:21.690
<v Speaker 1>there they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys murder each other.</v>

605
00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:24.960
<v Speaker 1>It looks like an oryx similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

606
00:29:24.961 --> 00:29:29.961
<v Speaker 1>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of those different types </v>

607
00:29:29.961 --> 00:29:32.211
<v Speaker 1>of antlered horned animals that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>clash heads.</v>

608
00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go to war with each other.</v>

609
00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.980
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be a part.</v>

610
00:29:37.981 --> 00:29:40.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's also part of genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>selection.</v>

611
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.500
<v Speaker 1>It seems be unavoidable and I've always </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt that when we look at the timeframe </v>

612
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.670
<v Speaker 1>between now and 6,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

613
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:49.480
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

614
00:29:49.481 --> 00:29:53.070
<v Speaker 1>when we started having these </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations,</v>

615
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:58.080
<v Speaker 1>these were wearing a very small window </v>
<v Speaker 1>between then and now in such radical </v>

616
00:29:58.961 --> 00:30:02.320
<v Speaker 1>change has taken place between them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now then and now,</v>

617
00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:06.760
<v Speaker 1>but yet genetically not much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few variations,</v>

618
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:11.790
<v Speaker 1>variations have been observed between us</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people that live thousands of years </v>

619
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:16.110
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but god not that much when it comes to </v>

620
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.110
<v Speaker 1>need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to sexual desire,</v>

621
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.220
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to greed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to automotive,</v>

622
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:22.750
<v Speaker 1>motivating factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all of the reward systems that are in</v>

623
00:30:22.751 --> 00:30:27.751
<v Speaker 1>place and the other thing being that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have release anymore.</v>

624
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:32.590
<v Speaker 1>The physical release that a human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>is essentially hard wired.</v>

625
00:30:32.591 --> 00:30:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Every chimp there swinging from branches</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're.</v>

626
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.600
<v Speaker 1>They're working out all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>

627
00:30:37.601 --> 00:30:40.330
<v Speaker 1>they're constantly getting this release </v>
<v Speaker 1>of energy</v>

628
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:43.630
<v Speaker 4>and they're also getting a release of </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of their aggressive energy as well,</v>

629
00:30:43.631 --> 00:30:45.460
<v Speaker 4>which we don't seem to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have a lot of</v>

630
00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:50.530
<v Speaker 1>exactly what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are essentially leaky </v>

631
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:53.291
<v Speaker 1>batteries of aggressive energy mean when</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's in their car and they start </v>

632
00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:57.311
<v Speaker 1>fucking freaking out because you got in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of them and fucking honking their </v>

633
00:30:57.311 --> 00:31:00.281
<v Speaker 1>horns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a leaky battery of aggressive </v>

634
00:31:00.281 --> 00:31:00.281
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

635
00:31:00.281 --> 00:31:02.740
<v Speaker 4>The other day this mild mannered woman </v>
<v Speaker 4>in her forties or fifties cut me off and</v>

636
00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:06.580
<v Speaker 4>she just turned around and get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd never seen a woman show that kind of</v>

637
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:11.620
<v Speaker 4>absolute chimp like aggressive bearing </v>
<v Speaker 4>where teeth at me in a car.</v>

638
00:31:11.621 --> 00:31:12.310
<v Speaker 4>It was shocking.</v>

639
00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been to the post office </v>
<v Speaker 1>stamps.com.</v>

640
00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

641
00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:22.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing and it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the cars,</v>

642
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.910
<v Speaker 1>a very unique environment in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the fact that you don't,</v>

643
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.760
<v Speaker 1>even though you see people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel them.</v>

644
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in front of them.</v>

645
00:31:30.231 --> 00:31:35.231
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm looking at you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I said something that hurt your </v>

646
00:31:35.231 --> 00:31:35.231
<v Speaker 1>feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would bother me,</v>

647
00:31:35.231 --> 00:31:35.270
<v Speaker 1>but if I didn't know you when you're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a car,</v>

648
00:31:35.271 --> 00:31:36.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you dude.</v>

649
00:31:36.471 --> 00:31:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

650
00:31:37.551 --> 00:31:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

651
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:44.760
<v Speaker 1>You know people do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people cut in front of each </v>

652
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.831
<v Speaker 1>other and raced down the street in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of each other and just madness that you </v>

653
00:31:47.831 --> 00:31:52.391
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't see in a line you wouldn't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're waiting in line to go to a </v>

654
00:31:52.391 --> 00:31:52.391
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare,</v>

655
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:57.140
<v Speaker 1>but you see it there because this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the social cues are missing.</v>

656
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.600
<v Speaker 1>All the human interaction that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing.</v>

657
00:31:59.601 --> 00:32:02.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's this wall and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>filter up.</v>

658
00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Same thing on the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

659
00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:09.100
<v Speaker 1>more so on the internet because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even see the person and they're </v>

660
00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:09.100
<v Speaker 1>hiding behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

661
00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.790
<v Speaker 1>dick fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty nine is their name and whatever it</v>

662
00:32:10.791 --> 00:32:12.440
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not real,</v>

663
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:15.260
<v Speaker 1>and so they can reach out to Robert </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greene and go,</v>

664
00:32:15.261 --> 00:32:19.000
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or for faggots posts,</v>

665
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:22.990
<v Speaker 1>youtube comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go fucking crazy on your block.</v>

666
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Like people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a friend of mine writes a blog and </v>

667
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.220
<v Speaker 1>someone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you have comments on your </v>

668
00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:31.220
<v Speaker 1>blogs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

669
00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:31.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you read comments?</v>

670
00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you read comments on blogs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want anybody to write </v>

671
00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:36.340
<v Speaker 1>where you're writing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

672
00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.480
<v Speaker 1>if you had a painting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you allow people to,</v>

673
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paint underneath your painting what they</v>

674
00:32:40.911 --> 00:32:45.911
<v Speaker 1>think about your painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be a lot of dick's pointing to </v>

675
00:32:45.911 --> 00:32:46.160
<v Speaker 1>your painting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piles of shit with flies.</v>

676
00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:49.910
<v Speaker 1>That's what they would draw in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not not all people,</v>

677
00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:55.030
<v Speaker 1>but enough people to where it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem because they haven't earned the </v>

678
00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:56.960
<v Speaker 1>ability to communicate with you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

679
00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.110
<v Speaker 1>you choose who you communicate with in </v>
<v Speaker 1>real life for the most part,</v>

680
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.900
<v Speaker 1>especially who you surround yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>with on a regular basis,</v>

681
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.450
<v Speaker 1>but online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you choose nothing online.</v>

682
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:10.451
<v Speaker 1>It's the beautiful thing about being </v>
<v Speaker 1>online is that everyone gets to say </v>

683
00:33:10.451 --> 00:33:11.720
<v Speaker 1>something and it's the horrible thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about being online is that everyone gets</v>

684
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:13.960
<v Speaker 1>to say something and do so anonymously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

685
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Which is another part of what's weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>about our progression from this ancient </v>

686
00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:23.591
<v Speaker 1>society where we hunted and gathered to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually agriculture and then </v>

687
00:33:24.231 --> 00:33:27.260
<v Speaker 1>civilization in quotes to where we find </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves today.</v>

688
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:32.710
<v Speaker 1>So your books essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this new book especially is sort of </v>

689
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.270
<v Speaker 1>recognizing these traits so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>move away from them.</v>

690
00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:44.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about my new book that </v>

691
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:45.861
<v Speaker 4>hasn't been written yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The point of the book is that this is </v>

692
00:33:45.861 --> 00:33:50.721
<v Speaker 4>human nature and it's an animal nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to be truly human,</v>

693
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.140
<v Speaker 4>we have to overcome these traits in us </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be truly rational,</v>

694
00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:58.590
<v Speaker 4>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm empathetic,</v>

695
00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:03.860
<v Speaker 4>abbott creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to overcome these various </v>

696
00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.300
<v Speaker 4>aspects of our own nature which are </v>
<v Speaker 4>embedded in each one of us biologically,</v>

697
00:34:06.301 --> 00:34:09.570
<v Speaker 4>genetically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>such as our propensity to feel envy.</v>

698
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.600
<v Speaker 4>The propensity that envy is basically at</v>
<v Speaker 4>its root.</v>

699
00:34:12.601 --> 00:34:16.560
<v Speaker 4>The fact that we humans are constantly </v>
<v Speaker 4>comparing ourselves to other people.</v>

700
00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:21.770
<v Speaker 4>Look at your own life on a day to day </v>
<v Speaker 4>basis and be honest with yourself and </v>

701
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:25.881
<v Speaker 4>try and calculate how many times during </v>
<v Speaker 4>a day you're actually comparing yourself</v>

702
00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.170
<v Speaker 4>to another person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got more money.</v>

703
00:34:28.171 --> 00:34:31.350
<v Speaker 4>She's prettier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a better job.</v>

704
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:35.760
<v Speaker 4>You're doing that's so completely human </v>
<v Speaker 4>for various reasons,</v>

705
00:34:35.761 --> 00:34:39.120
<v Speaker 4>which I'll explain in the book to reach </v>
<v Speaker 4>a higher nature,</v>

706
00:34:39.121 --> 00:34:44.121
<v Speaker 4>which is the goal of my book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be aware that that's </v>

707
00:34:44.121 --> 00:34:45.510
<v Speaker 4>happening and you and you have to find a</v>
<v Speaker 4>way to disengage yourself from that need</v>

708
00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:50.550
<v Speaker 4>to constantly compare yourself to others</v>
<v Speaker 4>to find your own value,</v>

709
00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:53.510
<v Speaker 4>your own self worth from within on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are all kinds of cliches,</v>

710
00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:58.520
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to show you in a very real</v>
<v Speaker 4>fashion how you can overcome them once </v>

711
00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:58.890
<v Speaker 4>you're aware that they're inside of you.</v>

712
00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the book is not written yet.</v>

713
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:06.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful point though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the beautiful point of being </v>

714
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.751
<v Speaker 1>aware of them instead of denying them </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of getting all fufu chimes and </v>

715
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.030
<v Speaker 1>indian chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

716
00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.350
<v Speaker 1>being aware of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

717
00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:19.890
<v Speaker 1>So when you started reading all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>self help books and started recognizing </v>

718
00:35:20.111 --> 00:35:22.570
<v Speaker 1>that there was all this horse shit going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

719
00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:27.900
<v Speaker 1>what was your immediate reaction to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to write something that you thought was </v>

720
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.250
<v Speaker 1>more realistic and beneficial or did </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

721
00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:32.200
<v Speaker 1>How did you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you deal with it?</v>

722
00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.170
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of anger.</v>

723
00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.150
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

724
00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.620
<v Speaker 4>I have less now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm older,</v>

725
00:35:37.621 --> 00:35:42.621
<v Speaker 4>but I had a lot of anger back then </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it really pissed me off that no </v>

726
00:35:42.621 --> 00:35:43.350
<v Speaker 4>one was talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were pretending that this was the</v>

727
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:46.140
<v Speaker 4>world we lived in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There'd be books in the business section</v>

728
00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 4>about management,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to manage people,</v>

729
00:35:48.121 --> 00:35:52.200
<v Speaker 4>which is a very primal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a topic of discussion.</v>

730
00:35:52.201 --> 00:35:53.820
<v Speaker 4>You have a group of people and you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>leader.</v>

731
00:35:53.821 --> 00:35:58.170
<v Speaker 4>How do you manage all of theSe insecure </v>
<v Speaker 4>egos who are thinking of themselves,</v>

732
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.630
<v Speaker 4>and these books were essentially </v>
<v Speaker 4>dishonest.</v>

733
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:04.470
<v Speaker 4>They weren't confronting the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you put 10 people together,</v>

734
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.110
<v Speaker 4>those people generally have their own </v>
<v Speaker 4>agendas.</v>

735
00:36:07.111 --> 00:36:12.111
<v Speaker 4>they're thinking first and primarily of </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves and their future and their </v>

736
00:36:12.111 --> 00:36:12.960
<v Speaker 4>careers and what they can get for </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>

737
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.140
<v Speaker 4>and if you start from a basic false </v>
<v Speaker 4>premise,</v>

738
00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:17.430
<v Speaker 4>you're not gonna get anywhere.</v>

739
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:22.670
<v Speaker 4>So I was dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to cut my soar through all of </v>

740
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:25.821
<v Speaker 4>this thick bullshit and say this is what</v>
<v Speaker 4>really happens in business,</v>

741
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:29.100
<v Speaker 4>in the music industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in hollywood,</v>

742
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:34.310
<v Speaker 4>among lawyers in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if some of it was a little brutal,</v>

743
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:39.710
<v Speaker 4>maybe I gave myself a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>literary licensed to exaggerate ever so </v>

744
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:40.500
<v Speaker 4>slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for instance,</v>

745
00:36:40.501 --> 00:36:43.050
<v Speaker 4>I have a chapter in there about how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>create a cult.</v>

746
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:45.790
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's obviously ironic.</v>

747
00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:49.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm not telling you you need to go out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and create a cult.</v>

748
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:54.350
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is we humans are very </v>
<v Speaker 4>gullible and we're very easy to mislead </v>

749
00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:57.000
<v Speaker 4>and we're very easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want to believe in something.</v>

750
00:36:57.001 --> 00:36:59.710
<v Speaker 4>We want to believe in a cause.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

751
00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:04.770
<v Speaker 4>these are the strategies that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>have used in history to create a cult </v>

752
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:08.601
<v Speaker 4>like following.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to sort of reveal that to </v>

753
00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:08.601
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

754
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:13.760
<v Speaker 4>these are things that just aren't in </v>
<v Speaker 4>self help books at least in 1998 when </v>

755
00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:13.760
<v Speaker 4>the book came out.</v>

756
00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.290
<v Speaker 6>So when [inaudible] writing about </v>
<v Speaker 6>creating a cult.</v>

757
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:18.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what do you,</v>

758
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.620
<v Speaker 6>what are your strategies?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do you go about doing that?</v>

759
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:28.950
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're trying to wrap yourself up in </v>

760
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:31.531
<v Speaker 6>this sort of mystical vale.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The chapter originally already fucked </v>

761
00:37:31.531 --> 00:37:35.391
<v Speaker 6>that part up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You probably haven't because you have a </v>

762
00:37:35.391 --> 00:37:38.911
<v Speaker 6>cult following and therefore you like </v>
<v Speaker 6>different though from what then called </v>

763
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:43.750
<v Speaker 6>cult like is different than cult because</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>

764
00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:48.780
<v Speaker 6>there's no organization whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not trying to get anything out of </v>

765
00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:48.780
<v Speaker 6>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Trying to tell them what to do.</v>

766
00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:48.960
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

767
00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:51.040
<v Speaker 6>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not trying to benefit from it.</v>

768
00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.740
<v Speaker 6>What you'd want to have as many </v>
<v Speaker 6>followers as possible,</v>

769
00:37:53.741 --> 00:37:55.870
<v Speaker 6>as many people shouldn't have as many as</v>
<v Speaker 6>possible.</v>

770
00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.440
<v Speaker 6>Quality over quantity is very important </v>
<v Speaker 6>business.</v>

771
00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:03.240
<v Speaker 6>And I'm sure you're right though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I keep hearing you say content,</v>

772
00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:05.770
<v Speaker 6>colton,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we're done with con,</v>

773
00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.090
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>once you,</v>

774
00:38:07.091 --> 00:38:08.440
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what was your term again?</v>

775
00:38:08.441 --> 00:38:09.460
<v Speaker 6>Crypto.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Crypto con?</v>

776
00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:11.660
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You fucking knocked it out of the park.</v>

777
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.940
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically if,</v>

778
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:19.970
<v Speaker 4>if somebody is using numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I know I have the 48 laws of power </v>

779
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:20.860
<v Speaker 4>so I couldn't be guilty of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thirty years.</v>

780
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:24.920
<v Speaker 6>Three strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Law probably</v>

781
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:29.950
<v Speaker 4>starting to create a cult because that </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes back hundreds and thousands of </v>

782
00:38:30.591 --> 00:38:32.190
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that I'm not hundreds,</v>

783
00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.260
<v Speaker 4>thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but hundreds and thousands take you.</v>

784
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:35.580
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

785
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:41.150
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>giving us sort of mystical edge to what </v>

786
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:44.671
<v Speaker 7>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're trying to make people think that </v>

787
00:38:44.671 --> 00:38:45.130
<v Speaker 7>you're creating a religion without a </v>
<v Speaker 7>religion.</v>

788
00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:46.230
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they're,</v>

789
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.680
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

790
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:51.840
<v Speaker 7>I show you the steps that people go </v>
<v Speaker 7>through five steps in order and you can </v>

791
00:38:52.331 --> 00:38:54.250
<v Speaker 7>pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you see those steps happening,</v>

792
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that this person is creating a cult like</v>

793
00:38:56.471 --> 00:39:01.471
<v Speaker 7>following and one of the steps towards </v>
<v Speaker 7>near the end is creating an us versus </v>

794
00:39:01.471 --> 00:39:05.140
<v Speaker 7>them dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's us 1000 followers against the whole</v>

795
00:39:05.141 --> 00:39:10.141
<v Speaker 7>world that doesn't believe in our theory</v>
<v Speaker 7>of how the know of how aliens landed on </v>

796
00:39:10.141 --> 00:39:12.840
<v Speaker 7>the planet and started the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So whenever there's,</v>

797
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:17.910
<v Speaker 7>they're creating this false dichotomy of</v>
<v Speaker 7>us versus the nonbelievers and you know,</v>

798
00:39:18.011 --> 00:39:19.240
<v Speaker 7>that you're on your way to a coat.</v>

799
00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:20.320
<v Speaker 1>That the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

800
00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.540
<v Speaker 1>that cult of thinking is very common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

801
00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The us versus them is really a,</v>

802
00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.790
<v Speaker 1>that's the big one that is the big.</v>

803
00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.160
<v Speaker 7>And that goes back,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to say in my new book,</v>

804
00:39:29.161 --> 00:39:31.000
<v Speaker 7>which hasn't been written yet,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

805
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:36.390
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that goes back to our hunter gatherer </v>

806
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:37.920
<v Speaker 7>ancestors where we're separating </v>
<v Speaker 7>ourselves very violently from us,</v>

807
00:39:37.921 --> 00:39:40.050
<v Speaker 7>from them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That tribe over there,</v>

808
00:39:40.051 --> 00:39:42.140
<v Speaker 7>they're evil.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They don't believe in the same gods that</v>

809
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:44.520
<v Speaker 7>we believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They don't practice the same rituals.</v>

810
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.010
<v Speaker 7>We have to go kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a very primal human thing.</v>

811
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems people have this really seems</v>

812
00:39:50.151 --> 00:39:52.460
<v Speaker 1>inescapable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Need to be a part of a group.</v>

813
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a group of mac users or you</v>

814
00:39:55.581 --> 00:39:57.680
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a whatever the fuck it is.</v>

815
00:39:57.681 --> 00:39:59.360
<v Speaker 1>So I like fords.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like chevy.</v>

816
00:39:59.361 --> 00:40:00.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people get,</v>

817
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:05.500
<v Speaker 1>they get really crazy about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very weird aspect of human </v>

818
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:10.241
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People want you to be on the same cell </v>

819
00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:13.691
<v Speaker 1>phone provider as them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you doing with t mobile </v>

820
00:40:13.691 --> 00:40:13.830
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on over to the t and t.</v>

821
00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Well the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

822
00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.930
<v Speaker 2>the companies have used some of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategies.</v>

823
00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:23.120
<v Speaker 2>They've created this us versus them </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentality to help make people feel like </v>

824
00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:23.950
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

825
00:40:23.951 --> 00:40:26.410
<v Speaker 2>all of these advertising practices that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

826
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:31.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally you can find a lot of their </v>

827
00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.451
<v Speaker 2>roots and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these larger scale strategies </v>

828
00:40:33.451 --> 00:40:37.290
<v Speaker 2>like look at this map versus this map </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating this antagonism that actually </v>

829
00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:40.840
<v Speaker 2>probably helps both sides and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all just shaking hands like that</v>

830
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:44.440
<v Speaker 2>plane ride where the republicans and </v>
<v Speaker 2>democrats were playing yahtzee with each</v>

831
00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:45.670
<v Speaker 2>other and having a big laugh.</v>

832
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I remember the think different Ads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the things she ants for </v>

833
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:52.030
<v Speaker 1>apple where they use all these dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

834
00:40:52.031 --> 00:40:52.780
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that guy,</v>

835
00:40:52.781 --> 00:40:56.260
<v Speaker 1>even though he's in an ad dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is weird,</v>

836
00:40:56.261 --> 00:41:01.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think different with the apple logo and </v>

837
00:41:01.261 --> 00:41:01.510
<v Speaker 1>that everybody wanted to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

838
00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very effective,</v>

839
00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.620
<v Speaker 1>but almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

840
00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.280
<v Speaker 1>kind of deceptively so in some weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a way.</v>

841
00:41:09.281 --> 00:41:11.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will.</v>

842
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:13.450
<v Speaker 1>You're just fucking computer man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

843
00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Which you have is a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not thinking for you.</v>

844
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:19.030
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could write the most racist,</v>

845
00:41:19.031 --> 00:41:21.980
<v Speaker 1>horrible shit on a mac and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop you.</v>

846
00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:27.670
<v Speaker 1>You can totally plot your agenda against</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever and they fill in the blank,</v>

847
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.800
<v Speaker 1>anti homosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti woman,</v>

848
00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:30.550
<v Speaker 1>anti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

849
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 1>You could just write the worst shit ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a mac.</v>

850
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.960
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't discriminate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have any effect on how you </v>

851
00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:37.960
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

852
00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.980
<v Speaker 1>it's such a dumb ad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think different.</v>

853
00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Think different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was sitting in front of this thing </v>

854
00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:45.460
<v Speaker 1>going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking any different.</v>

855
00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also grammatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrect.</v>

856
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.290
<v Speaker 1>It is differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think you're right.</v>

857
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking dead wrong,</v>

858
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.970
<v Speaker 1>but yet effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

859
00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:57.590
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's that the need to be a part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a group is a,</v>

860
00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:00.340
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely play against</v>

861
00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.560
<v Speaker 4>that was completely social animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

862
00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.980
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the source.</v>

863
00:42:05.981 --> 00:42:10.981
<v Speaker 4>If you think about the human being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go back a million years ago where we </v>

864
00:42:10.981 --> 00:42:14.110
<v Speaker 4>were incredibly the one of the weakest </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals on the planet.</v>

865
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:15.570
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

866
00:42:15.571 --> 00:42:18.610
<v Speaker 4>we were just barely learning how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand up on our two legs.</v>

867
00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:20.740
<v Speaker 4>We were slow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't run very fast,</v>

868
00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:24.070
<v Speaker 4>didn't have teeth to kill another animal</v>
<v Speaker 4>with no poison,</v>

869
00:42:24.071 --> 00:42:29.071
<v Speaker 4>no clause.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were the maybe one of the weakest </v>

870
00:42:29.071 --> 00:42:29.071
<v Speaker 4>animals on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

871
00:42:29.071 --> 00:42:29.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

872
00:42:29.071 --> 00:42:29.590
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in africa,</v>

873
00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:32.150
<v Speaker 4>and yet look at us now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was from our,</v>

874
00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.140
<v Speaker 4>so becoming the preeminent social </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>

875
00:42:35.141 --> 00:42:40.141
<v Speaker 4>We learn how to work in groups to hunt </v>
<v Speaker 4>in groups to cooperate out of that came </v>

876
00:42:40.141 --> 00:42:45.120
<v Speaker 4>language eventually so you can't divorce</v>
<v Speaker 4>are extreme social nature from who we </v>

877
00:42:46.721 --> 00:42:49.450
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because of that,</v>

878
00:42:49.451 --> 00:42:52.860
<v Speaker 4>we have a tremendous propensity to </v>
<v Speaker 4>conform to,</v>

879
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:55.000
<v Speaker 4>to want to think like other people.</v>

880
00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:00.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you're familiar with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>milgram experiments about authority and </v>

881
00:43:00.581 --> 00:43:02.170
<v Speaker 4>obedience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It Was in the sixties.</v>

882
00:43:02.171 --> 00:43:07.171
<v Speaker 4>A yale professor had people come in for </v>
<v Speaker 4>an experiment where they were made to </v>

883
00:43:07.171 --> 00:43:11.580
<v Speaker 4>give electric shocks to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they didn't answer a question </v>

884
00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.750
<v Speaker 4>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they weren't really giving a shock.</v>

885
00:43:13.751 --> 00:43:17.740
<v Speaker 4>It was all a plant that he was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>see how they would respond to authority.</v>

886
00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:23.280
<v Speaker 4>And the most mild manner housewife would</v>
<v Speaker 4>be given those shocks to people when </v>

887
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.800
<v Speaker 4>they gave the wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was showing how inbred rna,</v>

888
00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.780
<v Speaker 4>how we are all wired to obey authority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

889
00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:35.530
<v Speaker 4>so these are things embedded deeply in </v>
<v Speaker 4>us as a social animal for the good,</v>

890
00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:36.190
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

891
00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.470
<v Speaker 4>for a good thing or our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>cooperate,</v>

892
00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.630
<v Speaker 4>but also it's a very dark and negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>

893
00:43:40.631 --> 00:43:45.631
<v Speaker 4>which is our ability to engage in group </v>
<v Speaker 4>think and are mindless obedience.</v>

894
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.300
<v Speaker 1>40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that where that's coming from?</v>

895
00:43:49.301 --> 00:43:54.301
<v Speaker 1>When someone with a mild mannered </v>
<v Speaker 1>housewives are hitting that button and </v>

896
00:43:54.301 --> 00:43:57.750
<v Speaker 1>shocking people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that worth coming from or is it they </v>

897
00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:00.811
<v Speaker 1>finally have some power over something </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I feel like there's a lot of </v>

898
00:44:00.811 --> 00:44:01.450
<v Speaker 1>people out there that feel incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

899
00:44:01.451 --> 00:44:04.480
<v Speaker 1>less and frustrated and they feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this backlog,</v>

900
00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:09.860
<v Speaker 1>they have a leaky battery for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they want to have some fucking </v>

901
00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:09.860
<v Speaker 1>power over people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you finally do,</v>

902
00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:14.461
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the stanford prison experiment </v>

903
00:44:14.461 --> 00:44:14.461
<v Speaker 1>was the same?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it the same thing?</v>

904
00:44:14.461 --> 00:44:16.430
<v Speaker 4>There were two professors who were </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends and they kind of,</v>

905
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:21.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit heads pointing out how to make </v>

906
00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:22.790
<v Speaker 1>people evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stanford prison experiment,</v>

907
00:44:22.791 --> 00:44:26.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean they caught them off after they </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut the experiments short because people</v>

908
00:44:26.061 --> 00:44:31.061
<v Speaker 1>were being so evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had fake prison guards and </v>

909
00:44:31.061 --> 00:44:31.061
<v Speaker 1>prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

910
00:44:31.061 --> 00:44:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

911
00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I personally experienced that on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal level when I was a security </v>

912
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.731
<v Speaker 1>guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked as a security guard at great </v>

913
00:44:40.731 --> 00:44:43.431
<v Speaker 1>woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a concert center for the </v>

914
00:44:43.431 --> 00:44:43.431
<v Speaker 1>performing arts in Massachusetts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>nashville,</v>

915
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:45.100
<v Speaker 1>man manfield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

916
00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:45.840
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

918
00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:49.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

919
00:44:49.471 --> 00:44:54.330
<v Speaker 1>this outdoor venue and there was a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of crazy shit going on.</v>

920
00:44:54.331 --> 00:44:58.410
<v Speaker 1>They had all these nutty concerts there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these fights would break out and</v>

921
00:44:58.411 --> 00:45:01.980
<v Speaker 1>it became us versus them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>us as a security guard versus them.</v>

922
00:45:01.981 --> 00:45:06.981
<v Speaker 1>And I saw some really mild mannered </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do some mean shit to the people </v>

923
00:45:06.981 --> 00:45:07.380
<v Speaker 1>that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

924
00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:07.950
<v Speaker 1>were guests.</v>

925
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:09.900
<v Speaker 1>They're very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

926
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I saw a guy that would never hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody,</v>

927
00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:15.330
<v Speaker 1>punch somebody in the stomach because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>

928
00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:18.060
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the guy did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember watching him hit this guy</v>

929
00:45:18.061 --> 00:45:18.750
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

930
00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:20.340
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

931
00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:22.950
<v Speaker 1>And it was because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was because he was wearing a security</v>

932
00:45:22.951 --> 00:45:24.630
<v Speaker 1>jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was security.</v>

933
00:45:24.631 --> 00:45:27.870
<v Speaker 1>The guy was a drunk asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And but where he would normally,</v>

934
00:45:27.871 --> 00:45:30.240
<v Speaker 1>if you ran into this guy in the street </v>
<v Speaker 1>would never hit him,</v>

935
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.960
<v Speaker 1>but because he was in this position of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power in quotes,</v>

936
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

937
00:45:35.091 --> 00:45:36.090
<v Speaker 1>he hit this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

938
00:45:36.091 --> 00:45:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the guy pushed someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>

939
00:45:37.891 --> 00:45:39.180
<v Speaker 1>but it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was avoidable.</v>

940
00:45:39.181 --> 00:45:40.270
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have to hit them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

941
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:44.700
<v Speaker 1>And I remember that mentality being very</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear,</v>

942
00:45:44.701 --> 00:45:46.350
<v Speaker 1>the us versus them mentality.</v>

943
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:51.380
<v Speaker 2>So the key to avoiding these dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics is you have to be </v>

944
00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:51.600
<v Speaker 2>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>

945
00:45:51.601 --> 00:45:56.601
<v Speaker 2>which I think he's very good at doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then also understand and identify </v>

946
00:45:56.601 --> 00:45:57.270
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not be able to look and say,</v>

947
00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:01.140
<v Speaker 2>this is why this is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this us versus them dynamic.</v>

948
00:46:01.141 --> 00:46:02.940
<v Speaker 2>It's creating this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing.</v>

949
00:46:02.941 --> 00:46:05.460
<v Speaker 2>And unless you can identify it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>become aware of it,</v>

950
00:46:05.461 --> 00:46:10.461
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty much powerless to break it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the knowledge that these books give </v>

951
00:46:10.461 --> 00:46:12.430
<v Speaker 2>give you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in my opinion of,</v>

952
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.460
<v Speaker 2>of one of the reasons I loved him so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>

953
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:19.640
<v Speaker 2>they give you the power back by saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not just a leaf at the mercy of </v>

954
00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.120
<v Speaker 2>the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these forces of human nature.</v>

955
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:26.210
<v Speaker 2>And the forces of other people wielding </v>
<v Speaker 2>these power games and the forces of </v>

956
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:29.931
<v Speaker 2>seduction by these people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>desperately trying to date and how </v>

957
00:46:29.931 --> 00:46:33.141
<v Speaker 2>they've got you all wound up inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're no longer powerless because you </v>

958
00:46:33.141 --> 00:46:33.570
<v Speaker 2>can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aha,</v>

959
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.900
<v Speaker 2>this is what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can take some of that back and </v>

960
00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:39.510
<v Speaker 2>then chart your course with your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>intent,</v>

961
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.280
<v Speaker 2>with your own morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How you want to Do it.</v>

962
00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:41.770
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>

963
00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.590
<v Speaker 7>that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Thank you.</v>

964
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.230
<v Speaker 7>That was very well put.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I have a book.</v>

965
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.840
<v Speaker 7>I should have you just do all the </v>
<v Speaker 7>answer.</v>

966
00:46:46.841 --> 00:46:51.841
<v Speaker 7>All the questions plugs busy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I did a book with fifty cent a rapper </v>

967
00:46:55.671 --> 00:47:00.671
<v Speaker 7>called the 50th law.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And basically what I did in that book </v>

968
00:47:00.671 --> 00:47:03.350
<v Speaker 7>was I wanted to figure out what made 50 </v>
<v Speaker 7>so interesting,</v>

969
00:47:03.351 --> 00:47:08.351
<v Speaker 7>so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And after hanging out with them I </v>

970
00:47:08.351 --> 00:47:10.901
<v Speaker 7>decided that the guy was fearless.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He had a just incredible fearless </v>

971
00:47:10.901 --> 00:47:15.010
<v Speaker 7>quality and philosophy of life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the book that we wrote together was </v>

972
00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:19.091
<v Speaker 7>sort of a meditation on fearlessness and</v>
<v Speaker 7>the and the whole point of the book was </v>

973
00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.730
<v Speaker 7>being fearless isn't a question of just </v>
<v Speaker 7>going out there and saying,</v>

974
00:47:22.731 --> 00:47:24.710
<v Speaker 7>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't care what anybody does,</v>

975
00:47:24.711 --> 00:47:28.490
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to push you around and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 7>afraid.</v>

976
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:30.760
<v Speaker 7>That's about fearlessness</v>

977
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.390
<v Speaker 4>is first coming to terms with the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you are afraid,</v>

978
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:39.600
<v Speaker 4>you are afraid of death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are afraid of other people getting </v>

979
00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.760
<v Speaker 4>one up on you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are afraid of being alone.</v>

980
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.460
<v Speaker 4>You are afraid of people thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're different.</v>

981
00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:47.950
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at it in yourself.</v>

982
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.310
<v Speaker 4>Be aware that that's existing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's.</v>

983
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:54.460
<v Speaker 4>It's happening in your body before it </v>
<v Speaker 4>even hits your mind.</v>

984
00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.960
<v Speaker 4>Now that you're aware of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now you can start conquering your fears.</v>

985
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.510
<v Speaker 4>So I say we say it in that book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for instance,</v>

986
00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:06.511
<v Speaker 4>napoleon bonaparte or general patent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two men who were incredibly brave who </v>

987
00:48:07.211 --> 00:48:10.540
<v Speaker 4>would be on the front line of battle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take bullets flying past them.</v>

988
00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:15.900
<v Speaker 4>These were men who were very afraId in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the beginning when they first went into </v>

989
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:19.171
<v Speaker 4>battle and we're quite ashamed of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fear that they saw in themselves and </v>

990
00:48:19.171 --> 00:48:23.551
<v Speaker 4>they became aware of it and then slowly </v>
<v Speaker 4>they overcame it by exposing themselves </v>

991
00:48:23.551 --> 00:48:24.370
<v Speaker 4>to the very thing that they were afraid </v>
<v Speaker 4>of.</v>

992
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.470
<v Speaker 4>So that's sort of the paradigm you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>

993
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:31.770
<v Speaker 4>Becoming aware of the process of these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these sorts of qualities we don't want </v>

994
00:48:32.081 --> 00:48:35.140
<v Speaker 4>in ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seeing how they operate inside of you.</v>

995
00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.610
<v Speaker 4>Instead of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

996
00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:39.340
<v Speaker 4>it's always the other person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not me.</v>

997
00:48:39.341 --> 00:48:41.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm not afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have these problems.</v>

998
00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:43.210
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do have them.</v>

999
00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.880
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's confront it and let's show you how</v>

1000
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:50.560
<v Speaker 4>you can rationally and in a intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 4>and mindful way.</v>

1001
00:48:50.561 --> 00:48:52.120
<v Speaker 4>Overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Overcome them.</v>

1002
00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:57.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it truly is no managing of </v>

1003
00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:57.310
<v Speaker 5>anything that you're denying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're denying that it exists,</v>

1004
00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.730
<v Speaker 5>you cannot manage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was well.</v>

1005
00:48:58.731 --> 00:49:02.450
<v Speaker 5>Put two guys are much more eloquent than</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am.</v>

1006
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.720
<v Speaker 5>We take a lot of mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Robert grant helps us confront these </v>

1007
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:07.720
<v Speaker 5>interference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ever.</v>

1008
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:08.450
<v Speaker 5>Taken mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Robert?</v>

1009
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:10.910
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Deep breath.</v>

1010
00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:14.570
<v Speaker 5>Of course he has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I took a lot of pot.</v>

1011
00:49:14.571 --> 00:49:16.730
<v Speaker 5>That was my drug of choice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That injustice.</v>

1012
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:17.660
<v Speaker 5>Good?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1013
00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:22.720
<v Speaker 5>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just talk about a way to show you the </v>

1014
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.350
<v Speaker 5>fears that you didn't realize you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>and help you confront them.</v>

1015
00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:27.890
<v Speaker 5>You know these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're really a great mirror to reflect</v>

1016
00:49:27.891 --> 00:49:29.940
<v Speaker 5>upon yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hallucinogenics.</v>

1017
00:49:29.941 --> 00:49:34.941
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's one of the great values </v>

1018
00:49:34.941 --> 00:49:34.941
<v Speaker 5>that it brings is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1019
00:49:34.941 --> 00:49:38.581
<v Speaker 5>you don't know exactly what our deepest </v>
<v Speaker 5>fear is until you do iowasca and then </v>

1020
00:49:38.581 --> 00:49:38.581
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

1021
00:49:38.581 --> 00:49:43.481
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing that you've been showing me </v>

1022
00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:43.481
<v Speaker 5>for the last three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess I'm most afraid of that.</v>

1023
00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:47.830
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing with pod is you never knew </v>

1024
00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:49.631
<v Speaker 4>what was going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never knew whaT one trip was never </v>

1025
00:49:49.631 --> 00:49:49.631
<v Speaker 4>the same as another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you always had like,</v>

1026
00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.540
<v Speaker 4>trepidation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1027
00:49:50.541 --> 00:49:52.190
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this could be really ugly.</v>

1028
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:55.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you had to deal with it.</v>

1029
00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:00.600
<v Speaker 5>How did you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do it in traditional native american </v>

1030
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:00.600
<v Speaker 5>setting?</v>

1031
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:00.660
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1032
00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:04.100
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in berkeley college.</v>

1033
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:09.630
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would take the buttons and you take </v>

1034
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:12.561
<v Speaker 4>off all the little white,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stringy poisonous bits and then you cut </v>

1035
00:50:13.501 --> 00:50:17.940
<v Speaker 4>it up and you either put it in a shake </v>
<v Speaker 4>or a peanut butter sandwich and then you</v>

1036
00:50:17.941 --> 00:50:20.810
<v Speaker 4>go find a nice safe place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Traditional peanut butter sandwich.</v>

1037
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:22.050
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1038
00:50:22.051 --> 00:50:23.880
<v Speaker 4>they would eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would eat it.</v>

1039
00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:26.430
<v Speaker 4>They taste horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

1040
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:30.980
<v Speaker 4>it's not the taste is that consistency </v>
<v Speaker 4>and unless you're a native american,</v>

1041
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:36.220
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to stomach it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just going to vomit it straight </v>

1042
00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:36.350
<v Speaker 4>up and you don't want to vomit it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because then you're not going to get the</v>

1043
00:50:36.351 --> 00:50:41.351
<v Speaker 4>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you got to trick your body into like </v>

1044
00:50:41.351 --> 00:50:42.440
<v Speaker 4>digesting it and so you have to put it </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a smoothie.</v>

1045
00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:44.800
<v Speaker 5>If you brominated it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1046
00:50:44.801 --> 00:50:49.801
<v Speaker 5>you're vomiting out immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of the stuff you just didn't pay </v>

1047
00:50:49.801 --> 00:50:51.970
<v Speaker 5>attention because it works well if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>vomit based on the taste,</v>

1048
00:50:51.971 --> 00:50:56.971
<v Speaker 5>it hasn't had time to assault it later </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the trip based on it trying to clear </v>

1049
00:50:57.251 --> 00:50:58.810
<v Speaker 5>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a different.</v>

1050
00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:01.030
<v Speaker 5>It's already assimilated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1051
00:51:01.031 --> 00:51:01.840
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>

1052
00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:07.080
<v Speaker 5>so do you feel like those pod </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences help form your view of </v>

1053
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:07.080
<v Speaker 5>things?</v>

1054
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.610
<v Speaker 4>Very much so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very much so.</v>

1055
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:13.680
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just made you kind of put,</v>

1056
00:51:13.681 --> 00:51:18.681
<v Speaker 4>connects you to reality where there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>things where you're just in a fog all </v>

1057
00:51:19.111 --> 00:51:24.111
<v Speaker 4>the time because we're so conditioned to</v>
<v Speaker 4>think in certain ways and to have </v>

1058
00:51:24.111 --> 00:51:28.251
<v Speaker 4>something that draws you out of the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>rut of thinking and confront you with </v>

1059
00:51:28.251 --> 00:51:31.490
<v Speaker 4>really the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This amazing world.</v>

1060
00:51:31.491 --> 00:51:32.740
<v Speaker 4>It's aroUnd you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1061
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:37.880
<v Speaker 4>has had a huge influence on my writing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know this next book hasn't been </v>

1062
00:51:38.611 --> 00:51:43.611
<v Speaker 4>written,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have another book after that that </v>

1063
00:51:43.611 --> 00:51:43.611
<v Speaker 4>has not even begun to be even thought of</v>
<v Speaker 4>as written.</v>

1064
00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:48.180
<v Speaker 4>And that's going to bring together all </v>
<v Speaker 4>of my experiences on that level of book,</v>

1065
00:51:48.181 --> 00:51:53.181
<v Speaker 4>on what I call the sublime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I've written about in the 50th </v>

1066
00:51:53.181 --> 00:51:56.781
<v Speaker 4>law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we'll write a whole book about at </v>

1067
00:51:56.781 --> 00:51:56.781
<v Speaker 4>one point.</v>

1068
00:51:56.781 --> 00:51:57.090
<v Speaker 5>so the 50th law is the one that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrote with fifty cent?</v>

1069
00:51:57.270 --> 00:52:00.360
<v Speaker 5>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now what was the motivation behind that?</v>

1070
00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically my early books,</v>

1071
00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:08.790
<v Speaker 4>meaning the 48 laws,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seduction and war to some extent were </v>

1072
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:10.740
<v Speaker 4>very popular among hip hop artists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.510
<v Speaker 4>Basically because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the music industry,</v>

1074
00:52:14.511 --> 00:52:16.040
<v Speaker 4>I described you hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1075
00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:20.630
<v Speaker 4>hollywood is kind of like kindergarten </v>
<v Speaker 4>compared to the music business that they</v>

1076
00:52:20.631 --> 00:52:25.631
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real sharks are in the music </v>

1077
00:52:25.631 --> 00:52:25.850
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are pretty nasty,</v>

1078
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:28.290
<v Speaker 4>pretty machiavellian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1079
00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:33.760
<v Speaker 4>and people like 50 jay z and their </v>
<v Speaker 4>managers in the late nineties,</v>

1080
00:52:34.791 --> 00:52:38.570
<v Speaker 4>early two thousands were coming to grasp</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the fact that they,</v>

1081
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:43.750
<v Speaker 4>they wanted to control their own work to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have some power and some money and </v>

1082
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:48.071
<v Speaker 4>become entrepreneurs and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and dealing with these sharks in the </v>

1083
00:52:48.071 --> 00:52:48.640
<v Speaker 4>music business was something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing,</v>

1084
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:51.950
<v Speaker 4>not even any kind of street life </v>
<v Speaker 4>prepared them for 50 would tell me.</v>

1085
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:58.150
<v Speaker 4>He hustled on the streets dealing crack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>saw people being knives and killed and </v>

1086
00:52:58.150 --> 00:53:02.950
<v Speaker 4>dealt with a lot of danger and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>prepared him for the sharkey horrific </v>

1087
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:05.870
<v Speaker 4>games that he saw in the music industry </v>
<v Speaker 4>with columbia and interscope,</v>

1088
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:06.380
<v Speaker 4>etc.</v>

1089
00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.820
<v Speaker 4>So they were reading my book to help </v>
<v Speaker 4>them deal with this.</v>

1090
00:53:09.821 --> 00:53:11.870
<v Speaker 4>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are not people who went to harvard</v>

1091
00:53:11.871 --> 00:53:16.871
<v Speaker 4>business school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have a book out there to </v>

1092
00:53:16.871 --> 00:53:18.230
<v Speaker 4>help them understand how manipulative </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people could be.</v>

1093
00:53:18.231 --> 00:53:20.180
<v Speaker 4>And so they gravitated the 48 laws of </v>
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>

1094
00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.980
<v Speaker 4>Fifty was one of them and he contacted </v>
<v Speaker 4>me at some point I think,</v>

1095
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:30.200
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five or six wanting to meet me because </v>

1096
00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.520
<v Speaker 4>he liked the book a lot and then we met </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we had a really interesting synergy.</v>

1097
00:53:32.521 --> 00:53:35.250
<v Speaker 4>Obviously we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't come from similar backgrounds.</v>

1098
00:53:35.251 --> 00:53:37.440
<v Speaker 4>We don't look alike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't see that on the street.</v>

1099
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:43.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm from history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not the street or you're born in</v>

1100
00:53:43.351 --> 00:53:45.780
<v Speaker 4>the field.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's born from the street.</v>

1101
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:47.490
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm uh,</v>

1102
00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:49.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I come from a middle class jew,</v>

1103
00:53:49.271 --> 00:53:51.540
<v Speaker 4>jewish background,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not quite the same as,</v>

1104
00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>south side queens.</v>

1105
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:58.940
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we had a really nice energy </v>

1106
00:53:58.940 --> 00:53:58.940
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we think alike.</v>

1107
00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:00.630
<v Speaker 4>Like I told you about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that hollywood director,</v>

1108
00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:05.930
<v Speaker 4>most people in hollywood were getting so</v>
<v Speaker 4>angry with him and so angry about the </v>

1109
00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:07.290
<v Speaker 4>games that they never took a step back </v>
<v Speaker 4>to figure out,</v>

1110
00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:12.320
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the strategy that this guy </v>

1111
00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:12.320
<v Speaker 4>applied and 50 was the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

1112
00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:17.420
<v Speaker 4>I took a step back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what the guide in her scope is </v>

1113
00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.380
<v Speaker 4>really doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we thought alike and we thought let's</v>

1114
00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:22.440
<v Speaker 4>bring two minds together that think </v>
<v Speaker 4>alike,</v>

1115
00:54:22.441 --> 00:54:24.990
<v Speaker 4>but from totally different backgrounds </v>
<v Speaker 4>and see what happens.</v>

1116
00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1117
00:54:26.511 --> 00:54:31.511
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music business for folks who don't </v>

1118
00:54:31.511 --> 00:54:31.511
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a,</v>

1119
00:54:31.511 --> 00:54:35.570
<v Speaker 1>it's really a fascinating operation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kinda been gutted because of the </v>

1120
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:41.110
<v Speaker 1>mp3 influx and napster was the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>blow.</v>

1121
00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:46.111
<v Speaker 1>And then from there it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really now it's kind of interesting </v>

1122
00:54:46.111 --> 00:54:49.471
<v Speaker 1>because the performers actually make </v>
<v Speaker 1>their money from performing more than </v>

1123
00:54:49.471 --> 00:54:52.090
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to make the millions</v>

1124
00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:54.880
<v Speaker 1>and millions of dollars that the rolling</v>
<v Speaker 1>stones and what have you.</v>

1125
00:54:54.881 --> 00:54:58.010
<v Speaker 1>All those bands in the past made from </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling records.</v>

1126
00:54:58.011 --> 00:54:58.920
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not really that,</v>

1127
00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.030
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't exist anymore in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1128
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:06.510
<v Speaker 1>But courtney love wrote a piece about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure she probably didn't really </v>

1129
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:07.600
<v Speaker 1>write it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably they said it was ghost written.</v>

1130
00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking smart.</v>

1131
00:55:09.771 --> 00:55:12.010
<v Speaker 1>And I've smart woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe you,</v>

1133
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.950
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not anyway,</v>

1134
00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:16.600
<v Speaker 1>whether she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say she wrote it.</v>

1135
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1136
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Let's say she wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1137
00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:20.530
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever read it,</v>

1138
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:25.710
<v Speaker 1>that piece that she wrote on the music </v>
<v Speaker 1>business and how it really works and how</v>

1139
00:55:26.081 --> 00:55:29.680
<v Speaker 1>they extract everything from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>profits,</v>

1140
00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:31.720
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promotion,</v>

1141
00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:34.930
<v Speaker 1>expenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different things.</v>

1142
00:55:34.931 --> 00:55:37.540
<v Speaker 1>By the time the artist gets paid for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>records,</v>

1143
00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.800
<v Speaker 1>they have all this weird way of doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>math where it shows like no money,</v>

1144
00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:47.550
<v Speaker 1>no money has been made and they use that</v>
<v Speaker 1>for not just the music business but </v>

1145
00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:51.511
<v Speaker 1>hollywood trudeau.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who produced a </v>

1146
00:55:51.511 --> 00:55:54.691
<v Speaker 1>television show and it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful television show and it's not </v>

1147
00:55:54.691 --> 00:55:57.991
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you stop doing that start crunching </v>

1148
00:55:57.991 --> 00:55:57.991
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

1149
00:55:57.991 --> 00:56:01.120
<v Speaker 1>It's really distracting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The television shows not just successful</v>

1150
00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:04.510
<v Speaker 1>nationwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's syndicated across the world and the</v>

1151
00:56:04.511 --> 00:56:09.511
<v Speaker 1>company that made this show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the production company is claiming that </v>

1152
00:56:09.511 --> 00:56:10.930
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't turn a profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1153
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:16.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about one country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in 16 different countries and </v>

1154
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.910
<v Speaker 1>there's like several versions of it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>different hosts all throughout the world</v>

1155
00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:24.240
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to tell him that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not always suing them and there's like </v>

1156
00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:24.240
<v Speaker 1>this crazy fucking lost.</v>

1157
00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:27.080
<v Speaker 5>Lawsuits are just course for business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't even scare.</v>

1158
00:56:27.081 --> 00:56:29.240
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't even make people bad an eye </v>
<v Speaker 5>in those industries,</v>

1159
00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:30.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>

1160
00:56:30.741 --> 00:56:33.230
<v Speaker 1>like how has it not making a profit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you get paid?</v>

1161
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Did you get paid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where's there's got to be a fucking</v>

1162
00:56:38.211 --> 00:56:40.130
<v Speaker 1>profit here because there's all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

1163
00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:44.750
<v Speaker 1>like a movie that can make $100,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be said to have turned no profit.</v>

1164
00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1165
00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:51.140
<v Speaker 1>That's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's that money going to?</v>

1166
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:52.880
<v Speaker 1>But this fuckery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1167
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:57.910
<v Speaker 1>these shenanigans are sort of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that you're talking about in </v>

1168
00:56:58.281 --> 00:56:59.590
<v Speaker 1>48 laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1169
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Courtney love was a big reader of the 48</v>

1170
00:57:03.671 --> 00:57:08.671
<v Speaker 5>laws of power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She used it in one of her lawsuits </v>

1171
00:57:08.671 --> 00:57:09.580
<v Speaker 5>against the music industry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She held up a copy of the book and said,</v>

1172
00:57:09.581 --> 00:57:11.440
<v Speaker 5>this is what you guys are using against </v>
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>

1173
00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:16.550
<v Speaker 1>You bad motherfucker according lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that documentary that </v>

1174
00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:18.240
<v Speaker 1>claims that she killed kurt cobain or </v>
<v Speaker 1>had kurt cobain killed?</v>

1175
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:23.640
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of Them was fucking bizarre </v>

1176
00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:27.171
<v Speaker 1>documentaries ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like someone fucking set out to prove </v>

1177
00:57:27.171 --> 00:57:29.160
<v Speaker 1>that courtney love was responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>kurt cobain's death.</v>

1178
00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

1179
00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure you're not sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1180
00:57:33.481 --> 00:57:36.420
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty fucking crazy statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1181
00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:41.660
<v Speaker 1>How can you just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just do that and you can just </v>

1182
00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:41.660
<v Speaker 1>say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1183
00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Nobody tried her for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like can you sue someone who says that </v>

1184
00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:46.380
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for the suicide of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your fucking husband.</v>

1185
00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Awful off track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously back to the book.</v>

1186
00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:54.510
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this business,</v>

1187
00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:59.540
<v Speaker 1>this music business is just an example </v>
<v Speaker 1>really of what happens when power </v>

1188
00:57:59.761 --> 00:58:04.761
<v Speaker 1>structures are created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people who were in these power </v>

1189
00:58:04.761 --> 00:58:08.421
<v Speaker 1>structures understand the game and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>take these people that are just coming </v>

1190
00:58:08.421 --> 00:58:10.980
<v Speaker 1>into it fresh and especially artistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>types.</v>

1191
00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:13.950
<v Speaker 1>People who are creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are artistic types,</v>

1192
00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:19.160
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes not very good with money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not not sound financial thinkers,</v>

1193
00:58:19.231 --> 00:58:24.231
<v Speaker 1>and just the opposite of these business </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharks that are involved in interscope </v>

1194
00:58:24.231 --> 00:58:26.500
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the whatever the label is,</v>

1195
00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:31.310
<v Speaker 5>katie themselves to the mastery of their</v>
<v Speaker 5>craft and this whole other craft.</v>

1196
00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:36.330
<v Speaker 5>This business sharkey genus is this </v>
<v Speaker 5>other whole skillset that it's </v>

1197
00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:37.950
<v Speaker 5>challenging to be able to master both.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1198
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.000
<v Speaker 5>so getting the cliff notes is awfully </v>
<v Speaker 5>helpful to be able to sort that out </v>

1199
00:58:43.011 --> 00:58:48.011
<v Speaker 5>because that is to be as where they are </v>
<v Speaker 5>at that point and obviously he'll go </v>

1200
00:58:48.501 --> 00:58:53.501
<v Speaker 5>into his book mastery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that is a relentless pursuit of </v>

1201
00:58:53.501 --> 00:58:57.581
<v Speaker 5>excellence in a well defined niche that </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't allow for a lot of time to </v>

1202
00:58:57.581 --> 00:59:00.950
<v Speaker 5>explore these other things unless you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know you're forming some bridge.</v>

1203
00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:03.440
<v Speaker 5>If you were going to recommend your </v>
<v Speaker 5>books to someone,</v>

1204
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:05.450
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what order would you recommend them in?</v>

1205
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:10.510
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it depends on what business you're in </v>

1206
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:10.510
<v Speaker 5>and what point you are in life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1207
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:10.510
<v Speaker 5>How about you?</v>

1208
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:10.680
<v Speaker 1>How about me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a comedian.</v>

1209
00:59:10.681 --> 00:59:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I do</v>

1210
00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:14.230
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you who are already so successful.</v>

1211
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:20.080
<v Speaker 5>Well probably mastery in some ways </v>
<v Speaker 5>because maybe it'll take you to the next</v>

1212
00:59:20.081 --> 00:59:25.081
<v Speaker 5>level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know if you're dealing with </v>

1213
00:59:25.081 --> 00:59:25.081
<v Speaker 5>a</v>

1214
00:59:25.081 --> 00:59:25.081
<v Speaker 4>lot of political stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you are,</v>

1215
00:59:25.081 --> 00:59:27.830
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to want 48 laws or </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe the strategies of war.</v>

1216
00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.050
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it depends on who you are,</v>

1217
00:59:30.051 --> 00:59:32.630
<v Speaker 4>what your weaknesses are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what your strengths are,</v>

1218
00:59:32.631 --> 00:59:37.631
<v Speaker 4>where you are in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're 22 years old and you're just </v>

1219
00:59:37.631 --> 00:59:39.140
<v Speaker 4>graduating college and you're about to </v>
<v Speaker 4>enter the real world,</v>

1220
00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:44.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd say mastery for reasons that maybe </v>

1221
00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:44.420
<v Speaker 4>will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully we'll get into a.</v>

1222
00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:47.330
<v Speaker 4>But if you're a 25 and you're now </v>
<v Speaker 4>working at goldman sachs,</v>

1223
00:59:47.331 --> 00:59:49.810
<v Speaker 4>god bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you are ever saved you,</v>

1224
00:59:49.811 --> 00:59:53.810
<v Speaker 4>I think you're gonna probably want the </v>
<v Speaker 4>48 laws of power because man,</v>

1225
00:59:53.811 --> 00:59:56.060
<v Speaker 4>that's a power hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nasty,</v>

1226
00:59:56.061 --> 00:59:57.950
<v Speaker 4>manipulative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>machiavellian environment.</v>

1227
00:59:57.951 --> 01:00:02.951
<v Speaker 4>If you're in the music industry as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a person leaves a fairy </v>

1228
01:00:02.951 --> 01:00:06.101
<v Speaker 4>afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got all sorts of great creative </v>

1229
01:00:06.101 --> 01:00:08.111
<v Speaker 4>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're never going to the next step </v>

1230
01:00:08.111 --> 01:00:08.120
<v Speaker 4>and starting that great movie or project</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>

1231
01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:13.300
<v Speaker 4>maybe the 50th law would be good for you</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can get over some of those fears </v>

1232
01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:13.300
<v Speaker 4>that are holding you back.</v>

1233
01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:15.950
<v Speaker 4>If you're some guy who just can't find </v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1234
01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ken is really bad with women.</v>

1235
01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:24.210
<v Speaker 4>Art of seduction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously it would probably be just so </v>

1236
01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:26.380
<v Speaker 4>it depends a little bit on who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you wrote the artists deduction to </v>

1237
01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:26.380
<v Speaker 4>help people get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that the idea of.</v>

1238
01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.650
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know.</v>

1239
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:32.710
<v Speaker 4>I know it sound great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I probably have 8 million people </v>

1240
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:34.790
<v Speaker 4>buying the book tomorrow and now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>only going to get like 15,</v>

1241
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.480
<v Speaker 4>but the truth of the matter is artists </v>
<v Speaker 4>deduction is about how to seduce people,</v>

1242
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.110
<v Speaker 4>how to get them to like you or love you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all about creating a spell,</v>

1243
01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:46.190
<v Speaker 4>so if you want to just get laid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1244
01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:48.170
<v Speaker 4>maybe neil strauss or the pickup </v>
<v Speaker 4>artists,</v>

1245
01:00:48.171 --> 01:00:51.860
<v Speaker 4>that's probably more your speed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got all sorts of gimmicks about how</v>

1246
01:00:51.861 --> 01:00:55.910
<v Speaker 4>to sell a woman's something in a bar and</v>
<v Speaker 4>melt her resistance and etc.</v>

1247
01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:00.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm more about the longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how you can take that woman or it can be</v>

1248
01:01:00.351 --> 01:01:04.670
<v Speaker 4>a woman seducing a man obviously and get</v>
<v Speaker 4>and play a mind game on her.</v>

1249
01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.420
<v Speaker 4>So in the course of three months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't want to just sleep with you.</v>

1250
01:01:08.421 --> 01:01:11.210
<v Speaker 4>She wants to give you everything she </v>
<v Speaker 4>has.</v>

1251
01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:16.040
<v Speaker 4>She creating stalkers a could be and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have and I'm afraid I'm ashamed of it,</v>

1252
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:19.640
<v Speaker 4>but more likely I don't believe you at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1253
01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:23.540
<v Speaker 4>When you say I'm ashamed of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking proud of that shit.</v>

1254
01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:24.220
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1255
01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't like stalkers because really the</v>
<v Speaker 4>book is about casting a spell.</v>

1256
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:29.910
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1257
01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.330
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say this is the goal of seduction.</v>

1258
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:36.550
<v Speaker 4>When that woman leaves you after the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever night you had together,</v>

1259
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.630
<v Speaker 4>the date or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or just an encounter,</v>

1260
01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:41.510
<v Speaker 4>she's going home and thinking about you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1261
01:01:41.511 --> 01:01:43.380
<v Speaker 4>now you're starting to seducer you.</v>

1262
01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.560
<v Speaker 4>It's a mind game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a mental thing.</v>

1263
01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:51.040
<v Speaker 4>We humans are sex drive and our mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>process are really interconnected and </v>

1264
01:01:52.191 --> 01:01:57.191
<v Speaker 4>I'm kidding you to play on that and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>play on psychology and melting other </v>

1265
01:01:57.191 --> 01:02:01.691
<v Speaker 4>people's resistance is getting them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>lower their guard because everybody's </v>

1266
01:02:01.691 --> 01:02:03.950
<v Speaker 4>very got their guard up constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Particularly in this modern world.</v>

1267
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:07.820
<v Speaker 4>Nobody is opening up to you or nobody </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to show vulnerability.</v>

1268
01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:12.170
<v Speaker 4>It's just you're just dealing with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>million porcupines out there showing you</v>

1269
01:02:12.171 --> 01:02:17.171
<v Speaker 4>how to get those resistance levels down </v>
<v Speaker 4>and give room to finagle your way into </v>

1270
01:02:18.441 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 4>their head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the converse</v>

1271
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.120
<v Speaker 2>of course too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1272
01:02:21.121 --> 01:02:26.121
<v Speaker 2>which is a lot of people are getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things played upon them </v>

1273
01:02:26.121 --> 01:02:26.160
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1274
01:02:26.161 --> 01:02:31.161
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not aware of the tactics that </v>

1275
01:02:31.161 --> 01:02:34.791
<v Speaker 2>somebody is using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're defenseless against </v>

1276
01:02:34.791 --> 01:02:37.521
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just completely vulnerable and </v>

1277
01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:39.150
<v Speaker 2>you'll get sucked into this lure of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>spell that they're creating by this push</v>

1278
01:02:39.151 --> 01:02:43.350
<v Speaker 2>pull tactic that they're using and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever strategy that they're using and</v>

1279
01:02:43.351 --> 01:02:48.351
<v Speaker 2>you'll just be helpless to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see guys fall for these all the </v>

1280
01:02:48.351 --> 01:02:48.351
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1281
01:02:48.351 --> 01:02:50.610
<v Speaker 2>it's something that bums me in you out </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally a lot.</v>

1282
01:02:50.611 --> 01:02:55.611
<v Speaker 2>When we see friends and people we love </v>
<v Speaker 2>caught in this spell that someone's </v>

1283
01:02:55.611 --> 01:03:00.111
<v Speaker 2>woven where they can't let go despite so</v>
<v Speaker 2>many other things going bad in their </v>

1284
01:03:00.111 --> 01:03:04.761
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just trapped in it and reading </v>

1285
01:03:04.761 --> 01:03:04.761
<v Speaker 2>something like the artist's deduction </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1286
01:03:04.761 --> 01:03:09.230
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's using law number seven as her </v>

1287
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:11.490
<v Speaker 2>primary means and 13 and 17 and now I </v>
<v Speaker 2>see you now.</v>

1288
01:03:11.491 --> 01:03:12.840
<v Speaker 2>I got you a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1289
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:15.870
<v Speaker 2>like you can switch it back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1290
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.270
<v Speaker 2>now what do I want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I want to keep you around?</v>

1291
01:03:18.271 --> 01:03:21.270
<v Speaker 2>Do I want to or do I want to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>release myself,</v>

1292
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remove these hooks,</v>

1293
01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.840
<v Speaker 2>these invisible hooks that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>created,</v>

1294
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:27.360
<v Speaker 2>and just be free to chart my own course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1295
01:03:27.361 --> 01:03:27.960
<v Speaker 2>thank you all for you.</v>

1296
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I find that a lot of people enjoy the </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle of relationship struggle </v>

1297
01:03:33.891 --> 01:03:35.750
<v Speaker 1>because it distracts them from their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

1298
01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:41.190
<v Speaker 1>just distracts rama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distract them from their shortcomings </v>

1299
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:43.700
<v Speaker 1>and achieving their goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put up obstacles almost on purpose.</v>

1300
01:03:43.701 --> 01:03:48.701
<v Speaker 1>They create these inner personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships that are going to ensure </v>

1301
01:03:48.701 --> 01:03:51.590
<v Speaker 1>conflict so they don't have to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

1302
01:03:51.830 --> 01:03:56.830
<v Speaker 1>so they don't have to deal with a fee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have like a built in excuse for </v>

1303
01:03:56.830 --> 01:03:57.810
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1304
01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:59.250
<v Speaker 1>That's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1305
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:05.240
<v Speaker 7>Freud called that air full angst.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm basically.</v>

1306
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.700
<v Speaker 7>That means fear of success,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is something I talk a lot about in</v>

1307
01:04:08.701 --> 01:04:08.870
<v Speaker 7>my book.</v>

1308
01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>That's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1309
01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.170
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like it sounds ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like an oxymoron,</v>

1310
01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:15.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's real.</v>

1311
01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:17.500
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a main main.</v>

1312
01:04:17.501 --> 01:04:22.501
<v Speaker 7>One of the main points in mastery about </v>
<v Speaker 7>mastery is basically a book that's </v>

1313
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.200
<v Speaker 7>trying to get away from all of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>political stuff I've described in my </v>

1314
01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.681
<v Speaker 7>previous books,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and here I'm going to show you how we </v>

1315
01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:31.681
<v Speaker 7>humans can attain excellence in this </v>
<v Speaker 7>world,</v>

1316
01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:36.601
<v Speaker 7>how we can be really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>really the best at what we do because I </v>

1317
01:04:36.601 --> 01:04:40.590
<v Speaker 7>think that's the highest form of power </v>
<v Speaker 7>we humans can reach when we're so good </v>

1318
01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:45.571
<v Speaker 7>at what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then all the political games in the </v>

1319
01:04:45.571 --> 01:04:46.050
<v Speaker 7>world can't topple us from where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1320
01:04:46.051 --> 01:04:51.051
<v Speaker 7>and what holds a lot of people back is </v>
<v Speaker 7>that they're really self sabotaging,</v>

1321
01:04:51.790 --> 01:04:56.050
<v Speaker 7>their finding all kinds of excuses why </v>
<v Speaker 7>they can't go through this process.</v>

1322
01:04:56.870 --> 01:05:00.430
<v Speaker 7>They believe in the myth that people are</v>
<v Speaker 7>born talented,</v>

1323
01:05:00.431 --> 01:05:05.431
<v Speaker 7>are geniuses,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are simply born that way or that they </v>

1324
01:05:05.431 --> 01:05:07.750
<v Speaker 7>didn't get to go to the right school </v>
<v Speaker 7>where their parents were mean to them or</v>

1325
01:05:07.751 --> 01:05:10.400
<v Speaker 7>yada yada yada.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Or my girlfriend is that,</v>

1326
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:11.260
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever.</v>

1327
01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.110
<v Speaker 7>As you said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they get involved in drama games that.</v>

1328
01:05:14.111 --> 01:05:16.450
<v Speaker 7>So fill up their mind that can't think </v>
<v Speaker 7>of anything else.</v>

1329
01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:18.060
<v Speaker 7>So I'm going to make you</v>

1330
01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:23.060
<v Speaker 4>as this book as well aware of what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>holding you back and these fears that </v>

1331
01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:24.490
<v Speaker 4>you're using to sabotage yourself.</v>

1332
01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:28.600
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the most frustrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to me when I'm talking to someone</v>

1333
01:05:28.601 --> 01:05:31.970
<v Speaker 1>and they have these built in excuses for</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they can't do what they want to do.</v>

1334
01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.010
<v Speaker 4>Give me some of these excuses that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>hear.</v>

1335
01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who wanted to be a </v>

1336
01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:39.080
<v Speaker 1>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wound up not being a comedian.</v>

1337
01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:40.590
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have a wife,</v>

1338
01:05:40.591 --> 01:05:42.540
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a mortgage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's not.</v>

1339
01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:47.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he has this job that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has these responsibilities to feed his </v>

1340
01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:47.600
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he stuck in his job,</v>

1341
01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:49.230
<v Speaker 1>but he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1342
01:05:49.231 --> 01:05:50.240
<v Speaker 1>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1343
01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:53.040
<v Speaker 1>I've missed the boat with comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had started in the nineties,</v>

1344
01:05:53.041 --> 01:05:53.940
<v Speaker 1>everything would've been great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1345
01:05:53.941 --> 01:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is people that start right now?</v>

1346
01:05:56.681 --> 01:05:58.260
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's open mics right now.</v>

1347
01:05:58.410 --> 01:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tuesday night to the laugh factory </v>

1348
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>is a fucking line around the block.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get there at 9:00</v>

1349
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:03.810
<v Speaker 1>AM and they wait in line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should do that too.</v>

1350
01:06:03.811 --> 01:06:05.630
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A mannequin,</v>

1351
01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:06.660
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 30 years old.</v>

1352
01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the orion gives a shit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how old you are?</v>

1353
01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the line has no idea about your age.</v>

1354
01:06:12.361 --> 01:06:17.361
<v Speaker 1>The line is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The microphone is on for an 80 year old </v>

1355
01:06:17.361 --> 01:06:20.241
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If an 80 year old man talks in that </v>

1356
01:06:20.241 --> 01:06:20.490
<v Speaker 1>microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes noise just like a baby.</v>

1357
01:06:20.491 --> 01:06:23.940
<v Speaker 1>If a baby cries into that microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also makes noise like,</v>

1358
01:06:23.941 --> 01:06:25.110
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1359
01:06:25.111 --> 01:06:27.060
<v Speaker 1>he and I got into this crazy debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1360
01:06:27.061 --> 01:06:27.690
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>

1361
01:06:27.691 --> 01:06:29.730
<v Speaker 1>it's easy for you to say you're already </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

1362
01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look dude,</v>

1363
01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:36.080
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy for me to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me to hear because you're </v>

1364
01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.831
<v Speaker 1>fucking yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're you want to be a comedian and if </v>

1365
01:06:39.831 --> 01:06:39.900
<v Speaker 1>you think you're funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

1366
01:06:39.901 --> 01:06:44.901
<v Speaker 1>you don't even really have to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to have the ability to </v>

1367
01:06:44.901 --> 01:06:46.080
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to become funny and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>self analysis,</v>

1368
01:06:46.081 --> 01:06:48.660
<v Speaker 1>objectivity and work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is,</v>

1369
01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:52.590
<v Speaker 1>but you are already creating this </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurmountable barrier.</v>

1370
01:06:52.591 --> 01:06:54.000
<v Speaker 1>You didn't start in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1371
01:06:54.001 --> 01:06:55.530
<v Speaker 1>what are you fucking talking about it</v>

1372
01:06:55.820 --> 01:07:00.820
<v Speaker 4>in the book mastery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I interviewed nine modern masters to </v>

1373
01:07:01.421 --> 01:07:06.421
<v Speaker 4>sort of embed them in months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the ancient masters that I talk </v>

1374
01:07:06.421 --> 01:07:08.440
<v Speaker 4>about and one of the nine modern masters</v>
<v Speaker 4>I interviewed as a woman named temple.</v>

1375
01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:09.880
<v Speaker 4>Granted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've heard of her.</v>

1376
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.000
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to emigrate and it's like a very famous </v>

1377
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:15.350
<v Speaker 4>animal behavior scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1378
01:07:15.351 --> 01:07:20.351
<v Speaker 4>and she was born with autism and at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>age of two was basically going to be put</v>

1379
01:07:20.501 --> 01:07:25.501
<v Speaker 4>in a mental institution for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 4>her life because she was a severe </v>

1380
01:07:25.501 --> 01:07:26.110
<v Speaker 4>autistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She couldn't learn language.</v>

1381
01:07:26.111 --> 01:07:31.111
<v Speaker 4>He was just the kind of kid you see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just banging their head against </v>

1382
01:07:31.111 --> 01:07:32.380
<v Speaker 4>the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was severely autistic.</v>

1383
01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:37.740
<v Speaker 4>And through a process I describe in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>book with her mother's help and the </v>

1384
01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:41.851
<v Speaker 4>speech therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she slowly got to the age of four to be </v>

1385
01:07:41.851 --> 01:07:42.310
<v Speaker 4>able to start speaking and going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>schools.</v>

1386
01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:47.170
<v Speaker 4>And I show the process that eventually </v>
<v Speaker 4>led her to become a great scientist.</v>

1387
01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:50.440
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if somebody's born with severe autism,</v>

1388
01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:53.260
<v Speaker 4>at the age of two is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>institutionalized for their whole life,</v>

1389
01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:58.470
<v Speaker 4>can become a master,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there's no fucking excuse for some </v>

1390
01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:02.440
<v Speaker 4>30 year old who has nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no barriers like that at all to ever get</v>

1391
01:08:02.441 --> 01:08:07.441
<v Speaker 4>to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really the reason I put it in </v>

1392
01:08:07.441 --> 01:08:07.441
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If any.</v>

1393
01:08:07.441 --> 01:08:09.080
<v Speaker 4>If somebody like that can overcome their</v>
<v Speaker 4>limitations and there's no more excuses.</v>

1394
01:08:09.081 --> 01:08:09.150
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1395
01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.470
<v Speaker 1>well there is one excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a weak bitch.</v>

1396
01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the excuse and my eyes don't be </v>

1397
01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:17.060
<v Speaker 1>weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

1398
01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.170
<v Speaker 1>It's so simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Break it down to that.</v>

1399
01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My other advice that I always give out </v>

1400
01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:24.020
<v Speaker 1>is be the person that you pretend to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to get laid.</v>

1401
01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:28.400
<v Speaker 1>If you can Just do that and just be that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

1402
01:08:28.401 --> 01:08:30.890
<v Speaker 1>what would that guy be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy and let it become you.</v>

1403
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:32.990
<v Speaker 1>That was something I never covered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the artist seduction.</v>

1404
01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be the person.</v>

1405
01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Be the hero of your own movIe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the other thing I say to people </v>

1406
01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:40.360
<v Speaker 1>when people were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like their life.</v>

1407
01:08:40.730 --> 01:08:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Pretend you're a fucking loser in A </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

1408
01:08:42.741 --> 01:08:46.490
<v Speaker 1>You woke up today the same scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always see guy wakes up,</v>

1409
01:08:46.491 --> 01:08:49.280
<v Speaker 1>makes a fucking blender full of pizza or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they do,</v>

1410
01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:54.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get their life together and smoke a </v>

1411
01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:54.500
<v Speaker 1>cigarette and realize that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>

1412
01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.370
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the bills are piling up.</v>

1413
01:08:55.371 --> 01:08:57.440
<v Speaker 1>The phone's ringing off the hook from </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill collectors.</v>

1414
01:08:57.770 --> 01:09:00.080
<v Speaker 1>What would the hero in the movie do </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

1415
01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Do that shit and it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works at some people,</v>

1416
01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.330
<v Speaker 1>other people that find excuses to not do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1417
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:06.120
<v Speaker 1>I got that</v>

1418
01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:09.710
<v Speaker 2>vice from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a family friend one time and I was.</v>

1419
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:12.980
<v Speaker 2>I was terrible at dating until I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 22 or so,</v>

1420
01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:14.120
<v Speaker 2>21.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was awful.</v>

1421
01:09:14.121 --> 01:09:19.121
<v Speaker 2>I was way too nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so doting and it wasn't even the </v>

1422
01:09:19.121 --> 01:09:19.730
<v Speaker 2>real me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just being playing this overnights</v>

1423
01:09:19.731 --> 01:09:23.680
<v Speaker 2>person and people hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the most repulsive being nice,</v>

1424
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:25.760
<v Speaker 2>the most repulsive thing I could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

1425
01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.150
<v Speaker 2>And so he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1426
01:09:28.190 --> 01:09:30.470
<v Speaker 2>just analyze your actions and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying.</v>

1427
01:09:30.471 --> 01:09:32.180
<v Speaker 2>And ask what would Bruce Willis too</v>

1428
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:34.490
<v Speaker 1>at that time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the time it was,</v>

1429
01:09:34.491 --> 01:09:38.320
<v Speaker 1>that's who is like the big action hero </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

1430
01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:40.600
<v Speaker 1>My advice That helped changed the game </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>

1431
01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Stay nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but be willing to walk away as soon as </v>

1432
01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:45.820
<v Speaker 1>you expose that someone else is not nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

1433
01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:51.270
<v Speaker 1>be nice always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then as soon as someone's not nice </v>

1434
01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:51.270
<v Speaker 1>backside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1435
01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:51.270
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take it easy.</v>

1436
01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Not need them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't need them to know.</v>

1437
01:09:52.871 --> 01:09:55.450
<v Speaker 1>The problem with nice people is they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>needy motherfuckers.</v>

1438
01:09:55.780 --> 01:10:00.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not just nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why they're being nice is </v>

1439
01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.901
<v Speaker 1>they need you to like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be really nice and not need </v>

1440
01:10:03.901 --> 01:10:07.261
<v Speaker 1>people to like you and if they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you or they didn't want to be </v>

1441
01:10:07.261 --> 01:10:07.261
<v Speaker 1>around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fine with it.</v>

1442
01:10:07.261 --> 01:10:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Then they freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how to handle that.</v>

1443
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed a nice guy.</v>

1444
01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:13.270
<v Speaker 1>He was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It slipped through my fingers.</v>

1445
01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Personal sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most important things to</v>

1446
01:10:17.591 --> 01:10:20.980
<v Speaker 1>have in this life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability to be yourself,</v>

1447
01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:26.160
<v Speaker 1>to be by yourself and why would other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like you if you don't even like </v>

1448
01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:30.481
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to do things in life that you </v>

1449
01:10:30.481 --> 01:10:33.991
<v Speaker 1>would admire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be the kind of person that </v>

1450
01:10:33.991 --> 01:10:35.200
<v Speaker 1>you would like and if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you expect anyone to like you?</v>

1451
01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I have this argument with guys all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time where the talk about women and you </v>

1452
01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:42.160
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking girls want money.</v>

1453
01:10:42.161 --> 01:10:43.990
<v Speaker 1>They want this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want that.</v>

1454
01:10:43.991 --> 01:10:45.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women always like,</v>

1455
01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:45.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1456
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so good with women's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say this,</v>

1457

<v Speaker 1>would you fuck you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

1458
01:10:57.190 --> 01:10:59.030
<v Speaker 1>How dare you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1459
01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not just physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mental.</v>

1460
01:11:00.971 --> 01:11:03.940
<v Speaker 1>It's the way you behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or are you a kind of person?</v>

1461
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Are you fun to be around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people that are just genuinely</v>

1462
01:11:07.601 --> 01:11:09.480
<v Speaker 1>great to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1463
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:11.230
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to be good looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1464
01:11:11.231 --> 01:11:13.060
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to be,</v>

1465
01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to be</v>

1466
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.380
<v Speaker 5>well read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just have a quality.</v>

1467
01:11:16.381 --> 01:11:21.381
<v Speaker 5>They have quality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And do you not have that quality and if </v>

1468
01:11:21.381 --> 01:11:21.381
<v Speaker 5>you don't have that quality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you,</v>

1469
01:11:21.381 --> 01:11:22.140
<v Speaker 5>can you acquire it?</v>

1470
01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:25.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I try to do in our seduction is a.</v>

1471
01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:29.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying people who read a book and </v>
<v Speaker 4>try to seduce,</v>

1472
01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:33.870
<v Speaker 4>so usually the worst seducers or who've </v>
<v Speaker 4>taken some advice because they're not in</v>

1473
01:11:33.871 --> 01:11:35.540
<v Speaker 4>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1474
01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:40.480
<v Speaker 4>and there seemed like they're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>being cold and calculating and the trick</v>

1475
01:11:40.481 --> 01:11:45.481
<v Speaker 4>to seduction is to appear or to be as </v>
<v Speaker 4>natural as possible and to at least </v>

1476
01:11:45.481 --> 01:11:46.120
<v Speaker 4>appear natural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1477
01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:51.260
<v Speaker 4>so everybody has a different style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people are funny and great to be </v>

1478
01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:52.740
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe you're just not born that way.</v>

1479
01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:54.820
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you're just not widi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1480
01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.490
<v Speaker 4>maybe you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have other strengths.</v>

1481
01:11:56.491 --> 01:12:00.420
<v Speaker 4>You have other qualities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something naturally seductive about you.</v>

1482
01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.410
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that could be you're very social and you</v>

1483
01:12:04.411 --> 01:12:09.411
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can think about what the other </v>

1484

<v Speaker 5>In mastery of going with your natural </v>

<v Speaker 5>is in mastery,</v>

1506
01:13:01.690 --> 01:13:05.770
<v Speaker 5>pursuing that channel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that venue of what is going to bring you</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1510
01:13:11.441 --> 01:13:11.980
<v Speaker 5>I've tried.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I make</v>

1511
01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:16.980
<v Speaker 4>the point in mastery that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're born with a key to success.</v>

1512
01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:20.980
<v Speaker 4>Every single human being is born that </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1513
01:13:20.981 --> 01:13:25.981
<v Speaker 4>I'm not tried.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This isn't some new age bullshit that </v>

1514
01:13:25.981 --> 01:13:26.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to pedal here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What that key is,</v>

1515
01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:27.900
<v Speaker 4>the fact that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1516
01:13:27.901 --> 01:13:29.710
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something unique about you.</v>

1517
01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:31.000
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1518
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:34.360
<v Speaker 4>your dna is unique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your brain is wired in a unique way.</v>

1519
01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:39.660
<v Speaker 4>They've done these really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>studies on newborns and infants one </v>

1520
01:13:40.421 --> 01:13:45.421
<v Speaker 4>month to six months and they've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to show that an extremely early </v>

1521
01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:49.890
<v Speaker 4>age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>infants are already distinguishing </v>

1522
01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:49.890
<v Speaker 4>between things that they like and don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

1523
01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:54.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm very particular levels like foods </v>
<v Speaker 4>and colors and sounds,</v>

1524
01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.950
<v Speaker 4>so when you were really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really young,</v>

1525
01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:59.890
<v Speaker 4>you had what are recalls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I call them the book,</v>

1526
01:13:59.891 --> 01:14:01.930
<v Speaker 4>primal inclinations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These,</v>

1527
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:04.810
<v Speaker 4>there were things you were attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are very,</v>

1528
01:14:04.811 --> 01:14:06.880
<v Speaker 4>very unique and distinctive about you.</v>

1529
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:11.170
<v Speaker 4>IT could be sports,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be competing and winning.</v>

1530
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:15.250
<v Speaker 4>It could be working with people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>social situations.</v>

1531
01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.350
<v Speaker 4>It could be music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it is,</v>

1532
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:23.250
<v Speaker 4>if you're able to stay true to that or </v>
<v Speaker 4>rediscover it when you're older and </v>

1533
01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:27.870
<v Speaker 4>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's unique about you and your tastes </v>

1534
01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:27.940
<v Speaker 4>and your way of thinking and your whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>spirit,</v>

1535
01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:30.400
<v Speaker 4>you are going to fucking succeed in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1536
01:14:30.401 --> 01:14:33.460
<v Speaker 4>You're going to create a business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to create a book.</v>

1537
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:38.440
<v Speaker 4>Some have a podcast that reflects your </v>
<v Speaker 4>weirdness,</v>

1538
01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:41.800
<v Speaker 4>your uniqueness and people will come to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you because it's true.</v>

1539
01:14:41.801 --> 01:14:44.830
<v Speaker 4>It's authentic and it is nothing else </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there like it.</v>

1540
01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:47.110
<v Speaker 4>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you stay true to that?</v>

1541
01:14:47.111 --> 01:14:49.160
<v Speaker 4>How do you fIgure out what your life's </v>
<v Speaker 4>task is,</v>

1542
01:14:49.161 --> 01:14:54.161
<v Speaker 4>as I call it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you keep connected to those </v>

1543
01:14:54.161 --> 01:14:55.030
<v Speaker 4>primal inclination set what that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the book mastery is about,</v>

1544
01:14:55.510 --> 01:15:00.510
<v Speaker 4>but you first have to be at least aware </v>
<v Speaker 4>of what the root of your possible </v>

1545
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:04.981
<v Speaker 4>success in life is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I try to make the point that if you </v>

1546
01:15:04.981 --> 01:15:08.101
<v Speaker 4>aren't pursuing something that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>personally and emotionally connected to </v>

1547
01:15:08.101 --> 01:15:12.091
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're never going to actually succeed </v>

1548
01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:12.091
<v Speaker 4>in life.</v>

1549
01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:13.300
<v Speaker 4>If you go into law and you are meant to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be a writer,</v>

1550
01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.480
<v Speaker 4>you might be able to bullshit your way </v>
<v Speaker 4>for 10 years or so and be a pretty good </v>

1551
01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:21.811
<v Speaker 4>lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but eventually because it's not </v>

1552
01:15:21.811 --> 01:15:22.600
<v Speaker 4>something you were meant to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to disconnect.</v>

1553
01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:25.480
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to be into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to emotionally disengage.</v>

1554
01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:28.630
<v Speaker 4>You're going to start drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your hair's gonna fall out.</v>

1555
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:30.270
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Start seeing hookers</v>

1556
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:31.820
<v Speaker 6>getting on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wait a minute.</v>

1557
01:15:31.821 --> 01:15:33.000
<v Speaker 6>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were good.</v>

1558
01:15:33.001 --> 01:15:34.620
<v Speaker 6>Up until that point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I lost ya.</v>

1559
01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.490
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because you're not</v>

1560
01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:39.690
<v Speaker 4>pursuing what you were meant to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 4>and your life's going to fall apart.</v>

1561
01:15:39.691 --> 01:15:39.970
<v Speaker 4>You're not</v>

1562
01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:43.150
<v Speaker 6>have a good time with hookers and drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1563
01:15:43.151 --> 01:15:45.520
<v Speaker 6>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see.</v>

1564
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:47.290
<v Speaker 6>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're right.</v>

1565
01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:49.690
<v Speaker 6>I probably lost you there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People are probably going.</v>

1566
01:15:49.691 --> 01:15:54.691
<v Speaker 6>That's what I really want to mastery is </v>
<v Speaker 6>you become a lawyer when you're really </v>

1567
01:15:55.330 --> 01:16:00.330
<v Speaker 6>supposed to be a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you get hookers and drugs and </v>

1568
01:16:00.330 --> 01:16:00.700
<v Speaker 6>hookers and drugs are fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1569
01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:02.560
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

1570
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:03.720
<v Speaker 6>I'm just playing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1571
01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:08.890
<v Speaker 6>I fully see what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I do think that that is a very </v>

1572
01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:11.320
<v Speaker 6>important point that people do sabotage </v>
<v Speaker 6>when they're unhappy.</v>

1573
01:16:11.321 --> 01:16:14.440
<v Speaker 6>And I find a lot of people that tend to </v>
<v Speaker 6>work jobs,</v>

1574
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:19.450
<v Speaker 6>they find very unrewarding to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>exceptionally materialistic because </v>

1575
01:16:19.691 --> 01:16:24.691
<v Speaker 6>they're trying to reward themselves with</v>
<v Speaker 6>these material items in these material </v>

1576
01:16:24.691 --> 01:16:26.350
<v Speaker 6>items.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Become goals for plowing through another</v>

1577
01:16:26.351 --> 01:16:28.690
<v Speaker 6>daY doing this shitty job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

1578
01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:33.850
<v Speaker 4>it's a real dead end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like one of the worst traps that </v>

1579
01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:33.850
<v Speaker 4>people fall into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

1580
01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:35.510
<v Speaker 4>I have nothing against money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like making money.</v>

1581
01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:39.260
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the goal of your life when you're in</v>

1582
01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:40.790
<v Speaker 4>your twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for instAnce,</v>

1583
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:45.560
<v Speaker 4>should be learning as much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Developing skills in differenT areas and</v>

1584
01:16:45.561 --> 01:16:48.170
<v Speaker 4>not worrying about how much money you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>making,</v>

1585
01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:51.080
<v Speaker 4>giving yourself the freedom to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>mistakes,</v>

1586
01:16:51.081 --> 01:16:53.030
<v Speaker 4>to explore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have some adventures,</v>

1587
01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:56.000
<v Speaker 4>to try things out that don't quite work </v>
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>

1588
01:16:56.150 --> 01:17:01.150
<v Speaker 4>And then when you reach your thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got all these skills and </v>

1589
01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:02.150
<v Speaker 4>experiences and you're going to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>that money eventually.</v>

1590
01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:06.350
<v Speaker 4>But the path to mastery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at somebody like steve jobs,</v>

1591
01:17:06.351 --> 01:17:08.780
<v Speaker 4>you can hate them or you can like him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can think he's great or not,</v>

1592
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:14.140
<v Speaker 4>but he ended up being one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wealthiest men that ever existed in on </v>

1593
01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:14.140
<v Speaker 4>our planet.</v>

1594
01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.590
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he never thought about money.</v>

1595
01:17:15.591 --> 01:17:18.190
<v Speaker 4>He never cared about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He lived in a,</v>

1596
01:17:18.191 --> 01:17:21.290
<v Speaker 4>in a house that was hardly decorated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>

1597
01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:22.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just,</v>

1598
01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.580
<v Speaker 4>was never on his hierarchy of values to </v>
<v Speaker 4>quote maslow there.</v>

1599
01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:29.180
<v Speaker 4>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're obsessed with money,</v>

1600
01:17:29.181 --> 01:17:32.180
<v Speaker 4>you're actually going to find all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 4>of problems in life.</v>

1601
01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.340
<v Speaker 4>you're going to become hooked to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>paycheck.</v>

1602
01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:39.580
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you're 32 years old and </v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly you're downsized or you're </v>

1603
01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.990
<v Speaker 4>fired from your job and you've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>addicted to that $80,000.</v>

1604
01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:46.991
<v Speaker 4>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars a years that you've been </v>

1605
01:17:46.991 --> 01:17:47.450
<v Speaker 4>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now you don't have the mental freedom to</v>

1606
01:17:47.451 --> 01:17:51.770
<v Speaker 4>take a job for half that price where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can now maybe start learning some skills</v>

1607
01:17:51.771 --> 01:17:56.771
<v Speaker 4>and moving on and really finding your </v>
<v Speaker 4>way because you're addicted to all that </v>

1608
01:17:56.771 --> 01:18:01.361
<v Speaker 4>luxury to the things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the ego that you have connected to </v>

1609
01:18:01.361 --> 01:18:01.361
<v Speaker 4>that paycheck.</v>

1610
01:18:01.361 --> 01:18:06.130
<v Speaker 4>So money is one of the worst chaps and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason people get into that trap </v>

1611
01:18:06.130 --> 01:18:07.880
<v Speaker 4>generally is because of their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their parents tell them,</v>

1612
01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:09.620
<v Speaker 4>johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>susan,</v>

1613
01:18:09.621 --> 01:18:11.720
<v Speaker 4>I have whatever your name is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to make a living.</v>

1614
01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:12.530
<v Speaker 4>You gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta,</v>

1615
01:18:12.531 --> 01:18:14.040
<v Speaker 4>go get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's luca.</v>

1616
01:18:14.041 --> 01:18:15.710
<v Speaker 4>If you've got to become a doctor or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lawyer,</v>

1617
01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:21.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to go to yale and get this </v>

1618
01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:21.040
<v Speaker 4>degree and go into the business school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et cetera,</v>

1619
01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.250
<v Speaker 4>and then you're not listening to </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

1620
01:18:22.251 --> 01:18:24.670
<v Speaker 4>You're lIstening to other people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their and their values.</v>

1621
01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:27.200
<v Speaker 4>So you call that a counterforce in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>

1622
01:18:27.201 --> 01:18:32.201
<v Speaker 4>It's things that work against you and to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pushing work against you from finding </v>

1623
01:18:32.201 --> 01:18:36.671
<v Speaker 4>what you call your vocation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like what is going to make you </v>

1624
01:18:36.671 --> 01:18:38.900
<v Speaker 4>the most happy and doing and being and </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're in your vocation versus just</v>

1625
01:18:38.901 --> 01:18:39.560
<v Speaker 4>doing a work.</v>

1626
01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:42.140
<v Speaker 4>When you're in your vocation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your passionate about it,</v>

1627
01:18:42.141 --> 01:18:47.141
<v Speaker 4>you love what you're doing and so you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to naturally be more inclined to </v>

1628
01:18:47.141 --> 01:18:49.100
<v Speaker 4>be great at it because you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>put way more energy,</v>

1629
01:18:49.101 --> 01:18:50.630
<v Speaker 4>way more passionate into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1630
01:18:50.631 --> 01:18:55.631
<v Speaker 4>think about the people who have achieved</v>
<v Speaker 4>greatness and in any different field.</v>

1631
01:18:56.211 --> 01:18:57.520
<v Speaker 4>All the people we know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1632
01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:59.900
<v Speaker 4>even the bowhunter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he loves it.</v>

1633
01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:04.640
<v Speaker 4>He loves whaT he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's found success in doing it,</v>

1634
01:19:04.641 --> 01:19:09.641
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he found his vocation and he's just </v>

1635
01:19:09.641 --> 01:19:09.641
<v Speaker 4>stuck with it and so he's become a </v>
<v Speaker 4>master,</v>

1636
01:19:09.641 --> 01:19:12.890
<v Speaker 4>but if he was trying to do some legal </v>
<v Speaker 4>job or some accounting job,</v>

1637
01:19:12.891 --> 01:19:13.570
<v Speaker 4>he would suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suck</v>

1638
01:19:13.570 --> 01:19:15.760
<v Speaker 6>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Probably actually has a day job which he</v>

1639
01:19:15.761 --> 01:19:17.290
<v Speaker 6>fucking hates.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when he describes it,</v>

1640
01:19:17.291 --> 01:19:22.291
<v Speaker 6>he talks about dying there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Feels like he's dying every day when </v>

1641
01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:22.830
<v Speaker 6>he's at work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1642
01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.370
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're absolutely right.</v>

1643
01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.260
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

1644
01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:30.360
<v Speaker 6>is there a benefit in experiencing that </v>
<v Speaker 6>resistance early in life so that you </v>

1645
01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:33.190
<v Speaker 6>stay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you steal your resolve against it?</v>

1646
01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:38.370
<v Speaker 6>Which resistance?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The resistance to do what you actually </v>

1647
01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:38.370
<v Speaker 6>want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1648
01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:40.330
<v Speaker 6>I feel like a big part of my motivation </v>
<v Speaker 6>in life and the,</v>

1649
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:45.390
<v Speaker 6>the strength of my resistance to getting</v>
<v Speaker 6>other people happy or to doing what </v>

1650
01:19:47.021 --> 01:19:52.021
<v Speaker 6>other people wanted me to do was that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>was pressured in a way that I didn't </v>

1651
01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:54.500
<v Speaker 6>towards the direction that I didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 6>to go.</v>

1652
01:19:54.501 --> 01:19:56.530
<v Speaker 6>And It was all the course.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1653
01:19:56.531 --> 01:20:01.531
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that I would hear all </v>

1654
01:20:01.531 --> 01:20:04.831
<v Speaker 6>the time when I was starting out and </v>
<v Speaker 6>stand up is my mom telling me that I </v>

1655
01:20:04.831 --> 01:20:05.740
<v Speaker 6>wasn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My mom was like,</v>

1656
01:20:05.741 --> 01:20:07.090
<v Speaker 6>why are you doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not funny.</v>

1657
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 6>Like this is not a smart.</v>

1658
01:20:08.530 --> 01:20:13.530
<v Speaker 1>And I would bite down on my mouthpiece </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fucking plow forward because of </v>

1659
01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:15.030
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't want.</v>

1660
01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to hear,</v>

1661
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:19.520
<v Speaker 1>finish your college degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a,</v>

1662
01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.660
<v Speaker 1>get a normal job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop being a dreamer.</v>

1663
01:20:21.661 --> 01:20:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to hear that because I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard it and it strengthened my resolve.</v>

1664
01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very much so.</v>

1665
01:20:26.791 --> 01:20:28.920
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely a theme in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1666
01:20:28.921 --> 01:20:33.921
<v Speaker 4>if your path is too easy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you just fall out of the womb and </v>

1667
01:20:33.921 --> 01:20:37.131
<v Speaker 4>suddenly you'll note this is what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were meant to do and that 18 year doing </v>

1668
01:20:37.131 --> 01:20:37.860
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have other problems down</v>

1669
01:20:37.861 --> 01:20:39.630
<v Speaker 4>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good to have resistance.</v>

1670
01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:43.140
<v Speaker 4>It's good to have people's fucking with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and saying you're not good at this,</v>

1671
01:20:43.141 --> 01:20:44.190
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1672
01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:46.110
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for instance,</v>

1673
01:20:46.111 --> 01:20:49.470
<v Speaker 4>in my path to writing the 48 laws of </v>
<v Speaker 4>power,</v>

1674
01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:54.680
<v Speaker 4>I kind of knew I wanted to be a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I went into forms of writing that </v>

1675
01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:57.420
<v Speaker 4>didn't suit me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started off in journalism,</v>

1676
01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.760
<v Speaker 4>did that for several years and really </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of hated it.</v>

1677
01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:02.580
<v Speaker 4>And at one point an editor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1678
01:21:02.610 --> 01:21:05.400
<v Speaker 4>had lunch with me and he pointedly said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>robert,</v>

1679
01:21:05.401 --> 01:21:07.050
<v Speaker 4>you never going to be a good writer.</v>

1680
01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:09.870
<v Speaker 4>You just don't have the chemIstry for </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1681
01:21:09.871 --> 01:21:11.970
<v Speaker 4>You're just all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not disciplined.</v>

1682
01:21:11.971 --> 01:21:16.971
<v Speaker 4>maybe go to law school or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that got me out of journalism </v>

1683
01:21:16.971 --> 01:21:19.200
<v Speaker 4>because I've made me realize I really </v>
<v Speaker 4>hate the assholes who worked there,</v>

1684
01:21:19.201 --> 01:21:24.201
<v Speaker 4>who was just got to stick up their butt </v>
<v Speaker 4>and can't think about what real writing </v>

1685
01:21:24.201 --> 01:21:27.891
<v Speaker 4>might be like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got out of that and wandered around </v>

1686
01:21:27.891 --> 01:21:30.981
<v Speaker 4>europe and tried writing novels and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>sorts of things that didn't work either </v>

1687
01:21:30.981 --> 01:21:30.981
<v Speaker 4>that I tried hollywood and I tried </v>
<v Speaker 4>television.</v>

1688
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.860
<v Speaker 4>That through that process I discovered </v>
<v Speaker 4>what I loved.</v>

1689
01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:39.920
<v Speaker 4>When it came to the chance to do a book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suddenly the heavens blew open for me.</v>

1690
01:21:39.931 --> 01:21:43.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a book I can have total control over it.</v>

1691
01:21:43.611 --> 01:21:48.611
<v Speaker 4>There are no assholes telling me coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>in like in hollywood and changIng </v>

1692
01:21:48.611 --> 01:21:52.341
<v Speaker 4>everything that I write.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no writing for an article for </v>

1693
01:21:52.341 --> 01:21:52.800
<v Speaker 4>one week that disappears.</v>

1694
01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:57.800
<v Speaker 4>I've a book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was only through this process of </v>

1695
01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.981
<v Speaker 4>finding what I hated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when people come and tell me I don't </v>

1696
01:22:00.981 --> 01:22:05.181
<v Speaker 4>know what my vocation is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is I should be </v>

1697
01:22:05.181 --> 01:22:05.181
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I often say,</v>

1698
01:22:05.181 --> 01:22:05.940
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it that you hate?</v>

1699
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:08.760
<v Speaker 4>what are those things in life that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't like?</v>

1700
01:22:08.761 --> 01:22:12.540
<v Speaker 4>what are those jobs that you've had that</v>
<v Speaker 4>suck the life out of you?</v>

1701
01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:17.900
<v Speaker 4>They're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're sort of indications of maybe </v>

1702
01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:20.031
<v Speaker 4>something that you should like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't like working for large groups </v>

1703
01:22:20.031 --> 01:22:20.640
<v Speaker 4>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should be an entrepreneur.</v>

1704
01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.190
<v Speaker 4>You should be working for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're.</v>

1705
01:22:22.191 --> 01:22:24.330
<v Speaker 4>You're shaking your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look very skeptical.</v>

1706
01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:24.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1707
01:22:24.881 --> 01:22:26.510
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm agreeing with you wholeheartedly.</v>

1708
01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.100
<v Speaker 1>The total opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1709
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.990
<v Speaker 1>so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1710
01:22:28.991 --> 01:22:29.890
<v Speaker 1>please on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1711
01:22:29.891 --> 01:22:30.470
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just.</v>

1712
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I love it.</v>

1713
01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:33.760
<v Speaker 1>You got to have the resistance</v>

1714
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:38.890
<v Speaker 4>and the worst thing that happens are </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who get successful at 25 and then</v>

1715
01:22:39.411 --> 01:22:44.411
<v Speaker 4>think that they've got the golden touch </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they don't realize that they don't </v>

1716
01:22:44.411 --> 01:22:46.220
<v Speaker 4>have the golden touch that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they were.</v>

1717
01:22:46.221 --> 01:22:51.221
<v Speaker 4>They were kind of lucky and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>keep thinking that they have to repeat </v>

1718
01:22:51.221 --> 01:22:53.750
<v Speaker 4>the same thing that they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say they became a comic at the age</v>

1719
01:22:53.751 --> 01:22:56.450
<v Speaker 4>of 25,</v>
<v Speaker 4>became hugely successful,</v>

1720
01:22:57.410 --> 01:23:00.170
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't have the resistance that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had.</v>

1721
01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:05.680
<v Speaker 4>Now they start not listening to their </v>
<v Speaker 4>audience or to other people or to their </v>

1722
01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:06.190
<v Speaker 4>who says they're not really</v>

1723
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.320
<v Speaker 6>that funny and they just think </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

1724
01:23:08.321 --> 01:23:09.640
<v Speaker 6>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything they should.</v>

1725
01:23:09.641 --> 01:23:10.870
<v Speaker 6>It's just wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>By the way,</v>

1726
01:23:10.871 --> 01:23:12.490
<v Speaker 6>that's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Very common.</v>

1727
01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.360
<v Speaker 6>That's a huge issue with comics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1728
01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:16.690
<v Speaker 6>A huge issue with comics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As they become successful,</v>

1729
01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:21.691
<v Speaker 6>then they start to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a real issue with some of the </v>

1730
01:23:21.691 --> 01:23:21.900
<v Speaker 6>greats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I won't name names,</v>

1731
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:24.700
<v Speaker 6>but what happened to woody allen?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean he's an older guy,</v>

1732
01:23:24.701 --> 01:23:29.701
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I disagree with you there because his </v>

1733
01:23:29.701 --> 01:23:29.701
<v Speaker 6>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his,</v>

1734
01:23:29.701 --> 01:23:30.940
<v Speaker 6>his movies are fucking brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1735
01:23:30.941 --> 01:23:33.340
<v Speaker 6>Blue jasmine was great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a great movie.</v>

1736
01:23:33.670 --> 01:23:36.640
<v Speaker 6>Midnight in paris was fucking fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a really good movie.</v>

1737
01:23:36.641 --> 01:23:39.670
<v Speaker 6>I think he's just a crazy pervert and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then that's the problem.</v>

1738
01:23:39.671 --> 01:23:44.671
<v Speaker 6>I think what we don't like to admit it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what fuels woody allen is he likes </v>

1739
01:23:44.671 --> 01:23:44.671
<v Speaker 6>getting his dick sucked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1740
01:23:44.671 --> 01:23:45.790
<v Speaker 6>and he likes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a freak.</v>

1741
01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:51.240
<v Speaker 6>You go back and you ever seen woody </v>
<v Speaker 6>allen's young standup when he was </v>

1742
01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:51.240
<v Speaker 6>hilarious.</v>

1743
01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:55.560
<v Speaker 6>He was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought he was much funnier back then </v>

1744
01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:55.560
<v Speaker 6>than he is now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He certainly is,</v>

1745
01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.580
<v Speaker 6>but he also wasn't exposed like you is </v>
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

1746
01:23:57.790 --> 01:24:00.580
<v Speaker 6>He isn't hated and vilified like he is </v>
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

1747
01:24:00.581 --> 01:24:03.220
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he became a pariah.</v>

1748
01:24:03.221 --> 01:24:05.720
<v Speaker 6>I mean he became like a real freak.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1749
01:24:05.930 --> 01:24:10.210
<v Speaker 6>We were talking before the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was saying that the sound of clicking,</v>

1750
01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:12.820
<v Speaker 6>I was putting something on twitter and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>was like,</v>

1751
01:24:12.821 --> 01:24:14.710
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to miss that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If they ever get rid of that,</v>

1752
01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:19.920
<v Speaker 6>like the sound of clicking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like so a real rewarding to me or </v>

1753
01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:24.691
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Woody allen does all of his typing all </v>

1754
01:24:24.691 --> 01:24:26.740
<v Speaker 6>of scripts on an old typewriter and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>way he edits,</v>

1755
01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:31.090
<v Speaker 6>he takes pieces of paper and if he </v>
<v Speaker 6>changes a scene,</v>

1756
01:24:31.330 --> 01:24:36.330
<v Speaker 6>he'll print it on a piece of paper and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then cut it and then staple it to the </v>

1757
01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:37.330
<v Speaker 6>other thing or tape it to the other </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

1758
01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.300
<v Speaker 6>Like he's like so old school in his </v>
<v Speaker 6>approach,</v>

1759
01:24:40.570 --> 01:24:44.590
<v Speaker 6>he uses the same typewriter that he's </v>
<v Speaker 6>always used for everything.</v>

1760
01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:49.770
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well it's probably because he's fucking </v>

1761
01:24:49.770 --> 01:24:51.340
<v Speaker 6>terrified to go on the internet if he </v>
<v Speaker 6>googles woody allen is a.</v>

1762
01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.370
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1763
01:24:52.630 --> 01:24:54.780
<v Speaker 6>whoever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>jesus is a first word,</v>

1764
01:24:54.781 --> 01:24:55.780
<v Speaker 6>is going to be con.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1765
01:24:55.781 --> 01:24:57.670
<v Speaker 6>if jesus ever gets online and googles </v>
<v Speaker 6>his name,</v>

1766
01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:03.060
<v Speaker 6>but for woody allen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the fucking hate and the vitriol </v>

1767
01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:04.150
<v Speaker 6>that that guy must experience on a daily</v>
<v Speaker 6>basis.</v>

1768
01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:09.360
<v Speaker 6>Just looking people in the eyes at a </v>
<v Speaker 6>restaurant must be like really pretty </v>

1769
01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:09.490
<v Speaker 6>fucking intense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1770
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:12.100
<v Speaker 6>I think that phenomenon that you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about with comics,</v>

1771
01:25:12.101 --> 01:25:14.470
<v Speaker 6>it applies to pretty much everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Athletes,</v>

1772
01:25:14.471 --> 01:25:19.471
<v Speaker 6>entrepreneurs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because if you use this resistance of </v>

1773
01:25:19.471 --> 01:25:20.170
<v Speaker 6>your struggling trying to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>top,</v>

1774
01:25:20.171 --> 01:25:21.430
<v Speaker 6>people telling you you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>make.</v>

1775
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:22.630
<v Speaker 6>You'll never be a champion.</v>

1776
01:25:22.630 --> 01:25:25.000
<v Speaker 6>You'll never start on the basketball </v>
<v Speaker 6>team.</v>

1777
01:25:25.001 --> 01:25:27.700
<v Speaker 6>You'll never do this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then once you get there and once you</v>

1778
01:25:27.701 --> 01:25:32.701
<v Speaker 6>achieve that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that kind of opposing force that allows </v>

1779
01:25:32.701 --> 01:25:33.850
<v Speaker 6>you to bring out the best can can kind </v>
<v Speaker 6>of go away.</v>

1780
01:25:33.851 --> 01:25:38.410
<v Speaker 6>It's why it's hard for teams to repeat </v>
<v Speaker 6>championships and things like that.</v>

1781
01:25:38.411 --> 01:25:40.280
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's an interesting phenomenon.</v>

1782
01:25:40.281 --> 01:25:45.281
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like you need this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>heat and resistance to create the </v>

1783
01:25:45.281 --> 01:25:47.410
<v Speaker 6>greatest out of yourself and when that </v>
<v Speaker 6>goes,</v>

1784
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:50.530
<v Speaker 6>you have to look elsewhere and find it </v>
<v Speaker 6>and other things.</v>

1785
01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:52.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't make steel without fire.</v>

1786
01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:57.820
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have a story in the book of freddie </v>

1787
01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:00.960
<v Speaker 6>roach.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was one of the modern masters that I </v>

1788
01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:03.810
<v Speaker 6>love.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Freddy freddy's amazing guy and the </v>

1789
01:26:03.810 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 6>story of freddy's really kind of a</v>

1790
01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:09.180
<v Speaker 4>a model for mastery in a way and </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically I'll summarize it quickly.</v>

1791
01:26:09.381 --> 01:26:14.381
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his father was a fighter and he got all </v>

1792
01:26:14.381 --> 01:26:14.381
<v Speaker 4>his boys into boxing and the age of </v>
<v Speaker 4>four.</v>

1793
01:26:14.381 --> 01:26:19.330
<v Speaker 4>They were already in a ring boxing away </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the age of four and so matt,</v>

1794
01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:24.700
<v Speaker 4>age onward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Freddy was boxing and an amateur level </v>

1795
01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:25.580
<v Speaker 4>and at one point in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like your mom,</v>

1796
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:27.110
<v Speaker 4>his mom said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>freddy,</v>

1797
01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:29.810
<v Speaker 4>you're not really very good at boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are you doing this?</v>

1798
01:26:29.811 --> 01:26:33.470
<v Speaker 4>Your brother is so much better than you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I got him really pissed.</v>

1799
01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.680
<v Speaker 4>So he went back into the gym and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>started training twice as hard and he </v>

1800
01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:40.160
<v Speaker 4>suddenly got better than his brother and</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only he started getting really good,</v>

1801
01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:43.100
<v Speaker 4>got on the olympic team,</v>
<v Speaker 4>became a professional,</v>

1802
01:26:43.101 --> 01:26:48.101
<v Speaker 4>I think it's around age of 18 or so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he had a boxing career as a </v>

1803
01:26:48.101 --> 01:26:49.850
<v Speaker 4>professional for about eight years and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was good,</v>

1804
01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:51.320
<v Speaker 4>but he wasn't great.</v>

1805
01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:57.040
<v Speaker 4>He was kind of slow and he started </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking a lot of punches and it had an </v>

1806
01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.510
<v Speaker 4>effect on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And finally at the age of 26 people were</v>

1807
01:26:59.511 --> 01:26:59.960
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>freddy,</v>

1808
01:26:59.961 --> 01:27:02.540
<v Speaker 4>you better retire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something really bad's going to happen.</v>

1809
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:06.530
<v Speaker 4>And so he retired at the age of 26 and </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you think about it,</v>

1810
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:10.790
<v Speaker 4>for 22 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boxing was his whole life.</v>

1811
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:14.120
<v Speaker 4>That's all he ever did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now it's finished.</v>

1812
01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:17.900
<v Speaker 4>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His career is over and it's just,</v>

1813
01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:22.550
<v Speaker 4>he's ready to go on a downward spiral to</v>
<v Speaker 4>suicide or something bad.</v>

1814
01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:27.740
<v Speaker 4>And he gets a job in vegas as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>telemarketer because he'd been living in</v>

1815
01:27:27.741 --> 01:27:32.741
<v Speaker 4>vegas and fighting and he's drinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>heavily and in the day in the daytime </v>

1816
01:27:32.741 --> 01:27:33.890
<v Speaker 4>because his jobs at night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he goes,</v>

1817
01:27:33.891 --> 01:27:38.891
<v Speaker 4>does it tell me it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's on a fast track to suicide and one </v>

1818
01:27:38.891 --> 01:27:42.761
<v Speaker 4>day he decides to go back to the gym </v>
<v Speaker 4>where he used to train under his old </v>

1819
01:27:42.761 --> 01:27:43.130
<v Speaker 4>trainer eddie fudge.</v>

1820
01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:46.430
<v Speaker 4>And he's just watching the fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

1821
01:27:46.431 --> 01:27:48.500
<v Speaker 4>he used to be trained and he decides,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1822
01:27:48.501 --> 01:27:50.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to maybe help this one guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

1823
01:27:50.241 --> 01:27:52.070
<v Speaker 4>He's not getting any attention right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1824
01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:55.880
<v Speaker 4>And in that moment he just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he sort of realizes,</v>

1825
01:27:56.150 --> 01:27:58.250
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like teaching.</v>

1826
01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:01.670
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe this is what I was meant to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

1827
01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:04.220
<v Speaker 4>and he starts coming back every single </v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

1828
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:07.730
<v Speaker 4>He's not getting paid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The trainer isn't hiring him.</v>

1829
01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:12.940
<v Speaker 4>He comes on his own and he starts </v>
<v Speaker 4>helping out the fighters and he slowly </v>

1830
01:28:13.041 --> 01:28:15.920
<v Speaker 4>realizes that training is the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 4>job for him.</v>

1831
01:28:15.921 --> 01:28:18.020
<v Speaker 4>He loves competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>he loves winning,</v>

1832
01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:21.350
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't have to take a punch as </v>
<v Speaker 4>the trainer.</v>

1833
01:28:21.351 --> 01:28:24.020
<v Speaker 4>He can in the training area with his </v>
<v Speaker 4>large myths,</v>

1834
01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:27.320
<v Speaker 4>but no punches to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can strategize,</v>

1835
01:28:27.321 --> 01:28:28.820
<v Speaker 4>he can win,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can compete,</v>

1836
01:28:28.821 --> 01:28:33.821
<v Speaker 4>you can do all the mind games that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>loves and he can give these years of </v>

1837
01:28:33.821 --> 01:28:33.830
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

1838
01:28:34.130 --> 01:28:39.130
<v Speaker 4>The reason why I consider this a model </v>
<v Speaker 4>is it took him a path where he sort of </v>

1839
01:28:40.281 --> 01:28:44.630
<v Speaker 4>looked like he was going downhill where </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was nothing left for him to do and</v>

1840
01:28:44.631 --> 01:28:49.631
<v Speaker 4>suddenly just a chance encounter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>made him realize what is real task in </v>

1841
01:28:50.181 --> 01:28:55.181
<v Speaker 4>life was and all that experience that he</v>
<v Speaker 4>had now could be applied to becoming the</v>

1842
01:28:55.791 --> 01:28:58.400
<v Speaker 4>greatest trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a boxing trainer of our era,</v>

1843
01:28:58.401 --> 01:29:01.270
<v Speaker 4>and also a mixed martial arts trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1844
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:03.840
<v Speaker 4>and so people always say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1845
01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1846
01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:08.340
<v Speaker 4>I can't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what my path is.</v>

1847
01:29:08.341 --> 01:29:09.300
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1848
01:29:09.301 --> 01:29:11.220
<v Speaker 4>I can't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm too old,</v>

1849
01:29:11.230 --> 01:29:14.760
<v Speaker 4>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a question of what age you are.</v>

1850
01:29:15.290 --> 01:29:20.290
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can always take the experiences and </v>

1851
01:29:20.290 --> 01:29:22.521
<v Speaker 4>mistakes that you've had in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you still got some guts and </v>

1852
01:29:22.521 --> 01:29:25.971
<v Speaker 4>you're not a whiner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can find a way to apply those </v>

1853
01:29:25.971 --> 01:29:25.971
<v Speaker 4>skills.</v>

1854
01:29:25.971 --> 01:29:30.230
<v Speaker 4>In a new way that's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that more engaged as you </v>

1855
01:29:30.230 --> 01:29:31.080
<v Speaker 4>personally and emotionally because in </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact,</v>

1856
01:29:31.081 --> 01:29:34.800
<v Speaker 4>he really wasn't meant to be a boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His father had pushed him into it.</v>

1857
01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:39.150
<v Speaker 4>What he was meant to be was a teacher </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's fucking brilliant at it,</v>

1858
01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:43.920
<v Speaker 4>so that's sort of like the model of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>path that god has for you.</v>

1859
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:49.070
<v Speaker 4>It's not all rosy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not all instantly finding the </v>

1860
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:50.220
<v Speaker 4>perfect job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It requires some pain,</v>

1861
01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:52.320
<v Speaker 4>some defeat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some loss,</v>

1862
01:29:52.410 --> 01:29:55.800
<v Speaker 4>some really tough moments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it's going to click together.</v>

1863
01:29:55.801 --> 01:29:56.880
<v Speaker 4>As long as you don't give up</v>

1864
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.980
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1865
01:29:57.981 --> 01:30:01.310
<v Speaker 1>and it is important to to experience the</v>
<v Speaker 1>loss.</v>

1866
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:04.490
<v Speaker 1>It's exploring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very important to feel the lows.</v>

1867
01:30:04.730 --> 01:30:07.220
<v Speaker 1>If you don't feel the lows you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate the highs.</v>

1868
01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:11.060
<v Speaker 1>People in this day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want instant coffee.</v>

1869
01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:13.460
<v Speaker 1>You know they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want instant gratification.</v>

1870
01:30:13.461 --> 01:30:15.650
<v Speaker 1>They want everything to come to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>with very little work.</v>

1871
01:30:15.651 --> 01:30:18.050
<v Speaker 1>They want to win the lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winning the lottery.</v>

1872
01:30:18.051 --> 01:30:20.540
<v Speaker 1>It's probably the worst fucking thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could ever happen to you as a human</v>

1873
01:30:20.541 --> 01:30:22.310
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think bAck,</v>

1874
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:24.290
<v Speaker 1>I played the lottery wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a free ticket.</v>

1875
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I played it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost.</v>

1876
01:30:25.731 --> 01:30:26.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

1877
01:30:26.901 --> 01:30:28.700
<v Speaker 1>I never played the lottery again in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way,</v>

1878
01:30:28.730 --> 01:30:33.730
<v Speaker 1>but what if I fucking one man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if I want 100 million dollars when </v>

1879
01:30:33.730 --> 01:30:36.461
<v Speaker 1>I was 21?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be the biggest fucking loser of </v>

1880
01:30:36.461 --> 01:30:36.461
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I probably would.</v>

1881
01:30:36.461 --> 01:30:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The money would be gone.</v>

1882
01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I'd be suicidal because I blew through </v>
<v Speaker 1>$100,000,000.</v>

1883
01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:46.540
<v Speaker 1>But it's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why so many lottery </v>

1884
01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:50.240
<v Speaker 1>winners burned through that money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you don't know what it is.</v>

1885
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:53.000
<v Speaker 1>You didn't earn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not yours.</v>

1886
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:58.030
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you've done is you've found a </v>

1887
01:30:58.030 --> 01:31:01.091
<v Speaker 1>weakness in the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've exploited it because the system </v>

1888
01:31:01.091 --> 01:31:04.901
<v Speaker 1>is designed to steal money from people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get those dummies to spend all this </v>

1889
01:31:04.901 --> 01:31:09.191
<v Speaker 1>money on a fucking lottery ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's legalized gambling and the state </v>

1890
01:31:09.191 --> 01:31:13.211
<v Speaker 1>profits from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just once but twice because they </v>

1891
01:31:13.211 --> 01:31:14.090
<v Speaker 1>don't just take the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your tax dollars.</v>

1892
01:31:14.210 --> 01:31:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The money that you received after you </v>

1893
01:31:19.210 --> 01:31:19.210
<v Speaker 1>spent all your money on taxes and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1894
01:31:19.210 --> 01:31:21.230
<v Speaker 1>just what you've got left over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you buy a lottery ticket.</v>

1895
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that money goes into a pool.</v>

1896
01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:26.540
<v Speaker 1>The government takes a piece of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>

1897
01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:30.080
<v Speaker 1>and then when you get paid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take half of that.</v>

1898
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:33.920
<v Speaker 1>They fuck you every way coming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

1899
01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:37.070
<v Speaker 1>and you get all that money and you still</v>
<v Speaker 1>blow it.</v>

1900
01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:42.250
<v Speaker 1>You still blow it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't keep it with almost no one </v>

1901
01:31:42.250 --> 01:31:46.121
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have a million other fucking </v>

1902
01:31:46.121 --> 01:31:48.491
<v Speaker 1>parasites trying to steal it from you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and because they know you don't deserve </v>

1903
01:31:48.491 --> 01:31:48.491
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

1904
01:31:48.491 --> 01:31:50.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mad pursuit.</v>

1905
01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:55.600
<v Speaker 1>The way you appreciate money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a dollar or a million </v>

1906
01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.810
<v Speaker 1>dollars is when you earn it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you work hard,</v>

1907
01:31:56.811 --> 01:31:59.150
<v Speaker 1>you experienced the loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go through the trials,</v>

1908
01:31:59.230 --> 01:32:01.060
<v Speaker 1>tribulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get it.</v>

1909
01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:03.610
<v Speaker 2>when I look back at my path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just say real quick,</v>

1910
01:32:03.611 --> 01:32:08.611
<v Speaker 2>when I looked back at my path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know I've got out of school and I </v>

1911
01:32:08.611 --> 01:32:10.120
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what the hell I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gonna do and already felt terrible.</v>

1912
01:32:10.121 --> 01:32:14.230
<v Speaker 2>I had some idea that I was already gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>be in my vocation doing something great.</v>

1913
01:32:14.231 --> 01:32:15.760
<v Speaker 2>By the time I finished college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1914
01:32:15.761 --> 01:32:16.720
<v Speaker 2>that didn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1915
01:32:16.721 --> 01:32:19.210
<v Speaker 2>I was successful in a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

1916
01:32:19.211 --> 01:32:22.510
<v Speaker 2>I kept trying but not really nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I could really hang my hat on.</v>

1917
01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:26.020
<v Speaker 2>So I was really anxious and antsy and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>kept trying things.</v>

1918
01:32:26.021 --> 01:32:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I started a marketing company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sold fake vaginas.</v>

1919
01:32:28.691 --> 01:32:33.020
<v Speaker 2>I worked for a pharmaceutical company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus fleshlight,</v>

1920
01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:36.740
<v Speaker 2>the largest fake vagina company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a tangent we don't need to go to</v>

1921
01:32:37.290 --> 01:32:41.240
<v Speaker 2>for what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For stick your penis in them,</v>

1922
01:32:42.230 --> 01:32:47.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was working with oil and gas </v>

1923
01:32:47.230 --> 01:32:49.231
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every single thing it was like the </v>

1924
01:32:49.231 --> 01:32:49.231
<v Speaker 2>universe came and just bashed me on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

1925
01:32:49.231 --> 01:32:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Something didn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1926
01:32:50.261 --> 01:32:53.620
<v Speaker 2>I'd even get options in this company </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was going to strike,</v>

1927
01:32:53.621 --> 01:32:56.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were fracking some gas or something</v>

1928
01:32:56.111 --> 01:33:01.111
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really understand it at that </v>

1929
01:33:01.111 --> 01:33:02.521
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if that would have been successful </v>

1930
01:33:02.521 --> 01:33:04.771
<v Speaker 2>and worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've made a huge amount of money </v>

1931
01:33:04.771 --> 01:33:05.620
<v Speaker 2>and that would have deterred me from </v>
<v Speaker 2>this path I am now.</v>

1932
01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Which now I truly feel I'm in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>vocation.</v>

1933
01:33:08.710 --> 01:33:13.710
<v Speaker 2>But if I look back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things that I was fighting </v>

1934
01:33:13.710 --> 01:33:16.681
<v Speaker 2>for for success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they would have come and they would </v>

1935
01:33:16.681 --> 01:33:18.370
<v Speaker 2>have come lucratively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might have deterred me from what my</v>

1936
01:33:18.371 --> 01:33:20.830
<v Speaker 2>real vocation is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all of these things,</v>

1937
01:33:20.831 --> 01:33:25.831
<v Speaker 2>all these bashes on the head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the universe takinG a fucking </v>

1938
01:33:25.831 --> 01:33:28.681
<v Speaker 2>hammer and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wack not going to work has kind of led </v>

1939
01:33:28.681 --> 01:33:32.611
<v Speaker 2>me in this weird path to actually doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that I truly now feel is my </v>

1940
01:33:32.611 --> 01:33:33.850
<v Speaker 2>vocation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those things are blessings.</v>

1941
01:33:33.851 --> 01:33:38.851
<v Speaker 2>Those failures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think eventually you would have found </v>

1942
01:33:38.851 --> 01:33:39.970
<v Speaker 2>your way because it's just who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

1943
01:33:39.971 --> 01:33:41.200
<v Speaker 2>So like maybe</v>

1944
01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:44.710
<v Speaker 1>it's easy for say when to say when </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's successful.</v>

1945
01:33:44.770 --> 01:33:49.770
<v Speaker 1>I know that's like the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My issue with the secret is they only </v>

1946
01:33:49.770 --> 01:33:53.851
<v Speaker 1>talk to the ones who worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was hanging out at the comedy </v>

1947
01:33:53.851 --> 01:33:55.090
<v Speaker 1>store once and my friend kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kirsten,</v>

1948
01:33:55.120 --> 01:34:00.120
<v Speaker 1>very funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standup comic had a friend that came </v>

1949
01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.060
<v Speaker 1>with her to the comedy show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She seemed like a very nice person.</v>

1950
01:34:01.330 --> 01:34:06.190
<v Speaker 1>And she was talking about the secret and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the first time I met her and she</v>

1951
01:34:06.191 --> 01:34:07.600
<v Speaker 1>was going on about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1952
01:34:07.601 --> 01:34:12.601
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have this and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that and because I discovered the </v>

1953
01:34:12.601 --> 01:34:16.651
<v Speaker 1>secret and you know that movie where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells you to manifest your own destiny </v>

1954
01:34:16.651 --> 01:34:18.070
<v Speaker 1>with your imagination and you can make </v>
<v Speaker 1>things happen.</v>

1955
01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:21.790
<v Speaker 1>She had decided that because she had </v>
<v Speaker 1>this belief in this system,</v>

1956
01:34:21.791 --> 01:34:23.020
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this secret thing,</v>

1957
01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:28.230
<v Speaker 1>that she was going to somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>be super successful and find the man of </v>

1958
01:34:28.230 --> 01:34:30.160
<v Speaker 1>her dreams and be rich beyond our </v>
<v Speaker 1>wildest imagination.</v>

1959
01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Then I ran into her many years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She came to another comedy show that I </v>

1960
01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:37.840
<v Speaker 1>had a at the ucb and I remember she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>very nice.</v>

1961
01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.730
<v Speaker 1>So I was talking to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1962
01:34:39.731 --> 01:34:40.450
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you doing?</v>

1963
01:34:40.451 --> 01:34:45.451
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to her once and then I talked </v>

1964
01:34:45.451 --> 01:34:47.791
<v Speaker 1>to her twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the only two times I ever had </v>

1965
01:34:47.791 --> 01:34:47.791
<v Speaker 1>an interaction with this woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She seemed very nice,</v>

1966
01:34:47.791 --> 01:34:51.990
<v Speaker 1>but I'm talking to her and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why it's not working like </v>

1967
01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:57.240
<v Speaker 1>my relationships with terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't cut myself off of these bad </v>

1968
01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:01.741
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My father is always wants money from me </v>

1969
01:35:01.741 --> 01:35:02.510
<v Speaker 1>and he's always broke and he drinks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like she had.</v>

1970
01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:05.000
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that I was going to be able to</v>

1971
01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.820
<v Speaker 1>create my own life and it's just not </v>
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>

1972
01:35:07.821 --> 01:35:11.600
<v Speaker 1>And the secret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you watch those fucking shows,</v>

1973
01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:13.920
<v Speaker 1>it's only the people that succeeded </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1974
01:35:13.921 --> 01:35:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Like I drew a picture of the house that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted in 10 years later,</v>

1975
01:35:18.441 --> 01:35:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm living in that house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I set a goal.</v>

1976
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:24.530
<v Speaker 1>My goal was $10,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have $10,000,000.</v>

1977
01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:26.330
<v Speaker 1>The secret is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1978
01:35:26.331 --> 01:35:31.331
<v Speaker 1>there's a person out there that drew a </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture of a fucking castle on the moon </v>

1979
01:35:31.331 --> 01:35:31.331
<v Speaker 1>and they're still in pasadena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1980
01:35:31.331 --> 01:35:32.930
<v Speaker 1>where's my fucking castle on the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ain't getting there,</v>

1981
01:35:32.931 --> 01:35:33.710
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1982
01:35:33.711 --> 01:35:35.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>

1983
01:35:35.421 --> 01:35:40.421
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a very biased </v>

1984
01:35:40.421 --> 01:35:44.200
<v Speaker 1>profile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're only talking to the people that </v>

1985
01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:44.200
<v Speaker 1>are successful.</v>

1986
01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:44.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1987
01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:48.011
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things in the laws of human </v>

1988
01:35:48.011 --> 01:35:50.201
<v Speaker 4>nature coming up is this idea that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something that's easy,</v>

1989
01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:54.480
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that someone's trying to pedal,</v>

1990
01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:58.850
<v Speaker 4>it's a deception.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a con game.</v>

1991
01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:04.300
<v Speaker 4>We want to believe we humans wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe in something quick and easy and </v>

1992
01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:08.981
<v Speaker 4>simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if we believe in something that </v>

1993
01:36:08.981 --> 01:36:09.590
<v Speaker 4>means it can't really be real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we believe that because of that,</v>

1994
01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:10.790
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in other words,</v>

1995
01:36:10.791 --> 01:36:14.930
<v Speaker 4>we want to believe that we can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that god will grace us with,</v>

1996
01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:18.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we do perform certain rituals or that</v>

1997
01:36:18.561 --> 01:36:21.620
<v Speaker 4>we can make a lot of money by just </v>
<v Speaker 4>following the secret.</v>

1998
01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:25.340
<v Speaker 4>The truth of the matter is that to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>really successful,</v>

1999
01:36:25.341 --> 01:36:28.460
<v Speaker 4>to make money that lasts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes hours.</v>

2000
01:36:28.461 --> 01:36:29.600
<v Speaker 4>It takes 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours,</v>

2001
01:36:29.601 --> 01:36:30.890
<v Speaker 4>it takes 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

2002
01:36:30.891 --> 01:36:33.350
<v Speaker 4>It takes a lot of work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tedious work,</v>

2003
01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:35.300
<v Speaker 4>drudgery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boredom,</v>

2004
01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:37.910
<v Speaker 4>moments of challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two feet.</v>

2005
01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:43.360
<v Speaker 4>That's the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anybody that's trying to tell you </v>

2006
01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:43.360
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is not the case,</v>

2007
01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:45.200
<v Speaker 4>that there are shortcuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're con artists,</v>

2008
01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:46.970
<v Speaker 4>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just pure and simple there,</v>

2009
01:36:46.971 --> 01:36:51.971
<v Speaker 4>connors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one thing I'm trying to tell show </v>

2010
01:36:51.971 --> 01:36:51.971
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2011
01:36:51.971 --> 01:36:54.860
<v Speaker 4>in mastery is that we humans are geared </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards pleasure.</v>

2012
01:36:55.341 --> 01:36:58.310
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to do things that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>naturally painful.</v>

2013
01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:03.460
<v Speaker 4>We are immediately attracted to things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that offer us some kind of pleasure or </v>

2014
01:37:03.471 --> 01:37:08.471
<v Speaker 4>reward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the problem is too many things </v>

2015
01:37:08.471 --> 01:37:09.290
<v Speaker 4>nowadays offer pleasures that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediate,</v>

2016
01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.700
<v Speaker 4>instant rewards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2017
01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:16.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a movie or a video game or something </v>

2018
01:37:16.930 --> 01:37:17.750
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or a drug where without much effort,</v>

2019
01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:20.930
<v Speaker 4>we get a feeling of relaxation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pleasure.</v>

2020
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:26.470
<v Speaker 4>and what I'm trying to show in mastery </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that there's a different kind of </v>

2021
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:27.500
<v Speaker 4>pleasure that you want to train your </v>
<v Speaker 4>body towards,</v>

2022
01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:33.490
<v Speaker 4>aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a pleasure that comes from </v>

2023
01:37:33.490 --> 01:37:35.810
<v Speaker 4>conquering yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from learning something deeply as you're</v>

2024
01:37:35.811 --> 01:37:39.860
<v Speaker 4>taking up a or you've been doing archery</v>
<v Speaker 4>for some time.</v>

2025
01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:45.220
<v Speaker 4>It's probably not too satisfying the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first few days that you were doing at </v>

2026
01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:45.620
<v Speaker 4>our first few weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a challenge.</v>

2027
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:49.370
<v Speaker 4>There wasn't much creativity involved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>

2028
01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:51.920
<v Speaker 4>But if you keep doing this for five </v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

2029
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:55.890
<v Speaker 4>10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly it's reach a level pleasure</v>

2030
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:59.340
<v Speaker 2>that no video game could ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever begin to supply you.</v>

2031
01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:04.580
<v Speaker 2>And I want to reorient your whole value </v>
<v Speaker 2>system towards this other kind of </v>

2032
01:38:05.041 --> 01:38:08.640
<v Speaker 2>pleasure that comes from conquering your</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

2033
01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:12.000
<v Speaker 2>getting discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting skilled at something,</v>

2034
01:38:12.270 --> 01:38:17.270
<v Speaker 2>becoming really good at it and feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible sense of fulfillment as </v>

2035
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:21.090
<v Speaker 2>opposed to all those immediate rushes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that our culture tries to pedal.</v>

2036
01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:25.240
<v Speaker 1>That's such a huge point for </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction in life.</v>

2037
01:38:25.450 --> 01:38:30.450
<v Speaker 1>I feel most relaxed after I've worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out really hard and not just physically </v>

2038
01:38:31.211 --> 01:38:33.610
<v Speaker 1>because I've blown off all this steam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because I did it,</v>

2039
01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:34.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2040
01:38:34.851 --> 01:38:39.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of being uncomfortable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell that to people and I go,</v>

2041
01:38:39.221 --> 01:38:40.060
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2042
01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.100
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody likes sleeping in more than me.</v>

2043
01:38:42.130 --> 01:38:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you do,</v>

2044
01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:46.060
<v Speaker 1>but I doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

2045
01:38:46.270 --> 01:38:48.190
<v Speaker 1>I love sleeping in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't do it.</v>

2046
01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get up,</v>

2047
01:38:49.511 --> 01:38:51.430
<v Speaker 1>I get up and a half to get up unless I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

2048
01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:53.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did all my shit.</v>

2049
01:38:53.530 --> 01:38:58.530
<v Speaker 1>But my point is in when I have something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I have to do when I do it,</v>

2050
01:38:59.321 --> 01:39:02.450
<v Speaker 1>if I don't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels even better once I've done it.</v>

2051
01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:05.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the fan,</v>

2052
01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:09.490
<v Speaker 1>that's the fan of being uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I liked that feeling.</v>

2053
01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:11.740
<v Speaker 1>I liked that feeling because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of shaped me.</v>

2054
01:39:11.741 --> 01:39:16.741
<v Speaker 1>It's rewarded me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why pursue so </v>

2055
01:39:16.741 --> 01:39:18.190
<v Speaker 1>many things that I've never done before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why I got into archery.</v>

2056
01:39:18.191 --> 01:39:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why I'm enjoying it.</v>

2057
01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm enjoying it because I fucking suck </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

2058
01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like sucking at something.</v>

2059
01:39:23.730 --> 01:39:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you suck at it.</v>

2060
01:39:25.151 --> 01:39:27.460
<v Speaker 1>And now I don't suck out as much as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did three weeks,</v>

2061
01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:28.810
<v Speaker 1>three months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the hell it is.</v>

2062
01:39:28.811 --> 01:39:31.300
<v Speaker 1>When I first bought a bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm better at it now for sure.</v>

2063
01:39:31.301 --> 01:39:36.301
<v Speaker 1>I put pictures online of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my fucking my patterns that I can hit </v>

2064
01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:37.600
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2065
01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:38.930
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2066
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:44.430
<v Speaker 1>arrows in the bull's eyes and shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want to reinforce that in my </v>

2067
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:48.241
<v Speaker 1>head to keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also there's a discipline involved </v>

2068
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:52.210
<v Speaker 1>in something that's very difficult to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that requires all of your concentration.</v>

2069
01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:55.840
<v Speaker 1>That clears the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's.</v>

2070
01:39:56.110 --> 01:39:57.970
<v Speaker 1>You can get that in gardening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2071
01:39:57.971 --> 01:40:00.580
<v Speaker 1>you can get them running up hills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

2072
01:40:00.581 --> 01:40:03.070
<v Speaker 1>When you're running up hills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not thinking about too much other</v>

2073
01:40:03.071 --> 01:40:06.310
<v Speaker 1>shit when you're absolutely exhausted </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your heart's pounding your chest and</v>

2074
01:40:06.311 --> 01:40:09.130
<v Speaker 1>you know you've got 300 yards to go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think you can make it.</v>

2075
01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:10.650
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a.</v>

2076
01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:12.280
<v Speaker 1>there's a beauty in that.</v>

2077
01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking a lot about zen </v>

2078
01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:19.491
<v Speaker 2>philosophy almost too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well as using some modality of </v>

2079
01:40:19.491 --> 01:40:21.000
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is often it is or anything to find</v>

2080
01:40:21.001 --> 01:40:23.340
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sort of presence of mind,</v>

2081
01:40:23.370 --> 01:40:28.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>returning to that state of openness of </v>

2082
01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:30.891
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and archery is one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those main channels and in the art of </v>

2083
01:40:30.891 --> 01:40:31.170
<v Speaker 2>archery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great book,</v>

2084
01:40:31.171 --> 01:40:33.370
<v Speaker 2>I've read that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2085
01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:38.380
<v Speaker 2>you work for these moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it satori where it's these </v>

2086
01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:41.060
<v Speaker 2>moments where you have this really </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindless shot that you take in archery </v>

2087
01:40:41.371 --> 01:40:44.370
<v Speaker 2>and everything is just completely in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

2088
01:40:44.371 --> 01:40:48.090
<v Speaker 2>And I think the masters have found a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to duplicate that more.</v>

2089
01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:49.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more often more.</v>

2090
01:40:50.690 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 2>They have a almost a formula that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>allow them to get</v>

2091
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:57.300
<v Speaker 1>these moments where they're really in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the zone as you would call it,</v>

2092
01:40:57.310 --> 01:40:58.930
<v Speaker 1>or flow the flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2093
01:40:58.931 --> 01:41:00.700
<v Speaker 1>getting these flow states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really,</v>

2094
01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:05.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearkening back to that old zen </v>

2095
01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:07.891
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of being of no mind and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the the experience that best </v>

2096
01:41:08.441 --> 01:41:11.470
<v Speaker 1>describes martial arts at its best as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2097
01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:13.630
<v Speaker 1>When you're fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're competing,</v>

2098
01:41:13.631 --> 01:41:16.090
<v Speaker 1>especially if there's anything on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

2099
01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:21.360
<v Speaker 1>anything else besides the task at hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>besides dealing with the other skilled </v>

2100
01:41:21.941 --> 01:41:24.370
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be diminished.</v>

2101
01:41:24.670 --> 01:41:26.710
<v Speaker 1>You will be diminished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your skills will be diminished.</v>

2102
01:41:26.711 --> 01:41:31.711
<v Speaker 1>Your mind will be diminished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why so many </v>

2103
01:41:31.711 --> 01:41:33.931
<v Speaker 1>people talk trash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They talk trash to fill your mind up </v>

2104
01:41:33.931 --> 01:41:36.871
<v Speaker 1>with other tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fill your mind up with insecurity </v>

2105
01:41:36.871 --> 01:41:37.180
<v Speaker 1>and doubt or anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just as bad.</v>

2106
01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Fill your mind up with all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

2107
01:41:39.370 --> 01:41:44.370
<v Speaker 1>You might be able to win with anger if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fighting a less than skilled </v>

2108
01:41:44.370 --> 01:41:47.371
<v Speaker 1>opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you fight a real master and you </v>

2109
01:41:47.371 --> 01:41:47.371
<v Speaker 1>have anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make mistakes.</v>

2110
01:41:47.371 --> 01:41:50.320
<v Speaker 1>You're going to open yourself up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fight with that anger,</v>

2111
01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:52.890
<v Speaker 1>and in fighting with that anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>

2112
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Expose yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna fight with perfect </v>

2113
01:41:57.910 --> 01:42:00.211
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're Mike Tyson versus michael </v>

2114
01:42:00.211 --> 01:42:03.361
<v Speaker 1>spinks were is fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No maTter what he does to tyson could </v>

2115
01:42:03.361 --> 01:42:04.390
<v Speaker 1>come into that fight on cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>

2116
01:42:04.630 --> 01:42:06.190
<v Speaker 1>didn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to kill you because he's just</v>

2117
01:42:06.191 --> 01:42:10.240
<v Speaker 1>so much better and less that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you have to mike tyson's,</v>

2118
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:15.390
<v Speaker 1>you know what you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get Mike Tyson versus evander </v>

2119
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:17.491
<v Speaker 1>holyfield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a guy who was fighting with </v>

2120
01:42:17.491 --> 01:42:17.491
<v Speaker 1>purity and a guy who's going to beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>your fucking ass.</v>

2121
01:42:17.491 --> 01:42:22.381
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to take him out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>there with one big rush in the first </v>

2122
01:42:22.381 --> 01:42:22.840
<v Speaker 1>round and you know you're going to wind </v>
<v Speaker 1>up getting knocked the fuck out,</v>

2123
01:42:22.841 --> 01:42:24.850
<v Speaker 1>and that's what happened to holy wood to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyson.</v>

2124
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:27.160
<v Speaker 1>When he fought holyfield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fought a real master.</v>

2125
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:29.680
<v Speaker 1>He fought a master when he wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>master anymore.</v>

2126
01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:30.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This.</v>

2127
01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:34.260
<v Speaker 4>I didn't include them in the mastery of </v>
<v Speaker 4>an inclusive in my next book,</v>

2128
01:42:34.261 --> 01:42:38.990
<v Speaker 4>but I was reading phil jackson's most </v>
<v Speaker 4>recent book and he said,</v>

2129
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.000
<v Speaker 4>master himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he discovered then dealing with all </v>

2130
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.651
<v Speaker 4>these incredible egos on the team as he </v>
<v Speaker 4>did with the polls and later with the </v>

2131
01:42:48.651 --> 01:42:52.161
<v Speaker 4>lakers that if he tried to get them all </v>
<v Speaker 4>wired up before a game and emotional,</v>

2132
01:42:52.561 --> 01:42:54.300
<v Speaker 4>which is what a lot of coaches would do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gala,</v>

2133
01:42:54.330 --> 01:42:57.390
<v Speaker 4>we're going to rip the guts out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go kill the lake or whatever,</v>

2134
01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:02.800
<v Speaker 4>that they would play much worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So his job was to imbibe in them </v>

2135
01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:07.640
<v Speaker 4>incredible peacefulness and calm this so</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would meditate before a game which </v>

2136
01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:12.141
<v Speaker 4>no other coach ever did before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he wanted them completely to be </v>

2137
01:43:12.141 --> 01:43:16.971
<v Speaker 4>mindful in the game so that they could </v>
<v Speaker 4>focus on the task and not use all that </v>

2138
01:43:16.971 --> 01:43:18.090
<v Speaker 4>anger to push them.</v>

2139
01:43:18.330 --> 01:43:20.550
<v Speaker 4>And some players could use the anger a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit,</v>

2140
01:43:20.551 --> 01:43:25.551
<v Speaker 4>but most people like dennis rodman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would make them do all sorts of </v>

2141
01:43:25.551 --> 01:43:27.180
<v Speaker 4>terrible mistakes and look at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>results.</v>

2142
01:43:27.181 --> 01:43:32.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no coach who's had more </v>

2143
01:43:32.181 --> 01:43:32.181
<v Speaker 4>championships or more success than </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone like phil jackson,</v>

2144
01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:34.350
<v Speaker 4>but the thing that I tried show in </v>
<v Speaker 4>mastery,</v>

2145
01:43:34.351 --> 01:43:36.840
<v Speaker 4>because I have a story of a great zen </v>
<v Speaker 4>master,</v>

2146
01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:39.210
<v Speaker 4>a man named hakuin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2147
01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:42.960
<v Speaker 4>because I myself practice zen meditation</v>
<v Speaker 4>had been for many years.</v>

2148
01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:47.340
<v Speaker 4>This man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this was in sEventeenth century,</v>

2149
01:43:47.341 --> 01:43:48.600
<v Speaker 4>18th century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan,</v>

2150
01:43:49.530 --> 01:43:54.530
<v Speaker 4>he was reacting against all the zen </v>
<v Speaker 4>practices that were going on in Japan </v>

2151
01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:58.331
<v Speaker 4>that we're trying to promise you </v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment through something very </v>

2152
01:43:58.331 --> 01:44:02.501
<v Speaker 4>simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All you had to do was sit in what's </v>

2153
01:44:02.501 --> 01:44:04.250
<v Speaker 4>called zaza and seated meditation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment would come to you.</v>

2154
01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:06.050
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is such bullshit.</v>

2155
01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:07.820
<v Speaker 4>I hate this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This isn't the way to mass,</v>

2156
01:44:07.821 --> 01:44:08.840
<v Speaker 4>to enlightenment.</v>

2157
01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.780
<v Speaker 4>They've gotten away from the true </v>
<v Speaker 4>essence of zen.</v>

2158
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:14.570
<v Speaker 4>You have to have pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to go through 10,</v>

2159
01:44:14.571 --> 01:44:16.940
<v Speaker 4>20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 years of tortured doubt,</v>

2160
01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:20.150
<v Speaker 4>misery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The zen master hitting you over the head</v>

2161
01:44:20.151 --> 01:44:25.151
<v Speaker 4>with that stupid stick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every time he saw that you weren't </v>

2162
01:44:25.151 --> 01:44:25.151
<v Speaker 4>concentrating and then you would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightened.</v>

2163
01:44:25.190 --> 01:44:27.650
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm trying to show you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it's enlightenment,</v>

2164
01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:32.860
<v Speaker 4>which seems like the most material thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could think of requires the same </v>

2165
01:44:34.371 --> 01:44:38.540
<v Speaker 4>process of going through a practice of </v>
<v Speaker 4>having pain,</v>

2166
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:41.630
<v Speaker 4>of having resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of having a teacher tell you that you're</v>

2167
01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:42.920
<v Speaker 4>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're wrong,</v>

2168
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:45.410
<v Speaker 4>hitting you on the head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on and on.</v>

2169
01:44:45.411 --> 01:44:46.870
<v Speaker 4>It's a life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that okay?</v>

2170
01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:49.150
<v Speaker 5>Greatest teacher of all life will hit </v>
<v Speaker 5>you on the head.</v>

2171
01:44:49.151 --> 01:44:51.940
<v Speaker 5>It's sure if you don't have any teacher </v>
<v Speaker 5>with an actual stick,</v>

2172
01:44:51.941 --> 01:44:54.820
<v Speaker 5>you better believe that you know life </v>
<v Speaker 5>itself will handle that.</v>

2173
01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:58.730
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the.</v>

2174
01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:03.820
<v Speaker 4>What I try and say is I'm grounding you </v>
<v Speaker 4>in what the human brain was evolved for </v>

2175
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:08.830
<v Speaker 4>because our brains aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weren't wired for ipods and iphones and </v>

2176
01:45:08.841 --> 01:45:13.841
<v Speaker 4>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were wired over hundreds of </v>

2177
01:45:13.841 --> 01:45:15.350
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of dealing with extremely radical,</v>

2178
01:45:15.351 --> 01:45:18.710
<v Speaker 4>dangerous situations in which it the one</v>
<v Speaker 4>moment,</v>

2179
01:45:18.711 --> 01:45:20.900
<v Speaker 4>if we're not careful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the leopard will come and eat.</v>

2180
01:45:20.901 --> 01:45:25.901
<v Speaker 4>Us and early humans were being eaTen </v>
<v Speaker 4>quite often by large cats.</v>

2181
01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:31.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm very dangerous environment in which </v>
<v Speaker 4>your awareness,</v>

2182
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:36.970
<v Speaker 4>your focus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ability to understand your </v>

2183
01:45:36.970 --> 01:45:37.160
<v Speaker 4>environment as if it were on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>fingertips,</v>

2184
01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:42.340
<v Speaker 4>to know every square foot of that very </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous african savanna that you're </v>

2185
01:45:42.531 --> 01:45:45.200
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the brain was wired for.</v>

2186
01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:48.080
<v Speaker 4>Focus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing something deeply,</v>

2187
01:45:48.081 --> 01:45:53.081
<v Speaker 4>understanding your environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not being distracted here and there and </v>

2188
01:45:53.081 --> 01:45:54.620
<v Speaker 4>looking over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not how the brain was evolved,</v>

2189
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:59.420
<v Speaker 4>so all of these disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from boxing to zen enlightenment,</v>

2190
01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:01.400
<v Speaker 4>to archery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to music,</v>

2191
01:46:01.610 --> 01:46:06.610
<v Speaker 4>to whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all connected with the same </v>

2192
01:46:06.610 --> 01:46:09.490
<v Speaker 4>brain process that we all have to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>through in order to reach this point </v>

2193
01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:12.920
<v Speaker 4>where we've mastered our environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever that might be.</v>

2194
01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:15.990
<v Speaker 5>your work in meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

2195
01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:21.020
<v Speaker 5>what type of may saId zen meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What type of zen meditation do you </v>

2196
01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:21.020
<v Speaker 5>practice?</v>

2197
01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:25.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done mostly renza was called </v>

2198
01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:25.740
<v Speaker 4>rinzai.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's soto and rinzai.</v>

2199
01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:31.320
<v Speaker 4>I used to go to a place where I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>trained and now I do it on my own.</v>

2200
01:46:31.630 --> 01:46:33.220
<v Speaker 4>What's the difference between the two </v>
<v Speaker 4>schools of thought?</v>

2201
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:38.910
<v Speaker 4>One of them is more of a passive process</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you're just sitting there trying </v>

2202
01:46:39.281 --> 01:46:42.820
<v Speaker 4>to completely empty your mind and that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of the easier,</v>

2203
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:47.830
<v Speaker 4>slightly easier path and the concept is </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're able to reach a state where </v>

2204
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 4>you're not thinking at all and you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>your mind,</v>

2205
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:54.780
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment will come to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other school is more active.</v>

2206
01:46:54.810 --> 01:46:56.400
<v Speaker 4>You can't just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just so passive.</v>

2207
01:46:56.401 --> 01:46:58.740
<v Speaker 4>You just can't empty your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to do something else.</v>

2208
01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:01.980
<v Speaker 4>And that something else is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm simplifying it my junior,</v>

2209
01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:07.280
<v Speaker 4>but that's something else is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is more discipline and going through </v>

2210
01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:08.470
<v Speaker 4>learning these various coeds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2211
01:47:08.670 --> 01:47:13.670
<v Speaker 4>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most famous koan is these are </v>

2212
01:47:13.670 --> 01:47:14.910
<v Speaker 4>usually a series of questions they'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>sound of one hand clapping,</v>

2213
01:47:14.911 --> 01:47:18.990
<v Speaker 4>but the one that I've used for years is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The question is,</v>

2214
01:47:18.991 --> 01:47:23.991
<v Speaker 4>does the dog have buddha nature?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer from the zen master is </v>

2215
01:47:23.991 --> 01:47:24.750
<v Speaker 4>move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>move,</v>

2216
01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:28.290
<v Speaker 4>meaning no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it means more than no.</v>

2217
01:47:28.291 --> 01:47:33.291
<v Speaker 4>It means like nothing just nothingness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's the most powerful zen koan ever</v>

2218
01:47:33.991 --> 01:47:38.991
<v Speaker 4>written.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you ever try and think about it </v>

2219
01:47:38.991 --> 01:47:38.991
<v Speaker 4>deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will reach enlightenment.</v>

2220
01:47:38.991 --> 01:47:43.550
<v Speaker 4>The different school of thought is you </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditate on that koann almost like a </v>

2221
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:47.271
<v Speaker 4>mantra and try and figure it out until </v>
<v Speaker 4>it opens up a gate in your head.</v>

2222
01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:53.900
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a simplified version of the two </v>

2223
01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:53.900
<v Speaker 4>different types.</v>

2224
01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:58.060
<v Speaker 5>So the idea being that this preposterous</v>
<v Speaker 5>question becomes sort of a pattern that </v>

2225
01:47:58.911 --> 01:48:03.890
<v Speaker 5>your thoughts go into and you become </v>
<v Speaker 5>empty because there's,</v>

2226
01:48:03.891 --> 01:48:08.891
<v Speaker 5>this pattern becomes you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You say it over and over and over and </v>

2227
01:48:08.891 --> 01:48:09.440
<v Speaker 5>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You recite it.</v>

2228
01:48:09.441 --> 01:48:14.330
<v Speaker 5>You think about it over and over again </v>
<v Speaker 5>until you reach a state of mind,</v>

2229
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:18.590
<v Speaker 4>until you become so absurd that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>words fall off of you.</v>

2230
01:48:18.830 --> 01:48:21.560
<v Speaker 4>Zen is trying to teach you something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's wordless.</v>

2231
01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:26.310
<v Speaker 4>We're so trapped in language and words </v>
<v Speaker 4>and thinking that that's,</v>

2232
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:31.750
<v Speaker 4>it separates us from our natural state </v>
<v Speaker 4>of know of original mind,</v>

2233
01:48:33.141 --> 01:48:36.470
<v Speaker 4>of the nonthinking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that sounds strange idea,</v>

2234
01:48:36.471 --> 01:48:39.950
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so through words,</v>

2235
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:42.950
<v Speaker 4>you're going to realize the absurdity of</v>
<v Speaker 4>words that they're not.</v>

2236
01:48:42.951 --> 01:48:47.951
<v Speaker 4>They're disconnecting you from reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so at that point you realize that </v>

2237
01:48:47.951 --> 01:48:52.361
<v Speaker 4>move means everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's absolutely nothing real in this </v>

2238
01:48:52.911 --> 01:48:55.490
<v Speaker 4>universe that can be encompassed by a </v>
<v Speaker 4>word.</v>

2239
01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:01.120
<v Speaker 4>My talking about it here is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely counterproductive and and </v>

2240
01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:01.880
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous because people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

2241
01:49:01.881 --> 01:49:06.881
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just repeat the word move over and </v>

2242
01:49:06.881 --> 01:49:06.881
<v Speaker 4>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2243
01:49:06.881 --> 01:49:09.911
<v Speaker 4>it takes months of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of thinking very deeply about this is </v>

2244
01:49:09.911 --> 01:49:14.060
<v Speaker 4>trying to cut you off from that chatter </v>
<v Speaker 4>in your head from,</v>

2245
01:49:14.210 --> 01:49:18.680
<v Speaker 4>from thinking constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>linguistically about.</v>

2246
01:49:18.730 --> 01:49:21.950
<v Speaker 4>It's a total physical form of </v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment,</v>

2247
01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:22.560
<v Speaker 4>zen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2248
01:49:22.590 --> 01:49:25.490
<v Speaker 4>it's most physical form of enlightenment</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could reach.</v>

2249
01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:29.500
<v Speaker 5>I keep getting reminded of that bill </v>
<v Speaker 5>bradley story that you told,</v>

2250
01:49:29.630 --> 01:49:34.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and kind of repeating the same thing </v>

2251
01:49:34.630 --> 01:49:36.600
<v Speaker 5>bill bradley was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was a terrible basketball player to </v>

2252
01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:36.600
<v Speaker 5>start big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gangly,</v>

2253
01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:36.600
<v Speaker 5>slow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

2254
01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:38.050
<v Speaker 5>not terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't good,</v>

2255
01:49:38.350 --> 01:49:43.350
<v Speaker 5>but he had the most relentless pursuit </v>
<v Speaker 5>of improvement of anybody that I've ever</v>

2256
01:49:43.481 --> 01:49:45.760
<v Speaker 5>read.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can probably pick up the story,</v>

2257
01:49:45.761 --> 01:49:46.960
<v Speaker 5>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2258
01:49:46.990 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 5>dress,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dribbling the</v>

2259
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.500
<v Speaker 2>ball constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight hours,</v>

2260
01:49:50.501 --> 01:49:52.240
<v Speaker 2>nine hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2261
01:49:52.241 --> 01:49:54.610
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over again.</v>

2262
01:49:54.611 --> 01:49:56.380
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of repetition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2263
01:49:56.381 --> 01:50:01.381
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all part of this same pattern of </v>

2264
01:50:01.381 --> 01:50:01.381
<v Speaker 2>doing the same thing over and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2265
01:50:01.381 --> 01:50:06.210
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad you bring up music is a great </v>

2266
01:50:06.210 --> 01:50:07.591
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of another like freddie roach </v>

2267
01:50:07.591 --> 01:50:07.591
<v Speaker 4>type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You take the skis,</v>

2268
01:50:07.591 --> 01:50:11.080
<v Speaker 4>he's a white guy who happens to be tall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he loves basketball.</v>

2269
01:50:11.410 --> 01:50:16.410
<v Speaker 4>He's like nine years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know this myself because I love </v>

2270
01:50:16.410 --> 01:50:19.441
<v Speaker 4>basketball when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the sound of the ball swishing </v>

2271
01:50:19.441 --> 01:50:19.960
<v Speaker 4>through the net.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just loved that,</v>

2272
01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:22.420
<v Speaker 4>that side of the sound of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the feel of it.</v>

2273
01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:24.730
<v Speaker 4>So we had this sort of visceral love of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the game,</v>

2274
01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:26.980
<v Speaker 4>but he stunk at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was tall,</v>

2275
01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:28.150
<v Speaker 4>awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slow.</v>

2276
01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:33.550
<v Speaker 4>There's no way he'd become good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he decided he was gonna train himself</v>

2277
01:50:33.551 --> 01:50:36.800
<v Speaker 4>from a very early age and I call it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2278
01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:39.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a concept in called deliberate</v>

2279
01:50:39.401 --> 01:50:44.401
<v Speaker 4>practice where you learned to practice </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're not good at because we </v>

2280
01:50:44.401 --> 01:50:49.081
<v Speaker 4>often,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we're taking up archery or </v>

2281
01:50:49.081 --> 01:50:49.081
<v Speaker 4>basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we find something that we're good at and</v>

2282
01:50:49.081 --> 01:50:50.110
<v Speaker 4>we tend to just repeat that.</v>

2283
01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:52.930
<v Speaker 4>And tHen our practice becomes very one </v>
<v Speaker 4>sided,</v>

2284
01:50:54.130 --> 01:50:56.680
<v Speaker 4>deliberate practices to practice on what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not good at.</v>

2285
01:50:56.920 --> 01:51:00.970
<v Speaker 4>I call it resistance practice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually practicing it.</v>

2286
01:51:00.971 --> 01:51:05.560
<v Speaker 4>What is painful in enjoying the pain?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's bill bradley.</v>

2287
01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:10.980
<v Speaker 4>He put these special glasses on his head</v>
<v Speaker 4>that prevented him from looking down so </v>

2288
01:51:12.521 --> 01:51:16.180
<v Speaker 4>he could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would dribble on a court for 10 hours</v>

2289
01:51:16.181 --> 01:51:18.130
<v Speaker 4>or 10 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three or four hours,</v>

2290
01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:21.730
<v Speaker 4>and he couldn't look down at his feet </v>
<v Speaker 4>which trained him to dribble.</v>

2291
01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:23.920
<v Speaker 4>That's the worst thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can have fear always looking down.</v>

2292
01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:26.410
<v Speaker 4>You're not able to see where what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on on the court.</v>

2293
01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:28.030
<v Speaker 4>So he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did that.</v>

2294
01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:33.180
<v Speaker 4>He went on a cruise with his parents </v>
<v Speaker 4>across to england and he didn't.</v>

2295
01:51:33.641 --> 01:51:38.641
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to build a practice there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He brought his basketball and below </v>

2296
01:51:38.641 --> 01:51:42.301
<v Speaker 4>deck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were these incredibly long alleys </v>

2297
01:51:42.301 --> 01:51:43.240
<v Speaker 4>that would go from one end of the shift </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the other that were very narrow.</v>

2298
01:51:43.450 --> 01:51:48.450
<v Speaker 4>He would put on a special glasses and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>would dribble back and forth in this </v>

2299
01:51:48.450 --> 01:51:50.980
<v Speaker 4>narrow area so that he could dribble </v>
<v Speaker 4>with absolute complete control.</v>

2300
01:51:51.190 --> 01:51:56.190
<v Speaker 4>He devised all of these other exercises </v>
<v Speaker 4>where he could train himself to see </v>

2301
01:51:56.770 --> 01:52:01.770
<v Speaker 4>almost behind himself or at least way </v>
<v Speaker 4>over to the side on and on and on until </v>

2302
01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:08.220
<v Speaker 4>he became so good that by the time he </v>
<v Speaker 4>got into college at princeton and then </v>

2303
01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:12.661
<v Speaker 4>later he played for the New York knicks </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the seventies with all the great </v>

2304
01:52:12.661 --> 01:52:13.040
<v Speaker 4>champIonship teams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People would look at bill and they go,</v>

2305
01:52:13.041 --> 01:52:14.860
<v Speaker 4>my god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy is.</v>

2306
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:19.950
<v Speaker 4>He's a born.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was born with a basketball in his </v>

2307
01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:19.950
<v Speaker 4>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's naturally gifted.</v>

2308
01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:22.210
<v Speaker 4>He is so graceful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has eyes in the back of his head.</v>

2309
01:52:22.211 --> 01:52:24.610
<v Speaker 4>He could make a pass to walt frazier </v>
<v Speaker 4>without even looking.</v>

2310
01:52:25.090 --> 01:52:30.090
<v Speaker 4>They didn't realize that he had gone </v>
<v Speaker 4>through the most insanely rigorous,</v>

2311
01:52:30.341 --> 01:52:35.341
<v Speaker 4>painful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deliberate form of practice ever </v>

2312
01:52:35.341 --> 01:52:37.630
<v Speaker 4>invented by a single human athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm at a very early age,</v>

2313
01:52:38.130 --> 01:52:40.450
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it made,</v>

2314
01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:42.250
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>made the game fun for him.</v>

2315
01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:47.340
<v Speaker 4>It was sure it was a lot of pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but by the time got good and he was in </v>

2316
01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:49.160
<v Speaker 4>high school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the girls were admiring him.</v>

2317
01:52:49.490 --> 01:52:51.860
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got invited to go to princeton.</v>

2318
01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:53.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it paid off.</v>

2319
01:52:53.091 --> 01:52:56.990
<v Speaker 4>And he got a huge level of pleasure and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the game became incredibly fun,</v>

2320
01:52:57.260 --> 01:53:02.260
<v Speaker 4>but it was all based on these insane </v>
<v Speaker 4>moments and periods of of pain that he </v>

2321
01:53:02.361 --> 01:53:03.230
<v Speaker 4>put himself through.</v>

2322
01:53:03.550 --> 01:53:06.340
<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that story.</v>

2323
01:53:06.341 --> 01:53:11.341
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's such a huge lesson for young </v>

2324
01:53:11.341 --> 01:53:15.061
<v Speaker 1>people coming up to learn and here to </v>
<v Speaker 1>instill that into your mind and to use </v>

2325
01:53:15.061 --> 01:53:15.400
<v Speaker 1>that as a template.</v>

2326
01:53:15.850 --> 01:53:20.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Particularly nowadays when you're just </v>

2327
01:53:20.850 --> 01:53:24.301
<v Speaker 4>so inundated with immediate pleasures </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so many young people are </v>

2328
01:53:24.301 --> 01:53:25.690
<v Speaker 4>disconnected from what I call,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2329
01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:26.880
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2330
01:53:26.970 --> 01:53:29.290
<v Speaker 4>the pattern that our brains were built </v>
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>

2331
01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:35.070
<v Speaker 4>If you're going against that pattern and</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to get things quickly or </v>

2332
01:53:35.070 --> 01:53:35.140
<v Speaker 4>immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just going to fail.</v>

2333
01:53:35.141 --> 01:53:37.720
<v Speaker 4>You're just going to be a loser in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no you can't.</v>

2334
01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:43.330
<v Speaker 4>You in your short life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't suddenly move against 2 million,</v>

2335
01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:45.370
<v Speaker 4>3 million years of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

2336
01:53:45.371 --> 01:53:46.600
<v Speaker 4>It's just can't be done.</v>

2337
01:53:47.490 --> 01:53:49.140
<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2338
01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:54.000
<v Speaker 1>That's so that what you said is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>important and that story,</v>

2339
01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:59.120
<v Speaker 1>that bill bradley story is such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful story because anyone can do </v>

2340
01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:00.450
<v Speaker 1>that with whatever you're trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2341
01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:02.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just happened to be born tall,</v>

2342
01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:06.240
<v Speaker 4>so if you hadn't ended up being six foot</v>
<v Speaker 4>six or seven and he wouldn't know,</v>

2343
01:54:06.241 --> 01:54:07.100
<v Speaker 4>but that's all.</v>

2344
01:54:07.450 --> 01:54:10.990
<v Speaker 1>What about muggsy bogues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a great bass player.</v>

2345
01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:13.300
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of examples of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2346
01:54:13.330 --> 01:54:14.980
<v Speaker 1>They physically weren't built for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2347
01:54:14.981 --> 01:54:19.981
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson was one of the smallest </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight champions of that modern </v>

2348
01:54:19.981 --> 01:54:19.981
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2349
01:54:19.981 --> 01:54:20.110
<v Speaker 1>he was five foot 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2350
01:54:20.111 --> 01:54:23.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he weighed 215 pounds in his prime look,</v>

2351
01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:28.600
<v Speaker 1>go back to primo carnera who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight champion and the fucking </v>

2352
01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:28.600
<v Speaker 1>twenties or thirties or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell it was.</v>

2353
01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:30.130
<v Speaker 1>He was like 300 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2354
01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:31.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mike tyson's,</v>

2355
01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:33.040
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest heavyweight of all time,</v>

2356
01:54:33.041 --> 01:54:34.870
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't that big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a big guy,</v>

2357
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:36.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

2358
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:38.790
<v Speaker 1>the cool part is that ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2359
01:54:38.850 --> 01:54:41.350
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any master that you meet,</v>

2360
01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:44.560
<v Speaker 1>they're generally a real true pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be around.</v>

2361
01:54:44.650 --> 01:54:49.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they've worked through all of these </v>

2362
01:54:49.650 --> 01:54:49.870
<v Speaker 1>country egoistic attitudes that they may</v>
<v Speaker 1>carry along.</v>

2363
01:54:50.110 --> 01:54:55.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's through this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost overcoming this physical </v>

2364
01:54:55.110 --> 01:54:56.140
<v Speaker 1>resistance in the very heart of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mastery that they're doing.</v>

2365
01:54:56.250 --> 01:54:57.610
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ping pong,</v>

2366
01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:59.410
<v Speaker 1>bowhunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>

2367
01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:01.420
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball,</v>

2368
01:55:01.421 --> 01:55:06.421
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you reach a certain place by pushing </v>

2369
01:55:06.421 --> 01:55:09.601
<v Speaker 1>through that pain and going through </v>
<v Speaker 1>those hours and doing those things that </v>

2370
01:55:09.601 --> 01:55:12.340
<v Speaker 1>almost tempers your spirit as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the main thing that's happening.</v>

2371
01:55:12.341 --> 01:55:17.341
<v Speaker 1>And it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the skill kind of comes along with it </v>

2372
01:55:17.341 --> 01:55:19.711
<v Speaker 1>sometimes been focused on the sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>not though unfortunately sometimes </v>

2373
01:55:19.711 --> 01:55:23.400
<v Speaker 1>focusing on that skill becomes to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>detriment of all other aspects of your </v>

2374
01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:27.481
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are people that achieved </v>

2375
01:55:27.481 --> 01:55:29.341
<v Speaker 1>mastery in very specific things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking total shitheads ty cobb.</v>

2376
01:55:29.650 --> 01:55:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Great example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was famous shithead.</v>

2377
01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:35.110
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people,</v>

2378
01:55:35.111 --> 01:55:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson in his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2379
01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:39.700
<v Speaker 1>went to jail for rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of.</v>

2380
01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:40.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he did it.</v>

2381
01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 1>He says he didn't do it and he's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest pretty much everything else in</v>

2382
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:45.990
<v Speaker 6>his life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the point being,</v>

2383
01:55:46.020 --> 01:55:47.940
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was a wild,</v>

2384
01:55:47.941 --> 01:55:52.941
<v Speaker 6>crazy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that was one of the reasons why he </v>

2385
01:55:52.941 --> 01:55:55.281
<v Speaker 6>was being successful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are very many examples of people </v>

2386
01:55:55.281 --> 01:55:59.301
<v Speaker 6>who become so selective in what they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to do and so obsessed and focused</v>

2387
01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:05.060
<v Speaker 6>to the detriment of personal </v>
<v Speaker 6>relationships to the detriment of their </v>

2388
01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:05.760
<v Speaker 6>own personality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2389
01:56:05.761 --> 01:56:07.370
<v Speaker 6>steve jobs would definitely fall under </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

2390
01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:10.050
<v Speaker 6>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't have to be that way though.</v>

2391
01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:15.180
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't have to be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then I always say I'm even with ty cobb </v>

2392
01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:19.360
<v Speaker 7>or steve jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they were probably miserable to be </v>

2393
01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:22.151
<v Speaker 7>around,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he had a pretty hugely satisfying </v>

2394
01:56:22.151 --> 01:56:22.151
<v Speaker 7>life.</v>

2395
01:56:22.151 --> 01:56:22.720
<v Speaker 6>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know man.</v>

2396
01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:24.430
<v Speaker 6>I don't know that guy now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2397
01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:27.160
<v Speaker 6>I think it kinda goes to your.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Use the bathroom real quick,</v>

2398
01:56:27.161 --> 01:56:32.161
<v Speaker 6>please tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey goes to kind of one of your final </v>

2399
01:56:32.161 --> 01:56:34.801
<v Speaker 6>points which is on that path to mastery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The final level is building bridges back</v>

2400
01:56:35.561 --> 01:56:40.561
<v Speaker 6>to nature,</v>
<v Speaker 6>back to different and making other </v>

2401
01:56:40.561 --> 01:56:40.561
<v Speaker 6>connections.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know.</v>

2402
01:56:40.561 --> 01:56:40.660
<v Speaker 6>So if you stay too focused in that one </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing,</v>

2403
01:56:40.690 --> 01:56:45.220
<v Speaker 6>he never looked to build a bridge to </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything else you can probably result in</v>

2404
01:56:45.221 --> 01:56:45.970
<v Speaker 6>some of these issues.</v>

2405
01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:46.980
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2406
01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:52.020
<v Speaker 7>for those who don't know the book,</v>
<v Speaker 7>essentially I've laid out kind of five </v>

2407
01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:54.460
<v Speaker 7>or six steps towards this ultimate form </v>
<v Speaker 7>of mastery.</v>

2408
01:56:54.730 --> 01:56:59.440
<v Speaker 7>It's like a path and it involves first </v>
<v Speaker 7>discovering who you are,</v>

2409
01:56:59.441 --> 01:57:04.441
<v Speaker 7>what you were meant to do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then going through what I call the </v>

2410
01:57:04.441 --> 01:57:07.660
<v Speaker 7>apprenticeship in which you develop all </v>
<v Speaker 7>of the proper skills later in life.</v>

2411
01:57:08.741 --> 01:57:12.310
<v Speaker 7>You have like a real firm basis for </v>
<v Speaker 7>becoming creative.</v>

2412
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:17.550
<v Speaker 7>And part of that apprenticeship involves</v>
<v Speaker 7>working with mentors and masters and it </v>

2413
01:57:17.801 --> 01:57:22.801
<v Speaker 7>also involves learning how to work with </v>
<v Speaker 7>other people and deal with their </v>

2414
01:57:22.801 --> 01:57:26.491
<v Speaker 7>weirdness and their political games and </v>
<v Speaker 7>then showing you then how you reached </v>

2415
01:57:26.491 --> 01:57:28.390
<v Speaker 7>the creative level and then the mastery </v>
<v Speaker 7>level.</v>

2416
01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:31.960
<v Speaker 7>And it's a loose path.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not like a straight line,</v>

2417
01:57:32.380 --> 01:57:37.380
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm sort of showing you the various </v>

2418
01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:38.860
<v Speaker 7>steps that get you there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And as he poinTs out,</v>

2419
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:42.190
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>particularly nowadays,</v>

2420
01:57:42.260 --> 01:57:47.260
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it involves the kind of a </v>

2421
01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:47.260
<v Speaker 7>well-roundedness.</v>

2422
01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:51.690
<v Speaker 7>You're not just some asperger's guy in </v>
<v Speaker 7>silicon valley who's great at a </v>

2423
01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:56.830
<v Speaker 7>logarithms and creating the ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2424
01:57:56.831 --> 01:58:00.490
<v Speaker 7>facebook or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>you also have to have social skills.</v>

2425
01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:04.390
<v Speaker 7>And I have a whole chapter in mastery of</v>
<v Speaker 7>social intelligence.</v>

2426
01:58:04.750 --> 01:58:06.400
<v Speaker 7>You have to learn how to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>

2427
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:10.930
<v Speaker 7>You have to be socially fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have to know how to be empathetic,</v>

2428
01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:13.420
<v Speaker 7>how to understand what other people's </v>
<v Speaker 7>feelings are,</v>

2429
01:58:13.690 --> 01:58:17.350
<v Speaker 7>how to handle the assholes that will </v>
<v Speaker 7>inevitably cross your path.</v>

2430
01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:22.920
<v Speaker 7>So sort of the people that that joe's </v>
<v Speaker 7>talking about who are a little bit one </v>

2431
01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:27.121
<v Speaker 7>sided,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they've kind of bypassed some of these </v>

2432
01:58:27.121 --> 01:58:29.641
<v Speaker 7>other things that I'm talking about </v>
<v Speaker 7>because I'm trying to get you to that </v>

2433
01:58:29.641 --> 01:58:31.000
<v Speaker 7>well rounded form of mastery,</v>

2434
01:58:31.290 --> 01:58:33.900
<v Speaker 6>which is true mastery mastery over your </v>
<v Speaker 6>whole life,</v>

2435
01:58:33.901 --> 01:58:35.790
<v Speaker 6>not just a specific task.</v>
<v Speaker 6>very much so.</v>

2436
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:38.850
<v Speaker 6>Do you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were talking a lot about meditation.</v>

2437
01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:41.470
<v Speaker 6>Did you ever spend anytime in an </v>
<v Speaker 6>isolation tank?</v>

2438
01:58:41.770 --> 01:58:42.400
<v Speaker 6>I have.</v>

2439
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:47.990
<v Speaker 7>Do you do iT on regular basis?</v>
<v Speaker 7>When I was living in New York years ago </v>

2440
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:52.831
<v Speaker 7>as a journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they asked me to write an article about </v>

2441
01:58:52.831 --> 01:58:56.011
<v Speaker 7>isolation takes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This was when they were just starting </v>

2442
01:58:56.011 --> 01:58:56.011
<v Speaker 7>out early eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were around before that.</v>

2443
01:58:56.011 --> 01:59:00.810
<v Speaker 7>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they became a recreational thing in </v>

2444
01:59:00.810 --> 01:59:00.810
<v Speaker 7>the early eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The yeah,</v>

2445
01:59:00.810 --> 01:59:04.930
<v Speaker 7>they were around as a cia experiment and</v>
<v Speaker 7>the people know john lilly,</v>

2446
01:59:05.110 --> 01:59:06.870
<v Speaker 7>the guy john lilly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

2447
01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:11.880
<v Speaker 7>but for the general public,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it really became like a fad in the early</v>

2448
01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:13.470
<v Speaker 7>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2449
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:18.510
<v Speaker 7>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was asked to cover and I got kinda </v>

2450
01:59:18.510 --> 01:59:19.690
<v Speaker 7>hooked and I did it for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I haven't done it since then,</v>

2451
01:59:19.691 --> 01:59:21.190
<v Speaker 7>but I was quite.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a great experience.</v>

2452
01:59:21.190 --> 01:59:23.510
<v Speaker 1>I think that was because of the movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>altered states.</v>

2453
01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:28.980
<v Speaker 1>When did that movie come out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that was how I found out about </v>

2454
01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:28.990
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

2455
01:59:28.991 --> 01:59:29.720
<v Speaker 1>81.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2456
01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 altered states.</v>

2457
01:59:31.570 --> 01:59:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2458
01:59:33.450 --> 01:59:38.450
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it funny how a movie can just </v>

2459
01:59:38.450 --> 01:59:38.450
<v Speaker 1>start a trend like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2460
01:59:38.450 --> 01:59:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I found out about altered states when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in high school.</v>

2461
01:59:40.331 --> 01:59:43.900
<v Speaker 1>I watched the movie in high school or </v>
<v Speaker 1>right after it came out.</v>

2462
01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I actually saw in junior high because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 80.</v>

2463
01:59:46.751 --> 01:59:48.520
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in high school yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2464
01:59:48.521 --> 01:59:53.320
<v Speaker 1>I got into isolation tanks when I first </v>
<v Speaker 1>came to California because they had them</v>

2465
01:59:53.321 --> 01:59:58.321
<v Speaker 1>here and I never knew that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place where you could get into one and </v>

2466
01:59:58.321 --> 02:00:00.000
<v Speaker 1>through talking about it on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2467
02:00:00.020 --> 02:00:05.020
<v Speaker 1>the entire industry has got this massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>bump now and there's isolation tank </v>

2468
02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:09.421
<v Speaker 1>centers opening up all over the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that credit me talking about it on the </v>

2469
02:00:09.421 --> 02:00:10.660
<v Speaker 1>podcast and youtube videos that I talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

2470
02:00:11.290 --> 02:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I have one of my banks meant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man.</v>

2471
02:00:13.810 --> 02:00:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often do you do it?</v>

2472
02:00:15.490 --> 02:00:17.560
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was in yesterday.</v>

2473
02:00:17.770 --> 02:00:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the most important tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

2474
02:00:19.811 --> 02:00:21.850
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not online day before yesterday.</v>

2475
02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the most important tool </v>

2476
02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:27.520
<v Speaker 1>that I've ever discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often should it?</v>

2477
02:00:28.010 --> 02:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I at least an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think an hour is the right amount of </v>

2478
02:00:33.010 --> 02:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2479
02:00:33.010 --> 02:00:34.440
<v Speaker 7>Is there somebody that wakes you up and </v>
<v Speaker 7>gets you out?</v>

2480
02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a timer.</v>

2481
02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I set a timer if I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes I go in there if I don't </v>

2482
02:00:40.951 --> 02:00:41.280
<v Speaker 1>have</v>

2483
02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:43.940
<v Speaker 7>sense of time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have no idea,</v>

2484
02:00:43.941 --> 02:00:44.870
<v Speaker 7>but an hour is</v>

2485
02:00:46.050 --> 02:00:47.240
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2486
02:00:47.241 --> 02:00:48.130
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2487
02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:53.140
<v Speaker 1>My brain seems to know when to hours is </v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours seems pretty standard for me.</v>

2488
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I don't have any time constraints,</v>

2489
02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>two hours seems to be what I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on whether or not I'm sober or</v>

2490
02:00:59.851 --> 02:01:01.490
<v Speaker 1>not when I go into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never drunk.</v>

2491
02:01:01.491 --> 02:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>But marijuana is usually the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2492
02:01:03.380 --> 02:01:06.620
<v Speaker 1>intoxicant of choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially edible marijuana,</v>

2493
02:01:06.621 --> 02:01:09.860
<v Speaker 1>which provides a much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogenic effect.</v>

2494
02:01:09.950 --> 02:01:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2495
02:01:10.461 --> 02:01:14.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it enhances the experience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychedelic state inside the tank.</v>

2496
02:01:14.151 --> 02:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>You don't freak out or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like figuring out,</v>

2497
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>freaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking out.</v>

2498
02:01:19.141 --> 02:01:24.141
<v Speaker 1>It's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of freaking out because </v>

2499
02:01:24.141 --> 02:01:24.141
<v Speaker 1>then much like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2500
02:01:24.141 --> 02:01:29.121
<v Speaker 1>the stress of exercise or discipline </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the experience of complete </v>

2501
02:01:29.361 --> 02:01:31.900
<v Speaker 1>freaking out you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lessons to be learned.</v>

2502
02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Confront your demons and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2503
02:01:34.431 --> 02:01:37.250
<v Speaker 1>The psychedelic state that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve inside an isolation tank.</v>

2504
02:01:37.251 --> 02:01:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm edible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana is pretty,</v>

2505
02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>pretty</v>

2506
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.360
<v Speaker 6>fucking intense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2507
02:01:41.490 --> 02:01:46.490
<v Speaker 6>But it's just the data environment for </v>
<v Speaker 6>meditation.</v>

2508
02:01:46.730 --> 02:01:51.730
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no better environment ever </v>

2509
02:01:51.730 --> 02:01:51.730
<v Speaker 6>created for meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

2510
02:01:51.730 --> 02:01:51.730
<v Speaker 6>it's the only environment like it on </v>
<v Speaker 6>earth.</v>

2511
02:01:51.890 --> 02:01:53.510
<v Speaker 6>You're a successful man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How come you don't have one of those?</v>

2512
02:01:54.710 --> 02:01:57.320
<v Speaker 7>I don't have a basement,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the basement.</v>

2513
02:01:57.770 --> 02:01:58.580
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

2514
02:01:58.640 --> 02:01:59.570
<v Speaker 7>my girlfriend would want</v>

2515
02:01:59.770 --> 02:02:01.540
<v Speaker 6>edit our hub shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Get a new one.</v>

2516
02:02:02.210 --> 02:02:03.340
<v Speaker 6>New girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Moving on.</v>

2517
02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:07.450
<v Speaker 6>She tried to keep you from having an </v>
<v Speaker 6>isolation tank.</v>

2518
02:02:07.451 --> 02:02:09.010
<v Speaker 6>What's she trying to do to keep you from</v>
<v Speaker 6>enlightenment?</v>

2519
02:02:09.150 --> 02:02:10.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

2520
02:02:10.181 --> 02:02:15.181
<v Speaker 6>I'll try that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Honor the artist talking about your own </v>

2521
02:02:16.691 --> 02:02:21.691
<v Speaker 6>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're violating them right now by </v>

2522
02:02:21.691 --> 02:02:23.731
<v Speaker 6>saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did your girlfriend tell you what kind </v>

2523
02:02:23.731 --> 02:02:23.731
<v Speaker 6>of car you can drive to?</v>

2524
02:02:23.731 --> 02:02:24.020
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2525
02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:26.320
<v Speaker 7>but sometimes you got give in to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>other person.</v>

2526
02:02:26.321 --> 02:02:27.790
<v Speaker 7>You know relationships a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 7>about that.</v>

2527
02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:30.140
<v Speaker 6>Compromise.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not if it's about an isolation tank.</v>

2528
02:02:30.170 --> 02:02:31.160
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're right.</v>

2529
02:02:31.161 --> 02:02:32.690
<v Speaker 6>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>and no fucking reason.</v>

2530
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:37.990
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm beating you over the head with your </v>

2531
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:37.990
<v Speaker 6>own work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's all right.</v>

2532
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:37.990
<v Speaker 6>Everybody does that.</v>

2533
02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:44.860
<v Speaker 7>But zen meditation is sort of like the </v>
<v Speaker 7>the isolation because the point of it </v>

2534
02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:48.851
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is to cut off all stimuli and you're </v>

2535
02:02:48.851 --> 02:02:52.151
<v Speaker 7>not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to rely on this </v>

2536
02:02:52.151 --> 02:02:52.151
<v Speaker 7>environment that you're putting yourself</v>
<v Speaker 7>into.</v>

2537
02:02:52.151 --> 02:02:56.270
<v Speaker 7>So your eyes are open when you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>meditating,</v>

2538
02:02:57.290 --> 02:03:02.290
<v Speaker 7>but you're not looking at anything and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're not getting in any stimuli at </v>

2539
02:03:02.290 --> 02:03:03.980
<v Speaker 7>all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you're not hearing anything.</v>

2540
02:03:03.981 --> 02:03:08.981
<v Speaker 7>I mean there can be sounds outside,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you're not paying attention to them </v>

2541
02:03:08.981 --> 02:03:12.320
<v Speaker 7>and you enter the state that's similar </v>
<v Speaker 7>to what the isolation take is.</v>

2542
02:03:12.321 --> 02:03:17.321
<v Speaker 7>I can enter a state like the isolation </v>
<v Speaker 7>tank without the isolation tank because </v>

2543
02:03:17.321 --> 02:03:21.911
<v Speaker 7>I cut off all stimuli and I enter my own</v>
<v Speaker 7>mental space and incredible things can </v>

2544
02:03:21.911 --> 02:03:22.770
<v Speaker 7>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you just,</v>

2545
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:26.160
<v Speaker 6>nor the stimuli until the point where </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not reaching the mind,</v>

2546
02:03:26.161 --> 02:03:27.200
<v Speaker 6>is that the idea behind it</v>

2547
02:03:27.580 --> 02:03:32.580
<v Speaker 7>training it's years of meditation where </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're not good at it and still to this </v>

2548
02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:33.520
<v Speaker 7>day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>thoughts invade your head,</v>

2549
02:03:33.550 --> 02:03:36.460
<v Speaker 7>which probably don't so much.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well they do when you're In an isolation</v>

2550
02:03:36.461 --> 02:03:37.990
<v Speaker 7>tank of course to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2551
02:03:38.530 --> 02:03:40.710
<v Speaker 7>but if you go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2552
02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:45.880
<v Speaker 7>it's called samadhi and somadi is a </v>
<v Speaker 7>state where your samadhi tanks.</v>

2553
02:03:46.190 --> 02:03:46.720
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2554
02:03:46.721 --> 02:03:48.430
<v Speaker 7>that's the name of the company,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2555
02:03:48.431 --> 02:03:49.630
<v Speaker 7>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember tanks.</v>

2556
02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:51.160
<v Speaker 7>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2557
02:03:51.161 --> 02:03:56.110
<v Speaker 7>somebody is a kind of mindless state or </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not exactly the word,</v>

2558
02:03:56.111 --> 02:03:58.270
<v Speaker 7>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>

2559
02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:02.650
<v Speaker 7>there's no thinking going on and it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>just incredibly euphoric.</v>

2560
02:04:03.250 --> 02:04:08.250
<v Speaker 7>You could reach that through medItation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it maybe after 20 minutes or 25 </v>

2561
02:04:08.250 --> 02:04:11.920
<v Speaker 7>minutes you get to that state,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you're cutting off all stimuli</v>

2562
02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:17.900
<v Speaker 2>and the reasons they founded yoga was to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it so that there was less stimuli </v>

2563
02:04:17.900 --> 02:04:20.390
<v Speaker 2>coming from your seated ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2564
02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:25.400
<v Speaker 2>and the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that your legs were folded when </v>

2565
02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:28.041
<v Speaker 2>you're meditating because all of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>noise that an isolation tank filters </v>

2566
02:04:28.041 --> 02:04:28.041
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I love,</v>

2567
02:04:28.041 --> 02:04:29.670
<v Speaker 2>I love the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's most effective for me.</v>

2568
02:04:29.671 --> 02:04:34.671
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would do yoga so that they could </v>

2569
02:04:34.671 --> 02:04:36.120
<v Speaker 2>sit in that pose and have less of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stimuli yelling for longer so they could</v>

2570
02:04:36.121 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 2>reach those in which they</v>

2571
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:43.070
<v Speaker 6>could find that wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So personally find that yoga releases </v>

2572
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:44.600
<v Speaker 6>some form psychedelic chemicals in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>mind that it's,</v>

2573
02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:49.610
<v Speaker 6>its own practice and gotten high,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like legitimately high from yoga to the </v>

2574
02:04:49.610 --> 02:04:53.721
<v Speaker 6>point where uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not I don't want to say intoxicated </v>

2575
02:04:53.721 --> 02:04:53.721
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2576
02:04:53.721 --> 02:04:58.310
<v Speaker 6>like diminished in some way or affected </v>
<v Speaker 6>like I can't form sentences or anything </v>

2577
02:04:58.310 --> 02:05:03.171
<v Speaker 6>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like I feel like a chemical effect </v>

2578
02:05:03.450 --> 02:05:07.650
<v Speaker 6>or a biological effect,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some sort of a real tangible effect from</v>

2579
02:05:07.651 --> 02:05:10.800
<v Speaker 6>yoga definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which I have always wondered.</v>

2580
02:05:10.801 --> 02:05:15.801
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my thought process was why would these </v>

2581
02:05:15.801 --> 02:05:15.801
<v Speaker 6>people do all this for so long?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what,</v>

2582
02:05:15.870 --> 02:05:20.870
<v Speaker 6>why would they have this practice for </v>
<v Speaker 6>thousands of years unless there was </v>

2583
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:21.120
<v Speaker 6>something to it and there's something to</v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2584
02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:26.800
<v Speaker 7>I do a lot of swimming and I find </v>
<v Speaker 7>swimming the x absolute ultimate form of</v>

2585
02:05:27.401 --> 02:05:31.090
<v Speaker 7>exercise because there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's no stimuli.</v>

2586
02:05:31.730 --> 02:05:36.730
<v Speaker 7>I mean You're not sitting there thinking</v>
<v Speaker 7>about the water anymore and your brain </v>

2587
02:05:36.730 --> 02:05:38.380
<v Speaker 7>just zones out and after you do long </v>
<v Speaker 7>distance swimming,</v>

2588
02:05:38.381 --> 02:05:41.470
<v Speaker 7>you can reach very interesting alpha </v>
<v Speaker 7>states.</v>

2589
02:05:41.650 --> 02:05:42.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I agree.</v>

2590
02:05:42.431 --> 02:05:47.431
<v Speaker 6>I find it incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not just beautiful in that sense </v>

2591
02:05:47.441 --> 02:05:51.550
<v Speaker 6>where you achieve states,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's really taxing.</v>

2592
02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:57.270
<v Speaker 6>it's really hard to swim like most </v>
<v Speaker 6>people think of swimming is like </v>

2593
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.820
<v Speaker 6>recreational activity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I do a lot of swimming with my kids</v>

2594
02:05:57.821 --> 02:06:01.540
<v Speaker 6>and we play around,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when I do laps like fuck.</v>

2595
02:06:01.541 --> 02:06:02.830
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2596
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:04.360
<v Speaker 6>swimming is hard to do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2597
02:06:04.361 --> 02:06:05.890
<v Speaker 6>You look at it dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Michael Phelps.</v>

2598
02:06:06.370 --> 02:06:11.370
<v Speaker 6>That's a bad man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That guy has achieved this incredible </v>

2599
02:06:11.370 --> 02:06:13.240
<v Speaker 6>ability to move through the water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like a fucking fish.</v>

2600
02:06:13.810 --> 02:06:18.810
<v Speaker 6>That's not an easy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is a real legit difficult </v>

2601
02:06:18.810 --> 02:06:18.810
<v Speaker 6>accomplishment.</v>

2602
02:06:18.810 --> 02:06:20.600
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I like the pain,</v>

2603
02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:25.660
<v Speaker 7>the mental pain involved in swimming </v>
<v Speaker 7>because I like to swim long distances </v>

2604
02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:26.510
<v Speaker 7>where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just can't do this anymore.</v>

2605
02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:31.900
<v Speaker 7>It's so boring and it's so painful and </v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just going to drown.</v>

2606
02:06:32.271 --> 02:06:33.830
<v Speaker 7>I kept.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm taking whatever,</v>

2607
02:06:33.831 --> 02:06:37.550
<v Speaker 7>and then you just push past that and you</v>
<v Speaker 7>swim two miles and you get out.</v>

2608
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:38.840
<v Speaker 7>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What a great feeling.</v>

2609
02:06:39.450 --> 02:06:42.030
<v Speaker 6>Do laps in the pool over and over and </v>
<v Speaker 6>over again.</v>

2610
02:06:42.650 --> 02:06:44.490
<v Speaker 6>You're not one of those crazy fox.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It gets in the ocean.</v>

2611
02:06:44.491 --> 02:06:44.760
<v Speaker 6>Are you?</v>

2612
02:06:45.500 --> 02:06:50.500
<v Speaker 7>I would love to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I live close to the ocean and it's </v>

2613
02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:54.170
<v Speaker 7>cold and polluted.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If I lived in Hawaii,</v>

2614
02:06:54.171 --> 02:06:59.171
<v Speaker 7>I'd be swimming in the ocean and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>they get radioactive shit come from </v>

2615
02:06:59.171 --> 02:07:01.250
<v Speaker 7>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Says if I lived in the yucatan,</v>

2616
02:07:01.251 --> 02:07:01.370
<v Speaker 7>I'd.</v>

2617
02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:02.920
<v Speaker 6>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there you go.</v>

2618
02:07:03.130 --> 02:07:04.480
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the spot.</v>

2619
02:07:05.330 --> 02:07:10.330
<v Speaker 6>Long ocean swims moved to the uk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is a beautiful patch of water </v>

2620
02:07:10.330 --> 02:07:10.330
<v Speaker 6>though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>

2621
02:07:10.330 --> 02:07:11.760
<v Speaker 6>to loom you ever been into loom?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2622
02:07:11.770 --> 02:07:14.290
<v Speaker 6>I've been to teach an eatsa chinita.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2623
02:07:14.510 --> 02:07:15.530
<v Speaker 6>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2624
02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:16.540
<v Speaker 6>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2625
02:07:16.541 --> 02:07:18.320
<v Speaker 6>that's freaky spot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2626
02:07:18.580 --> 02:07:22.780
<v Speaker 6>being around those ancient ruins is one </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the most bizarre moments I think I've</v>

2627
02:07:22.781 --> 02:07:27.781
<v Speaker 6>ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just walking around knowing that people </v>

2628
02:07:27.781 --> 02:07:30.421
<v Speaker 6>were playing football with human heads </v>
<v Speaker 6>where I was standing scant 1500 plus </v>

2629
02:07:31.151 --> 02:07:33.030
<v Speaker 6>years ago or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2630
02:07:33.670 --> 02:07:35.000
<v Speaker 6>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2631
02:07:35.050 --> 02:07:37.480
<v Speaker 6>these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these altered states that,</v>

2632
02:07:37.481 --> 02:07:39.610
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you achieve with zen meditation,</v>

2633
02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:42.250
<v Speaker 6>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you find them to be psychedelic?</v>

2634
02:07:42.251 --> 02:07:44.800
<v Speaker 6>Do you find like that you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>hallucinate,</v>

2635
02:07:44.860 --> 02:07:45.280
<v Speaker 6>do you?</v>

2636
02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:46.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2637
02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:48.880
<v Speaker 4>you're not supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the goal.</v>

2638
02:07:49.180 --> 02:07:53.140
<v Speaker 4>They have this word called,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means a demon.</v>

2639
02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:56.150
<v Speaker 4>And what it means is after a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>point in,</v>

2640
02:07:56.151 --> 02:08:01.151
<v Speaker 4>in meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>demons start appearing in your brain </v>

2641
02:08:01.151 --> 02:08:05.460
<v Speaker 4>where you've cut out all sensory stimuli</v>
<v Speaker 4>and suddenly images start coming up that</v>

2642
02:08:07.061 --> 02:08:09.820
<v Speaker 4>are just weird and random and somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 4>frightening.</v>

2643
02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:10.990
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

2644
02:08:10.991 --> 02:08:14.980
<v Speaker 4>that happens to me all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a almost or like in a dream state,</v>

2645
02:08:14.981 --> 02:08:19.981
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how in dreams their thoughts and images </v>

2646
02:08:19.981 --> 02:08:21.730
<v Speaker 4>that it seems so random and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 4>scary by how random they are.</v>

2647
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:26.910
<v Speaker 4>You're consciously getting that in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>head as you're entering deeper and </v>

2648
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:29.440
<v Speaker 4>deeper into this state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're trying to push past that.</v>

2649
02:08:29.441 --> 02:08:33.790
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to push to the state where</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing coming in at all and you</v>

2650
02:08:33.791 --> 02:08:38.791
<v Speaker 4>kind of transcend the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this sort of thinking state that you're </v>

2651
02:08:39.431 --> 02:08:42.010
<v Speaker 4>constantly in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't really put it in words.</v>

2652
02:08:42.011 --> 02:08:43.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't even want to try and put it in </v>
<v Speaker 4>words.</v>

2653
02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:48.790
<v Speaker 4>So the goal isn't really to have these </v>
<v Speaker 4>vivid hallucinations,</v>

2654
02:08:48.791 --> 02:08:51.010
<v Speaker 4>but they happen and they're very </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

2655
02:08:51.070 --> 02:08:53.850
<v Speaker 6>That's fascinating though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that it's thought to be demons.</v>

2656
02:08:54.300 --> 02:08:58.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in the traditional zen form,</v>

2657
02:08:58.321 --> 02:08:59.640
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they call them.</v>

2658
02:08:59.970 --> 02:09:02.670
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2659
02:09:03.180 --> 02:09:05.120
<v Speaker 4>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2660
02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:10.520
<v Speaker 4>they have in japanese iconography these </v>
<v Speaker 4>very frightening looking demon like </v>

2661
02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:13.290
<v Speaker 4>figures and then they do actually have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>concept of hell,</v>

2662
02:09:13.730 --> 02:09:14.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2663
02:09:14.460 --> 02:09:19.460
<v Speaker 4>in japanese culture that came into zen </v>
<v Speaker 4>buddhism and I know hakuin talks about </v>

2664
02:09:20.610 --> 02:09:25.610
<v Speaker 4>these very vivid images of demons that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he had when he was a child that he was </v>

2665
02:09:25.681 --> 02:09:29.790
<v Speaker 4>so afraid of them that he decided he had</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get into buddhism and zen to overcome</v>

2666
02:09:29.791 --> 02:09:32.400
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know exactly.</v>

2667
02:09:32.401 --> 02:09:37.401
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to be hallucinating these </v>
<v Speaker 4>japanese demons that were probably very </v>

2668
02:09:37.401 --> 02:09:38.790
<v Speaker 4>much in their minds and in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>

2669
02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:40.680
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if,</v>

2670
02:09:41.310 --> 02:09:42.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting.</v>

2671
02:09:42.511 --> 02:09:47.511
<v Speaker 4>This is a total,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how far we're getting away </v>

2672
02:09:47.511 --> 02:09:47.511
<v Speaker 4>from things here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's no getting away.</v>

2673
02:09:47.511 --> 02:09:50.360
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is concept in ancient times.</v>

2674
02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:52.710
<v Speaker 4>So there's a great book called the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bicameral mind.</v>

2675
02:09:52.711 --> 02:09:54.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you're familiar with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never read it though.</v>

2676
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:57.600
<v Speaker 4>The ideal is in this book is that for </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancient people,</v>

2677
02:09:57.870 --> 02:10:02.870
<v Speaker 4>consciousness was almost like a voice in</v>
<v Speaker 4>their head and it flipped them out and </v>

2678
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:05.640
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't understand it and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were constantly like on drugs.</v>

2679
02:10:05.790 --> 02:10:10.260
<v Speaker 4>Hearing their own thoughts and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>why they had to project it onto gods and</v>

2680
02:10:10.261 --> 02:10:12.660
<v Speaker 4>demons and other things that are out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there in the world,</v>

2681
02:10:12.810 --> 02:10:17.810
<v Speaker 4>but literally hearing their own thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 4>was almost like a continual trip for </v>

2682
02:10:18.721 --> 02:10:23.721
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard for us to imagine because </v>

2683
02:10:23.721 --> 02:10:23.721
<v Speaker 4>we're so used to the chatter in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>minds,</v>

2684
02:10:23.721 --> 02:10:24.600
<v Speaker 4>but originally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>according to this man,</v>

2685
02:10:25.650 --> 02:10:30.650
<v Speaker 4>this was how they experienced </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness with this in the early </v>

2686
02:10:30.650 --> 02:10:31.870
<v Speaker 4>days of language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this a</v>

2687
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:34.250
<v Speaker 6>fairly recent?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that was the idea</v>

2688
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:38.180
<v Speaker 4>behind it is 6,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>7,000,</v>

2689
02:10:38.181 --> 02:10:39.350
<v Speaker 4>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>bc.</v>

2690
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:42.140
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember the writer's name.</v>

2691
02:10:42.150 --> 02:10:44.720
<v Speaker 4>Julian something or his last name is </v>
<v Speaker 4>julian.</v>

2692
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:46.390
<v Speaker 4>Great book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2693
02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:50.540
<v Speaker 4>but if you read books like about </v>
<v Speaker 4>buddhism,</v>

2694
02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:52.520
<v Speaker 4>which I do for racially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2695
02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:54.010
<v Speaker 4>the history of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2696
02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:57.170
<v Speaker 4>early people in meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early adherence to buddhism,</v>

2697
02:10:57.171 --> 02:11:02.171
<v Speaker 4>we're constantly talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 4>chatter in their mind as if it were </v>

2698
02:11:02.171 --> 02:11:05.411
<v Speaker 4>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like hearing this noise of </v>

2699
02:11:05.411 --> 02:11:08.681
<v Speaker 4>thoughts was just awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was claustrophobic and frightening </v>

2700
02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:14.920
<v Speaker 4>and they had to get into meditation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>buddhism just to calm the mind down and </v>

2701
02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:16.220
<v Speaker 4>not hear that voice in their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2702
02:11:16.221 --> 02:11:21.221
<v Speaker 4>this is a totally alien notion to us </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we're so used to it and it's </v>

2703
02:11:21.221 --> 02:11:22.640
<v Speaker 4>almost not a good thing that we're so </v>
<v Speaker 4>used to it.</v>

2704
02:11:23.070 --> 02:11:24.980
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that that's sort of the idea</v>

2705
02:11:24.981 --> 02:11:28.460
<v Speaker 4>of the demons constantly hearing this </v>
<v Speaker 4>voice,</v>

2706
02:11:28.461 --> 02:11:32.270
<v Speaker 4>these things in your head that aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not willing them,</v>

2707
02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:38.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're not willing these thoughts </v>

2708
02:11:38.260 --> 02:11:38.260
<v Speaker 4>that are constantly coming up into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>

2709
02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:42.620
<v Speaker 4>Where are they coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a great zen cohen called,</v>

2710
02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:46.610
<v Speaker 4>who is the master?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where are your thoughts coming from?</v>

2711
02:11:46.611 --> 02:11:49.520
<v Speaker 4>Who is the master calling up these </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts in your head,</v>

2712
02:11:49.521 --> 02:11:52.280
<v Speaker 4>particularly in your dreams or </v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly when you're not,</v>

2713
02:11:52.730 --> 02:11:56.060
<v Speaker 4>when you're maybe tired and suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 4>this image comes up,</v>

2714
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:57.470
<v Speaker 4>you're not calling it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2715
02:11:57.471 --> 02:12:00.920
<v Speaker 4>where is it coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where I think this idea of demons</v>

2716
02:12:00.921 --> 02:12:01.940
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is connected.</v>

2717
02:12:01.941 --> 02:12:06.880
<v Speaker 4>This reminds me a lot of going through a</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic experience like iowasca in,</v>

2718
02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:11.920
<v Speaker 4>in that path,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you reach this very visual point in the </v>

2719
02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:12.830
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is generally,</v>

2720
02:12:12.831 --> 02:12:16.730
<v Speaker 4>it can either be incredibly beautiful or</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can be incredibly hellish.</v>

2721
02:12:16.810 --> 02:12:20.270
<v Speaker 4>Like would make well incredibly hellish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

2722
02:12:20.271 --> 02:12:20.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2723
02:12:21.410 --> 02:12:26.410
<v Speaker 4>I have different spiders going inside of</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and laying eggs and exploding and </v>

2724
02:12:26.410 --> 02:12:28.490
<v Speaker 4>bugs are coming out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's eels coming inside,</v>

2725
02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:32.270
<v Speaker 4>eating through my intestines and eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>all my organs coming out.</v>

2726
02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:35.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm sliding naked through a va,</v>
<v Speaker 4>down a vine of thorns.</v>

2727
02:12:35.691 --> 02:12:40.691
<v Speaker 4>It's ripping up my flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are all images that happened in </v>

2728
02:12:40.691 --> 02:12:44.330
<v Speaker 4>moscow trip or incredibly beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most beautiful colors you've ever </v>

2729
02:12:44.330 --> 02:12:44.600
<v Speaker 4>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The most beautiful lights,</v>

2730
02:12:44.630 --> 02:12:46.730
<v Speaker 4>images,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things and you know,</v>

2731
02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:50.990
<v Speaker 4>I get a lot of people asking me about </v>
<v Speaker 4>these trips and for them that is,</v>

2732
02:12:51.590 --> 02:12:53.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who haven't done it very much.</v>

2733
02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:58.660
<v Speaker 4>They focus very much on those visions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but those visions are almost like the </v>

2734
02:12:58.660 --> 02:13:02.270
<v Speaker 4>fireworks and the chatter to what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to come after and what comes after</v>

2735
02:13:02.271 --> 02:13:05.390
<v Speaker 4>is this kind of oneness with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts and your,</v>

2736
02:13:05.630 --> 02:13:10.630
<v Speaker 4>your highest consciousness in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>highest being that has passed all that </v>

2737
02:13:10.630 --> 02:13:12.920
<v Speaker 4>and maybe that brings up resistances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things you can overcome.</v>

2738
02:13:12.921 --> 02:13:16.420
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it helps you with some thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the real value of it in Iowa,</v>

2739
02:13:16.421 --> 02:13:21.380
<v Speaker 4>oscar dmt or any kind of psychedelic is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that period after were these demons,</v>

2740
02:13:21.381 --> 02:13:26.381
<v Speaker 4>are these visions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everything goes away and to me </v>

2741
02:13:26.381 --> 02:13:26.381
<v Speaker 4>that's the real end goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the real gem.</v>

2742
02:13:26.381 --> 02:13:29.690
<v Speaker 4>Well that's really similar to the zen </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditation because you're going through.</v>

2743
02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 4>So I meditate for 35,</v>

2744
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:34.560
<v Speaker 7>40 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the first 25,</v>

2745
02:13:35.050 --> 02:13:37.140
<v Speaker 7>I'm having those demons.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm hearing my thoughts.</v>

2746
02:13:37.141 --> 02:13:42.141
<v Speaker 7>I'm trying to get over.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then I finally reached that state </v>

2747
02:13:42.141 --> 02:13:43.140
<v Speaker 7>only lasts for 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the best state.</v>

2748
02:13:43.141 --> 02:13:45.270
<v Speaker 7>It also sent a similar process.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's it.</v>

2749
02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:47.940
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's not so much about the visions,</v>

2750
02:13:47.941 --> 02:13:49.950
<v Speaker 7>it's about what happens after the </v>
<v Speaker 7>vision.</v>

2751
02:13:49.951 --> 02:13:51.750
<v Speaker 7>So it seems to me very much like what </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're saying.</v>

2752
02:13:52.450 --> 02:13:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the that state after very difficult yoga</v>

2753
02:13:55.181 --> 02:13:57.820
<v Speaker 1>sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't last very long,</v>

2754
02:13:57.821 --> 02:14:02.821
<v Speaker 1>but there's a period of intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxation and enlightenment that you </v>

2755
02:14:03.161 --> 02:14:06.280
<v Speaker 1>achieve where you kind of have a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of things,</v>

2756
02:14:06.281 --> 02:14:09.940
<v Speaker 1>but it only comes through this very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult work of the hour and a half of</v>

2757
02:14:09.941 --> 02:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>yoga that you have to do to get to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>

2758
02:14:12.430 --> 02:14:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And if you have acid anywhere along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2759
02:14:14.381 --> 02:14:17.500
<v Speaker 1>you don't reach that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't reach that spot every time.</v>

2760
02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:19.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reached it a lot,</v>

2761
02:14:19.151 --> 02:14:21.790
<v Speaker 1>but I don't reach it every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very tricky,</v>

2762
02:14:21.791 --> 02:14:22.210
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2763
02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:24.540
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You'd ever know and they're like,</v>

2764
02:14:25.170 --> 02:14:30.170
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if it's the same with </v>
<v Speaker 7>archery or the things that you do like </v>

2765
02:14:30.170 --> 02:14:33.021
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but when you start the meditation you </v>

2766
02:14:33.021 --> 02:14:35.160
<v Speaker 7>bring a mood and it's never the same </v>
<v Speaker 7>sunday for no reason.</v>

2767
02:14:35.550 --> 02:14:40.550
<v Speaker 7>I just falls into place and some days </v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't know why this anxiety is not </v>

2768
02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:46.100
<v Speaker 7>on your inside.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You never could figure out what you </v>

2769
02:14:46.100 --> 02:14:46.100
<v Speaker 7>bring to it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's interesting.</v>

2770
02:14:46.100 --> 02:14:50.290
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you have a very rigid schedule </v>

2771
02:14:50.691 --> 02:14:53.510
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to your meditation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your discipline?</v>

2772
02:14:53.511 --> 02:14:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you structure your days?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're obviously self employed,</v>

2773
02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:00.350
<v Speaker 1>you know you're a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you.</v>

2774
02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a structure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I must write for this amount of </v>

2775
02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:05.400
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must meditate.</v>

2776
02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you do it?</v>

2777
02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:07.770
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I every morning I wake up and I meditate</v>

2778
02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:13.220
<v Speaker 7>for 35 minutes and nothing will stop me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sick.</v>

2779
02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:17.360
<v Speaker 7>Or even if I'm traveling or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 7>every day.</v>

2780
02:15:18.050 --> 02:15:23.050
<v Speaker 7>Do you sit in a particular way?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have the proper pillows and I have a </v>

2781
02:15:24.151 --> 02:15:29.151
<v Speaker 7>little place and I have a little clock </v>
<v Speaker 7>that goes off with bells and I sit in </v>

2782
02:15:29.151 --> 02:15:32.400
<v Speaker 7>the lotus position until my legs are </v>
<v Speaker 7>like screaming</v>

2783
02:15:32.460 --> 02:15:34.050
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can pull your legs up.</v>

2784
02:15:35.300 --> 02:15:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do,</v>

2785
02:15:36.271 --> 02:15:36.460
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

2786
02:15:37.170 --> 02:15:38.170
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've been doing it for many,</v>

2787
02:15:38.171 --> 02:15:43.171
<v Speaker 7>many years,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then I recently broke my foot and I </v>

2788
02:15:43.171 --> 02:15:44.530
<v Speaker 7>couldn't do it for about three months,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so now I'm fine and I can do it.</v>

2789
02:15:44.710 --> 02:15:47.310
<v Speaker 7>So I'm back to having some pain again.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2790
02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:49.870
<v Speaker 7>but the pain is good as we all know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2791
02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:51.100
<v Speaker 7>and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2792
02:15:51.101 --> 02:15:54.070
<v Speaker 7>then I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not usually writing because my books</v>

2793
02:15:54.071 --> 02:15:56.440
<v Speaker 7>require so much research.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2794
02:15:56.441 --> 02:16:01.030
<v Speaker 7>so right now I'm in a research period </v>
<v Speaker 7>where I'm reading for racial sleep books</v>

2795
02:16:01.031 --> 02:16:02.890
<v Speaker 7>about human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 7>psychology,</v>

2796
02:16:02.900 --> 02:16:07.900
<v Speaker 7>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then in Nevada year I'm going to </v>

2797
02:16:07.900 --> 02:16:09.710
<v Speaker 7>start writing and then I go onto a kind </v>
<v Speaker 7>of a different routine where I'm a,</v>

2798
02:16:09.711 --> 02:16:12.550
<v Speaker 7>I'm a little more crazed and hard to be </v>
<v Speaker 7>around.</v>

2799
02:16:13.070 --> 02:16:16.310
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you researched for a full year before</v>

2800
02:16:16.311 --> 02:16:16.580
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2801
02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You discipline the research aspect of </v>

2802
02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:21.920
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2803
02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:21.920
<v Speaker 7>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm so disciplined.</v>

2804
02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:26.020
<v Speaker 7>It's probably bordering on ocd.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I read,</v>

2805
02:16:26.070 --> 02:16:27.250
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>three,</v>

2806
02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:29.560
<v Speaker 7>400 books and I read them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't them.</v>

2807
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:35.100
<v Speaker 7>And then I go back and I do these note </v>
<v Speaker 7>cards and it's the note cards that's </v>

2808
02:16:35.100 --> 02:16:35.890
<v Speaker 7>excruciating.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's like the bill bradley part.</v>

2809
02:16:36.220 --> 02:16:39.610
<v Speaker 7>I put every book onto maybe 10,</v>
<v Speaker 7>20,</v>

2810
02:16:39.611 --> 02:16:41.800
<v Speaker 7>30 cards depending on how good a book it</v>
<v Speaker 7>is.</v>

2811
02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:47.160
<v Speaker 7>And at the end I'll have two,</v>
<v Speaker 7>3000 cards and I can written handwritten</v>

2812
02:16:47.620 --> 02:16:51.670
<v Speaker 7>and I can take these cards and move them</v>
<v Speaker 7>around and in the book is created out of</v>

2813
02:16:51.671 --> 02:16:52.300
<v Speaker 7>the cards.</v>

2814
02:16:52.670 --> 02:16:57.670
<v Speaker 6>So the cards are the beneficial aspects </v>
<v Speaker 6>of whatever book you're reading or what </v>

2815
02:16:57.670 --> 02:16:58.340
<v Speaker 6>strikes you or.</v>

2816
02:16:58.470 --> 02:17:01.500
<v Speaker 7>But I'm able to break a book down that </v>
<v Speaker 7>can be chaotic.</v>

2817
02:17:01.501 --> 02:17:04.080
<v Speaker 7>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for this new book,</v>

2818
02:17:04.380 --> 02:17:06.480
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have it a love a niche,</v>

2819
02:17:06.500 --> 02:17:08.460
<v Speaker 7>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've never loved them since I was a kid.</v>

2820
02:17:08.550 --> 02:17:11.940
<v Speaker 7>Uber manch the uber manch.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is a book about the uber match.</v>

2821
02:17:11.941 --> 02:17:16.941
<v Speaker 7>My next book,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and there's a book that I've read for </v>

2822
02:17:16.941 --> 02:17:16.941
<v Speaker 7>him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2823
02:17:16.941 --> 02:17:19.710
<v Speaker 7>early book called human all too human.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's just the most amazing book,</v>

2824
02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:22.650
<v Speaker 7>but it's chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's all over the place.</v>

2825
02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:27.680
<v Speaker 7>He's got all these aphorisms and these </v>
<v Speaker 7>thoughts and it's just like entering a </v>

2826
02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:32.040
<v Speaker 7>rat's maze.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I with my cards can organize all of his </v>

2827
02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:36.441
<v Speaker 7>ideas and all of his thoughts and bring </v>
<v Speaker 7>some order and show you the amazing </v>

2828
02:17:36.750 --> 02:17:41.220
<v Speaker 7>pearls of wisdom this guy has gleaned </v>
<v Speaker 7>out of his mad syphilitic brain.</v>

2829
02:17:41.660 --> 02:17:43.020
<v Speaker 7>The syphilis.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

2830
02:17:43.021 --> 02:17:43.420
<v Speaker 7>He,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

2831
02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:48.440
<v Speaker 7>He went mad at the age of like 44 and </v>
<v Speaker 7>the best spent his last eight years and </v>

2832
02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:49.590
<v Speaker 7>basically too much pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>huh?</v>

2833
02:17:50.100 --> 02:17:51.390
<v Speaker 7>no crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2834
02:17:51.690 --> 02:17:54.300
<v Speaker 7>he probably not enough pussy really?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you got syphilis.</v>

2835
02:17:54.301 --> 02:17:55.620
<v Speaker 7>Pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He got.</v>

2836
02:17:55.650 --> 02:18:00.650
<v Speaker 7>He probably went to a prostitute when he</v>
<v Speaker 7>was in the prussian war and then got </v>

2837
02:18:00.650 --> 02:18:01.530
<v Speaker 7>syphilis and then he.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He didn't get laid enough.</v>

2838
02:18:01.531 --> 02:18:05.160
<v Speaker 7>I was certainly probably his problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was why he was obsessed with uber.</v>

2839
02:18:05.161 --> 02:18:09.300
<v Speaker 7>Manch a syphilis.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's probably why he got.</v>

2840
02:18:10.030 --> 02:18:12.210
<v Speaker 7>It's probably not the not getting laid.</v>

2841
02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:17.640
<v Speaker 6>What'd they do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Back in those days when you had </v>

2842
02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:17.640
<v Speaker 6>syphilis,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was no cure,</v>

2843
02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:19.570
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You an apple or something like that.</v>

2844
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:23.050
<v Speaker 6>That was before penicillin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2845
02:18:23.051 --> 02:18:24.120
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nothing much to do.</v>

2846
02:18:24.130 --> 02:18:29.130
<v Speaker 6>I think some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some people were smart enough to start </v>

2847
02:18:29.130 --> 02:18:32.490
<v Speaker 6>trying silver.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think silver had some use in some of </v>

2848
02:18:32.490 --> 02:18:32.920
<v Speaker 6>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not verY effective.</v>

2849
02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:35.320
<v Speaker 6>Not like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not like an antibiotic.</v>

2850
02:18:35.510 --> 02:18:38.350
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fascinating because I was trying to</v>

2851
02:18:38.351 --> 02:18:43.351
<v Speaker 6>explain to my kids the plague because </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're reading a book and my five year </v>

2852
02:18:43.351 --> 02:18:48.241
<v Speaker 6>old and my three year old,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're sitting in bed reading before </v>

2853
02:18:48.241 --> 02:18:50.911
<v Speaker 6>bedtime.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the story involved the plague a </v>

2854
02:18:50.911 --> 02:18:51.310
<v Speaker 6>plague upon you was one of the lines and</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2855
02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:52.540
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were like,</v>

2856
02:18:52.541 --> 02:18:54.970
<v Speaker 6>what's a plug?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's shit.</v>

2857
02:18:54.971 --> 02:18:57.880
<v Speaker 6>Before doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they didn't really have doctors,</v>

2858
02:18:57.881 --> 02:19:00.850
<v Speaker 6>when all doctors could do is like cutoff</v>
<v Speaker 6>broken limbs.</v>

2859
02:19:01.230 --> 02:19:01.690
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2860
02:19:01.710 --> 02:19:04.540
<v Speaker 6>they had diseases that would kill giant </v>
<v Speaker 6>chunks of people.</v>

2861
02:19:04.541 --> 02:19:05.860
<v Speaker 6>My kids are like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

2862
02:19:05.861 --> 02:19:06.520
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2863
02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:09.160
<v Speaker 6>not that long ago by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They wrote about it.</v>

2864
02:19:09.161 --> 02:19:12.130
<v Speaker 6>So they had language and we were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>were,</v>

2865
02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:17.160
<v Speaker 6>were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>were talking about earlier about the </v>

2866
02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:17.160
<v Speaker 6>evolution of civilization and the amount</v>
<v Speaker 6>of time,</v>

2867
02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:21.571
<v Speaker 6>the very brief window between us and </v>
<v Speaker 6>when we were animals in relationship to </v>

2868
02:19:21.641 --> 02:19:26.110
<v Speaker 6>the length of time that things have been</v>
<v Speaker 6>alive on earth.</v>

2869
02:19:26.140 --> 02:19:27.560
<v Speaker 6>It's smaLl.</v>

2870
02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:32.330
<v Speaker 1>We're going through the most crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic time pretty much ever.</v>

2871
02:19:32.331 --> 02:19:34.670
<v Speaker 1>When the wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2872
02:19:34.671 --> 02:19:39.671
<v Speaker 1>descrIption that mckenna used to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the exponential growth of </v>

2873
02:19:39.671 --> 02:19:42.641
<v Speaker 1>technology was about sending a ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the top of a funnel and then it </v>

2874
02:19:42.891 --> 02:19:47.891
<v Speaker 1>takes a long time to get around the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that we're somewhere towards the </v>

2875
02:19:48.531 --> 02:19:51.350
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the funnel now where that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing is going around the tunnel</v>

2876
02:19:51.590 --> 02:19:53.690
<v Speaker 1>going around the funnel so quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2877
02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:57.020
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for us to really wrap our </v>
<v Speaker 1>heads around.</v>

2878
02:19:57.021 --> 02:20:02.021
<v Speaker 1>But when we talk to children about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I talk to children about it really </v>

2879
02:20:02.021 --> 02:20:04.040
<v Speaker 1>sends it home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I tried to describe to my kids what</v>

2880
02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:05.530
<v Speaker 1>would a fucking plague is,</v>

2881
02:20:05.570 --> 02:20:08.870
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just.</v>

2882
02:20:09.170 --> 02:20:14.170
<v Speaker 2>I just remind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reminded myself of when you read actual </v>

2883
02:20:14.170 --> 02:20:15.530
<v Speaker 2>accounts of the true pirates like </v>
<v Speaker 2>blackbeard and things like that.</v>

2884
02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:18.170
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that they would barter</v>
<v Speaker 2>with for the most,</v>

2885
02:20:18.171 --> 02:20:20.520
<v Speaker 2>like when they were making deals with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2886
02:20:20.730 --> 02:20:25.730
<v Speaker 2>the british ships or different thIngs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and striking deals was venereal disease </v>

2887
02:20:25.730 --> 02:20:27.290
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like syphilis medicine.</v>

2888
02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Like it'd be like we'll give you all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gold,</v>

2889
02:20:29.900 --> 02:20:34.340
<v Speaker 2>but you have to bring over a chest of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a medicine to cure that.</v>

2890
02:20:34.341 --> 02:20:39.341
<v Speaker 2>Venereal disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was a probably a much </v>

2891
02:20:39.341 --> 02:20:40.210
<v Speaker 2>bigger problem in ancient history than </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

2892
02:20:40.220 --> 02:20:43.370
<v Speaker 2>We're not completely ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in past civilization than we give it</v>

2893
02:20:43.371 --> 02:20:47.030
<v Speaker 2>credit people first venereal disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2894
02:20:47.031 --> 02:20:48.860
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea how fucking dirty trick,</v>

2895
02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:52.760
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about how few diseases kill</v>

2896
02:20:52.761 --> 02:20:55.520
<v Speaker 1>you that you catch it just walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around like the flu,</v>

2897
02:20:56.060 --> 02:20:59.000
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be nature's way to keep</v>

2898
02:20:59.001 --> 02:21:01.280
<v Speaker 1>the population down a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most likely,</v>

2899
02:21:01.281 --> 02:21:01.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2900
02:21:01.970 --> 02:21:05.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems like what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always a battle,</v>

2901
02:21:05.271 --> 02:21:10.271
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like we were talking about the </v>

2902
02:21:10.271 --> 02:21:11.921
<v Speaker 1>battle between discipline and success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle between being uncomfortable </v>

2903
02:21:11.921 --> 02:21:13.070
<v Speaker 1>and doing things that are hard to do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reaping,</v>

2904
02:21:13.071 --> 02:21:18.071
<v Speaker 1>the rewards of that seems to be a battle</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of trying to fucking kill us so </v>

2905
02:21:18.071 --> 02:21:18.710
<v Speaker 1>we get stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2906
02:21:18.711 --> 02:21:20.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't like to think that,</v>

2907
02:21:20.541 --> 02:21:25.541
<v Speaker 1>but it's been directly proven that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>plagues and many diseases have certain </v>

2908
02:21:26.181 --> 02:21:31.181
<v Speaker 1>traits have risen through those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through those diseases which have made </v>

2909
02:21:31.181 --> 02:21:31.190
<v Speaker 1>the human race actually stronger.</v>

2910
02:21:31.640 --> 02:21:36.640
<v Speaker 7>Although they say our cro,</v>
<v Speaker 7>magnon ancestors,</v>

2911
02:21:36.861 --> 02:21:39.050
<v Speaker 7>for Instance,</v>
<v Speaker 7>lived longer than we do.</v>

2912
02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2913
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:41.780
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2914
02:21:41.781 --> 02:21:44.510
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they've died at like 12.</v>

2915
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:46.850
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2916
02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:49.160
<v Speaker 7>I know in the bible,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but who believes the bible?</v>

2917
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:50.470
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>600 years ago,</v>

2918
02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:54.740
<v Speaker 7>like moses died at the age of 193.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a little shaky.</v>

2919
02:21:55.050 --> 02:21:55.760
<v Speaker 7>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It is.</v>

2920
02:21:55.770 --> 02:21:57.210
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know what a year was back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

2921
02:21:57.211 --> 02:22:02.211
<v Speaker 1>Now they're making shit up now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The calendar suck written on a rock that</v>

2922
02:22:03.931 --> 02:22:04.790
<v Speaker 1>you can't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2923
02:22:04.860 --> 02:22:07.920
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of shit in the bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking tough to swallow.</v>

2924
02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2925
02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:13.110
<v Speaker 1>so where did you read the cro?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Magnon lived longer than us.</v>

2926
02:22:14.540 --> 02:22:15.180
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2927
02:22:15.181 --> 02:22:19.800
<v Speaker 7>for one thIng that's for certain,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they were bigger than we were real.</v>

2928
02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:21.940
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they had a,</v>

2929
02:22:22.290 --> 02:22:24.840
<v Speaker 7>they were taller.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a known fact.</v>

2930
02:22:25.320 --> 02:22:27.210
<v Speaker 7>Agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2931
02:22:27.211 --> 02:22:32.211
<v Speaker 7>we did not have certain diseases that we</v>
<v Speaker 7>have now talked to the paleo people and </v>

2932
02:22:32.221 --> 02:22:34.110
<v Speaker 7>they can fill you with,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with all that stuff.</v>

2933
02:22:34.610 --> 02:22:39.610
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but before we started having grains and </v>

2934
02:22:39.610 --> 02:22:41.700
<v Speaker 7>all that bad stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people were perhaps living longer.</v>

2935
02:22:41.701 --> 02:22:42.870
<v Speaker 7>They were certainly bigger.</v>

2936
02:22:43.780 --> 02:22:45.940
<v Speaker 5>magnum was five foot seven,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five foot nine.</v>

2937
02:22:46.770 --> 02:22:47.350
<v Speaker 7>Oh you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>

2938
02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:48.640
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're showing me wrong.</v>

2939
02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:52.260
<v Speaker 7>But they were taller than the people </v>
<v Speaker 7>that came after them.</v>

2940
02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:53.400
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2941
02:22:53.800 --> 02:22:55.360
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are.</v>

2942
02:22:55.361 --> 02:23:00.361
<v Speaker 5>That's the average,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but large males stood as tall six foot </v>

2943
02:23:00.361 --> 02:23:01.330
<v Speaker 5>five.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not really taller than us.</v>

2944
02:23:01.720 --> 02:23:06.720
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But taller then the people living than </v>

2945
02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:06.830
<v Speaker 5>the humans of those after</v>

2946
02:23:07.510 --> 02:23:12.510
<v Speaker 7>in ancient Greece or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nothing like the internet to be able to </v>

2947
02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:12.510
<v Speaker 7>show that</v>

2948
02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:12.930
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2949
02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:15.490
<v Speaker 5>10 years ago there was no way you </v>
<v Speaker 5>would've been able to prove me wrong.</v>

2950
02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:18.880
<v Speaker 5>We've had many examples of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>stating,</v>

2951
02:23:19.260 --> 02:23:24.260
<v Speaker 5>I know you're not doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's been a lot of people that </v>

2952
02:23:24.260 --> 02:23:24.260
<v Speaker 5>have bullshitted us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2953
02:23:24.260 --> 02:23:26.080
<v Speaker 5>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've spread information,</v>

2954
02:23:26.081 --> 02:23:29.050
<v Speaker 5>so now I have to be diligent about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that wikipedia.</v>

2955
02:23:29.830 --> 02:23:32.320
<v Speaker 5>This is wikipedia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it has references.</v>

2956
02:23:32.350 --> 02:23:35.560
<v Speaker 5>If you'd like me to find the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 5>references there in there as well.</v>

2957
02:23:35.561 --> 02:23:37.980
<v Speaker 5>Don't get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that.</v>

2958
02:23:38.010 --> 02:23:43.010
<v Speaker 5>I think the path back between what we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about is that life itself needs </v>

2959
02:23:43.010 --> 02:23:44.950
<v Speaker 5>resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just as masters need resistance,</v>

2960
02:23:44.951 --> 02:23:46.240
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there is no,</v>

2961
02:23:46.570 --> 02:23:51.570
<v Speaker 5>there is no life that's worth living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>IF everything is like that Alan Watts </v>

2962
02:23:51.570 --> 02:23:55.741
<v Speaker 5>video,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we could make everything absolutely </v>

2963
02:23:55.741 --> 02:23:56.260
<v Speaker 5>perfect and nothing is a surprise and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no resistance out there,</v>

2964
02:23:56.440 --> 02:23:58.450
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't become what it is.</v>

2965
02:23:58.450 --> 02:24:01.630
<v Speaker 5>It's not as rich anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not filled with the magic that life</v>

2966
02:24:01.810 --> 02:24:02.680
<v Speaker 5>can be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2967
02:24:02.681 --> 02:24:07.681
<v Speaker 5>resistance is an intrinsic part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the fact that nature is constantly </v>

2968
02:24:07.681 --> 02:24:07.960
<v Speaker 5>looking to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2969
02:24:08.350 --> 02:24:13.350
<v Speaker 5>pick us off is part of that resistance </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the fact that all of these forces </v>

2970
02:24:13.350 --> 02:24:16.450
<v Speaker 5>are aligned against someone who's trying</v>
<v Speaker 5>to become a master.</v>

2971
02:24:16.451 --> 02:24:19.510
<v Speaker 5>The pain sacriFice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever people are saying,</v>

2972
02:24:19.511 --> 02:24:24.511
<v Speaker 5>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is required for a master to be </v>

2973
02:24:24.511 --> 02:24:24.511
<v Speaker 5>created,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2974
02:24:24.511 --> 02:24:25.870
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all part of the same thing.</v>

2975
02:24:25.871 --> 02:24:30.871
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's this kind of dualism of force and </v>

2976
02:24:30.871 --> 02:24:34.111
<v Speaker 5>opposition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The average liFe expectancy of cro </v>

2977
02:24:34.111 --> 02:24:34.510
<v Speaker 5>magnon was 35 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>

2978
02:24:34.570 --> 02:24:35.260
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I met,</v>

2979
02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:37.500
<v Speaker 5>I meant the high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>

2980
02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:41.680
<v Speaker 5>did most of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got something.</v>

2981
02:24:41.681 --> 02:24:43.270
<v Speaker 5>I've got something that's maybe on </v>
<v Speaker 5>chromat.</v>

2982
02:24:44.490 --> 02:24:48.240
<v Speaker 5>I better shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>40th five would be exceptionally old for</v>

2983
02:24:48.241 --> 02:24:49.090
<v Speaker 5>cro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>magnon math.</v>

2984
02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:52.120
<v Speaker 5>So if I was crow bag now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>might be the fucking old wise man in the</v>

2985
02:24:52.121 --> 02:24:57.121
<v Speaker 5>village she gets compared to the people </v>
<v Speaker 5>who got into agricultural settlements </v>

2986
02:24:57.121 --> 02:25:00.160
<v Speaker 5>after cro magnon they didn't live to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>35 years old.</v>

2987
02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:05.560
<v Speaker 5>That age is also factoring or infant </v>
<v Speaker 5>mortality for things like that.</v>

2988
02:25:05.561 --> 02:25:07.780
<v Speaker 5>Things don't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Disease mortality,</v>

2989
02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:09.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't mean that the,</v>

2990
02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:11.530
<v Speaker 5>a healthy crow bangin wouldn't live </v>
<v Speaker 5>longer.</v>

2991
02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:12.740
<v Speaker 5>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the big things.</v>

2992
02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:14.980
<v Speaker 5>Factoring infant mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a big one,</v>

2993
02:25:14.981 --> 02:25:15.710
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2994
02:25:15.740 --> 02:25:18.460
<v Speaker 5>Mother's dying in childbirth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit that doesn't happen anymore.</v>

2995
02:25:18.490 --> 02:25:20.590
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that raises or as much.</v>

2996
02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:21.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2997
02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:26.760
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but when I came back to what you were </v>

2998
02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:28.850
<v Speaker 7>saying in the preface to mastery,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I try and say the times that we live in,</v>

2999
02:25:28.860 --> 02:25:29.370
<v Speaker 7>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

3000
02:25:29.371 --> 02:25:31.960
<v Speaker 7>I make the point that we need masters in</v>
<v Speaker 7>the world now.</v>

3001
02:25:33.010 --> 02:25:38.010
<v Speaker 7>This is a time where we have incredible </v>
<v Speaker 7>opportunitY largely through the internet</v>

3002
02:25:39.310 --> 02:25:42.550
<v Speaker 7>where access to information,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the ability to learn things,</v>

3003
02:25:42.551 --> 02:25:45.580
<v Speaker 7>to develop skills,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to have an isolation tank,</v>

3004
02:25:45.581 --> 02:25:48.340
<v Speaker 7>to learn archery,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to do all of these things.</v>

3005
02:25:48.670 --> 02:25:53.670
<v Speaker 7>The world is opened up and the ability </v>
<v Speaker 7>to develop skills and master something </v>

3006
02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:58.501
<v Speaker 7>and create something is just completely </v>
<v Speaker 7>unprecedented at the same time.</v>

3007
02:25:59.290 --> 02:26:04.290
<v Speaker 7>The distractions and the resistance that</v>
<v Speaker 7>we have to go through is equally </v>

3008
02:26:04.290 --> 02:26:07.420
<v Speaker 7>unprecedented with the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with iphones,</v>

3009
02:26:07.421 --> 02:26:12.421
<v Speaker 7>with all the other things that are </v>
<v Speaker 7>making it so much harder for us to </v>

3010
02:26:12.421 --> 02:26:16.891
<v Speaker 7>focus,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I want you to think of all of these </v>

3011
02:26:16.891 --> 02:26:19.741
<v Speaker 7>things as the kind of the water that you</v>
<v Speaker 7>have to swim against and if you're able </v>

3012
02:26:19.741 --> 02:26:24.631
<v Speaker 7>to swim against all of these </v>
<v Speaker 7>distractions that the world throws at </v>

3013
02:26:24.631 --> 02:26:27.841
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to become a real kick ass </v>

3014
02:26:27.841 --> 02:26:30.961
<v Speaker 7>master in whatever it is because you've </v>
<v Speaker 7>overcome something that 90 percent of </v>

3015
02:26:31.541 --> 02:26:35.260
<v Speaker 7>the people in this world just submerges </v>
<v Speaker 7>them under because they're too weak.</v>

3016
02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:40.680
<v Speaker 1>But there's also the clIche and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very important to point out that there </v>

3017
02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:44.301
<v Speaker 1>is no end result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it's a journey and this journey </v>

3018
02:26:44.301 --> 02:26:45.510
<v Speaker 1>does not mean becoming a master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not.</v>

3019
02:26:45.870 --> 02:26:48.720
<v Speaker 1>There's no end point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You continue to get better at everything</v>

3020
02:26:48.721 --> 02:26:52.350
<v Speaker 1>you do or you start to suck and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens.</v>

3021
02:26:52.590 --> 02:26:55.860
<v Speaker 1>You will get better if you do not </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to get better.</v>

3022
02:26:55.861 --> 02:26:56.940
<v Speaker 1>You are getting worse.</v>

3023
02:26:57.350 --> 02:26:58.280
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3024
02:26:58.400 --> 02:26:59.390
<v Speaker 7>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

3025
02:27:00.020 --> 02:27:01.460
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you take someone like einstein,</v>

3026
02:27:01.461 --> 02:27:06.461
<v Speaker 7>one of the greatest masters,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he discovers the second theory of </v>

3027
02:27:06.461 --> 02:27:08.630
<v Speaker 7>relativity at the age of 26 and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 7>after that,</v>

3028
02:27:09.740 --> 02:27:11.430
<v Speaker 7>he tried to do his unified theory.</v>

3029
02:27:11.770 --> 02:27:12.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

3030
02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Why posey again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that scientist was too much.</v>

3031
02:27:17.860 --> 02:27:19.120
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean he had too much?</v>

3032
02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:22.690
<v Speaker 1>So I was a famous pussy out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't know that.</v>

3033
02:27:23.170 --> 02:27:24.340
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is true.</v>

3034
02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein loved it.</v>

3035
02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:26.970
<v Speaker 1>He was smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was fine.</v>

3036
02:27:26.980 --> 02:27:31.980
<v Speaker 1>When you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two guys with the most brilliant minds </v>

3037
02:27:31.980 --> 02:27:32.020
<v Speaker 1>of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love pussy,</v>

3038
02:27:32.710 --> 02:27:36.250
<v Speaker 1>don't want to go to baptist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big old smile on einstein's face,</v>

3039
02:27:37.220 --> 02:27:40.510
<v Speaker 1>wacky fucking image going on him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved him.</v>

3040
02:27:41.140 --> 02:27:42.050
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3041
02:27:42.130 --> 02:27:43.180
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3042
02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:48.600
<v Speaker 1>you talk about all the favorable traits </v>
<v Speaker 1>for evolutionary success talking about </v>

3043
02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:50.830
<v Speaker 1>one of the most brilliant men </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically ever.</v>

3044
02:27:51.100 --> 02:27:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that a lot of women will </v>

3045
02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:56.100
<v Speaker 1>want that seed inside of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3046
02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:56.100
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3047
02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:58.240
<v Speaker 1>see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that lady's fuck gene simmons.</v>

3048
02:27:58.340 --> 02:28:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Look at that as the tongue of a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>super genius with his own hair.</v>

3049
02:28:04.430 --> 02:28:06.370
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>

3050
02:28:06.371 --> 02:28:11.110
<v Speaker 1>He was a very unique individual in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that uniqueness.</v>

3051
02:28:11.111 --> 02:28:13.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there was some motivation </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind that,</v>

3052
02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:18.720
<v Speaker 1>not just the scientific motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the actual natural motivation to be </v>

3053
02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:21.330
<v Speaker 1>exceptional for breeding purposes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3054
02:28:21.350 --> 02:28:23.000
<v Speaker 1>women would find him exceptional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3055
02:28:23.001 --> 02:28:24.440
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3056
02:28:24.660 --> 02:28:29.660
<v Speaker 7>but you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it is a process so that you never can </v>

3057
02:28:29.660 --> 02:28:29.660
<v Speaker 7>sort of rest on your laurels and say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

3058
02:28:29.660 --> 02:28:32.700
<v Speaker 7>so the way I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying that I'm a master,</v>

3059
02:28:32.701 --> 02:28:37.701
<v Speaker 7>so don't misinterpret me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the way I do it for myself is every </v>

3060
02:28:37.701 --> 02:28:39.300
<v Speaker 7>book that I write,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm back at square one.</v>

3061
02:28:39.940 --> 02:28:41.100
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm nobody.</v>

3062
02:28:41.220 --> 02:28:45.390
<v Speaker 7>I have no history of no fault readers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not successful.</v>

3063
02:28:45.780 --> 02:28:49.240
<v Speaker 7>I have to make it's death ground.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have to make my next book work or I'm.</v>

3064
02:28:49.241 --> 02:28:51.060
<v Speaker 7>I'm a total loser.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

3065
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:55.630
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly the same process involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in standup comedy,</v>

3066
02:28:56.530 --> 02:29:01.530
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put out a new special and then once </v>

3067
02:29:01.530 --> 02:29:05.851
<v Speaker 1>you have that new special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you throw all that material out and you </v>

3068
02:29:05.851 --> 02:29:08.410
<v Speaker 1>start from scratch and you write all new</v>
<v Speaker 1>material and if you do it that way,</v>

3069
02:29:08.490 --> 02:29:11.590
<v Speaker 1>and that's the only real way to do it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this day and age,</v>

3070
02:29:11.591 --> 02:29:13.210
<v Speaker 1>because too many people have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>

3071
02:29:13.211 --> 02:29:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone has the internet.</v>

3072
02:29:14.801 --> 02:29:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Obviously too many people have access to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your previous work,</v>

3073
02:29:17.351 --> 02:29:22.351
<v Speaker 1>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in comedy you constantly need new </v>

3074
02:29:22.351 --> 02:29:22.600
<v Speaker 1>material unlike in music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rough.</v>

3075
02:29:23.050 --> 02:29:24.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

3076
02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:25.300
<v Speaker 1>It's rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's great.</v>

3077
02:29:25.630 --> 02:29:27.550
<v Speaker 1>The roughness is the great part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3078
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:30.820
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole process of mastery,</v>

3079
02:29:31.390 --> 02:29:32.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say you're not a master.</v>

3080
02:29:33.370 --> 02:29:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I think you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there is none.</v>

3081
02:29:36.610 --> 02:29:40.540
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think you are a master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no ultimate mastery.</v>

3082
02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:44.800
<v Speaker 1>A master is someone who is very good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the process,</v>

3083
02:29:45.220 --> 02:29:47.860
<v Speaker 1>but there's no end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3084
02:29:48.460 --> 02:29:50.200
<v Speaker 1>The end doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>

3085
02:29:50.350 --> 02:29:53.800
<v Speaker 1>There's no where it becomes easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no golden age of retirement.</v>

3086
02:29:53.801 --> 02:29:58.801
<v Speaker 1>That's a bunch of horse shit that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking sell you to keep you in your </v>

3087
02:29:58.801 --> 02:29:58.801
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no golden age.</v>

3088
02:29:58.801 --> 02:29:59.110
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3089
02:29:59.120 --> 02:30:04.120
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get old and you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reach that point where you know you </v>

3090
02:30:04.120 --> 02:30:04.210
<v Speaker 1>can't really work anymore so you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to work anymore,</v>

3091
02:30:04.211 --> 02:30:06.230
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got to watch your money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know this,</v>

3092
02:30:06.310 --> 02:30:09.970
<v Speaker 1>this selling point of one day and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>retire and everything will be groovy the</v>

3093
02:30:09.971 --> 02:30:11.800
<v Speaker 1>fuck it will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be groovy.</v>

3094
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:15.100
<v Speaker 1>There's that whole half waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to drop on you.</v>

3095
02:30:15.101 --> 02:30:20.101
<v Speaker 1>Even the religious belief that you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through this life and just do your work </v>

3096
02:30:20.101 --> 02:30:20.101
<v Speaker 1>and then you get to heaven.</v>

3097
02:30:20.101 --> 02:30:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3098
02:30:20.351 --> 02:30:22.240
<v Speaker 1>or you go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's not religious,</v>

3099
02:30:22.241 --> 02:30:27.241
<v Speaker 1>this capitalist belief you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you work in this job and it's gonna </v>

3100
02:30:27.241 --> 02:30:27.241
<v Speaker 1>suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you get to retire.</v>

3101
02:30:27.250 --> 02:30:30.340
<v Speaker 1>No bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to enjoy that every minute along</v>

3102
02:30:30.341 --> 02:30:32.950
<v Speaker 1>that path that you're going on or choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different path.</v>

3103
02:30:32.951 --> 02:30:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Fuck the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck everything else.</v>

3104
02:30:34.870 --> 02:30:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Do what you love to do the whole time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll smile at the end when your,</v>

3105
02:30:38.920 --> 02:30:40.240
<v Speaker 1>when your time is up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3106
02:30:40.241 --> 02:30:45.241
<v Speaker 1>and if you do use the wrong motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will not get the results you desire.</v>

3107
02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:50.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a guy who has been trying to get </v>

3108
02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:53.371
<v Speaker 1>famous forever and he's trying to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in all the wrong ways,</v>

3109
02:30:54.030 --> 02:30:59.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to become famous instead of </v>

3110
02:30:59.030 --> 02:31:01.681
<v Speaker 1>focusing on whatever art form you choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make you famous just wants fame and </v>

3111
02:31:02.410 --> 02:31:04.930
<v Speaker 1>it just escapes them like sand through </v>
<v Speaker 1>your fingers.</v>

3112
02:31:04.931 --> 02:31:06.640
<v Speaker 1>You just can't hold onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't,</v>

3113
02:31:06.970 --> 02:31:11.560
<v Speaker 1>can't get a quantifiable amount in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands and the motivation is incorrect.</v>

3114
02:31:11.620 --> 02:31:15.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like the motivation was just on his</v>
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>

3115
02:31:15.850 --> 02:31:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I think probably he would be far more </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>

3116
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:23.550
<v Speaker 1>but instead the motivation is based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the green demon of looking at all these </v>

3117
02:31:23.550 --> 02:31:27.501
<v Speaker 1>other people becoming successful and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to find out why he can't </v>

3118
02:31:27.501 --> 02:31:27.501
<v Speaker 1>achieve it himself.</v>

3119
02:31:27.501 --> 02:31:29.560
<v Speaker 7>I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Attention is never the goal in.</v>

3120
02:31:29.570 --> 02:31:31.570
<v Speaker 7>In mastery,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it is actually a negative.</v>

3121
02:31:31.630 --> 02:31:33.220
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but learning,</v>

3122
02:31:33.250 --> 02:31:35.680
<v Speaker 7>learning is what gets you high.</v>
<v Speaker 7>LeArning is what you love.</v>

3123
02:31:35.681 --> 02:31:38.170
<v Speaker 7>If you love the attention more than the </v>
<v Speaker 7>learning,</v>

3124
02:31:38.171 --> 02:31:39.700
<v Speaker 7>then you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're never gonna make it.</v>

3125
02:31:39.950 --> 02:31:42.250
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that need,</v>

3126
02:31:42.610 --> 02:31:43.020
<v Speaker 7>that need</v>

3127
02:31:43.130 --> 02:31:48.130
<v Speaker 1>for acceptance and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the very opposite of what you </v>

3128
02:31:48.130 --> 02:31:48.600
<v Speaker 1>should be striving for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3129
02:31:49.010 --> 02:31:54.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we were talking about people that </v>

3130
02:31:54.010 --> 02:31:56.320
<v Speaker 1>become really successful and then lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>their way and how you can learn so much </v>

3131
02:31:56.421 --> 02:31:58.340
<v Speaker 1>from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in comedy.</v>

3132
02:31:58.341 --> 02:32:03.341
<v Speaker 1>My um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my guide for that was always sam </v>

3133
02:32:03.341 --> 02:32:06.041
<v Speaker 1>kennison because I think that sam </v>
<v Speaker 1>kennison was the greatest comedian of </v>

3134
02:32:06.041 --> 02:32:08.880
<v Speaker 1>all time from 1986 to 1987.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3135
02:32:08.900 --> 02:32:11.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe before that,</v>

3136
02:32:11.600 --> 02:32:13.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found out about 86.</v>

3137
02:32:13.420 --> 02:32:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean probably it was the greatest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>85 and maybe even in a four,</v>

3138
02:32:16.580 --> 02:32:21.580
<v Speaker 1>but that's it from then on it's dog shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you try to listen to sam kinison from</v>

3139
02:32:21.711 --> 02:32:24.320
<v Speaker 1>89 or 88,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible comedy.</v>

3140
02:32:24.321 --> 02:32:26.330
<v Speaker 1>I went to see him alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was awful.</v>

3141
02:32:26.930 --> 02:32:30.500
<v Speaker 1>I saw him live several times because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was such a huge fan of his work and 86,</v>

3142
02:32:30.890 --> 02:32:31.990
<v Speaker 1>but the dropoff was.</v>

3143
02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:35.000
<v Speaker 1>So there's guys who have good cd's and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3144
02:32:35.001 --> 02:32:37.310
<v Speaker 1>they'll have hills and valleys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I myself,</v>

3145
02:32:37.311 --> 02:32:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I have stuff that I really love and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff I was like,</v>

3146
02:32:39.530 --> 02:32:44.530
<v Speaker 1>well that wasn't my best one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then more motivation to do better </v>

3147
02:32:44.530 --> 02:32:47.270
<v Speaker 1>than the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just sometimes creative glitches</v>

3148
02:32:47.271 --> 02:32:49.100
<v Speaker 1>or what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A part of the process,</v>

3149
02:32:49.490 --> 02:32:54.490
<v Speaker 1>but with kennison there's this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster peak and then this crazy drop </v>

3150
02:32:54.640 --> 02:32:58.220
<v Speaker 1>off of coke and hookers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A coke,</v>

3151
02:32:58.250 --> 02:32:59.780
<v Speaker 1>a lot booze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

3152
02:32:59.810 --> 02:33:02.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had mark marin on the podcast who was</v>

3153
02:33:02.450 --> 02:33:07.450
<v Speaker 1>palling around with kennison in the hay </v>
<v Speaker 1>day at the comedy store when mark was a </v>

3154
02:33:07.450 --> 02:33:11.150
<v Speaker 1>young kid and he told some amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about this,</v>

3155
02:33:11.151 --> 02:33:16.151
<v Speaker 1>the amount of substances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark hung out with kennison and he had </v>

3156
02:33:16.151 --> 02:33:19.880
<v Speaker 1>to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He left la and he hit it So hard that he</v>

3157
02:33:19.881 --> 02:33:23.330
<v Speaker 1>was hearing voices in his head for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost a year.</v>

3158
02:33:23.540 --> 02:33:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Like literally he was psychotic and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>met mark soon after that I met mark in </v>

3159
02:33:28.540 --> 02:33:32.600
<v Speaker 1>boston like after he had been hanging </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with kennis and after kennison was,</v>

3160
02:33:32.601 --> 02:33:34.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>riding the wave and you know,</v>

3161
02:33:34.851 --> 02:33:36.460
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met mark I think in [inaudible].</v>

3162
02:33:36.461 --> 02:33:39.050
<v Speaker 1>80 eight was when I started and I met </v>
<v Speaker 1>him soon after that,</v>

3163
02:33:39.051 --> 02:33:44.051
<v Speaker 1>so he had already gone through all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was a young guy working at the </v>

3164
02:33:44.051 --> 02:33:48.401
<v Speaker 1>comedy store and he got to see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overwhelming amount of substances </v>

3165
02:33:49.221 --> 02:33:52.790
<v Speaker 1>that kinison was consuming and massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just destroyed him.</v>

3166
02:33:52.791 --> 02:33:55.050
<v Speaker 1>He never recovered from this cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>

3167
02:33:55.051 --> 02:33:57.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't writing either.</v>

3168
02:33:57.141 --> 02:33:58.850
<v Speaker 1>His brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his brother wrote about it.</v>

3169
02:33:58.851 --> 02:34:03.851
<v Speaker 1>There's a book called mY brother sam was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great book about kennison written by </v>

3170
02:34:03.851 --> 02:34:03.950
<v Speaker 1>his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>

3171
02:34:03.951 --> 02:34:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I think also his manager at the time who</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote about how there was a.</v>

3172
02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:12.440
<v Speaker 1>He wrote about the tangible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tangible dropoff in his writing.</v>

3173
02:34:12.730 --> 02:34:15.260
<v Speaker 1>It didn't write new materIal anymore and</v>
<v Speaker 1>was sort of like,</v>

3174
02:34:15.330 --> 02:34:16.190
<v Speaker 1>just partying.</v>

3175
02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:17.560
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean there's,</v>

3176
02:34:17.561 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 7>I talk in</v>

3177
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:23.040
<v Speaker 1>the book about this myth that drugs will</v>
<v Speaker 1>just instantly make you more creative.</v>

3178
02:34:23.591 --> 02:34:25.660
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's often the opposite.</v>

3179
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:31.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have example of coltrane who was </v>

3180
02:34:31.150 --> 02:34:35.430
<v Speaker 1>probably maybe one of the greatest jazz </v>
<v Speaker 1>artist who ever lived and he got hooked </v>

3181
02:34:35.430 --> 02:34:40.261
<v Speaker 1>on heroin for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people have this myth that that's </v>

3182
02:34:40.261 --> 02:34:43.231
<v Speaker 1>what made coltrane so great was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs and the heroin and the coke and in</v>

3183
02:34:43.391 --> 02:34:45.610
<v Speaker 1>fact he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said it was the worst.</v>

3184
02:34:45.611 --> 02:34:50.611
<v Speaker 1>He did his worst work in that period and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got off of it like in 58 and never </v>

3185
02:34:50.611 --> 02:34:52.960
<v Speaker 1>touched the drugs or drinking after that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and did is better.</v>

3186
02:34:52.961 --> 02:34:57.961
<v Speaker 1>Workout is much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Work to create something requires so </v>

3187
02:34:57.961 --> 02:35:02.731
<v Speaker 1>much discipline and so much mindfulness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and focus that you just can't do it if </v>

3188
02:35:03.341 --> 02:35:05.430
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly drugged out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3189
02:35:05.431 --> 02:35:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Especially those to those very </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressive ones and very like.</v>

3190
02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Coke and heroin are probably two of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst,</v>

3191
02:35:12.510 --> 02:35:16.680
<v Speaker 1>but there seems to be a connection </v>
<v Speaker 1>between heroin and deep soulful music.</v>

3192
02:35:16.681 --> 02:35:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe it helps them for a small </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

3193
02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:25.160
<v Speaker 1>reach a state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then ultimately the abuse of it </v>

3194
02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:26.670
<v Speaker 1>destroys your body so much that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't keep it up.</v>

3195
02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:31.840
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You mean like a velvet underground or </v>

3196
02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:31.840
<v Speaker 7>something like that?</v>

3197
02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:34.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's something will hendricks </v>

3198
02:35:34.020 --> 02:35:35.290
<v Speaker 1>and well people will argue dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't really into heroin,</v>

3199
02:35:35.291 --> 02:35:37.740
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at that photo behind me </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his mugshot,</v>

3200
02:35:37.780 --> 02:35:42.780
<v Speaker 1>that is from the fucking toronto police </v>
<v Speaker 1>department when he was arrested for </v>

3201
02:35:42.780 --> 02:35:46.801
<v Speaker 1>heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was a little problem with that </v>

3202
02:35:46.801 --> 02:35:48.730
<v Speaker 1>little heroin in his system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what drugs.</v>

3203
02:35:48.731 --> 02:35:53.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he was also involved in acid and </v>

3204
02:35:53.731 --> 02:35:53.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morrison was into heroin.</v>

3205
02:35:53.731 --> 02:35:56.290
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of alcohol involveD with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those guys as well.</v>

3206
02:35:56.291 --> 02:36:01.291
<v Speaker 1>But the ability to escape your </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibitions was they were chasing the </v>

3207
02:36:01.291 --> 02:36:01.630
<v Speaker 1>dragon in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3208
02:36:01.631 --> 02:36:03.580
<v Speaker 1>but look how long it lasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty seven.</v>

3209
02:36:04.590 --> 02:36:07.270
<v Speaker 1>They're all died at 27.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Janice joplin,</v>

3210
02:36:07.271 --> 02:36:08.490
<v Speaker 1>hendrix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morrison.</v>

3211
02:36:08.620 --> 02:36:10.410
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be the most dangerous</v>

3212
02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:13.480
<v Speaker 7>path to embark upon iF you're looking to</v>
<v Speaker 7>gain something.</v>

3213
02:36:13.481 --> 02:36:18.481
<v Speaker 7>I think one of the things I got from one</v>
<v Speaker 7>of your books was the story about </v>

3214
02:36:18.481 --> 02:36:21.561
<v Speaker 7>theater or dusty was that in was that in</v>
<v Speaker 7>48 laws of power where it gets in the 33</v>

3215
02:36:21.941 --> 02:36:24.100
<v Speaker 7>strikes for add in the 40 lows.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3216
02:36:24.101 --> 02:36:26.560
<v Speaker 7>basically after he would be successful </v>
<v Speaker 7>with a book,</v>

3217
02:36:26.561 --> 02:36:31.561
<v Speaker 7>you would find that he was unable to </v>
<v Speaker 7>really write and he didn't have that </v>

3218
02:36:31.561 --> 02:36:34.831
<v Speaker 7>creative fire anymore to create another </v>
<v Speaker 7>great work so he would take all of his </v>

3219
02:36:34.831 --> 02:36:39.721
<v Speaker 7>life savings and go to the casino and </v>
<v Speaker 7>just gamble it away in the night so that</v>

3220
02:36:39.821 --> 02:36:42.760
<v Speaker 7>he was desperate and hungry again.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He waS penniless,</v>

3221
02:36:42.850 --> 02:36:47.850
<v Speaker 7>penniless,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and at that point he had to write </v>

3222
02:36:47.850 --> 02:36:48.190
<v Speaker 7>something great to get himself out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3223
02:36:48.191 --> 02:36:53.191
<v Speaker 7>so these,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these people use these different </v>

3224
02:36:53.191 --> 02:36:53.191
<v Speaker 7>strategies and he did that over and over</v>
<v Speaker 7>again.</v>

3225
02:36:53.191 --> 02:36:55.560
<v Speaker 7>That takes guts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got to be a fucking crazy person.</v>

3226
02:36:56.590 --> 02:36:59.560
<v Speaker 7>That death ground,</v>
<v Speaker 7>putting yourself on death ground.</v>

3227
02:36:59.561 --> 02:37:04.561
<v Speaker 7>It comes from sun tzu says a general </v>
<v Speaker 7>with deliberately put his army on death </v>

3228
02:37:04.561 --> 02:37:08.911
<v Speaker 7>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 7>meaning he would deliberately put their </v>

3229
02:37:08.911 --> 02:37:10.621
<v Speaker 7>back against an ocean or a mountain and </v>
<v Speaker 7>they either had to defeat the enemy </v>

3230
02:37:10.751 --> 02:37:13.840
<v Speaker 7>that's confronting them or they would </v>
<v Speaker 7>die because they had no escape route,</v>

3231
02:37:13.870 --> 02:37:15.620
<v Speaker 7>no safety net,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no safety net,</v>

3232
02:37:15.621 --> 02:37:16.130
<v Speaker 7>no escape</v>

3233
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:20.180
<v Speaker 6>route safety nets or something that I've</v>
<v Speaker 6>argued against ever since I was a child,</v>

3234
02:37:20.181 --> 02:37:25.181
<v Speaker 6>which was another thing that my parents </v>
<v Speaker 6>instilled in me that I had to have a </v>

3235
02:37:25.181 --> 02:37:25.370
<v Speaker 6>safety net.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I've always told everybody who would</v>

3236
02:37:25.371 --> 02:37:30.371
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't ever have a fucking safety net </v>

3237
02:37:30.371 --> 02:37:31.430
<v Speaker 6>because if you have a net you will fall.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You might not make it without the net,</v>

3238
02:37:31.431 --> 02:37:36.010
<v Speaker 6>but you will not make it within that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's that.</v>

3239
02:37:36.540 --> 02:37:37.170
<v Speaker 6>There's that.</v>

3240
02:37:37.630 --> 02:37:42.630
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had an interesting experience with </v>

3241
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.630
<v Speaker 7>mastery,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3242
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:46.300
<v Speaker 7>were in writing the book where I've </v>
<v Speaker 7>written four of the six chapters,</v>

3243
02:37:46.510 --> 02:37:49.840
<v Speaker 7>but I was getting really late in </v>
<v Speaker 7>delivering the final result.</v>

3244
02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:55.080
<v Speaker 7>And the publisher basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have like 11 weeks to finish the </v>

3245
02:37:55.901 --> 02:37:58.030
<v Speaker 7>book,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or we're canceling the project or,</v>

3246
02:37:58.031 --> 02:38:00.880
<v Speaker 7>or postponing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And they were,</v>

3247
02:38:00.881 --> 02:38:03.040
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the two chapters left were the longest,</v>

3248
02:38:03.041 --> 02:38:08.041
<v Speaker 7>the hardest,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the most abstract and the most </v>

3249
02:38:08.041 --> 02:38:08.041
<v Speaker 7>important.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it was like,</v>

3250
02:38:08.041 --> 02:38:09.850
<v Speaker 7>there's no way I'm exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just can't do it.</v>

3251
02:38:10.390 --> 02:38:13.360
<v Speaker 7>But I had no choice because if they </v>
<v Speaker 7>cancel or postpone it,</v>

3252
02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:16.450
<v Speaker 7>all of my hard work would be thrown out </v>
<v Speaker 7>the window.</v>

3253
02:38:16.690 --> 02:38:18.940
<v Speaker 7>So that was death ground.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And finally,</v>

3254
02:38:18.941 --> 02:38:23.080
<v Speaker 7>after three days of torturing myself and</v>
<v Speaker 7>whining and bitching at myself,</v>

3255
02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:24.190
<v Speaker 7>I decided,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all right,</v>

3256
02:38:24.191 --> 02:38:25.770
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just going to try.</v>

3257
02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:26.980
<v Speaker 7>Let's just do what I can.</v>

3258
02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:31.150
<v Speaker 7>And it was the most incredible writing </v>
<v Speaker 7>experience I've ever had in my life.</v>

3259
02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:36.510
<v Speaker 7>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had to work harder than I've ever had </v>

3260
02:38:36.510 --> 02:38:38.911
<v Speaker 7>to work.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got on this high where thoughts were </v>

3261
02:38:38.911 --> 02:38:40.190
<v Speaker 7>just coming to me and my dreams and my,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3262
02:38:40.200 --> 02:38:42.190
<v Speaker 7>I'm having sex every.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just the most amazing.</v>

3263
02:38:42.550 --> 02:38:47.550
<v Speaker 7>And they worked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I was sitting there writing about </v>

3264
02:38:47.550 --> 02:38:50.020
<v Speaker 7>creativity and intuition while they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>while this was happening to me.</v>

3265
02:38:50.290 --> 02:38:55.290
<v Speaker 7>And it just demonstrated to me that the </v>
<v Speaker 7>limits that I thought I had are just </v>

3266
02:38:55.290 --> 02:38:59.971
<v Speaker 7>sort of self imposed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if I stop complaining and stop </v>

3267
02:38:59.971 --> 02:39:03.931
<v Speaker 7>saying that I had these limits,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I could explore beyond them and explore </v>

3268
02:39:03.931 --> 02:39:06.820
<v Speaker 7>what I was capable of that I never </v>
<v Speaker 7>thought I was capable of.</v>

3269
02:39:07.450 --> 02:39:08.170
<v Speaker 7>Prior to that.</v>

3270
02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:10.940
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hunter thompson wrote hell's angels.</v>

<v Speaker 6>That fucking blast me off there.</v>

3294
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:13.150

<v Speaker 6>There's constant matter what you do in </v>

3295

<v Speaker 6>this life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>just larry will watch this.</v>

3299
02:40:20.971 --> 02:40:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I was alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing some work and you know,</v>

3300
02:40:23.281 --> 02:40:28.281
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking wrote all night because of </v>

3301
02:40:28.281 --> 02:40:30.801
<v Speaker 1>that documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got on the keyboard and just smashed </v>

3302
02:40:30.801 --> 02:40:30.801
<v Speaker 1>keys all night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh nice.</v>

3303
02:40:30.801 --> 02:40:32.250
<v Speaker 1>It's those things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3304
02:40:32.251 --> 02:40:37.251
<v Speaker 1>you catch these bursts of inspiration </v>
<v Speaker 1>and thompson who's a personal hero of </v>

3305
02:40:37.861 --> 02:40:39.630
<v Speaker 1>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to call them fuel,</v>

3306
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:45.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said that he personally believed </v>

3307
02:40:45.190 --> 02:40:47.211
<v Speaker 1>that with the right song you could drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>further in your car and your car would </v>

3308
02:40:47.211 --> 02:40:52.011
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way if the right song was </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing to go to go miles past the and </v>

3309
02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:57.600
<v Speaker 1>theoretically obviously not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically he was a,</v>

3310
02:40:58.140 --> 02:40:59.760
<v Speaker 1>it was just a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Metaphor.</v>

3311
02:40:59.910 --> 02:41:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3312
02:41:00.610 --> 02:41:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

3313
02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Metaphorically he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3314
02:41:04.050 --> 02:41:09.050
<v Speaker 1>just great at figuring out how to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>these abstract ideas into a tangible </v>

3315
02:41:09.811 --> 02:41:14.400
<v Speaker 1>form that you mind accepted and never </v>
<v Speaker 1>met a deadline.</v>

3316
02:41:14.850 --> 02:41:18.360
<v Speaker 1>And his whOle thing was like putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things off until the last minute.</v>

3317
02:41:18.540 --> 02:41:22.410
<v Speaker 1>And then this fury of fucking teeth </v>
<v Speaker 1>gnashing,</v>

3318
02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:25.470
<v Speaker 1>slamming against the keys and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>

3319
02:41:25.650 --> 02:41:28.070
<v Speaker 1>But it's almost like he forced himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>into this,</v>

3320
02:41:28.580 --> 02:41:31.500
<v Speaker 1>this back against the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you call it?</v>

3321
02:41:31.530 --> 02:41:35.070
<v Speaker 1>The death ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He forced himself into a death ground.</v>

3322
02:41:35.320 --> 02:41:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to complete.</v>

3323
02:41:36.571 --> 02:41:38.410
<v Speaker 2>I wish I'd done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've included it among you.</v>

3324
02:41:38.411 --> 02:41:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3325
02:41:39.550 --> 02:41:44.550
<v Speaker 2>I've know you've talking about comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like following someone like joey </v>

3326
02:41:44.550 --> 02:41:46.120
<v Speaker 2>diaz who is hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3327
02:41:46.121 --> 02:41:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Because you've talked about how that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes,</v>

3328
02:41:48.450 --> 02:41:51.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would make some people a little bit</v>

3329
02:41:51.071 --> 02:41:56.071
<v Speaker 2>scared and a little bit nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you like it because it's going to </v>

3330
02:41:56.071 --> 02:41:57.220
<v Speaker 2>bring out your best following somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that great.</v>

3331
02:41:57.670 --> 02:42:02.670
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haven't you kind of mentioned isn't </v>

3332
02:42:02.670 --> 02:42:02.670
<v Speaker 2>there something there in that same </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy?</v>

3333
02:42:02.670 --> 02:42:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my philosophy in that is that I </v>

3334
02:42:07.630 --> 02:42:10.190
<v Speaker 1>think that not foe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not working with funny really,</v>

3335
02:42:10.191 --> 02:42:12.830
<v Speaker 1>really funny people is a twofold </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

3336
02:42:12.831 --> 02:42:17.831
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's famine thinking like they think </v>

3337
02:42:17.831 --> 02:42:20.111
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of really selfish </v>

3338
02:42:20.111 --> 02:42:21.620
<v Speaker 1>comedians out there and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they like to do is they like</v>

3339
02:42:21.621 --> 02:42:25.370
<v Speaker 1>to stack the deck so they'll bring this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys had a national touring headliners.</v>

3340
02:42:25.371 --> 02:42:30.371
<v Speaker 1>They bring the worst fucking comedians </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've ever seen in your life to open </v>

3341
02:42:30.371 --> 02:42:33.911
<v Speaker 1>for them because these guys go up there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and eat dick for half an hour and then </v>

3342
02:42:33.911 --> 02:42:34.610
<v Speaker 1>you go on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crowd has been tortured,</v>

3343
02:42:34.611 --> 02:42:36.950
<v Speaker 1>waiting for actual entertainment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the hero.</v>

3344
02:42:37.010 --> 02:42:39.320
<v Speaker 1>You're the conquering hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So nobody out shines you this,</v>

3345
02:42:39.321 --> 02:42:42.440
<v Speaker 1>but it is incredibly common and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gross.</v>

3346
02:42:42.770 --> 02:42:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I think a disrespect to the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3347
02:42:45.020 --> 02:42:48.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it disrespects the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people have paid money to see you.</v>

3348
02:42:48.260 --> 02:42:53.260
<v Speaker 1>They deserve entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just from you but from other people </v>

3349
02:42:53.260 --> 02:42:56.111
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you shouldn't be scared of other </v>

3350
02:42:56.111 --> 02:42:59.711
<v Speaker 1>people being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't take away from you being </v>

3351
02:42:59.711 --> 02:43:02.051
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way it would take away is if </v>

3352
02:43:02.051 --> 02:43:03.200
<v Speaker 1>the person on before you is stealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>your material or what it's called,</v>

3353
02:43:03.201 --> 02:43:08.201
<v Speaker 1>stepping on your material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you know you had a very </v>

3354
02:43:08.201 --> 02:43:08.201
<v Speaker 1>particular subject that you were famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

3355
02:43:08.201 --> 02:43:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Like jim gaffigan likes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk about hot pockets.</v>

3356
02:43:10.221 --> 02:43:12.160
<v Speaker 1>He does this whole hot pocket bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really hilarious.</v>

3357
02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:14.730
<v Speaker 1>If you went on before I even started </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about hot pockets,</v>

3358
02:43:14.740 --> 02:43:19.740
<v Speaker 1>you would kind of step on his bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you would and people will do </v>

3359
02:43:19.740 --> 02:43:20.680
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same shit heads like that actor that</v>

3360
02:43:20.681 --> 02:43:25.681
<v Speaker 1>I told you that we'd like to go up to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and say it was fat right before </v>

3361
02:43:25.681 --> 02:43:25.681
<v Speaker 1>he would go and read his lines.</v>

3362
02:43:26.020 --> 02:43:31.020
<v Speaker 1>That's that same sort of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that same sort of famine thinking you </v>

3363
02:43:31.020 --> 02:43:33.220
<v Speaker 1>like another person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Success should be inspirational to you.</v>

3364
02:43:33.250 --> 02:43:37.390
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be detrimental to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I.</v>

3365
02:43:37.391 --> 02:43:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the other thing is I'm a fan of</v>

3366
02:43:40.541 --> 02:43:42.040
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to laugh.</v>

3367
02:43:42.130 --> 02:43:47.130
<v Speaker 1>So I bring joey diaz who I personally </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is the funniest guy who's ever </v>

3368
02:43:47.130 --> 02:43:50.131
<v Speaker 1>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bring him to open for me because I </v>

3369
02:43:50.131 --> 02:43:51.220
<v Speaker 1>want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be in a hilarious state before</v>

3370
02:43:51.221 --> 02:43:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I go onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be laughing.</v>

3371
02:43:52.661 --> 02:43:57.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not worried about not being funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if I've done my job,</v>

3372
02:43:57.820 --> 02:43:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I've done the work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be good.</v>

3373
02:43:59.770 --> 02:44:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Like don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't worry about that.</v>

3374
02:44:02.261 --> 02:44:05.050
<v Speaker 1>That worrying is the enemy of comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

3375
02:44:05.140 --> 02:44:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

3376
02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:11.040
<v Speaker 1>it's pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bring murderers with main man </v>

3377
02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:11.040
<v Speaker 1>everywhere I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>duncan,</v>

3378
02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:11.620
<v Speaker 1>ari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jo.</v>

3379
02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I just bring the biggest killers that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could find.</v>

3380
02:44:14.990 --> 02:44:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I take headliners at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taken greg fitzsimmons on the road </v>

3381
02:44:19.990 --> 02:44:19.990
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3382
02:44:19.990 --> 02:44:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I like doing shows with guys who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking awesome.</v>

3383
02:44:21.731 --> 02:44:23.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it's reaLly important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3384
02:44:24.040 --> 02:44:28.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's not because I want to die </v>
<v Speaker 1>something because we want to put my back</v>

3385
02:44:28.841 --> 02:44:31.570
<v Speaker 1>up against the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want the audience to get their money's</v>

3386
02:44:31.571 --> 02:44:35.200
<v Speaker 1>worth and I want to be around my friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I also want to support my friends.</v>

3387
02:44:35.830 --> 02:44:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason to bring in joey and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ari and duncan on the road with me all </v>

3388
02:44:40.830 --> 02:44:43.951
<v Speaker 1>these years is it's selfish because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to have a good time and I want to </v>

3389
02:44:43.951 --> 02:44:45.100
<v Speaker 1>be with them and I want to enjoy myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that.</v>

3390
02:44:45.250 --> 02:44:50.250
<v Speaker 1>But also I want people to know how good </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys are and a lot of these guys </v>

3391
02:44:50.250 --> 02:44:51.100
<v Speaker 1>are good in a really fucked up way.</v>

3392
02:44:51.100 --> 02:44:56.100
<v Speaker 1>That's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really palatable for comedy </v>

3393
02:44:56.100 --> 02:44:58.150
<v Speaker 1>central.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard for them to get on hbo.</v>

3394
02:44:58.360 --> 02:44:59.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a guy like joey diaz,</v>

3395
02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:02.350
<v Speaker 1>the only way for that guy to get famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the internet.</v>

3396
02:45:02.530 --> 02:45:05.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what made him famous and my help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3397
02:45:05.171 --> 02:45:10.171
<v Speaker 1>helping get him out there in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people that would never </v>

3398
02:45:10.171 --> 02:45:13.591
<v Speaker 1>have had an opportunity to see him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling people as I introduced him </v>

3399

<v Speaker 6>you know I'm going with god.</v>

3432
02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:30.200
<v Speaker 6>It was the so disingenuous from a </v>
<v Speaker 6>harvard graduate.</v>

3433
02:46:30.201 --> 02:46:30.420
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:34.490
<v Speaker 7>fucking have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have my own bill riley's story.</v>

3436
02:46:34.820 --> 02:46:36.430
<v Speaker 7>Please tell it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3437
02:46:36.450 --> 02:46:40.490
<v Speaker 7>48 laws of power just come out in </v>
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] 98 and bill o'reilly decides</v>

3438
02:46:40.491 --> 02:46:43.640
<v Speaker 7>to have me on the if o'reilly factor,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which was big then,</v>

3439
02:46:43.641 --> 02:46:47.070
<v Speaker 7>but not as big as it became later on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so I'm like,</v>

3440
02:46:47.230 --> 02:46:49.610
<v Speaker 7>this is like one of my first shows I've </v>
<v Speaker 7>ever been on you.</v>

3441
02:46:49.611 --> 02:46:50.120
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3442
02:46:50.150 --> 02:46:50.960
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

3443
02:46:53.090 --> 02:46:54.770
<v Speaker 7>Nothing like this ever happened to me </v>
<v Speaker 7>before.</v>

3444
02:46:54.980 --> 02:46:59.980
<v Speaker 7>And basically you go to a studio in los </v>
<v Speaker 7>angeles where he's in New York and </v>

3445
02:47:01.250 --> 02:47:04.490
<v Speaker 7>you're in this room and there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 7>around you,</v>

3446
02:47:04.491 --> 02:47:08.150
<v Speaker 7>and they put an earphone in your head </v>
<v Speaker 7>and you're staring at a camera.</v>

3447
02:47:08.270 --> 02:47:13.270
<v Speaker 7>You don't see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You just hear bill o'reilly's stupid </v>

3448
02:47:13.270 --> 02:47:13.520
<v Speaker 7>fucking voice in your ear asking you </v>
<v Speaker 7>questions.</v>

3449
02:47:13.670 --> 02:47:16.160
<v Speaker 7>It's like you're on drugs and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 7>disconcerting.</v>

3450
02:47:16.310 --> 02:47:21.310
<v Speaker 7>It's like the guy who's trying to put </v>
<v Speaker 7>you off your game before and you're </v>

3451
02:47:21.310 --> 02:47:21.470
<v Speaker 7>already put off your game the moment you</v>
<v Speaker 7>start.</v>

3452
02:47:21.620 --> 02:47:26.620
<v Speaker 7>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he interviews me and I prepared like </v>

3453
02:47:26.620 --> 02:47:26.620
<v Speaker 7>shit for this interview because I knew </v>
<v Speaker 7>the questions coming.</v>

3454
02:47:26.690 --> 02:47:31.690
<v Speaker 7>It was all about monica lewinsky and </v>
<v Speaker 7>clinton and the scandal and the 48 laws </v>

3455
02:47:31.690 --> 02:47:33.830
<v Speaker 7>and I nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he said,</v>

3456
02:47:33.980 --> 02:47:35.030
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that was a great interview,</v>

3457
02:47:35.031 --> 02:47:36.320
<v Speaker 7>robert.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to have you on again.</v>

3458
02:47:37.150 --> 02:47:37.970
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wow.</v>

3459
02:47:38.030 --> 02:47:40.610
<v Speaker 7>And so I'm feeling pretty good about </v>
<v Speaker 7>myself.</v>

3460
02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:44.570
<v Speaker 7>So four weeks later I trudged back to </v>
<v Speaker 7>that office and I sit in that same chair</v>

3461
02:47:44.571 --> 02:47:49.571
<v Speaker 7>with the little earphone in my head and </v>
<v Speaker 7>he proceeds to just rip me to shreds </v>

3462
02:47:49.790 --> 02:47:52.120
<v Speaker 7>about what a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3463
02:47:52.130 --> 02:47:54.920
<v Speaker 7>essentially he hated the 48 laws of </v>
<v Speaker 7>power,</v>

3464
02:47:54.921 --> 02:47:59.120
<v Speaker 7>he liked the writing or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he was just using his game.</v>

3465
02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:04.420
<v Speaker 7>He was completely,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was just using it as a way to attack </v>

3466
02:48:04.420 --> 02:48:07.070
<v Speaker 7>clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I wasn't wanting to do that.</v>

3467
02:48:07.220 --> 02:48:08.750
<v Speaker 7>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sorry.</v>

3468
02:48:08.751 --> 02:48:12.980
<v Speaker 7>He was just like totally messing with me</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I was so expecting the opposite that</v>

3469
02:48:12.981 --> 02:48:14.150
<v Speaker 7>I was like woo.</v>

3470
02:48:14.420 --> 02:48:15.870
<v Speaker 7>And then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3471
02:48:16.110 --> 02:48:17.090
<v Speaker 7>and then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

3472
02:48:17.630 --> 02:48:20.390
<v Speaker 7>what about this law about use selective </v>
<v Speaker 7>honesty?</v>

3473
02:48:20.391 --> 02:48:20.930
<v Speaker 7>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>weLl,</v>

3474
02:48:20.931 --> 02:48:24.170
<v Speaker 7>it's something that politicians and </v>
<v Speaker 7>business people use all the time.</v>

3475
02:48:24.171 --> 02:48:29.171
<v Speaker 7>Like lyndon johnson for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then I was about to explain how </v>

3476
02:48:29.171 --> 02:48:29.330
<v Speaker 7>lyndon johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he cuts me off.</v>

3477
02:48:29.331 --> 02:48:30.260
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yes.</v>

3478
02:48:30.261 --> 02:48:35.261
<v Speaker 7>The same man who said 58,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>men of our young men to death in </v>

3479
02:48:35.261 --> 02:48:36.110
<v Speaker 7>Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's break for a commercial.</v>

3480
02:48:36.650 --> 02:48:41.480
<v Speaker 7>And that was the end of the interview.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So he like made me look like a.</v>

3481
02:48:41.481 --> 02:48:46.190
<v Speaker 7>I was supporting lyndon johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 7>massacring 58,000</v>

3482
02:48:46.191 --> 02:48:51.191
<v Speaker 7>americans in Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He manipulated me and humiliated me and </v>

3483
02:48:51.191 --> 02:48:53.500
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and um,</v>

3484
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:58.990
<v Speaker 7>the whole thing was he hates the 48 laws</v>
<v Speaker 7>of power because it's all about </v>

3485
02:48:58.990 --> 02:49:02.921
<v Speaker 7>manipulation and ugliness and he's the </v>
<v Speaker 7>most fucking manipulative interview you </v>

3486
02:49:02.921 --> 02:49:05.210
<v Speaker 7>could ever imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look how he manipulated me,</v>

3487
02:49:05.350 --> 02:49:08.040
<v Speaker 7>be completely set me up by making me</v>

3488
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:11.700
<v Speaker 6>think this was going to be like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>softball interview where we were just,</v>

3489
02:49:11.730 --> 02:49:12.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3490
02:49:12.361 --> 02:49:17.361
<v Speaker 6>he's a hater.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He just hated that someone else wrote </v>

3491
02:49:17.361 --> 02:49:17.361
<v Speaker 6>something brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's all it is.</v>

3492
02:49:17.361 --> 02:49:17.810
<v Speaker 6>That guys a fucking hater.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's,</v>

3493
02:49:17.850 --> 02:49:20.740
<v Speaker 6>he's the ultimate hater.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it was a,</v>

3494
02:49:20.750 --> 02:49:24.990
<v Speaker 6>it was a special type of looking glass </v>
<v Speaker 6>that allowed people to see bill o'reilly</v>

3495
02:49:24.991 --> 02:49:26.760
<v Speaker 6>for the fucking monster that he was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3496
02:49:26.761 --> 02:49:31.761
<v Speaker 6>And I find it just the book incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 6>ridiculous that that guy got to </v>

3497
02:49:31.761 --> 02:49:32.010
<v Speaker 6>interview a obama,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3498
02:49:32.011 --> 02:49:37.011
<v Speaker 6>not that I think obama's particularly </v>
<v Speaker 6>unique and special human being </v>

3499
02:49:37.140 --> 02:49:42.140
<v Speaker 6>relatively to what his position is and </v>
<v Speaker 6>what could have been done by a guy like </v>

3500
02:49:42.140 --> 02:49:43.110
<v Speaker 6>that in that position.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think that,</v>

3501
02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:48.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>having an obama being interviewed by </v>

3502
02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:49.170
<v Speaker 6>this fucking buffoon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think obama has the most thankless job</v>

3503
02:49:49.171 --> 02:49:52.620
<v Speaker 6>probably in the history of the world and</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe the most impossible job.</v>

3504
02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:55.260
<v Speaker 6>I don't think he's done the best that he</v>
<v Speaker 6>could with it,</v>

3505
02:49:55.261 --> 02:49:58.050
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think anybody can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you're set up.</v>

3506
02:49:58.350 --> 02:50:01.560
<v Speaker 6>That's what I've come to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The more I think about being a president</v>

3507
02:50:01.561 --> 02:50:06.561
<v Speaker 6>and more think about dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>house and dealing with congress and the </v>

3508
02:50:06.561 --> 02:50:10.221
<v Speaker 6>senate and all the fucking laws and just</v>
<v Speaker 6>just look at what's happened to his </v>

3509
02:50:10.221 --> 02:50:11.280
<v Speaker 6>hair.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The gray.</v>

3510
02:50:11.340 --> 02:50:13.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that happens all the and gray.</v>

3511
02:50:13.081 --> 02:50:14.610
<v Speaker 6>But like in this course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like a year.</v>

3512
02:50:14.611 --> 02:50:19.611
<v Speaker 6>It just suddenly turned gray.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think we can even imagine the </v>

3513
02:50:19.611 --> 02:50:22.311
<v Speaker 6>kind of pressure that you'd have to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>to be the leader or the supposedly </v>

3514
02:50:22.311 --> 02:50:23.700
<v Speaker 6>commander in chief of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 6>superpower of the world has ever known,</v>

3515
02:50:23.701 --> 02:50:25.920
<v Speaker 6>which wants to consume the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3516
02:50:25.930 --> 02:50:29.310
<v Speaker 6>this crazy super power that literally </v>
<v Speaker 6>thrives on consuming the earth.</v>

3517
02:50:29.610 --> 02:50:34.350
<v Speaker 6>I think we can gain so much from </v>
<v Speaker 6>listening to eisenhower speech about the</v>

3518
02:50:34.351 --> 02:50:36.600
<v Speaker 6>military industrial complex when he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>leaving office,</v>

3519
02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:41.720
<v Speaker 6>that intense speech warning the people </v>
<v Speaker 6>about the military industrial complex </v>

3520
02:50:42.210 --> 02:50:44.340
<v Speaker 6>and the dangers of it and the influence </v>
<v Speaker 6>of it.</v>

3521
02:50:44.340 --> 02:50:49.340
<v Speaker 6>I don't think we could even imagine what</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is actually like when you're in </v>

3522
02:50:49.340 --> 02:50:49.530
<v Speaker 6>office.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3523
02:50:50.360 --> 02:50:55.360
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to think that obama,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one day we'll write a book explaining </v>

3524
02:50:55.360 --> 02:50:55.620
<v Speaker 6>everything and we'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3525
02:50:55.621 --> 02:51:00.621
<v Speaker 6>I get it because I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't get how he could have made the </v>

3526
02:51:00.621 --> 02:51:02.790
<v Speaker 6>decisions that he's made based on what </v>
<v Speaker 6>he said before he got into office,</v>

3527
02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:08.000
<v Speaker 6>unless he's totally full of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I'd like to think that he's not </v>

3528
02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.720
<v Speaker 6>that set him getting interviewed by a </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking buffoon like bill riley.</v>

3529
02:51:10.721 --> 02:51:15.721
<v Speaker 6>It's just like it's watching that and </v>
<v Speaker 6>just that he's one of the most popular </v>

3530
02:51:16.681 --> 02:51:18.480
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's so silly.</v>

3531
02:51:18.481 --> 02:51:21.210
<v Speaker 6>It's so silly that he's one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 6>popular people on television.</v>

3532
02:51:21.211 --> 02:51:23.250
<v Speaker 6>It's so fucking silly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>

3533
02:51:23.310 --> 02:51:25.440
<v Speaker 6>it's just you'll get no argument from </v>
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>

3534
02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:27.060
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3535
02:51:27.150 --> 02:51:32.150
<v Speaker 6>it's unnecessary and I think I </v>
<v Speaker 6>personally believe that that style of </v>

3536
02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:35.721
<v Speaker 6>television is like fucking silent films </v>
<v Speaker 6>where you debate a very important issue </v>

3537
02:51:36.660 --> 02:51:39.800
<v Speaker 6>on a split screen for six minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3538
02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:41.330
<v Speaker 6>people yell over yell,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3539
02:51:41.340 --> 02:51:42.900
<v Speaker 6>well bill,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not the case.</v>

3540
02:51:42.901 --> 02:51:45.630
<v Speaker 6>And rambam fracking doesn't produce any </v>
<v Speaker 6>negative results.</v>

3541
02:51:47.360 --> 02:51:48.600
<v Speaker 6>We'll be right back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3542
02:51:48.601 --> 02:51:50.760
<v Speaker 6>we won't be right back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is not the way to talk.</v>

3543
02:51:50.850 --> 02:51:52.660
<v Speaker 6>This is not the way to address complex </v>
<v Speaker 6>issues.</v>

3544
02:51:52.661 --> 02:51:54.900
<v Speaker 6>It's just not the way to have </v>
<v Speaker 6>interesting discussions.</v>

3545
02:51:54.901 --> 02:51:57.930
<v Speaker 6>Did you ever see John Stewart on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>firing line years ago?</v>

3546
02:51:57.990 --> 02:51:59.910
<v Speaker 6>We almost five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3547
02:52:02.210 --> 02:52:04.920
<v Speaker 6>I was supposeD to pimp something that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>forgot to.</v>

3548
02:52:05.470 --> 02:52:07.350
<v Speaker 6>What he supposed to been,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3549
02:52:08.050 --> 02:52:10.360
<v Speaker 6>some special offers for getting the book</v>
<v Speaker 6>mastery.</v>

3550
02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:11.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's right.</v>

3551
02:52:11.320 --> 02:52:12.790
<v Speaker 6>Didn't somebody emailing that or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that?</v>

3552
02:52:12.850 --> 02:52:14.350
<v Speaker 6>Is it too late to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3553
02:52:14.351 --> 02:52:19.351
<v Speaker 6>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now we've probably lost everybody by </v>

3554
02:52:19.351 --> 02:52:19.351
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's still here.</v>

3555
02:52:19.351 --> 02:52:21.040
<v Speaker 6>If people still about still in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd be amazed.</v>

3556
02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:26.120
<v Speaker 6>These people sticking into the end,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most of the people listening to this or </v>

3557
02:52:26.120 --> 02:52:29.260
<v Speaker 6>commuting or they're on the treadmill or</v>
<v Speaker 6>on a plane or something like that,</v>

3558
02:52:29.590 --> 02:52:34.120
<v Speaker 6>but a huge majority of them are,</v>

<v Speaker 6>And they listen.</v>

3574
02:53:23.171 --> 02:53:25.900
<v Speaker 6>the book for reasons that don't have </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything to do with the quality of it.</v>

3575
02:53:26.610 --> 02:53:29.380
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

<v Speaker 6>about the writing of the book itself and</v>
<v Speaker 6>things that I explained today about my </v>

3583
02:53:53.960 --> 02:53:54.750
<v Speaker 2>robert's process because I've looked at </v>

3585
02:53:59.751 --> 02:54:02.460
<v Speaker 2>stories that almost didn't make the cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like the director's cut.</v>

<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>8 million people.</v>

3588
02:54:07.240 --> 02:54:09.380

<v Speaker 2>than five,</v>

3589
02:54:09.420 --> 02:54:11.130
<v Speaker 2>for those of you thinking about reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>mastery,</v>

3590
02:54:11.131 --> 02:54:14.910
<v Speaker 2>I've read it and it's been an invaluable</v>
<v Speaker 2>tool along with the rest of your books.</v>

3591
02:54:15.140 --> 02:54:16.260

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3592
02:54:16.261 --> 02:54:20.490
<v Speaker 2>you allow people to get the best out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and that's something that I'm</v>

3593
02:54:20.491 --> 02:54:25.491
<v Speaker 2>incredibly passionate about and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>these are incredible tools to have and </v>

3594
02:54:25.491 --> 02:54:28.020
<v Speaker 2>you decide what to do with these tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a unique individual,</v>

3595
02:54:28.140 --> 02:54:33.140
<v Speaker 2>but there's no doubt that knowledge is </v>
<v Speaker 2>power in itself and you can use that.</v>

3596
02:54:33.271 --> 02:54:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Power for however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however means you want to do it.</v>

3597
02:54:35.940 --> 02:54:40.940
<v Speaker 2>It's up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the books have knowledge and when </v>

3598
02:54:40.940 --> 02:54:44.271
<v Speaker 2>you consume those books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that knowledge will translate into your </v>

3599
02:54:44.271 --> 02:54:44.271
<v Speaker 2>own personal power cliches.</v>
