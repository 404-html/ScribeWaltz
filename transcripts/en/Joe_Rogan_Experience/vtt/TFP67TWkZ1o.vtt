1
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where that comes from.</v>

2
00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:06.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was just fucking tense.</v>

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.091
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

4
00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:09.250
<v Speaker 2>it's the practicality to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5
00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:09.701
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

6
00:00:09.701 --> 00:00:11.020
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a referee,</v>

7
00:00:11.021 --> 00:00:12.820
<v Speaker 2>we have walls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have whatever,</v>

8
00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:13.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fans.</v>

9
00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:16.570
<v Speaker 2>It's entertaining people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I need to know,</v>

10
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.890
<v Speaker 2>I need to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like would that be in nature,</v>

11
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be doing whatever that be</v>

12
00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:27.400
<v Speaker 2>selfdefence that'd be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>US fighting over a territory or food or</v>

13
00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:29.650
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I need to know what would happen.</v>

14
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Like if we had like that's why I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>these finishes.</v>

15
00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:36.160
<v Speaker 2>We only get 15 minutes to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell ourselves what would have happened</v>

16
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.170
<v Speaker 2>in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

17
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:40.870
<v Speaker 2>And when it goes to a decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pissed because I don't know,</v>

18
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you don't know,</v>

19
00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:46.390
<v Speaker 2>especially these three round fights</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm waking up like these last</v>

20
00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:47.770
<v Speaker 2>couple fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like late in the fight,</v>

21
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm pissed because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that would have been</v>

22
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 2>another 30 minutes or another two hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're scrapping in the woods.</v>

23
00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Like who gets the bone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

24
00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:58.640
<v Speaker 2>I want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

25
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.760
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of practicality,</v>

26
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:03.760
<v Speaker 2>and it's your survival and this is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way I get to know myself.</v>

27
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.860
<v Speaker 1>That's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gets the EU</v>

28
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>the way you just put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only you've ever heard anybody put</v>

29
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to know that the problem with</v>

30
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>vegans is the problem with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not veganism,</v>

31
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>it's people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get a room that has 100 people in</v>

32
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the odds of one of those people being a</v>

33
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>fucking idiot is a hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost 100 percent that one of them</v>

34
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>is a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>So if you get $300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people,</v>

36
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>you have 3 million fucking idiots and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those folks are vegans.</v>

37
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem with veganism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

38
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not veganism itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there's a certain percentage of</v>

39
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 1>human beings that they don't have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to become vegans,</v>

40
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just joined this group.</v>

41
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.290
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're thinking about allowing you in to</v>

43
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>the Vegan culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we want to know what your philosophy</v>

44
00:01:57.421 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

45
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Are you a hateful person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you a person that's looking to be a</v>

46
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Vegan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can just talk shit about other</v>

47
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:04.000
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you looking to be and are you</v>

48
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>looking to be in a group or a gang of</v>
<v Speaker 1>plant based Gad and put the word Vegan</v>

49
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>in front of your name and just start</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking shit because that's a lot of the</v>

50
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people read all these angry,</v>

51
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>hateful things that these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.611
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

53
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>well this is vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

54
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most vegans are not like that at all</v>

55
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.390
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people are not like that at all,</v>

56
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 1>but there's a certain percentage of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they claimed veganism and they</v>

57
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>usually put that name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word Vegan in their fucking screen</v>

58
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you can spot those assholes.</v>

59
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're proud.</v>

60
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're into it.</v>

61
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>They're in a plant based gang.</v>

62
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>That's really what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>And so what it is is not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a problem of diet.</v>

64
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem of human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people love to stand on the</v>

65
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>moral high ground that will love to</v>
<v Speaker 1>point down at all the other people.</v>

66
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a religious issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're not eating Halau or you're</v>

67
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Speaker 1>not eating kosher or you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating meat on Good Friday,</v>

68
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just decide that they have this</v>

69
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>moral high ground that you don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fuck you.</v>

70
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really comes from our own</v>

71
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>questions of our own existence and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>messiness that we're all inherently</v>

72
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>aware of that life eats life.</v>

73
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 3>So it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But whole life I thought I'd be scared</v>

74
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 3>to death and most people we all are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all terrified of fucking dying</v>

75
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 3>because we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was the closest I ever came and</v>

76
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like suddenly the fear just went away</v>

77
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 3>and it seemed logical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like of course it's over,</v>

78
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 3>like things end and I didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>

79
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have a death wish,</v>

80
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's done,</v>

81
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of,</v>

82
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 3>it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And count your blessings and be happy</v>

83
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 3>and don't be a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like don't.</v>

84
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the fucking fairy man shows up</v>

85
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 3>tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't fucking hold out.</v>

86
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 3>Don't be the last asshole at the party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go No,</v>

87
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 3>like just fucking pay the ferryman get</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a boat and go,</v>

88
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 3>we'll see what's next and stuff and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately late in time did a good job</v>

89
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 3>and I fucking wound up living and stuff.</v>

90
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.190
<v Speaker 3>So I know this much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to read a bunch of shit like after</v>

91
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 3>I nearly died and it was all nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People wrote very nice things about me</v>

92
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:06.740
<v Speaker 3>and shit and I expected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

93
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 3>creature of the Internet that some</v>
<v Speaker 3>people be like I wish he had fucking</v>

94
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck them to death and shit.</v>

95
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 3>I wish he'd stay silent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But generally it was like very nice</v>

96
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were kind of positive and stuff.</v>

97
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 3>So I was like fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

98
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

99
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:28.141
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to die but like if I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that would've been okay.</v>

100
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm back at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

101
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:35.161
<v Speaker 3>Like now until it ends like I've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

102
00:04:35.701 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 3>and it's Kinda easy as long as they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't wake up with a fucking dead girl</v>

103
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 3>are alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>

104
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't think like they'll fucking broke</v>
<v Speaker 3>me over the coals when I die in the</v>

105
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:45.400
<v Speaker 3>future and shit like that.</v>

106
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 3>But it felt weird to be so close to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>completion.</v>

107
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 3>And so having something that normally</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrifies you suddenly be like,</v>

108
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay.</v>

109
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know if you walked up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a gun in my face,</v>

110
00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I'd feel threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I kind of lost my fear of</v>

111
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.450
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like death defying.</v>

112
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 3>I won't go out and do anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>differently,</v>

113
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that dark cloud that kind of kills any</v>

114
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:13.240
<v Speaker 3>good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The moment you start thinking about like</v>

115
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 3>the fear and anxiety you're going to die</v>
<v Speaker 3>one day,</v>

116
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 3>like you know it's gone and now all of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to die one day and it's going</v>

118
00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 3>to be awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not for the reasons that you think.</v>

119
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying it's going to be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just be awesome.</v>

120
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 3>Because a finish like it's nice to</v>
<v Speaker 3>finish things.</v>

121
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.140
<v Speaker 3>We know how good it feels in life to</v>
<v Speaker 3>complete something and that's the</v>

122
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 3>biggest fucking thing in life you'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever complete is your journey.</v>

123
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.850
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't walk away going like I got</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do more.</v>

<v Speaker 3>fullest.</v>

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 3>I just got to keep doing what I've been</v>

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Like living life the way I enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do things.</v>

127
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I fail and Shit.</v>

128
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.160
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes people are on your side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes people like you fucking blow</v>

129
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Speaker 3>and just do that fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have good conversations in the process.</v>

130
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Meet interesting people here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new points</v>

131
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 4>of view and shit like that and keep at</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

132
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.350
<v Speaker 4>But it's nothing to be afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>From my perspective.</v>

133
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.880
<v Speaker 4>They were just calling me more name said</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to set up straw men.</v>

134
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:14.340
<v Speaker 4>And is this egyptologist who is in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>documentary who dismissed everything was</v>

135
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 4>still around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

136
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 4>And has he amended his position at all?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not to my knowledge.</v>

137
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 4>I haven't spoken with him for years and</v>
<v Speaker 4>years and years.</v>

138
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever speak with them off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>record or personally alone?</v>

139
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

140
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't say this off the record</v>

141
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it was off the record.</v>

142
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I will shut this years</v>
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>

143
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 4>but I'll say it now at that debate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at that debate,</v>

144
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.140
<v Speaker 4>AAA's debate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

145
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.310
<v Speaker 4>I just suddenly found myself in the hall</v>
<v Speaker 4>with him and there was no one else</v>

146
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 4>around so he could totally deny this.</v>

147
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.850
<v Speaker 4>But it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My perspective,</v>

148
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:55.450
<v Speaker 4>at least he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

149
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.620
<v Speaker 4>said something to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

150
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.560
<v Speaker 4>you don't really believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you don't really believe this.</v>

151
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 4>You just won't be on television and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

152
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.070
<v Speaker 4>be famous or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

153
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:07.611
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

154
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 4>I really do believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you know,</v>

155
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 4>I really go by the evidence and I do</v>
<v Speaker 4>think the evidence says this.</v>

156
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 4>And he served was telling me that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

157
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:17.601
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

158
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:19.540
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno.</v>

159
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.760
<v Speaker 4>I analyze what the sizing you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

160
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:23.594
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

161
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Speaker 4>And then he slept in and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then what he does is he starts</v>

162
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 4>asking me a question of some detailed</v>
<v Speaker 4>question about the geology and well,</v>

163
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:35.270
<v Speaker 4>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can such and such and I think in</v>

164
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:40.220
<v Speaker 4>hindsight might have been fed to them by</v>
<v Speaker 4>some geo archeologists just say call</v>

165
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 4>someone who does archeology but knows a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little geology.</v>

166
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.750
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

167
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 4>I realize in hindsight it was meant to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be one of those Gotcha questions.</v>

168
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 4>I guess they say nowadays where I</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be able to answer it,</v>

169
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:53.891
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

170
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 4>of course I'd thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was to me as a geologist,</v>

171
00:07:56.961 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 4>very obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I start giving him this detailed</v>

172
00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:02.180
<v Speaker 4>explanation as to why that's not the</v>
<v Speaker 4>case and why,</v>

173
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my evidence stands up,</v>

174
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.030
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah blah.</v>

175
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.490
<v Speaker 4>And we're standing there face to face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm explained this to her and I see his</v>

176
00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:14.550
<v Speaker 4>face turn and it goes blank and I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 4>midsentence.</v>

177
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 4>He just turns around and walks away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the one who realized he couldn't,</v>

178
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.580
<v Speaker 4>he couldn't refute what you were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Refute what I was saying.</v>

179
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:27.320
<v Speaker 4>And he wasn't really answered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My takeaway is that he wasn't interested</v>

180
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:30.630
<v Speaker 4>in discussing it rationally or aunts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

181
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 4>he just went to win the debate or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

182
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:35.710
<v Speaker 4>He</v>

183
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:36.461
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

184
00:08:36.461 --> 00:08:37.294
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

185
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.570
<v Speaker 5>when Charlie and I met and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I told him what my plan to sort of</v>

186
00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:43.210
<v Speaker 5>help black America and wake them up</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they understood how we had</v>

187
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.160
<v Speaker 5>fallen victim to this brainwash,</v>
<v Speaker 5>brainwash,</v>

188
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.690
<v Speaker 5>the leftist dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's this idea that because we're</v>

189
00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:51.280
<v Speaker 5>black,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have to vote Democrat and anybody</v>

190
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.740
<v Speaker 5>that is not a Democrat is racist and</v>
<v Speaker 5>against helping us.</v>

191
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 5>That is what so black Americans believe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believed it.</v>

192
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 5>I believed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

193
00:08:58.351 --> 00:08:58.900
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm a,</v>

194
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm a pretty smart girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

195
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.610
<v Speaker 5>I've always been a very smart girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always,</v>

196
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.530
<v Speaker 5>I've always been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

197
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 5>I've excelled in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in academics,</v>

198
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.810
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how did I fall victim to it?</v>

199
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 5>The exact same system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

200
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:10.890
<v Speaker 5>These three verticals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first being the family,</v>

201
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:13.890
<v Speaker 5>that breakdown of the family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The second one I'm being culture,</v>

202
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.230
<v Speaker 5>which then to me like growing up it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Jay z,</v>

203
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 5>Jay z was God to me.</v>

204
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 5>Like I would throw on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I was,</v>

205
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.310
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went through a lot of stuff when I was</v>

206
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 5>a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have a great family,</v>

207
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:22.770
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

208
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I would throw on a Jay z album and</v>

209
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 5>like whatever he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

210
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:27.720
<v Speaker 5>it was like going to church,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

211
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.090
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I can't stand them now,</v>

212
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 5>but the third vertical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

213
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.170
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he knows exactly what he's doing</v>

214
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:36.870
<v Speaker 5>and he's a trader,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but third vertical being education,</v>

215
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.540
<v Speaker 5>which was casual side trader.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

216
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like beyonce because he knows what's</v>

217
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:47.520
<v Speaker 5>happening to black America and he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody that built his entire career</v>

218
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.920
<v Speaker 5>off the backs of black America,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

219
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:52.050
<v Speaker 5>of being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy who started in the honing in,</v>

220
00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.590
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

221
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 5>queens and worked at it was a drug</v>
<v Speaker 5>dealer and worked his way up and it</v>

222
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 5>became the io for so many people in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Black America.</v>

223
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.840
<v Speaker 5>And then he stands on stage and endorses</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hillary Clinton.</v>

224
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.140
<v Speaker 5>He stands on stage and tell us black</v>
<v Speaker 5>America to put the same people in the</v>

225
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.650
<v Speaker 5>White House that locked up more black</v>
<v Speaker 5>men than any present history of United</v>

226
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.440
<v Speaker 5>States.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bill Clinton,</v>

227
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.230
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The person that stands on the crime bill</v>

228
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:13.170
<v Speaker 5>of 94 is Bill Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But because Jay Z is now focused on</v>

229
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:15.210
<v Speaker 5>getting a piece of the pie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the globalist piece of the Pie,</v>

230
00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't care about black America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

231
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.210
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's my opinion.</v>

232
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.840
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so what do you think that maybe he</v>

233
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:24.690
<v Speaker 5>thought the Donald Trump represented a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of racist white people?</v>

234
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>

235
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:27.990
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not even.</v>

236
00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:28.830
<v Speaker 5>Kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>

237
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.550
<v Speaker 5>not for a single second,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jason,</v>

238
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.640
<v Speaker 5>because Jason is very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just speak to him.</v>

239
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:34.500
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't speak to him.</v>

240
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:37.170
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know there's a certain thing where</v>

241
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:37.860
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

242
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.020
<v Speaker 5>I know that Jay z and beyonce betrayed</v>
<v Speaker 5>the black community.</v>

243
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.660
<v Speaker 5>Like there they are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they did it purposely for</v>

244
00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:43.680
<v Speaker 5>financial gain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

245
00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:44.401
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

246
00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:45.190
<v Speaker 5>I think that they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

247
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.510
<v Speaker 5>they were interested in having,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want to be the people that control</v>

248
00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:50.220
<v Speaker 5>the world and they felt that Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 5>Clinton,</v>

249
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were working with Obama very</v>

250
00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:55.260
<v Speaker 5>closely and very clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we know that the Obama</v>

251
00:10:55.261 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 5>administration worked very hard to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hillary Clinton to office and they</v>

252
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Speaker 5>wanted to stay in that group,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so they supported Hillary Clinton</v>

253
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:06.120
<v Speaker 5>who was selected behind closed doors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forget the American people to be the</v>

254
00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:07.320
<v Speaker 5>next president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>United States.</v>

255
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:07.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
