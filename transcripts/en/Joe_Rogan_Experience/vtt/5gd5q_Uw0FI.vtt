00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I started thinking about it when people have said like,</v>

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:06.681
<v Speaker 1>you pick,</v>

4
00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:07.490
<v Speaker 1>could you beat,</v>

5
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>like 12,</v>

7
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.743
<v Speaker 1>12 year olds?</v>

8
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I fuck up 12,</v>

9
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>12 year olds.</v>

10
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.173
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

11
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

12
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a hundred percent.</v>

13
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>What if they're organized?</v>

14
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

15
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.833
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a chance.</v>

16
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a chance if they all come at you at once.</v>

17
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

18
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>And they don't care about getting beat up.</v>

19
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

20
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>everybody cares about getting beat up.</v>

21
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about non humans now.</v>

22
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.751
<v Speaker 1>Well wait,</v>

23
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>what if you start training them at a young age?</v>

24
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.053
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fuck him up.</v>

25
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.263
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a chance.</v>

26
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>The first one's going to get kicked into a person who's going to get kicked hard</v>

27
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>for sure in a panic and then I'm just going to start smashing,</v>

28
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

29
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

30
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

31
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 1>I listen.</v>

32
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>If I had a fight,</v>

33
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.410
<v Speaker 1>me and 10 other dudes in a fight,</v>

34
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>a 500 pound man,</v>

35
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>that's more coyotes.</v>

36
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

37
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.831
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

38
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:46.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird looking ones.</v>

39
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>It's all very,</v>

40
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.851
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

41
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:48.481
<v Speaker 1>he buries,</v>

42
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>need a lot of berries.</v>

43
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.053
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

45
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>if I had to,</v>

46
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:52.824
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>get 10 friends and we had a fight,</v>

48
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 1>a 500 pound hulking man,</v>

49
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>we'd be fucked to be fucked.</v>

50
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>We'd be fucked.</v>

51
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.711
<v Speaker 1>We didn't,</v>

52
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:02.544
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have a chance.</v>

53
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.151
<v Speaker 1>What about 12?</v>

54
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Like Duncan trussell's.</v>

55
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Could you take that a little bit bigger now it's current form performance.</v>

56
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

57
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.083
<v Speaker 1>All up.</v>

58
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.923
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't have a chance.</v>

59
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>They are grown by the beard.</v>

60
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 1>One of them in front of me at some point.</v>

61
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>The problem with Dunkin as you wouldn't be able to really do any damage if he</v>

62
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:19.164
<v Speaker 1>got close,</v>

63
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 1>he could punch a square in the jaw and you'd laugh it off like vehicle Rocco's.</v>

64
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:23.874
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

66
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.803
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

67
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>but if you got to deal with like three Burt crushers,</v>

68
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.071
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

69
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably going to get fucked up.</v>

70
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Even if he's not a trained fighter.</v>

71
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.320
<v Speaker 1>The first guy you have to take out immediately hard as hard as you can.</v>

72
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>You also have to show consequences for everybody else.</v>

73
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>We smoke way too much pot for this pod.</v>

74
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was the right amount.</v>
