00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.830

<v Speaker 1>how you mix it up with the android</v>

3
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the apple phone that's very curious</v>

<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I used to be all Samsung.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the android and the watches.</v>

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love how it interacts,</v>

7
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 1>but then I get a girlfriend who has an</v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone.</v>

8
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.281
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

9
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>I want to have face time with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why don't you tell her to get skype,</v>

10
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>skype APP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You married,</v>

11
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>you understand what you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

12
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I got set standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

14
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the stamp lines in the sand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they have like a.</v>

15
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>They had this app on the apple now</v>
<v Speaker 1>called gear which lets you hook up your</v>

16
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>phone but you can't really interact with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

17
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>You can't like talk or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually kind of Nice.</v>

18
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>You just want to know stuff's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably.</v>

19
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were saying it's probably better that</v>

20
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>you can't interact with it because Jamie</v>
<v Speaker 1>was telling me that they could do walkie</v>

21
00:00:57.151 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>talkie with your iphones now.</v>

22
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still being announced right now.</v>

23
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know all the details,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the worldwide developers conference</v>

24
00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:08.720
<v Speaker 2>is going on the WWDC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're not new operating system.</v>

25
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:12.530
<v Speaker 2>The new Apple Watch and the new all like</v>
<v Speaker 2>automatic workout detection,</v>

26
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.480
<v Speaker 2>walkie talkie mode and something else.</v>

27
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.040
<v Speaker 1>There's just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an apple watch too.</v>

28
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can leave it at,</v>

29
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>at least sometimes I'll leave my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even bring my phone with me,</v>

30
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can.</v>

31
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Uh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel weird when you do that?</v>

32
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Because he's a rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's happening now though,</v>

33
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>like if I have my watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you look at your watch,</v>

34
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>what does that cue he accused like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go or you're missing out on or.</v>

35
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I know now when you do that it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're looking at a text</v>

36
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:39.650
<v Speaker 1>message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now it's just as rude as it just.</v>

37
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.310
<v Speaker 1>We're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't helping.</v>

38
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not helping them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I go,</v>

39
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>if I'm looking and you were talking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go like this,</v>

40
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm looked down and you think you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go someplace.</v>

41
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

42
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>not just got a text too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got a tweet,</v>

44
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.610
<v Speaker 1>I got to retweet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

47
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really weird about all this</v>

48
00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The phones and how we talk.</v>

49
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to text like you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get people to call you.</v>

50
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>You can't get people to a now and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're putting the little emojis.</v>

51
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.881
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

52
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>And then from the mode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they're putting like gifts of real</v>

53
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is how I feel.</v>

54
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.040
<v Speaker 1>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

55
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.090
<v Speaker 1>we're going in a circle because we want</v>
<v Speaker 1>human interaction,</v>

56
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>we want connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to see people.</v>

57
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>So now we're putting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're putting a celebrity up.</v>

58
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Like this is how I feel today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you put how you feel today,</v>

59
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Chris,</v>

60
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Pat Pratt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling a garbage can or something.</v>

61
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>This is my mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're slowly getting back to where</v>

62
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to actually be talking to a</v>

63
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:37.210
<v Speaker 1>real person thinks so you didn't come</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way around or I think it's going</v>

64
00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>to come all the way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>well this is this Jamie</v>

67
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 2>of yourself called me Mochi.</v>

68
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.820
<v Speaker 1>They already do that with Sandra</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samsung,</v>

69
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.070
<v Speaker 1>like it's working in the wrapping them</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

70
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.250
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm working together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm saying.</v>

71
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.510
<v Speaker 1>We're searching for trying to find ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more ourselves.</v>

72
00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>You don't need an Emoji of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just be yourself</v>

73
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 3>that they're going against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

74
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 3>there's tax on Samsung.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ar Emoji.</v>

75
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They ripped off the idea for cheap</v>

76
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 3>fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hakan on like ripping people off now.</v>

77
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 3>They were first with the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The iphone was the first of these kinds</v>

78
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 3>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first iphone,</v>

79
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 3>but androids are real close now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're real close.</v>

80
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's very debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everything after that they were</v>

81
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:24.010
<v Speaker 3>late,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like really?</v>

82
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Like on an android.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could copy and paste on an android</v>

83
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.690
<v Speaker 3>three years before you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh right.</v>

84
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.810
<v Speaker 3>An apple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've always been an android guy?</v>

85
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 3>I've always been andrew guys get another</v>
<v Speaker 3>android.</v>

86
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.610
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm going girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the man.</v>

87
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 3>You get an Android,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get it.</v>

88
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 3>You get an android,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little skype it.</v>

89
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 3>It'll be me giving bite Hernandez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>native to Android,</v>

90
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.890
<v Speaker 3>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the facetime thing is,</v>

91
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 3>there's something that's on the revenue</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>

92
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 3>like they have like their own version of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

93
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 3>They have their own version of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think people really use it.</v>

94
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 3>They have their own like Samsung video</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

95
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 3>But Samsung has one but just like what</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have say like a Google Pixel</v>

96
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:03.090
<v Speaker 3>phone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

97
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 3>That they might have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think enough people have a</v>

98
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:07.630
<v Speaker 3>google pixel phone to make that even a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

99
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

100
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 3>I thought those were really popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And are they who?</v>

101
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 3>Do you know if any one person you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has a Google Pixel could call me.</v>

102
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.840
<v Speaker 3>I have one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

103
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 3>you do not have a Google Pixel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do have one?</v>

104
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Do you use it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

105
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 3>So you were given a Google Bot one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

106
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 3>Because I wanted to try it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's what happened.</v>

107
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get text messages to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the scam because you are hooked</v>

108
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:30.810
<v Speaker 3>up to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

109
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 3>what are you showing me?</v>

110
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 3>Jamie said they do have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's with the Pixel two or something</v>

111
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's android video calling.</v>

112
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 3>It just simplifies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Enjoyed video calling.</v>

113
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get that.</v>

114
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 3>So does that only work with android?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Android to android.</v>

115
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why they don't just work</v>

116
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does an apple example just work</v>

117
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.090
<v Speaker 3>together?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't work together with text</v>

118
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:52.800
<v Speaker 3>message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See this.</v>

119
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 3>My point is really annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The I message thing is what?</v>

120
00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:59.510
<v Speaker 3>Fuck me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because everybody knew that I had an</v>

121
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.990
<v Speaker 3>iphone so they would send me because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have an iphone.</v>

122
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:06.340
<v Speaker 3>They would send me an I message and so I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was sending people text messages to like</v>

123
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm not getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like send me one and they would send</v>

124
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 3>me one and I wouldn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then I went online and looked it</v>

125
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 3>up and it said you have to disable I</v>
<v Speaker 3>message.</v>

126
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.170
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I disabled my message.</v>

127
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 3>Then you have to call up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to actually call up someone.</v>

128
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm done at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At that point you have to call up</v>

129
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:29.251
<v Speaker 3>someone and tell them to take your email</v>
<v Speaker 3>address off of the I message database.</v>

130
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I do that and I say take this email.</v>

131
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 3>Well why are you doing that sir?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I switched over to an android</v>

132
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like pause,</v>

133
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:42.250
<v Speaker 3>like I just fucking killed the queen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like come on,</v>

134
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.240
<v Speaker 3>like you heard an alarm go off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of millions of fucking people</v>

135
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know anything about me.</v>

136
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 3>Why do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you give a fuck what they</v>

137
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:52.030
<v Speaker 3>like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They literally,</v>

138
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 3>the guy on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt bad that I was switching over.</v>

139
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.420
<v Speaker 3>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

140
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 3>it still wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it didn't work for Dow.</v>

141
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 3>Get like one out of three text messages</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it all happened while I was on</v>

142
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:03.440
<v Speaker 3>vacation.</v>

143
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 3>I just figured I'm going to try this</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone while I'm on vacation.</v>

144
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 3>Fuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can't.</v>

145
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 3>They got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you roped in with that.</v>

146
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Goddamn that I messaged shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

147
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 3>That's the apples thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No matter where you are in the world and</v>

148
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have apple.</v>

149
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 3>A lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Samsung has taken over in terms</v>

150
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:21.010
<v Speaker 3>of life for android.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

151
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 3>I love the Samsung phones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't make good phones.</v>

152
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 3>They make great phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The difference between the androids</v>

153
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 3>though is that Samsung does not update</v>
<v Speaker 3>their software very often.</v>

154
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 3>Their update,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they update security patches but they</v>

155
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 3>don't need to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Google Pixel phones get the latest</v>

156
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 3>software right when it gets released and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like when Oreo comes out,</v>

157
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 3>an eight point one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different operating systems</v>

158
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 3>come out there better supposedly for</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for how long a week.</v>

159
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean we know it takes a long time</v>
<v Speaker 3>before they come out on St.</v>

160
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 3>on Samsung phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Long time.</v>

161
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 3>Like six months sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

162
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes a long time.</v>

163
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 3>Well there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You heard it break the breaking news</v>

164
00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 3>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's what the problem was.</v>

165
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.581
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also.</v>

166
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 3>Samsung puts their own shit over android</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Ios.</v>

167
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.170
<v Speaker 3>Real android dorks want pure android and</v>
<v Speaker 3>pure android.</v>

168
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 3>You really only get with the pixel</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you can.</v>

169
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.350
<v Speaker 3>Are you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know about how do you like,</v>

170
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 3>can you hack them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can hack them,</v>

171
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:18.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can like how you use,</v>

172
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.320
<v Speaker 3>what do they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jail break your phone and all that kind</v>

173
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 3>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've made that just common now</v>

174
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.500
<v Speaker 3>because it used to be like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

175
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 3>they would lock it down where like let's</v>
<v Speaker 3>say you had verizon,</v>

176
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.050
<v Speaker 3>so you could only use this phone on</v>
<v Speaker 3>verizon with verizon stuff and then you</v>

177
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 3>would jailbreaker then you couldn't like</v>
<v Speaker 3>open it up to like all these other types</v>

178
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:37.124
<v Speaker 3>of apps.</v>

179
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.660
<v Speaker 3>If they would stop being greedy freaks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just stop being so greedy.</v>

180
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.930

<v Speaker 3>I'm still going to be on your system.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm still paying your $200 a month for</v>
<v Speaker 3>your stupid phone.</v>

182
00:07:48.431 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 3>A surface and you do a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little extra,</v>

183
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.140
<v Speaker 3>a little extra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extra little extra.</v>

184
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.180
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me started on that when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>

185
00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I know motherfucker and I can't believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shit we have to deal with.</v>

186
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.950
<v Speaker 3>Eric Griffin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

187
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.810
<v Speaker 3>That was weird though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

188
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

189
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 3>There's only two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also weird.</v>

190
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.440
<v Speaker 3>There's only two operating systems</v>
<v Speaker 3>heating side aside,</v>

191
00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 3>but that's how we are in our country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can only Republican or Democrat.</v>

192
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.830
<v Speaker 3>Apple or android.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember windows?</v>

193
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:19.491
<v Speaker 3>Phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Windows.</v>

194
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:23.480
<v Speaker 3>Phone wasn't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that bad.</v>

195
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.130
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who had a windows phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

196
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:25.970
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is kinda cool.</v>

197
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 3>It had tiles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like windows 10 windows,</v>

198
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 3>10 books with titles like a Cayman went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody cares about that and went look at</v>

199
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 3>you just like I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't deal with.</v>

200
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hear what everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get into the phone game,</v>

201
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.910
<v Speaker 3>but what's crazy is how many people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>windows computers.</v>

202
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.370
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing that windows had a phone</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people are like,</v>

203
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they know all the problems they</v>

204
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:51.050
<v Speaker 3>had with their.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With their computer.</v>

205
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.290
<v Speaker 3>I stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even remember the last time I</v>

206
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:57.510
<v Speaker 3>had a windows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I strictly went app because it's just so</v>

207
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 3>easy to use and it's still not easy to</v>
<v Speaker 3>use.</v>

208
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 3>You know what's not easy though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm apple does not have good keyboards.</v>

209
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have a desktop keyboard at</v>
<v Speaker 3>home and you can add a second keyboard,</v>

210
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.880
<v Speaker 3>you know like by a mechanical keyboard.</v>

211
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.490
<v Speaker 3>If you're a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you like to write.</v>

212
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 3>The problem with apple keyboards is</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no key travel.</v>

213
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very shallow,</v>

214
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.200
<v Speaker 3>so it's like a just a tiny movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Click,</v>

215
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.561
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>

216
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:23.394
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>
<v Speaker 3>click.</v>

217
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.270
<v Speaker 3>What I use is I use a think pad and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why I use the</v>

218
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:30.170
<v Speaker 3>thinkpad is there's like travel to these</v>
<v Speaker 3>keys.</v>

219
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 3>These keys have motion to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you just your old school.</v>

220
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the thing is you feel where the</v>

221
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:40.650
<v Speaker 3>keys are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like.</v>

222
00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:44.910
<v Speaker 3>So as you're typing I can just look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the screen and I don't have to look down</v>

223
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 3>at the keyboard and they depressed with</v>
<v Speaker 3>your fingers.</v>

224
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's motion to it.</v>

225
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 3>So there's no accidental pressing of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>keys.</v>

226
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.600
<v Speaker 3>Did you take typing in high school?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

227
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember any of it though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

228
00:09:56.311 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 3>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might have my high school year.</v>

229
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.050
<v Speaker 3>Was it last year that they had typing at</v>
<v Speaker 3>my school?</v>

230
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.100
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

231
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.460
<v Speaker 3>I remember they were saying like this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the longer.</v>

<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

262
00:11:17.881 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 3>It has an old school feel to what you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

263
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.890
<v Speaker 3>You know you still have a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>anytime somebody is using windows.</v>

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.220
<v Speaker 3>They're connected to the past still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

267
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.530
<v Speaker 3>I just switched over to a reasonably</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I.</v>

268
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.080
<v Speaker 3>I fucked around with a thinkpad one day</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

269
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.660
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this keyboard is so much better because</v>

270
00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:36.410
<v Speaker 3>I have a Mac book to one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Mac book pros.</v>

271
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.920

<v Speaker 3>you just can't handle it.</v>

272
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.340
<v Speaker 3>It's just not a good keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's shit.</v>

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.800
<v Speaker 3>It's not just bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's shit.</v>

274
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.950
<v Speaker 3>It's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's no options.</v>

275
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:50.100
<v Speaker 3>Like if you want a laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't give you options for</v>

276
00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:50.631
<v Speaker 3>keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

277
00:11:50.631 --> 00:11:53.590
<v Speaker 3>You can't customize the now and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a different one.</v>

278
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:56.320
<v Speaker 3>Like if you want windows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get an a seuss.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the desktop.</v>

283
00:12:04.431 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of my shit,</v>

284
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:08.680
<v Speaker 3>I go in the Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>third class action lawsuit over Mac</v>

285
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pro Keyboard,</v>

286
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.220
<v Speaker 3>allegedly fraudulent concealment.</v>

287
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.710
<v Speaker 3>This guy's a research king right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

288
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.980
<v Speaker 3>But look at that keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look how fucking shallow those keys are.</v>

289
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.410
<v Speaker 3>That's bullshit west to keep it thin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

290
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's bad for a writer.</v>

291
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.790
<v Speaker 3>If you're a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a shitty design.</v>

292
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.770
<v Speaker 3>Remember how thick too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

293
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.200
<v Speaker 3>But make it a little thicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

294
00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Who gives a fuck if it's an extra half a</v>
<v Speaker 3>millimeter,</v>

295
00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:35.530
<v Speaker 3>if you have good keyboard feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it depends on what you're doing.</v>

296
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 3>If you're the type of person just writes</v>
<v Speaker 3>an email every now and then,</v>

297
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.590
<v Speaker 3>but I fucking right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need a keyboard.</v>

298
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.610
<v Speaker 3>I feel you need it so I could take a</v>
<v Speaker 3>beating too.</v>

299
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still fuck around with that when I,</v>

300
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still have it so I fuck around with</v>

301
00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:48.994
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I,</v>

302
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.190
<v Speaker 3>if I travel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I go online,</v>

303
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:54.220
<v Speaker 3>if I'm just just web surfing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine for that.</v>

304
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.370
<v Speaker 3>But it sucks a fat one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it deals with.</v>

305
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.580
<v Speaker 3>Did you get a text message?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm already getting messages about this</v>

<v Speaker 3>you really want it to.</v>

315
00:13:29.471 --> 00:13:32.390
<v Speaker 3>Like if it got political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem.</v>

316
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.660
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're dealing with with</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

317
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.670
<v Speaker 3>A famous person who becomes the</v>

<v Speaker 3>super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super famous.</v>

335
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.420

<v Speaker 3>electoral college though by the way.</v>

336
00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:19.990
<v Speaker 3>Not to get political but does help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean did he rigged that?</v>

337
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.450
<v Speaker 3>But you can't make it but played the</v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't have a popularity contest,</v>

339
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.380
<v Speaker 3>but it is a popularity contest no matter</v>
<v Speaker 3>what.</v>

340
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.650
<v Speaker 3>Even with the Electoral College,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just have to be popular in Iowa.</v>

341
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Popular in Ohio know how to do that and</v>

<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

348
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 3>they already</v>

349
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.240
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call it?</v>

350
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Like facial recognition software.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

351
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.450
<v Speaker 1>their phones have fingerprint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's like three different ways to</v>

352
00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:02.450
<v Speaker 1>like register and then you'll get</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's vote.</v>

353
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.210
<v Speaker 1>I always say vote should be like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbia DVD.</v>

354
00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:06.680
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember Columbia Dvds,</v>

355
00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:08.890
<v Speaker 1>they would just send them just giving it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

356
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.840
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

357
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Then your vote goes to the Republican</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you go.</v>

358
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't want this from the numbers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that people don't know what we're</v>

359
00:15:19.311 --> 00:15:21.020
<v Speaker 1>talking about with Columbia DVD because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're old.</v>

360
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.970
<v Speaker 1>But back in the day you would sign up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like cassette tapes and they would</v>

361
00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:28.350
<v Speaker 1>send you a bunch of cassettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd pick.</v>

362
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Go to book club?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

363
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:32.030
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they would send them to you,</v>

364
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.350
<v Speaker 1>but it was only like a dollar and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>get like 15 sets,</v>

365
00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:37.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get like aerosmith and is it still</v>

366
00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:38.470
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>

367
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.970
<v Speaker 1>It's still on but the fuck out and check</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>

368
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.290
<v Speaker 1>They finally made it so they don't just</v>
<v Speaker 1>send it automatically because people</v>

369
00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:47.080
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were quitting the service.</v>

370
00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they would just send you.</v>

371
00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 1>So you would pay and you had like say</v>
<v Speaker 1>three days and if you,</v>

372
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.820
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't send it back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would charge you to $9.</v>

373
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm saying about voting.</v>

374
00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.980
<v Speaker 1>This is how we should vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty $5 page right there.</v>

375
00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:03.530
<v Speaker 1>He's showing us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd be like all your candidates for</v>

376
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Democrat and if you don't eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have three days to pick.</v>

377
00:16:06.571 --> 00:16:08.090
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't pick your vote goes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

378
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.860
<v Speaker 1>That's how they should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show me what you just showed me.</v>

379
00:16:09.861 --> 00:16:11.840
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you show them?</v>

380
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Look on the details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>

381
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.400
<v Speaker 1>It says it's $35 for like two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

382
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Free shipping is only eligible for</v>

383
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:21.320
<v Speaker 1>orders of two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have more dvds with a sub total of $35.</v>

384
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Say preorders are not eligible for free</v>
<v Speaker 1>shipping.</v>

385
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they say it's free shipping,</v>

386
00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:28.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's not free shipping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they're doing?</v>

387
00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.270
<v Speaker 1>And they say it's 95 each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But free shipping,</v>

388
00:16:32.271 --> 00:16:36.950
<v Speaker 1>that's more than $35 free shipping on</v>
<v Speaker 1>two plus dvds,</v>

389
00:16:36.951 --> 00:16:41.120
<v Speaker 1>but the dvds or nine 95.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So two plus is what for?</v>

390
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Because it has to be more than $35.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking crux.</v>

391
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.110
<v Speaker 1>They're all crooks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The record companies are so gross,</v>

392
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.300
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking to people that had</v>

393
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Steven Tyler and here was explaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens now with streaming,</v>

394
00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:55.010
<v Speaker 1>so that was great by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's great,</v>

396
00:16:56.001 --> 00:16:56.834
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

397
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

398
00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:01.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean you want to talk about a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was singing it all.</v>

399
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm never surprised when someone like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that with that type of personality.</v>

400
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised that you see the kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of life and career he's had.</v>

401
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Those people aren't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a notch above the norm.</v>

402
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely a notch above the noise.</v>

403
00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Super sweet guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice to everybody.</v>

404
00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Just oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hugging everybody.</v>

405
00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:20.300
<v Speaker 1>And really friendly as time of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

406
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there was a super dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think so come on to some famous.</v>

407
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:31.370
<v Speaker 1>You don't get that famous at the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people are treating you like just a</v>

408
00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:32.540
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

409
00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:35.240
<v Speaker 1>everywhere he went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean rock star,</v>

410
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.170
<v Speaker 1>that was the pinnacle Rockstar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A list.</v>

411
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.030
<v Speaker 1>So a list actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional athlete.</v>

412
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you think they have to be dicks?</v>

413
00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:44.751
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

414
00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:46.100
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they become dicks?</v>

415
00:17:46.101 --> 00:17:49.120
<v Speaker 1>But just because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's my theory about that is that the</v>

416
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 1>fame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that level of fame is overwhelming.</v>

417
00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.350
<v Speaker 1>People grabbing at you all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you just develop this dickie thing</v>

418
00:17:55.351 --> 00:17:56.850
<v Speaker 1>just to keep people the fuck away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

419
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine like that Michael Jordan</v>

420
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.500
<v Speaker 1>or a even bieber mean that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>level where you can't go anywhere.</v>

421
00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been.</v>

422
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I've been around Bieber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

423
00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:10.160
<v Speaker 1>What's it like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not an.</v>

424
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 1>He's never alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always got somebody there.</v>

425
00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he trusts anyone and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of fame where you're just also</v>

426
00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:21.780
<v Speaker 1>used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

427
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.560
<v Speaker 1>get me a water or get the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go here.</v>

428
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.380
<v Speaker 1>When you get used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that becomes normal.</v>

429
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Just telling people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just telling people what to do becomes</v>

430
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:31.464
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

431
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.930
<v Speaker 1>I was at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at a party and he was.</v>

432
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.200
<v Speaker 1>He was there and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's playing his music for his new album</v>

433
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.880
<v Speaker 1>and he just looks at me and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

434
00:18:38.881 --> 00:18:40.410
<v Speaker 1>can you give me a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you give me a vodka?</v>

435
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.820
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me a vodka.</v>

436
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.800
<v Speaker 1>And then I went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

437
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:44.670
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

438
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:52.550
<v Speaker 1>like I was so mad at myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm over here.</v>

439
00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:53.301
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

440
00:18:53.301 --> 00:18:55.410
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

441
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Everybody got away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got time.</v>

442
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I gave it to him I thought</v>

443
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:05.511
<v Speaker 1>I should have said no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck if I'm 47 years old,</v>

444
00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.580
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was playing the piano at the same</v>

445
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.590
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at the laugh factory and he was</v>

446
00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:16.740
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was watching and the scooter who's a</v>

447
00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:17.910
<v Speaker 1>buddy of mine,</v>

448
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.430
<v Speaker 1>scooter comes down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when he says,</v>

449
00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Hey Erica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justin would like to see you.</v>

450
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.030

<v Speaker 1>you don't summon me,</v>

455
00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a nerd this way,</v>

456
00:19:38.521 --> 00:19:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm a fan of all types of music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you got to look up the cost of living in</v>

581
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

582
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.990
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people from Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they retire in Spain because our money</v>

583
00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:22.220
<v Speaker 1>goes a lot further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

584
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that people go there to avoid</v>

585
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:26.000
<v Speaker 1>taxes from France.</v>

586
00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of stuff,</v>

587
00:24:27.141 --> 00:24:28.010
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I take.</v>

588
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.680
<v Speaker 1>So we go to Costa Rica and it was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>

589
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:35.730
<v Speaker 1>It was one of these resorts where like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could get room service 24 hours or</v>

590
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.370
<v Speaker 1>do what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all covered in the thing.</v>

591
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.560
<v Speaker 1>But I got sick Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

592
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I knew it was high or Maria sec or what</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of said it was every hole in my</v>

593
00:24:43.671 --> 00:24:45.500
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something was coming out of it.</v>

594
00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I was in bed.</v>

595
00:24:48.011 --> 00:24:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I was telling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I don't,</v>

596
00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I met.</v>

597
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.990
<v Speaker 1>And then as a comic I'm making it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a joke at her that she didn't</v>

598
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:56.240
<v Speaker 1>appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was mad at me about this joke.</v>

599
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.680
<v Speaker 1>So at I'm also telling her like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

600
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not feeling well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it happened.</v>

601
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I get up and I have to vomit.</v>

602
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.400
<v Speaker 1>And then there was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I vomited in my hands.</v>

603
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.520
<v Speaker 1>I will run to the bathroom and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

604
00:25:07.521 --> 00:25:12.350
<v Speaker 1>it's coming out of both holes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is going on for all night.</v>

605
00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:13.101
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

606
00:25:13.101 --> 00:25:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way she was acting,</v>

607
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.570
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was shocked.</v>

608
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.920
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ruining the trend.</v>

609
00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.470
<v Speaker 1>So at the time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

610
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.550
<v Speaker 1>well we weren't as close as we are now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

611
00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:28.640
<v Speaker 1>we've since resolved the issue and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the time I was like,</v>

612
00:25:28.641 --> 00:25:30.870
<v Speaker 1>I can't be with somebody that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna look.</v>

613
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She ordered room service while I was</v>

614
00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.030
<v Speaker 1>already writing it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

615
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

616
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.730
<v Speaker 1>well I'm going to go ahead and get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking cheeseburger.</v>

617
00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Then that was making me more sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The food smell.</v>

618
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:46.700
<v Speaker 1>So I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm outside.</v>

619
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.260
<v Speaker 1>But then she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was mad at you for your jokes and</v>

620
00:25:51.261 --> 00:25:52.094
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

621
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.540
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always tell her,</v>

622
00:25:53.541 --> 00:25:55.070
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said to me one day,</v>

623
00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:56.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brothers,</v>

624
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.560
<v Speaker 1>they used to tease me all the time when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was growing up that I said,</v>

625
00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:00.920
<v Speaker 1>why don't you get with a comic?</v>

626
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's going on.</v>

627
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.790
<v Speaker 1>If you know how we say we get with our</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

628
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

630
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.620

<v Speaker 1>So I think whatever,</v>

631
00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're close to in your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

632
00:26:10.701 --> 00:26:12.740
<v Speaker 1>she's accustomed to people giving her a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard time.</v>

633
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Know she didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went with him,</v>

634
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:15.970
<v Speaker 1>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

635
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to balance it out,</v>

636
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be compromised.</v>

637
00:26:19.281 --> 00:26:20.420

<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

638
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.600

<v Speaker 1>you got to go into this ever is when you</v>

639
00:26:23.601 --> 00:26:27.230
<v Speaker 1>just start dating someone and you go on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vacation with them and it goes sour</v>

640
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.510
<v Speaker 1>and you're stuck with them for like five</v>
<v Speaker 1>days in some spot and it usually happens</v>

641
00:26:32.511 --> 00:26:36.440
<v Speaker 1>by the way on the plane ride over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something that happens on the</v>

<v Speaker 1>listened to it together and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I quit when checking,</v>

696
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.890
<v Speaker 1>check this check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That changed my phone number through my</v>

697
00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:48.870
<v Speaker 1>phone in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was like,</v>

698
00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.160
<v Speaker 1>it was like the guy that wrote the book</v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about her.</v>

699
00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.090
<v Speaker 1>That was the best part about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

700
00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.090
<v Speaker 1>it would be like something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

701
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.580
<v Speaker 1>what you shouldn't do with your man is</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a look on your face of</v>

702
00:29:02.581 --> 00:29:04.590
<v Speaker 1>disgust when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're mad.</v>

703
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:07.890
<v Speaker 1>It was like all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was one moment I'm going</v>

704
00:29:07.891 --> 00:29:09.510
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my hands in the air and it was</v>

705
00:29:09.511 --> 00:29:11.310
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your man's body language,</v>

706
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:15.960
<v Speaker 1>if he has his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your time to back off.</v>

707
00:29:15.961 --> 00:29:18.360
<v Speaker 1>And I was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you date this guy because he's</v>

708
00:29:18.361 --> 00:29:19.950
<v Speaker 1>talking about you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

709
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.800
<v Speaker 1>But I thought that the gesture of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

710
00:29:22.801 --> 00:29:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to improve.</v>

711
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:28.440
<v Speaker 1>I need to like change how I feel or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or like,</v>

712
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe look at a self self reflect that,</v>

713
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.520
<v Speaker 1>the act of that self reflection with her</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that was,</v>

714
00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.940
<v Speaker 1>that's big speak volumes for her and her</v>
<v Speaker 1>character and it really made me go,</v>

715
00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:40.020
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really want to,</v>

716
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.640
<v Speaker 1>you want to make this work and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

717
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

718
00:29:43.541 --> 00:29:44.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make it work.</v>

719
00:29:44.471 --> 00:29:45.880
<v Speaker 1>How old is she?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty nine.</v>

720
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:46.953
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

721
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's at that age,</v>

722
00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.930
<v Speaker 1>should not have said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

723
00:29:49.931 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much trouble.</v>

724
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Why not supposed to tell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not supposed to tell her like she,</v>

725
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:55.410
<v Speaker 1>she want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

726
00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Well the cat's out the bag now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fucking write their name.</v>

727
00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Just go to my instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to say,</v>

728
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.780
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>

729
00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:07.900
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

730
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.460
<v Speaker 1>but that's part of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

731
00:30:09.461 --> 00:30:09.821
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

732
00:30:09.821 --> 00:30:12.670
<v Speaker 1>but she know because she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't want people to know.</v>

733
00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:14.710
<v Speaker 1>So she wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wants people to know.</v>

734
00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.410
<v Speaker 1>She thinks she's 23.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>

735
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:17.620
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

736
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.900
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes me look like a creeper</v>

737
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.990
<v Speaker 1>creeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even this age difference is a little</v>

738
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Iffy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

739
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:29.300
<v Speaker 1>So like it's weird how we just make</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules as to how old someone can be to be</v>

740
00:30:30.911 --> 00:30:33.280
<v Speaker 1>with someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it changes after a while.</v>

741
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:33.821
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

742
00:30:33.821 --> 00:30:35.470
<v Speaker 1>once you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

743
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 1>if the dude is like this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and the woman's 50,</v>

744
00:30:39.491 --> 00:30:41.230
<v Speaker 1>we don't go give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

745
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:41.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

746
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:42.463
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

747
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.670
<v Speaker 1>I would say to me it's like it's gotta</v>
<v Speaker 1>be 30,</v>

748
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.620
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she's at the cusp of it.</v>

749
00:30:47.621 --> 00:30:49.870
<v Speaker 1>I think like once a woman gets to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>28,</v>

750
00:30:49.871 --> 00:30:51.430
<v Speaker 1>29,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 in that age range,</v>

751
00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:54.490
<v Speaker 1>then this other part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter it depending on what</v>

752
00:30:54.491 --> 00:30:55.720
<v Speaker 1>they got going on in their life.</v>

753
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:59.170
<v Speaker 1>But it's not about the age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about experience level.</v>

754
00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.370
<v Speaker 1>It's about where are you in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the moment,</v>

755
00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.160
<v Speaker 1>one thing I struggle with is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

756
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm knee deep in my career when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember when I was 30,</v>

757
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.020
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

758
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.940
<v Speaker 1>I just started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were hustling.</v>

759
00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.500
<v Speaker 1>I was hustling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I go,</v>

760
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 1>I have to remember that this is her</v>
<v Speaker 1>hustle years.</v>

761
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:15.730
<v Speaker 1>So you started doing standup at 30?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

762
00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:16.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

763
00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.310
<v Speaker 1>I took a late start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

764
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.210
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a comedy class when I was in</v>

765
00:31:22.211 --> 00:31:24.790
<v Speaker 1>my early twenties because my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those supportive women.</v>

766
00:31:24.791 --> 00:31:25.530
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey mom,</v>

767
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I think I want to be a comedian next</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

768
00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm signed up at La at Ucla extension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

769
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.400
<v Speaker 1>with a notebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

770
00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:34.571
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all my mom.</v>

771
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:37.250
<v Speaker 1>If I said I want to be a rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I said I want to be a rock climber.</v>

772
00:31:37.251 --> 00:31:38.320
<v Speaker 1>And my mom was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

773
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.300
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would've bought ropes and like hook</v>

774
00:31:40.301 --> 00:31:42.340
<v Speaker 1>me up with the because you want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the fucking house,</v>

775
00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:44.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I was young,</v>

776
00:31:44.231 --> 00:31:47.350
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went to the class taught by sandy</v>

777
00:31:47.351 --> 00:31:48.370
<v Speaker 1>shore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

778
00:31:48.371 --> 00:31:48.931
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

779
00:31:48.931 --> 00:31:49.764
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

780
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I thought it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought this is going to be it.</v>

781
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Her mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter,</v>

782
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.930
<v Speaker 1>her mom owns the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make it.</v>

783
00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.860
<v Speaker 1>That was the advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at you.</v>

784
00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

785
00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:04.930
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker right here.</v>

786
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan tried to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's me.</v>

787
00:32:08.861 --> 00:32:12.880
<v Speaker 1>How good was the advice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I misspoke.</v>

788
00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:14.290
<v Speaker 1>And I can't tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

789
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

790
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:15.510
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

791
00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suggest to anyone if you want to be a</v>

792
00:32:18.941 --> 00:32:21.850
<v Speaker 1>comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to one comedy class just for the</v>

793
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:25.360
<v Speaker 1>comfort of the environment and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>support to go to one comedy class.</v>

794
00:32:25.361 --> 00:32:27.700
<v Speaker 1>But after that you got to get out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the open mics and you got to do it</v>

795
00:32:27.701 --> 00:32:30.360
<v Speaker 1>on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I suggest one comedy class.</v>

796
00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:31.870
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with it.</v>

797
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.320
<v Speaker 1>So I went and I loved that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by the way,</v>

798
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:39.230
<v Speaker 1>the Od,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the showcase for the graduation was at</v>

799
00:32:39.231 --> 00:32:42.650
<v Speaker 1>the comedy store in the or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first time I ever did standup</v>

800
00:32:42.651 --> 00:32:45.970
<v Speaker 1>comedy within the or at the comedy store</v>
<v Speaker 1>was this,</v>

801
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:51.340
<v Speaker 1>it was like 90 something to 93.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what I remember</v>

802
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:53.450
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like after our show,</v>

803
00:32:53.451 --> 00:32:57.670
<v Speaker 1>they just rolled into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our show first got onstage Carlos</v>

804
00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Mitzia.</v>

805
00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes on and at the time he was</v>

806
00:33:00.381 --> 00:33:01.214
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

807
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

808
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.480
<v Speaker 1>just at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>time he was like,</v>

809
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Taco Bell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking hilarious.</v>

810
00:33:11.931 --> 00:33:14.030
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching him and I'm at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

811
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.950
<v Speaker 1>at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching him thinking,</v>

812
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.200
<v Speaker 1>I think I can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

813
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.930
<v Speaker 1>because I had a great set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a great first set,</v>

814
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how that goes and supportive</v>

815
00:33:22.941 --> 00:33:23.960
<v Speaker 1>people in the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

816
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my funny hacky jokes that I was</v>

817
00:33:26.511 --> 00:33:29.000
<v Speaker 1>doing at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just my knew what I thought was new.</v>

818
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I remember one of my jokes was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

819
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.370
<v Speaker 1>how come you can't recognize superman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would take my glasses off,</v>

820
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'd be like,</v>

821
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:37.010
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Clark Kent,</v>

822
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:38.340
<v Speaker 1>take them off man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

823
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.040
<v Speaker 1>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was hilarious at the</v>

824
00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:40.874
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

825
00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no black people on jeopardy.</v>

826
00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:44.870
<v Speaker 1>That was another one of my jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>

827
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had like a had black categories on</v>

828
00:33:47.121 --> 00:33:47.800
<v Speaker 1>jeopardy already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

829
00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.970
<v Speaker 1>blind singers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barbecue holidays,</v>

830
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:50.833
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

831
00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I was killing back then with that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

832
00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.740
<v Speaker 1>So brutal though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go to a real show with that</v>

833
00:33:57.741 --> 00:34:00.440
<v Speaker 1>shit and it's crickets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're like,</v>

834
00:34:00.441 --> 00:34:02.480
<v Speaker 1>but an open mic night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>

835
00:34:02.481 --> 00:34:04.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's open mic night material</v>

836
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:07.610
<v Speaker 1>where it does okay on open mic nights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

837
00:34:07.611 --> 00:34:09.710
<v Speaker 1>this is some good material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got to develop it.</v>

838
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think it's even open mic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think even worse is doing it in front</v>

839
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:14.630
<v Speaker 1>of a crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

840
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:16.510
<v Speaker 1>this is what happens to get side</v>
<v Speaker 1>tracked,</v>

841
00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.570
<v Speaker 1>but I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're.</v>

842
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.910
<v Speaker 1>When you go in the Middle American when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you first were coming up when you were</v>

843
00:34:19.911 --> 00:34:23.660
<v Speaker 1>still a major headliner and then like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the local guy will be there that local</v>

844
00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:28.550
<v Speaker 1>guys now going to be on Joe Rogan's show</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Iowa and he's going to be performing</v>

845
00:34:28.551 --> 00:34:30.230
<v Speaker 1>in front of two or 300 people.</v>

846
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That type of hacky material is going to</v>

847
00:34:32.661 --> 00:34:36.590
<v Speaker 1>kill with those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then then that person now thinks that</v>

848
00:34:36.591 --> 00:34:40.730
<v Speaker 1>this is how you do it and they bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to La and New York and then they're</v>

849
00:34:40.731 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

850
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.960
<v Speaker 1>how come this isn't working?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're seeing like a thousand</v>

851
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:47.640
<v Speaker 1>other comics doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

852
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.140
<v Speaker 1>talking about the same subjects and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't realize how they had to find</v>

853
00:34:51.141 --> 00:34:52.700
<v Speaker 1>some originality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they're doing,</v>

854
00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.730
<v Speaker 1>and that's the hard part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the hard part.</v>

855
00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:57.500
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of subjects to talk</v>

856
00:34:57.501 --> 00:34:58.640
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

857
00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.980
<v Speaker 1>you're not the first comment to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>married and have daughters.</v>

858
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this experience that you had is,</v>

859
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:09.650
<v Speaker 1>is it is personal to you and conveying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the hard part,</v>

860
00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:10.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

861
00:35:10.851 --> 00:35:13.340
<v Speaker 1>and so people kind of go just surface</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are material.</v>

862
00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:17.990
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to delve deeper and it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to have the confidence to drag</v>

863
00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.310
<v Speaker 1>a subject out too.</v>

864
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Like when you first start out like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your premises are so short and then you</v>

865
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:27.050
<v Speaker 1>go from one short premise to another</v>
<v Speaker 1>short premise and then it becomes a,</v>

866
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.200
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bit becomes a,</v>

867
00:35:30.201 --> 00:35:32.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a set then.</v>

868
00:35:32.391 --> 00:35:37.010
<v Speaker 1>And then now you're talking about often</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell comics like that.</v>

869
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

870
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.380
<v Speaker 1>if you heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

871
00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.640
<v Speaker 1>if you heard like a Neptune's beat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hear it from a mile away.</v>

872
00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.250
<v Speaker 1>You can know when you hear it you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

873
00:35:47.251 --> 00:35:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I bet you the neptunes produce that</v>
<v Speaker 1>track.</v>

874
00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or premier,</v>

875
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dj Premier,</v>

876
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.660
<v Speaker 1>he would produce a beat and you'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

877
00:35:54.661 --> 00:35:55.740
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a premier beat.</v>

878
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Your comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your comedy is the same way when you're</v>

879
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:03.600
<v Speaker 1>working on things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You work on it in your way that if you</v>

880
00:36:03.601 --> 00:36:07.800
<v Speaker 1>looked at all your material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might now see the common thread and</v>

881
00:36:07.801 --> 00:36:09.780
<v Speaker 1>that's how you put together an act.</v>

882
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Thirty minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 minutes.</v>

883
00:36:11.641 --> 00:36:15.090
<v Speaker 1>That's how you're able to talk about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject for so long because we've now</v>

884
00:36:15.091 --> 00:36:18.030
<v Speaker 1>woven together these thoughts that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think are connected,</v>

885
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.110
<v Speaker 1>but when we look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

886
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.190
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm actually.</v>

887
00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:25.420
<v Speaker 1>This subject actually flows into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it connects very nicely so that</v>

888
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.290
<v Speaker 1>that's what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm watching again.</v>

889
00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:32.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching Lexia at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a young kid.</v>

890
00:36:32.521 --> 00:36:35.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just had a great set I thought,</v>

891
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:38.940
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm looking at these</v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals and I saw them and see it</v>

892
00:36:38.941 --> 00:36:42.900
<v Speaker 1>and at that particular time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him and when he talked about Taco</v>

893
00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:43.830
<v Speaker 1>bell and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

894
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:45.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I could do this.</v>

895
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he brought up Chris Tucker and</v>

896
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Chris Tucker went on stage and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought to myself,</v>

897
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I could do this just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way he was.</v>

898
00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:58.230
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is voice man?</v>

899
00:36:58.231 --> 00:37:01.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just Taco tacos on fire back then.</v>

900
00:37:01.051 --> 00:37:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just uh,</v>

901
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.470
<v Speaker 1>his whole persona and I thought I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know and I didn't know what to do.</v>

902
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.860
<v Speaker 1>So I floundered around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did open minded.</v>

903
00:37:06.861 --> 00:37:08.420
<v Speaker 1>You get nervous when you saw Chris</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tucker?</v>

904
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I do so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just so it was something special</v>

905
00:37:11.251 --> 00:37:13.260
<v Speaker 1>about what he was doing and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

906
00:37:13.261 --> 00:37:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just was scattered to habit at that</v>

907
00:37:16.561 --> 00:37:17.131
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

908
00:37:17.131 --> 00:37:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I was so nervous and scared and arrogant</v>
<v Speaker 1>too because I was a funny guy.</v>

909
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:26.040
<v Speaker 1>So then I would go to open mics and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same people doing the same shit over</v>

910
00:37:26.041 --> 00:37:28.470
<v Speaker 1>and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I wouldn't go to another open mic</v>

911
00:37:28.471 --> 00:37:30.870
<v Speaker 1>for another four weeks and then I see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same people and I thought,</v>

912
00:37:30.871 --> 00:37:32.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get from here?</v>

913
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.900
<v Speaker 1>How do you get on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

914
00:37:33.901 --> 00:37:36.240
<v Speaker 1>this and know it and I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no mentors,</v>

915
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.730
<v Speaker 1>there was no people going like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me help you with this.</v>

916
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:41.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't even talk to someone of</v>

917
00:37:41.071 --> 00:37:42.150
<v Speaker 1>your stature at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

918
00:37:42.151 --> 00:37:43.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time you couldn't just be some</v>

919
00:37:43.501 --> 00:37:45.540
<v Speaker 1>open micro and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

920
00:37:45.541 --> 00:37:47.310
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

921
00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need the comedy store and some</v>

922
00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:51.060
<v Speaker 1>dude comes up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just kinda like,</v>

923
00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:52.440
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to talk to me about</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

924
00:37:52.441 --> 00:37:57.441
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you just started kyle approach I</v>

925
00:37:57.841 --> 00:38:00.120
<v Speaker 1>think especially when they worked there</v>
<v Speaker 1>as door guys.</v>

926
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:03.180
<v Speaker 1>I feel like everybody's just a comic</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's different,</v>

927
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.200
<v Speaker 1>that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like there's,</v>

928
00:38:05.201 --> 00:38:08.310
<v Speaker 1>there's a sorta but even still like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

929
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's so appropriate for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a door guy to come up to you and be</v>

930
00:38:12.091 --> 00:38:12.691
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

931
00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:14.400
<v Speaker 1>can I open for you at Irvine?</v>

932
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:16.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guy just did that the other day.</v>

933
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Mitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know you.</v>

934
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:19.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

935
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I have friends by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do that.</v>

936
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:23.380
<v Speaker 1>They show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

937
00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I used to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember John,</v>

938
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Sanchez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

939
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.390
<v Speaker 1>First was coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Johnson.</v>

940
00:38:27.391 --> 00:38:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me open for you.</v>

941
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:31.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm a jug or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you said?</v>

942
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I told them I was agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I'm trying to bury these</v>

943
00:38:35.291 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 1>headliners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

944
00:38:36.161 --> 00:38:38.590
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that's what she told him.</v>

945
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you thought you were</v>

946
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:41.590
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like checking his watch.</v>

947
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:42.453
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the time.</v>

948
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.360
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's teased me ever since.</v>

949
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:49.030
<v Speaker 1>This is a 22 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years later he still teases me about</v>

950
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:50.410
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

951
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:51.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

952
00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.870
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what I was doing,</v>

953
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how to.</v>

954
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you supposed to do,</v>

955
00:38:55.871 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's no clear path.</v>

956
00:38:57.161 --> 00:38:59.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not just being a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no right or wrong way either,</v>

957
00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:00.783
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

958
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.190
<v Speaker 1>It's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially I grew up in La.</v>

959
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I was born and raised in La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm in La trying to get on a stage</v>

960
00:39:06.341 --> 00:39:08.950
<v Speaker 1>where I would go to the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was telling you earlier,</v>

961
00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I saw you at the laugh factory with</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair,</v>

962
00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just like a man you were on stage,</v>

963
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.200
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not like you were just given</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

964
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain energy you had about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you were talking about that I was</v>

965
00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:24.760
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

966
00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.760
<v Speaker 1>what happened to this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember the first thought,</v>

967
00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:30.401
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

968
00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:35.401
<v Speaker 1>some woman hurt him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>

969
00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I've tapped into that</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

970
00:39:37.751 --> 00:39:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I thought at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I've tapped into that.</v>

971
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.070
<v Speaker 1>So it took a long time for me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>

972
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I want to do.</v>

973
00:39:43.241 --> 00:39:45.760
<v Speaker 1>And like when I was 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's different,</v>

974
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:47.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some people go up there and they're</v>

975
00:39:47.171 --> 00:39:50.950
<v Speaker 1>excited and angry about shit and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people go up there and they're mellow.</v>

976
00:39:50.951 --> 00:39:55.951
<v Speaker 1>And that's the funny part is the slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low punchlines,</v>

977
00:39:58.361 --> 00:40:01.810
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even if you like sigora perfect</v>

978
00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:04.030
<v Speaker 1>exact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just could tell a story.</v>

979
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Have you captivated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

980
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.080
<v Speaker 1>there's no anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

981
00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:08.960
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like screaming emotions.</v>

982
00:40:08.961 --> 00:40:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Cigarettes just chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't you find yourself?</v>

983
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone up?</v>

984
00:40:12.881 --> 00:40:14.470
<v Speaker 1>It had been in because you have a way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>performing,</v>

985
00:40:14.471 --> 00:40:15.940
<v Speaker 1>like you know you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

986
00:40:15.941 --> 00:40:17.200
<v Speaker 1>as Joe Mode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

987
00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:20.580
<v Speaker 1>you're on there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be powerful and you're</v>

988
00:40:20.581 --> 00:40:24.130
<v Speaker 1>gonna you're like really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then have you ever just gone on and</v>

989
00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like not done it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then now you get laughed at a</v>

990
00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:31.750
<v Speaker 1>completely different point and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>set with new material for sure because</v>

991
00:40:31.751 --> 00:40:33.320
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to find the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

992
00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:34.470
<v Speaker 1>you trying to find the beats.</v>

993
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:35.230
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

994
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I set material up to fail sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'll go into a bit slower and I'll</v>

995
00:40:40.181 --> 00:40:44.920
<v Speaker 1>go and do a bit more casual and try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ramp it up rather than try to make it</v>

996
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.610
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes when you get a new bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you first started out</v>

997
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:51.250
<v Speaker 1>like this bit is shaky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just get it out of the gate with</v>

998
00:40:51.251 --> 00:40:53.890
<v Speaker 1>a lot of momentum so that I can kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>coast with it.</v>

999
00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say,</v>

1000
00:40:55.631 --> 00:40:57.490
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this bit might be all just bullshit</v>

1001
00:40:57.491 --> 00:41:00.130
<v Speaker 1>or what Tom Calls Thompson [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>calls them dance moves.</v>

1002
00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I used to call it English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>English on the cue ball because</v>

1003
00:41:05.081 --> 00:41:07.720
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hamming it up,</v>

1004
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.880
<v Speaker 1>you're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying,</v>

1005
00:41:09.881 --> 00:41:11.200
<v Speaker 1>you doing that thing that you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1006
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Makes people laugh and it's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>

1007
00:41:13.591 --> 00:41:15.730
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really difficult for me because I'm</v>

1008
00:41:15.731 --> 00:41:17.650
<v Speaker 1>just a funny looking guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1009
00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I accepted it,</v>

1010
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1011
00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a looker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1012
00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:22.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1013
00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.910
<v Speaker 1>I had some felony guy mustache works</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1014
00:41:25.911 --> 00:41:27.430
<v Speaker 1>you know my qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1015
00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.930
<v Speaker 1>But I know that like that I could do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that they're thinking,</v>

1016
00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.740
<v Speaker 1>why are they laughing at what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about?</v>

1017
00:41:32.741 --> 00:41:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Like are they with me emotionally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they with me intellectually or are</v>

1018
00:41:36.231 --> 00:41:37.070
<v Speaker 1>they just going like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1019
00:41:37.071 --> 00:41:40.790
<v Speaker 1>this guy is funny and it's hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that.</v>

1020
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1021
00:41:42.621 --> 00:41:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want from them?</v>

1022
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to connect with them?</v>

1023
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you want them to laugh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want both or do you want them to</v>

1024
00:41:49.551 --> 00:41:51.110
<v Speaker 1>appreciate you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

1025
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.830
<v Speaker 1>you just want them to have a good time</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you even want them to laugh at how</v>

1026
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:56.780
<v Speaker 1>you are connected to what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

1027
00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Because that's different too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a political comic,</v>

1028
00:42:00.501 --> 00:42:03.920
<v Speaker 1>people might laugh that like how</v>
<v Speaker 1>passionate you are about being a</v>

1029
00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:08.000
<v Speaker 1>libertarian or how passionate you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>about being an atheist.</v>

1030
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't agree with you or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do agree with you,</v>

1031
00:42:11.001 --> 00:42:14.210
<v Speaker 1>but they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're laughing at how you are</v>

1032
00:42:14.211 --> 00:42:17.180
<v Speaker 1>connected to what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's another element</v>

1033
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.590
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a whole other thing.</v>

1034
00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at all my friends,</v>

1035
00:42:20.721 --> 00:42:21.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1036
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.420
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of peers or friends that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just go,</v>

1037
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.000
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all have something different in</v>

1038
00:42:26.001 --> 00:42:27.030
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1039
00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:28.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the summer it's an,</v>

1040
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:32.150
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing thing to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy art form because nobody can</v>

1041
00:42:32.151 --> 00:42:34.640
<v Speaker 1>tell you how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounded like any other art form.</v>

1042
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really know like if you went into</v>

1043
00:42:37.371 --> 00:42:39.380
<v Speaker 1>music or I went into music like we</v>
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>

1044
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.790
<v Speaker 1>like you can be in a rock band or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be in a blues band or you get like</v>

1045
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.440
<v Speaker 1>country music and everybody would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly defined,</v>

1046
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.850
<v Speaker 1>but you just do standup.</v>

1047
00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just standup.</v>

1048
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no categories.</v>

1049
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:53.330
<v Speaker 1>What was funny about that though is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that there's no categories,</v>

1050
00:42:53.331 --> 00:42:57.500
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that it is similar to</v>
<v Speaker 1>music in that we're not going to change</v>

1051
00:42:57.501 --> 00:43:01.400
<v Speaker 1>the rules of communication and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where people get in the way.</v>

1052
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.670
<v Speaker 1>So like when you're on a piano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to make new cords.</v>

1053
00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:05.880
<v Speaker 1>It's still going to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>

1054
00:43:05.881 --> 00:43:06.350
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>

1055
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:07.460
<v Speaker 1>g,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1056
00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:11.930
<v Speaker 1>And like the certain courts when they go</v>
<v Speaker 1>together or not gonna sound good no</v>

1057
00:43:11.931 --> 00:43:13.820
<v Speaker 1>matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to reinvent the wheel.</v>

1058
00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.660
<v Speaker 1>So I think the baseline of comedy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just being able to communicate your</v>

1059
00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:20.960
<v Speaker 1>points and I think one of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person that can communicate your</v>

1060
00:43:20.961 --> 00:43:25.961
<v Speaker 1>points and they're solid and clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the jokes on top of that or going</v>

1061
00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.630
<v Speaker 1>to what the entertainment is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1062
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.130
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still got to like you don't want</v>

1063
00:43:31.131 --> 00:43:33.860
<v Speaker 1>somebody says they're telling the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody says anything and then they</v>

1064
00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:34.431
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1065
00:43:34.431 --> 00:43:35.390
<v Speaker 1>you know you had to be there.</v>

1066
00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a horrible storyteller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1067
00:43:38.051 --> 00:43:41.300
<v Speaker 1>that's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll never hear Joey Dsa that never</v>

1068
00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:47.870
<v Speaker 1>be their cock sucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that would be like,</v>

1069
00:43:47.871 --> 00:43:49.640
<v Speaker 1>well I don't know if I want to be there</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

1070
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:53.360
<v Speaker 1>You know you had to be there means you</v>
<v Speaker 1>failed in communicating.</v>

1071
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.850
<v Speaker 1>So I think that on that level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though all comics are different in</v>

1072
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:59.930
<v Speaker 1>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that level of like long when.</v>

1073
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:02.030
<v Speaker 1>So when you say setup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is important.</v>

1074
00:44:02.031 --> 00:44:03.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be universal to all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

1075
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:05.990
<v Speaker 1>You have to set this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:09.440
<v Speaker 1>That's the case with all songs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything too.</v>

1077
00:44:09.441 --> 00:44:10.850
<v Speaker 1>But their styles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1078
00:44:10.851 --> 00:44:12.700
<v Speaker 1>like there's certain styles of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1079
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:17.710
<v Speaker 1>I guess their styles of comedy so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no distinct style.</v>

1080
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.110
<v Speaker 1>If you heard like</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1081
00:44:21.111 --> 00:44:22.310
<v Speaker 1>a Hank Williams Jr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1082
00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:24.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's clearly country and you just hear</v>

1083
00:44:24.711 --> 00:44:26.090
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know right away you hear,</v>

1084
00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some wacky about country.</v>

1085
00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:33.060
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love country with a good story.</v>

1086
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving down a highway,</v>

1087
00:44:35.111 --> 00:44:37.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you do is healing a couple of</v>

1088
00:44:37.171 --> 00:44:39.360
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what the fuck this is.</v>

1089
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Just to have like music behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what he sat your comedy at the</v>

1090
00:44:43.951 --> 00:44:47.310
<v Speaker 1>time it was the country music of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you misrepresenting</v>

1091
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:51.540
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a story.</v>

1092
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.580
<v Speaker 1>You know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you felt that the anguish.</v>

1093
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:55.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's what I was doing.</v>

1094
00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Are you trying to look back and think</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird though?</v>

1095
00:45:00.961 --> 00:45:02.850
<v Speaker 1>He had hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a whole different guy.</v>

1096
00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1097
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.540
<v Speaker 1>you weren't this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a solid muscle now.</v>

1098
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know if you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your body fat count right now?</v>

1099
00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it checked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1100
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.410
<v Speaker 1>That's probably better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably better to think that it's</v>

1101
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:17.100
<v Speaker 1>better than it probably is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you went and you might be</v>

1102
00:45:17.101 --> 00:45:19.680
<v Speaker 1>disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last time I checked it was 10</v>

1103
00:45:19.681 --> 00:45:21.060
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>

1104
00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Not very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably like 30 percent,</v>

1105
00:45:23.641 --> 00:45:25.770
<v Speaker 1>35 percent body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1106
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got stumped in.</v>

1107
00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:28.540
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

1108
00:45:28.541 --> 00:45:29.281
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1109
00:45:29.281 --> 00:45:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I my but my blood pressure's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

1110
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:33.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I,</v>

1111
00:45:33.091 --> 00:45:33.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1112
00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:35.660
<v Speaker 1>I told him you what I'm trying to box</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1113
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:36.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm working out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to this,</v>

1114
00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:39.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to the boxing thing and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I go to glove works,</v>

1115
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.360
<v Speaker 1>works in century city and shit.</v>

1116
00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pads holding,</v>

1117
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 1>holding the thing in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this something that tricks you with</v>

1118
00:45:49.351 --> 00:45:51.810
<v Speaker 1>that though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they hit them back.</v>

1119
00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So youth in um,</v>

1120
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:55.890
<v Speaker 1>after I've done it a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm walking around in public like,</v>

1121
00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:56.733
<v Speaker 1>Fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish,</v>

1122
00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:01.740
<v Speaker 1>I wish somebody would test me like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to hold up their hands and</v>

1123
00:46:01.741 --> 00:46:04.100
<v Speaker 1>fight me like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1124
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:07.620
<v Speaker 1>what's something about going to boxing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is changed my perception of women,</v>

1125
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:13.910
<v Speaker 1>women in the boxing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they really at that shit is when</v>

1126
00:46:13.921 --> 00:46:15.300
<v Speaker 1>you see a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1127
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm working out with five people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then a woman goes in and he goes on,</v>

1128
00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:20.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's like,</v>

1129
00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

1130
00:46:23.101 --> 00:46:25.890
<v Speaker 1>this is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is great.</v>

1131
00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can handle yourself all my</v>

1132
00:46:27.601 --> 00:46:30.630
<v Speaker 1>preconceived notions of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's something stupid,</v>

1133
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.880
<v Speaker 1>a stupid male thing is to see a woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

1134
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:34.980
<v Speaker 1>And then the first thought is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1135
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:36.870
<v Speaker 1>somebody hurt her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

1136
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.150
<v Speaker 1>You got a lot of that in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1137
00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:38.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1138
00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:41.340
<v Speaker 1>That was me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I had this people.</v>

1139
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's hurting when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

1140
00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:49.350
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like therapy.</v>

1141
00:46:49.351 --> 00:46:50.270
<v Speaker 1>It's coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1142
00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I was hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you needed a cassette</v>

1143
00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:54.740
<v Speaker 1>sets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1144
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on it,</v>

1145
00:46:56.101 --> 00:46:59.130
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did your oldest fuck kids that</v>

1146
00:46:59.131 --> 00:47:00.070
<v Speaker 1>they're going like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

1147
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:04.260
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know what a CD is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A laser disc.</v>

1148
00:47:04.261 --> 00:47:05.880
<v Speaker 1>You little fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.160
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the boxing has been cool.</v>

1150
00:47:08.161 --> 00:47:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I like a fun workout and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are weird though.</v>

1151
00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.560
<v Speaker 1>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody sent me a picture of this,</v>

1152
00:47:13.561 --> 00:47:18.210
<v Speaker 1>a mma chick and she was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this woman who's down and she's</v>

1153
00:47:18.211 --> 00:47:20.010
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who the lady is,</v>

1154
00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:22.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm not familiar with our shells and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight in the UFC,</v>

1155
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:27.030
<v Speaker 1>but she's got blood on her and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going like this and she standing up over</v>

1156
00:47:27.031 --> 00:47:28.350
<v Speaker 1>this chick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's pounding,</v>

1157
00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:31.030
<v Speaker 1>she's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

1158
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is an angry woman.</v>

1159
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I can't do those kinds of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

1160
00:47:35.221 --> 00:47:36.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't like male UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't leave.</v>

1161
00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:40.030
<v Speaker 1>I just too violent for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just live,</v>

1162
00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to go?</v>

1163
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I would go and I was watching the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>day because I heard your voice just one</v>

1164
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 1>in La in August.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go.</v>

1165
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:50.860
<v Speaker 1>I want to go because it just seems so</v>
<v Speaker 1>like very,</v>

1166
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:51.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that,</v>

1167
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:53.860
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it like I,</v>

1168
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:56.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't like watching women hit each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

1169
00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:57.850
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't like it.</v>

1170
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:59.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's my male thing,</v>

1171
00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:01.930
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that like how can we be in a</v>

1172
00:48:01.931 --> 00:48:04.150
<v Speaker 1>society where we're talking about no</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence against women?</v>

1173
00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.010
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless it's paperview like,</v>

1174
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.050
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no violence against women by men is</v>

1175
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:09.690
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1176
00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:12.610
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you some violence against</v>
<v Speaker 1>women competition.</v>

1177
00:48:12.611 --> 00:48:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that woman that beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>up Rhonda Rousey,</v>

1178
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Amanda Nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that I fight better than</v>

1179
00:48:21.011 --> 00:48:21.460
<v Speaker 1>her?</v>

1180
00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:22.300
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll fuck you up.</v>

1181
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:24.490
<v Speaker 1>She will fuck me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Amanda Nunez.</v>

1182
00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I hit one arousing into face,</v>

1183
00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.690
<v Speaker 1>he liked her and I go out on a date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have something happens.</v>

1184
00:48:31.691 --> 00:48:34.840
<v Speaker 1>We have a scuffle and it gets on video</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I punched Ronda Rousey gonna face.</v>

1185
00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm now a pariah is society for the rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my life,</v>

1186
00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:42.040
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman who trains and it's like a</v>

1187
00:48:42.041 --> 00:48:45.400
<v Speaker 1>beast</v>
<v Speaker 1>will beat her up.</v>

1188
00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get the disconnect.</v>

1189
00:48:47.831 --> 00:48:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a disconnect.</v>

1190
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:52.900
<v Speaker 1>It's competition sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't understand what.</v>

1191
00:48:52.901 --> 00:48:54.940
<v Speaker 1>What were you missing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The connection.</v>

1192
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:58.120
<v Speaker 1>There's such a big difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric Griffin.</v>

1193
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:01.030
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ron ain't going on a date with you.</v>

1194
00:49:01.031 --> 00:49:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what.</v>

1195
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.030
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did Travis Brown and he's a fucking</v>

1196
00:49:07.031 --> 00:49:07.841
<v Speaker 1>killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1197
00:49:07.841 --> 00:49:11.350
<v Speaker 1>well maybe they have another batch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heavyweight.</v>

1198
00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:15.490
<v Speaker 1>UFC it so they have a tough patch that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going out to get something good.</v>

1199
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to be some strange.</v>

1200
00:49:17.861 --> 00:49:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And she went to the comedy store if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>tired of being with a killer,</v>

1201
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wants somebody cuddly,</v>

1202
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.360
<v Speaker 1>soft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soft and squishy,</v>

1203
00:49:25.361 --> 00:49:27.060
<v Speaker 1>and then we'd go out on a date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1204
00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.110
<v Speaker 1>you want a punching her because she</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>

1205
00:49:29.111 --> 00:49:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Does that ever happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1206
00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever punched anybody in your</v>

1207
00:49:31.811 --> 00:49:32.570
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A girl?</v>

1208
00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:34.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what I was into.</v>

1209
00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Sixth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I had a fight with a girl one</v>

1210
00:49:36.281 --> 00:49:39.010
<v Speaker 1>time and that's the first time I learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to hit a girl.</v>

1211
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was the,</v>

1212
00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.640
<v Speaker 1>she was a bully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a bully and she was pushing</v>

1213
00:49:42.641 --> 00:49:46.180
<v Speaker 1>people and active and she did something</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me and I punched her and then no</v>

1214
00:49:46.181 --> 00:49:50.770
<v Speaker 1>matter what she did the whole yard when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1215
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:52.090
<v Speaker 1>like you don't hit a girl.</v>

1216
00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:52.841
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1217
00:49:52.841 --> 00:49:55.720
<v Speaker 1>but remember everybody hated her like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>second ago.</v>

1218
00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I knew at that point was outside.</v>

1219
00:49:58.450 --> 00:49:59.081
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

1220
00:49:59.081 --> 00:50:00.370
<v Speaker 1>I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that there's some kind of</v>

1221
00:50:00.371 --> 00:50:01.630
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned it then.</v>

1222
00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way to learn it before it</v>

1223
00:50:03.671 --> 00:50:04.950
<v Speaker 1>gets ugly before we get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>

1224
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.310
<v Speaker 1>that was still a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1225
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.900
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably younger than that to</v>

1226
00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.210
<v Speaker 1>break anybody's job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1227
00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:11.691
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1228
00:50:11.691 --> 00:50:12.161
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1229
00:50:12.161 --> 00:50:12.911
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in what?</v>

1230
00:50:12.911 --> 00:50:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Piss me off too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1231
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget this is so vivid in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>head that she admitted immediately went</v>

1232
00:50:17.741 --> 00:50:22.741
<v Speaker 1>from bully strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've run this court yard too.</v>

1233
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:28.020
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

1234
00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:29.490
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what just happened?</v>

1235
00:50:29.491 --> 00:50:30.660
<v Speaker 3>You ever want to look her up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1236
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.020
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just what the fuck she's done to her</v>

1237
00:50:33.021 --> 00:50:37.820
<v Speaker 3>disaster of a life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was condoleeza rice actually don't</v>

1238
00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.560
<v Speaker 3>care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if it was somebody like that?</v>

1239
00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.350
<v Speaker 3>That would be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's angry at you for punching her all</v>

1240
00:50:42.351 --> 00:50:44.840
<v Speaker 3>this time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Starting wars in Syria and shit.</v>

1241
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:47.130
<v Speaker 3>But I'm saying it could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm with Ron.</v>

1242
00:50:47.131 --> 00:50:51.200
<v Speaker 3>Let's go back to the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>you punch and Rhonda is that would be</v>

1243
00:50:51.201 --> 00:50:53.840
<v Speaker 3>the last punch you ever through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flip you on your head,</v>

1244
00:50:53.841 --> 00:50:55.720
<v Speaker 3>on the concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smash your head open,</v>

1245
00:50:55.740 --> 00:51:00.740
<v Speaker 3>stomp you into a mud puddle and all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>on video all day would say is Erik</v>

1246
00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:02.413
<v Speaker 3>Griffin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a woman</v>

1247
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:05.820
<v Speaker 3>or he had a comment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1248
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.351
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1249
00:51:06.351 --> 00:51:08.510
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Domestic abusers.</v>

1250
00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:13.320
<v Speaker 3>Strong woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean that in.</v>

1251
00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:17.360
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda is a professional mixed martial</v>
<v Speaker 3>arts champion.</v>

1252
00:51:17.361 --> 00:51:21.410
<v Speaker 3>She was a champion and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest female champions of all time.</v>

1253
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:25.010
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like seeing her face look like</v>
<v Speaker 3>she shouldn't have fought that woman.</v>

1254
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.240
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like seeing it.</v>

1255
00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.130
<v Speaker 3>I guess what I'm saying there was I</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't.</v>

1256
00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.680
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel any of like,</v>

1257
00:51:30.681 --> 00:51:32.170
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the competition that she trains</v>

1258
00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:35.210
<v Speaker 3>know what I saw is a bruised and</v>
<v Speaker 3>battered woman.</v>

1259
00:51:35.211 --> 00:51:37.430
<v Speaker 3>That's what I saw and that's probably my</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1260
00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.400
<v Speaker 3>You must be talking about the Holly Holm</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight because that's when the one she</v>

1261
00:51:40.401 --> 00:51:41.330
<v Speaker 3>was about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1262
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:46.540
<v Speaker 3>That's when she got head kick and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>was bloody and it was a 48 seconds of</v>

1263
00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.600
<v Speaker 3>knuckles in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a quick fight.</v>

1264
00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.610
<v Speaker 3>She just got the fuck beat out of her in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fight,</v>

1265
00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:56.240
<v Speaker 3>but fights anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's lessons in that.</v>

1266
00:51:56.241 --> 00:51:59.140
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can fight in mma and there's,</v>

1267
00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:03.230
<v Speaker 3>there's danger and there's consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're in shape and you're</v>

1268
00:52:03.231 --> 00:52:05.330
<v Speaker 3>prepared correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can fight,</v>

1269
00:52:05.331 --> 00:52:08.630
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of women that weren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>prepared correctly and Rhonda Fuck them</v>

1270
00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:09.110
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1271
00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:10.410
<v Speaker 3>That's just how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me.</v>

1272
00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:12.890
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes there's a name of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like sometimes you're the hammer,</v>

1273
00:52:12.891 --> 00:52:15.800
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you're the nail is also hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pumped her up,</v>

1274
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:16.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

1275
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:20.690
<v Speaker 3>it was a money marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was great marketing too.</v>

1276
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.600
<v Speaker 3>She only hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pumped her up,</v>

1277
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:28.790
<v Speaker 3>me doing a lot of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was based on what she'd been able</v>

1278
00:52:28.791 --> 00:52:30.770
<v Speaker 3>to accomplish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't based on bullshit.</v>

1279
00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:34.400
<v Speaker 3>It was based on her actual performance</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside the octagon against people like</v>

1280
00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:35.840
<v Speaker 3>cats and gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1281
00:52:35.841 --> 00:52:37.640
<v Speaker 3>against people like Sarah Mcmahon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1282
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.550
<v Speaker 3>which she had done was supremely</v>
<v Speaker 3>impressive.</v>

1283
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 3>But we love a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We love undefeated.</v>

1284
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:49.790
<v Speaker 3>We love being the best ever we we'd get</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind that.</v>

1285
00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:52.340
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what was behind her going</v>

1286
00:52:52.341 --> 00:52:54.110
<v Speaker 3>into that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1287
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:57.410
<v Speaker 3>And it didn't look like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shouldn't have been behind her</v>

1288
00:52:57.411 --> 00:52:58.190
<v Speaker 3>going into that fight.</v>

1289
00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:00.920
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the Holly Holm fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holly Holm funded even the Holly Holm</v>

1290
00:53:00.921 --> 00:53:03.290
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was under massive amounts of</v>

1291
00:53:03.291 --> 00:53:04.790
<v Speaker 3>distractions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was under.</v>

1292
00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:05.803
<v Speaker 3>She was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were at.</v>

1293
00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:08.830
<v Speaker 3>They were going to do roadhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember they're going to do a roadhouse</v>

1294
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:11.960
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's having meetings with agents and</v>

1295
00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.870
<v Speaker 3>they just thought she could fuck up</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody on the planet.</v>

1296
00:53:14.871 --> 00:53:18.530
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is in less didn't look like</v>

1297
00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:22.460
<v Speaker 3>a hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All in with your training and your</v>

1298
00:53:22.461 --> 00:53:24.890
<v Speaker 3>learning and your development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're making sure that you've got the</v>

1299
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:28.980
<v Speaker 3>training partners and the right coaching</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the right staff and nutrition and</v>

1300
00:53:28.981 --> 00:53:30.720
<v Speaker 3>all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't,</v>

1301
00:53:30.721 --> 00:53:33.180
<v Speaker 3>if you have any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any part of that missing,</v>

1302
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:37.350
<v Speaker 3>then the people coming up who have all</v>
<v Speaker 3>those bases covered,</v>

1303
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:39.690
<v Speaker 3>they're going to surpass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are talented too,</v>

1304
00:53:39.691 --> 00:53:41.910
<v Speaker 3>and that's what happened with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're knee deep in the world.</v>

1305
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:43.080
<v Speaker 3>You know everything about it.</v>

1306
00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a lay person,</v>

1307
00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:47.370
<v Speaker 3>just looking at them standing next to</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1308
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:48.320
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1309
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.450
<v Speaker 3>she gonna get her ass beat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you looking at Rhonda standing next</v>

1310
00:53:51.451 --> 00:53:53.470
<v Speaker 3>to Holly Holm to Ronda was going to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>harassed.</v>

1311
00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:54.363
<v Speaker 3>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1312
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:55.530
<v Speaker 3>when I saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1313
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:57.510
<v Speaker 3>how's this going to work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did you think the,</v>

1314
00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:59.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just the eye test.</v>

1315
00:53:59.461 --> 00:54:00.360
<v Speaker 3>She just looked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holly,</v>

1316
00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:01.171
<v Speaker 3>Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically,</v>

1317
00:54:01.171 --> 00:54:02.910
<v Speaker 3>she looked bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was at.</v>

1318
00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:05.010
<v Speaker 3>She was physically bigger than this</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

1319
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.810
<v Speaker 3>Seen Sarah Mcmahon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1320
00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:10.350
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda stops Sara Mcmahon in one round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah Mcmahon was an Olympic silver</v>

1321
00:54:10.351 --> 00:54:13.470
<v Speaker 3>medalist and wrestling and she's a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't into it like that.</v>

1322
00:54:13.471 --> 00:54:15.360
<v Speaker 3>Maybe if I'd seen that I would've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1323
00:54:15.361 --> 00:54:19.260
<v Speaker 3>well this is going to be a good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was my first time and I just</v>

1324
00:54:19.261 --> 00:54:20.071
<v Speaker 3>looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1325
00:54:20.071 --> 00:54:21.630
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't look like this is going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a good fight.</v>

1326
00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:24.790
<v Speaker 3>That's just know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

1327
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.610
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't think it was going to be a</v>

1328
00:54:26.611 --> 00:54:29.070
<v Speaker 3>good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when did you hear just you hear</v>

1329
00:54:29.071 --> 00:54:30.810
<v Speaker 3>you guys talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear like,</v>

1330
00:54:30.811 --> 00:54:32.580
<v Speaker 3>the guy's going to get all that Holly</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holmes,</v>

1331
00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.350
<v Speaker 3>she's a box or in this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1332
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:36.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't gonna go well.</v>

1333
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:41.100
<v Speaker 3>And then sure enough it didn't go well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then that made me have the respect</v>

1334
00:54:41.101 --> 00:54:43.480
<v Speaker 3>level for female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1335
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:46.950
<v Speaker 3>fighting if I'm just coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like at that time,</v>

1336
00:54:46.951 --> 00:54:48.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like Ronda Rousey's everywhere.</v>

1337
00:54:48.781 --> 00:54:49.990
<v Speaker 3>She's in movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's in like,</v>

1338
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you're like,</v>

1339
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.590
<v Speaker 3>oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the greatest fighter ever right</v>

1340
00:54:52.591 --> 00:54:53.530
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the chief's,</v>

1341
00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:55.530
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the attraction of a lifetime.</v>

1342
00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:56.640
<v Speaker 3>And then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1343
00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:58.231
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check it out.</v>

1344
00:54:58.231 --> 00:54:59.250
<v Speaker 3>Let me check out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1345
00:54:59.251 --> 00:55:00.084
<v Speaker 3>that girl looks big.</v>

1346
00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:03.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't think this is going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she gets demolished and you're</v>

1347
00:55:03.451 --> 00:55:03.841
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1348
00:55:03.841 --> 00:55:07.200
<v Speaker 3>is this a sport?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was a big blow for female</v>

1349
00:55:07.201 --> 00:55:08.440
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>

1350
00:55:08.441 --> 00:55:10.590
<v Speaker 3>There was like one of the best things to</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever happen to feminist finding.</v>

1351
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:12.630
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we're different in that way.</v>

1352
00:55:12.631 --> 00:55:14.370
<v Speaker 3>I think she should have one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would've been the best thing.</v>

1353
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1354
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:17.850
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good to know that anyone can lose.</v>

1355
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Even the greats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the greats,</v>

1356
00:55:19.921 --> 00:55:22.050
<v Speaker 3>they get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get paired to boxing too much is what</v>

1357
00:55:22.051 --> 00:55:23.700
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boxing has gotta be you gotta be</v>

1358
00:55:23.701 --> 00:55:24.770
<v Speaker 3>undefeated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1359
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:26.160
<v Speaker 3>boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We love undefeated.</v>

1360
00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:28.470
<v Speaker 3>One blemish on your record and it does</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1361
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:30.390
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work like that in MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1362
00:55:30.391 --> 00:55:30.691
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1363
00:55:30.691 --> 00:55:32.760
<v Speaker 3>Because in mma there's so many different</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways to win.</v>

1364
00:55:32.761 --> 00:55:36.270
<v Speaker 3>The only one is really undefeated at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>top of the food chain is.</v>

1365
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:37.133
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two guys,</v>

1366
00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:38.500
<v Speaker 3>Khabib,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroma Madoff,</v>

1367
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:40.950
<v Speaker 3>who was the lightweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's undefeated period.</v>

1368
00:55:40.951 --> 00:55:45.320
<v Speaker 3>Mauled everybody except l I acquainted</v>
<v Speaker 3>went the distance with them and you</v>

1369
00:55:45.321 --> 00:55:46.560
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still beat his ass.</v>

1370
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Still beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but John Jones is really undefeated.</v>

1371
00:55:50.251 --> 00:55:53.370
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones has one loss in his career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a disqualification.</v>

1372
00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.970
<v Speaker 3>Is he the guy that's been disqualified</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was well dogs or something</v>

1373
00:55:57.070 --> 00:56:00.870
<v Speaker 3>got caught with some shit in his system</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he shouldn't have had in the system</v>

1374
00:56:00.871 --> 00:56:02.670
<v Speaker 3>and how did he get into it in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>system?</v>

1375
00:56:02.671 --> 00:56:04.770
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was only in there for a very short</v>

1376
00:56:04.771 --> 00:56:07.050
<v Speaker 3>amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of speculation.</v>

1377
00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:09.620
<v Speaker 3>We don't until that gets ironed out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1399
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Started thinking.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you one quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time I ever boxed,</v>

1403
00:56:52.121 --> 00:56:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1404
00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:56.680
<v Speaker 1>I went with Craig Robinson on cracker</v>

1405
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Know we weren't boxing each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Craig was starting to box and he</v>

1406
00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:01.300
<v Speaker 1>took me to the gym and it was this old</v>
<v Speaker 1>black dude.</v>

1407
00:57:01.301 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Speaker 1>He was like in his sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1408
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:03.723
<v Speaker 1>Old School black.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So I got into the ring with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Guy,</v>

1410
00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:06.011
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>after doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>

1418
00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:19.660

<v Speaker 1>Joe didn't keep your head up and I was</v>

1419
00:57:19.661 --> 00:57:21.550
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after he hit me twice,</v>

<v Speaker 1>then it was like 30 seconds left in the</v>

1421
00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.220
<v Speaker 1>fight and he put his hands up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Finally drawn and street.</v>

1424
00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.830
<v Speaker 1>And I kicked him in the nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went like sales off.</v>

1425
00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I went like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>box again for a little while until</v>

1426
00:57:43.631 --> 00:57:45.880
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was one time.</v>

1427
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:47.110
<v Speaker 1>It was once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so hard.</v>

1428
00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:48.730
<v Speaker 1>It was like that three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1429
00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:53.170
<v Speaker 1>how can these people throw 50 punches?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you got to build up to it,</v>

1430
00:57:53.171 --> 00:57:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Eric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to man to come here.</v>

1431
00:57:56.730 --> 00:57:59.470
<v Speaker 1>I need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what I need to work out.</v>

1432
00:57:59.471 --> 00:58:01.280
<v Speaker 1>I need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's laughing.</v>

1433
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:04.210
<v Speaker 1>He's laughing like you can't deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Joe Rogan workout.</v>

1434
00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:08.710
<v Speaker 1>The key is to do a workout top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about doing one a while ago,</v>

1435
00:58:08.711 --> 00:58:11.600
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd read this.</v>

1436
00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I do too many things publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather just keep someone's to just</v>

1437
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.280
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a man who has a family now has,</v>

1438
00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:22.480
<v Speaker 1>has reached a level of success that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>is comfortable and now you're starting</v>

1439
00:58:22.481 --> 00:58:24.850
<v Speaker 1>to see like not everyone needs to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1440
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:29.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that there's value in</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing things just for you.</v>

1441
00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1442
00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:30.641
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1443
00:58:30.641 --> 00:58:31.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1444
00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:31.720
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1445
00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Just working on stuff and doing things</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for you.</v>

1446
00:58:34.271 --> 00:58:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Don't do things publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agree.</v>

1447
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.500
<v Speaker 1>In this day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody does everything on social</v>

1448
00:58:38.501 --> 00:58:41.110
<v Speaker 1>media and I've done a bunch of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them on social media,</v>

1449
00:58:41.111 --> 00:58:44.860
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's benefit like why did you do the</v>

1450
00:58:44.861 --> 00:58:46.120
<v Speaker 1>things you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1451
00:58:46.121 --> 00:58:48.400
<v Speaker 1>I do the things I do for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1452
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:51.460
<v Speaker 1>either I enjoy them or I think they make</v>
<v Speaker 1>me better.</v>

1453
00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:54.290
<v Speaker 1>They make me a better person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it all.</v>

1454
00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Be on your tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of yoga.</v>

1455
00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:59.680
<v Speaker 1>I did yoga today and I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do it a lot and one of the reasons why</v>

1456
00:58:59.681 --> 00:59:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes me a better person.</v>

1457
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:03.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes me more mellow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is good.</v>

1458
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.980
<v Speaker 1>I have a tendency to not be mo mellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me more friendly.</v>

1459
00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it calms me down and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very good for my body,</v>

1460
00:59:12.041 --> 00:59:14.220
<v Speaker 1>so I do it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not about to do some fucking</v>

1461
00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:15.400
<v Speaker 1>yoga video.</v>

1462
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I think I do stand up for that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoga calm.</v>

1463
00:59:18.091 --> 00:59:19.400
<v Speaker 1>He calms you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1464
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1465
00:59:20.651 --> 00:59:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do stand up to like,</v>

1466
00:59:21.681 --> 00:59:22.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did.</v>

1467
00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.240
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It calms me down.</v>

1468
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:26.030
<v Speaker 1>If something happens to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go directly to the stage.</v>

1469
00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:29.750
<v Speaker 1>That's a great way to work on it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like can develop material.</v>

1470
00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>

1471
00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.390
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's something silly.</v>

1472
00:59:32.391 --> 00:59:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Like if I see a movie that moves me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might go on stage and be like,</v>

1473
00:59:35.421 --> 00:59:38.000
<v Speaker 1>did y'all see this movie and where are</v>
<v Speaker 1>you working out now?</v>

1474
00:59:38.001 --> 00:59:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I know you do the store and I know you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the factory,</v>

1475
00:59:40.251 --> 00:59:41.890
<v Speaker 1>but do you fuck around and go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:44.450
<v Speaker 1>the ice house flippers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that shit.</v>

1477
00:59:44.530 --> 00:59:46.220
<v Speaker 1>My start was I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

1478
00:59:46.221 --> 00:59:49.820
<v Speaker 1>when I knew I wanted to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to open mics and then I went</v>

1479
00:59:49.821 --> 00:59:50.540
<v Speaker 1>to Long Beach.</v>

1480
00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:54.410

<v Speaker 1>the Queen Mary and they had a laugh is</v>

1481
00:59:54.411 --> 00:59:57.050
<v Speaker 1>hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This Guy Steve Kimbro had this really</v>

1482
00:59:57.051 --> 01:00:00.680
<v Speaker 1>shitty club on the Queen Mary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did fear factor and the Queen Mary.</v>

1483
01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:03.530
<v Speaker 1>It was right down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember someone was doing a room</v>

1484
01:00:03.531 --> 01:00:05.150
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the room you're talking about.</v>

1485
01:00:05.151 --> 01:00:08.380
<v Speaker 1>So I did that and then I started doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1486

<v Speaker 1>the ice house.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She didn't even look.</v>

1501
01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.630
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What year this was.</v>

1502
01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:47.600
<v Speaker 1>It was a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay Davis got passed so I wanted to kill</v>

1503
01:00:47.601 --> 01:00:51.200
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I showcased with Jay Davis.</v>

1504
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>That's not rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay.</v>

1505
01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Jay knows I'll say this to his fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

1506
01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:03.110
<v Speaker 1>He knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're showcasing the same day right</v>

1507
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>as she passed him and then didn't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to me.</v>

1508
01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wasn't even watching.</v>

1509
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.970
<v Speaker 1>She didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She watched me and I went down.</v>

1510
01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:12.470
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said she didn't like it.</v>

1511
01:01:12.471 --> 01:01:14.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not which really pissed me off here.</v>

1512
01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:18.380
<v Speaker 1>His skin do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This must have been 2000,</v>

1513
01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:22.570
<v Speaker 1>2003 ish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is when Jay was on Torque.</v>

1514
01:01:22.571 --> 01:01:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Asm with Dane Cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dane was supposed to showcase that night</v>

1515
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.420
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he refused to come because he was</v>

1516
01:01:29.421 --> 01:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Dane Cook and I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he refused to show.</v>

1517
01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:32.301
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I hear.</v>

1518
01:01:32.301 --> 01:01:33.134
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't even say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1519
01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I should have asked him before I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about this,</v>

1520
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>but I had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to showcase,</v>

1521
01:01:37.731 --> 01:01:39.380
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Louis Ck didn't get passed at the</v>

1522
01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:43.360
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like she got her own thing,</v>

1523
01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:47.960
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to showcase my then friend a Metta</v>

1524
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Med is setup to showcase that night and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get passed so a year and a half</v>

1525
01:01:52.761 --> 01:01:54.410
<v Speaker 1>later I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to deal with Tommy,</v>

1526
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:55.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1527
01:01:55.691 --> 01:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>and listen as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as what people get on him and I,</v>

1528
01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>I think Tommy's out there thinks I hate</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

1529
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.140
<v Speaker 1>but I know there was a method to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>madness,</v>

1530
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it.</v>

1531
01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.390
<v Speaker 1>And maybe if he didn't even know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it worked for me because he was my</v>

1532
01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:10.580
<v Speaker 1>villain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was my enemy.</v>

1533
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had to get past him.</v>

1534
01:02:12.531 --> 01:02:14.690
<v Speaker 1>He was the gatekeeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to get past.</v>

1535
01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:19.190
<v Speaker 1>So it took me a year and a half of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>belly room and,</v>

1536
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just hanging around and people keep</v>

1537
01:02:21.031 --> 01:02:21.721
<v Speaker 1>saying to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1538
01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>you should put her griffin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1539
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>So then I got another showcase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in the main room,</v>

1540
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during one of those bringer shows.</v>

1541
01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:31.650
<v Speaker 1>They were doing the showcases during</v>
<v Speaker 1>those and she was there.</v>

1542
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>They had her in our booth and I did my</v>
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>

1543
01:02:34.081 --> 01:02:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I ran the fucking light to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1544
01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>

1545
01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>what year are we talking about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like a,</v>

1546
01:02:39.601 --> 01:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>like a year later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like 2005,</v>

1547
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 2005,</v>

1548
01:02:43.501 --> 01:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>2006 around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just around that time.</v>

1549
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand four or five six.</v>

1550
01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1551
01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>And then as I'm leaving there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bringing her through the,</v>

1552
01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main room and their,</v>

1553
01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hair helping her through the</v>

1554
01:02:55.231 --> 01:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>hallway to go to the kitchen and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>stops and she looks at me and says,</v>

1555
01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.060
<v Speaker 1>you have funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the only words she ever spoke</v>

1556
01:03:03.061 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you need.</v>

1557
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.700
<v Speaker 1>That's all I needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Tommy comes over and he was</v>

1558
01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:08.011
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1559
01:03:08.011 --> 01:03:08.331
<v Speaker 1>yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yo,</v>

1560
01:03:08.331 --> 01:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

1561
01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

1562
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:12.150
<v Speaker 1>she passed you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in the belly room now headbutted</v>

1563
01:03:12.151 --> 01:03:14.310

1564
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.500

<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1565
01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.700
<v Speaker 1>And then he told me I had to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>belly room for a year.</v>

1566
01:03:17.701 --> 01:03:20.010
<v Speaker 1>And I knew that was a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He passed me.</v>

1567
01:03:20.011 --> 01:03:21.270
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I needed the,</v>

1568
01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I needed the challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1569
01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my best moments for me personally</v>

1570
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.620
<v Speaker 1>because I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handbag</v>

1571
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:35.610
<v Speaker 1>bad richard over at a comedy and magic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1572
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:37.080
<v Speaker 1>And I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Richard.</v>

1573
01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:39.300
<v Speaker 1>So I tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to showcase for Richard are the</v>

1574
01:03:39.301 --> 01:03:40.620
<v Speaker 1>nicest people ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were so nice.</v>

1575
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:44.190
<v Speaker 1>They treat comics that asked as you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1576
01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:47.790
<v Speaker 1>you go there not to do comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go there to get food at a hug,</v>

1577
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.490
<v Speaker 1>hug people hanging out with good people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man for real.</v>

1578
01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.800
<v Speaker 1>So I remember I tried to showcase for</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

1579
01:03:52.801 --> 01:03:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I sent him a tape and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Erica,</v>

1580
01:03:54.601 --> 01:03:56.640
<v Speaker 1>too dirty and all this stuff and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't pass me.</v>

1581
01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:59.640
<v Speaker 1>So Mazda Brawny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is years later now.</v>

1582
01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Mazda bronys doing a show and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric,</v>

1583
01:04:01.441 --> 01:04:04.050
<v Speaker 1>you won't be on my show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm standing in the hallway before I</v>

1584
01:04:04.051 --> 01:04:07.620
<v Speaker 1>go on with the MC and then we're joking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about being clean,</v>

1585
01:04:07.621 --> 01:04:08.221
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1586
01:04:08.221 --> 01:04:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go up there and pull my</v>
<v Speaker 1>dick out.</v>

1587
01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.460
<v Speaker 1>A guy in a suit is walking down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hallway.</v>

1588
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.360
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dude just walking.</v>

1589
01:04:15.361 --> 01:04:15.990
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1590
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:17.490
<v Speaker 1>please don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

1591
01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:18.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>

1592
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:20.820
<v Speaker 1>And we laugh a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We laugh a little bit.</v>

1593
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I go onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm murder it,</v>

1594
01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:25.530
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm headed to the green room</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that same guy in the suit comes</v>

1595
01:04:25.531 --> 01:04:27.420
<v Speaker 1>running at me and it's Mike is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>owner.</v>

1596
01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

1597
01:04:28.351 --> 01:04:29.340
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>

1598
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:30.870
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1599
01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:33.870
<v Speaker 1>you're hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't you working at my club?</v>

1600
01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Why don't I know you at that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard is in the hallway and then I</v>

1601
01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:40.080
<v Speaker 1>look at Richard and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1602
01:04:40.081 --> 01:04:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I not working here?</v>

1603
01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:44.120
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you do,</v>

1604
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:45.960
<v Speaker 1>do you know you're dirty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1605
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I can play clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I play churches.</v>

1606
01:04:47.941 --> 01:04:50.460
<v Speaker 1>I played cruise ships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a professional comedian.</v>

1607
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:55.980
<v Speaker 1>My point about this is that moment of</v>
<v Speaker 1>him squirming and like being like,</v>

1608
01:04:55.981 --> 01:04:58.410
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in Canada and after that I was in</v>

1609
01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:03.960
<v Speaker 1>that was worth waiting for as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trying to bully my way into places.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1644
01:06:16.521 --> 01:06:18.790
<v Speaker 3>like one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite phone calls I've had</v>

1645
01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:22.050
<v Speaker 3>is Joey Diaz calling me the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1646
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:23.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do this.</v>

1647
01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:24.243
<v Speaker 3>I'll call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1648
01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:25.990
<v Speaker 3>you will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're really good on.</v>

1649
01:06:25.991 --> 01:06:28.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm dying up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's just given me compliments.</v>

1650
01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.070
<v Speaker 3>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just don't.</v>

1651
01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:34.110
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when this comes from someone that you</v>

1652
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:39.040
<v Speaker 3>believe is 100 percent genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the way,</v>

1653
01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:41.380
<v Speaker 3>the way he was talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was like,</v>

1654
01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:42.070
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

1655
01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:44.170
<v Speaker 3>That's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I learned when I got back</v>

1656
01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:45.280
<v Speaker 3>into it later too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1657
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:47.560
<v Speaker 3>when I was 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that you had to get the respect</v>

1658
01:06:47.561 --> 01:06:50.980
<v Speaker 3>of your peers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people that you do this business</v>

1659
01:06:50.981 --> 01:06:53.310
<v Speaker 3>with have to think you're funny because</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the people that are going to</v>

1660
01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:54.010
<v Speaker 3>get you work.</v>

1661
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:54.461
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to,</v>

1662
01:06:54.461 --> 01:06:55.640
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like youtube,</v>

1663
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:58.780
<v Speaker 3>that's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Kevin would be a nice person and</v>

1664
01:06:58.781 --> 01:07:00.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be what you are in a very</v>

1665
01:07:00.911 --> 01:07:02.590
<v Speaker 3>nice person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things that's nice about</v>

1666
01:07:02.591 --> 01:07:05.590
<v Speaker 3>the comedy store for sure is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1667
01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:06.930
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>

1668
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:09.550
<v Speaker 3>I attribute this to the Internet because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what's going on with the</v>

1669
01:07:09.551 --> 01:07:11.560
<v Speaker 3>Internet now is there's so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities for the community,</v>

1670
01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:14.770
<v Speaker 3>for comedians now that we're not in</v>
<v Speaker 3>competition with each other anymore.</v>

1671
01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we've ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We used to be like that man,</v>

1672
01:07:17.411 --> 01:07:20.380
<v Speaker 3>the nineties in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody was like Doggie dog.</v>

1673
01:07:20.381 --> 01:07:24.640
<v Speaker 3>It was different like there was a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people back then that felt like say if</v>

1674
01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:26.830
<v Speaker 3>you got something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a TV show,</v>

1675
01:07:26.831 --> 01:07:29.650
<v Speaker 3>why didn't I get that fucking show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>As people that thought there was a</v>

1676
01:07:29.651 --> 01:07:30.760
<v Speaker 3>limited number of things.</v>

1677
01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.610
<v Speaker 3>It's what I call famine thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever heard that expression?</v>

1678
01:07:33.611 --> 01:07:35.140
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly what that expression is.</v>

1679
01:07:35.141 --> 01:07:39.250
<v Speaker 3>A deadly fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a poison to your life and the</v>

1680
01:07:39.251 --> 01:07:42.220
<v Speaker 3>way you think about the world that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people have that problem,</v>

1681
01:07:42.221 --> 01:07:45.160
<v Speaker 3>that famine thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people still feel like that now.</v>

1682
01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:46.380
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I always,</v>

1683
01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.100
<v Speaker 3>I always liken it to golf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1684
01:07:48.101 --> 01:07:52.060
<v Speaker 3>I think that we're on a leader board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're still fighting against</v>

1685
01:07:52.061 --> 01:07:54.550
<v Speaker 3>ourselves and no golf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're competing,</v>

1686
01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:56.620
<v Speaker 3>you're still competing for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>championship.</v>

1687
01:07:56.621 --> 01:07:58.360
<v Speaker 3>There's no competing at the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>

1688
01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.141
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1689
01:07:59.141 --> 01:08:01.000
<v Speaker 3>But what I'm the world of standup comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

1690
01:08:01.001 --> 01:08:03.730
<v Speaker 3>I think there's so many opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many places to work.</v>

1691
01:08:03.731 --> 01:08:05.830
<v Speaker 3>So many stand when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're doing the road,</v>

1692
01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:08.320
<v Speaker 3>there's so many theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many comedy clubs,</v>

1693
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:10.900
<v Speaker 3>so many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's still only 52 weeks in a</v>

1694
01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.340
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about that.</v>

1695
01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean how many headliners are</v>

01:09:15.830 --> 01:09:19.250
<v Speaker 3>there was a time when you got to a point</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you were doing Friday,</v>

1726
01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:20.650
<v Speaker 3>Saturday and you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1727
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.240
<v Speaker 3>At clubs,</v>

<v Speaker 3>so there's still.</v>

1729
01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:26.510
<v Speaker 3>That was just because I just got tired</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the grind.</v>

1730
01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.180
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what got me more than anything is doing</v>

1731
01:09:29.181 --> 01:09:32.240
<v Speaker 3>morning radio where you had to get up</v>
<v Speaker 3>early in the morning and then you try to</v>

1732
01:09:32.241 --> 01:09:35.450
<v Speaker 3>get some sleep and you never could and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you just wrecked.</v>

1733
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:37.230
<v Speaker 3>And then the only time he didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1735
01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:41.480

<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1738

<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

1839
01:14:04.261 --> 01:14:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Sex robots go fullscreen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1840
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Let me see this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the one I've seen.</v>

1841
01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:11.520
<v Speaker 1>There's always some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1842
01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:12.210
<v Speaker 1>it looks like my phone</v>

1843
01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 3>telling my God that's what she looks</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

1844
01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:15.820
<v Speaker 3>She looks that good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1845
01:14:15.821 --> 01:14:16.840
<v Speaker 3>we're getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1846
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:19.960
<v Speaker 3>just something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

1847
01:14:19.961 --> 01:14:21.340
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how they want it to.</v>

1848
01:14:21.341 --> 01:14:24.630
<v Speaker 3>With the head cover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to ask some weird.</v>

1849
01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:27.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's even weird to look at that hole.</v>

1850
01:14:27.041 --> 01:14:29.890
<v Speaker 3>Where the neck is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

1851
01:14:29.891 --> 01:14:31.740
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1852
01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.790
<v Speaker 3>so the dam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is unbelievably lifelike though.</v>

1853
01:14:35.791 --> 01:14:37.060
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1854
01:14:37.061 --> 01:14:38.890
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a scene in a science fiction</v>

1855
01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:42.370
<v Speaker 3>movie because this was like 1960 and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a science fiction movie.</v>

1856
01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she can blink slowly and seductive.</v>

1857
01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:49.140
<v Speaker 3>Look at it because she's blinking lips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1858
01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:52.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if this was a science fiction movie</v>

1859
01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.700
<v Speaker 3>from like the 19 sixties and they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1860
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:55.990
<v Speaker 3>we'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

1861
01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:59.690
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it would be so far removed from</v>

1862
01:15:00.090 --> 01:15:01.910
<v Speaker 3>farfetch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way that this is going to</v>

1863
01:15:01.911 --> 01:15:04.810
<v Speaker 3>have a look at what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is not far fetched.</v>

1864
01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:07.040
<v Speaker 3>This is close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

1865
01:15:07.050 --> 01:15:11.620
<v Speaker 3>I think that this is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>bypassed by his virtual reality,</v>

1866
01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:14.960
<v Speaker 3>like brain links or some sort of thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>where like you,</v>

1867
01:15:14.961 --> 01:15:18.730
<v Speaker 3>you can stimulate the mind in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think things are happening.</v>

1868
01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:21.580
<v Speaker 3>I think that's going to bypass all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this technology.</v>

1869
01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.710
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think.</v>

1870
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:25.720
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right that that's coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

1871
01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:27.640
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think this is coming to.</v>

1872
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:28.720
<v Speaker 3>I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1873
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:32.950
<v Speaker 3>the ability to have like a real</v>
<v Speaker 3>realistic robot that'll fuck you.</v>

1874
01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.980
<v Speaker 3>That's not hard because you just think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about all the moves that it has to do.</v>

1875
01:15:36.150 --> 01:15:38.230
<v Speaker 3>Not a lot of moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you know,</v>

1876
01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:39.970
<v Speaker 3>also there'll be quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1877
01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:42.940
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think also a good thing if it's</v>

1878
01:15:42.941 --> 01:15:46.540
<v Speaker 3>possible is have a move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have a robot like that to practice</v>

1879
01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:49.870
<v Speaker 3>martial arts on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like have a robot that throws punches</v>

1880
01:15:49.871 --> 01:15:50.704
<v Speaker 3>and kicks.</v>

1881
01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.230
<v Speaker 3>See now you're thinking about improving</v>
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>

1882
01:15:53.231 --> 01:15:55.330
<v Speaker 3>not just for sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can have a robot teach you to</v>

1883
01:15:55.331 --> 01:15:57.900
<v Speaker 3>play piano.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Teach you how to do like I'm just</v>

1884
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:59.680
<v Speaker 3>talking about a robot that you can fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1885
01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:02.210
<v Speaker 3>Like leg kick you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You though body kick in.</v>

1886
01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:04.090
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to hurt training thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1887
01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:04.953
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1888
01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:06.820
<v Speaker 3>it's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1889
01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:09.160
<v Speaker 3>Have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm a robot in there cooking.</v>

1890
01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.180
<v Speaker 3>How it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1891
01:16:10.181 --> 01:16:13.330
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't move quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it moves slowly so you can just work</v>

1892
01:16:13.331 --> 01:16:16.450
<v Speaker 3>on drills and shit is already have one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1893
01:16:16.451 --> 01:16:16.791
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1894
01:16:16.791 --> 01:16:17.501
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No they don't.</v>

1895
01:16:17.501 --> 01:16:19.390
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just a fucking punching bag that</v>

1896
01:16:19.391 --> 01:16:22.510
<v Speaker 3>moves back and forth and stupid things</v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

1897
01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:27.550
<v Speaker 3>Like that throws throws back at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to a person this is like,</v>

1898
01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.120
<v Speaker 3>but this is good for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hyperextending elbows.</v>

1899
01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:32.320
<v Speaker 3>You're going to miss this thing and hurt</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

1900
01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly.</v>

1901
01:16:35.410 --> 01:16:39.340
<v Speaker 3>I think you figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your idea about having a of take instead</v>

1902
01:16:39.341 --> 01:16:42.980
<v Speaker 3>of having a sex robot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that same technology used for fine arts</v>

1903
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:44.230
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1904
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:46.720
<v Speaker 3>because I have a dummy that I practice</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jiu Jitsu on,</v>

1905
01:16:46.721 --> 01:16:49.210
<v Speaker 3>but it's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called a but dummy.</v>

1906
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:53.260
<v Speaker 3>It just lays there like this and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I can practice armbars and</v>

1907
01:16:53.261 --> 01:16:54.880
<v Speaker 3>triangles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get reps on it.</v>

1908
01:16:54.881 --> 01:16:55.990
<v Speaker 3>I just don't call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1909
01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:57.700
<v Speaker 3>But it's not as good as doing it with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

1910
01:16:57.701 --> 01:17:01.030
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard to get a person to stand</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and let you do fucking choke them</v>

1911
01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:02.570
<v Speaker 3>over and over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm saying,</v>

1912
01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.240
<v Speaker 3>but a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A robot could.</v>

1913
01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:08.230
<v Speaker 3>You could get us male sex doll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta order it specifically.</v>

1914
01:17:08.231 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 3>I want the sealed.</v>

1915
01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:15.380
<v Speaker 1>I want the Dick removed from mouth post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hold on.</v>

1916
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:16.243
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

1917
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Why does the butthole need to be sealed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to be tempted?</v>

1918
01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Can accuse me of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even work,</v>

1919
01:17:26.601 --> 01:17:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show you can take the gate off.</v>

1920
01:17:29.490 --> 01:17:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does the butthole still work?</v>

1921
01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:36.100
<v Speaker 1>I specifically called and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1922
01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.450
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this cock so large?</v>

1923
01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Larger glistening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it smell like strawberry?</v>

1924
01:17:43.341 --> 01:17:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd always be dirty to here.</v>

1925
01:17:44.931 --> 01:17:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is your feed to couple of specks of</v>

1926
01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:51.050
<v Speaker 1>blood on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't feel like it's been cleaned</v>

1927
01:17:51.051 --> 01:17:55.610
<v Speaker 1>and used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep the plastic on it like a phone,</v>

1928
01:17:55.611 --> 01:17:57.690
<v Speaker 1>you know when you get your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those</v>

1929
01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:01.820
<v Speaker 3>real dolls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they move like a real person like you.</v>

1930
01:18:01.930 --> 01:18:04.920
<v Speaker 3>If you didn't mind practicing on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>girl real doll,</v>

1931
01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:08.020
<v Speaker 3>you would order the girl real dog with</v>
<v Speaker 3>like small breasts,</v>

1932
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:10.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like the breast don't get in the way</v>

1933
01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:14.200
<v Speaker 3>and then you can work your mount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get armbars in your triangles and then</v>

1934
01:18:14.201 --> 01:18:16.220

<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

1936
01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.960

<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1937
01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.390
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very different than dating.</v>

1938
01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you dated quite a few data,</v>

<v Speaker 3>completely.</v>

1943
01:18:32.370 --> 01:18:34.650
<v Speaker 3>I bet they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't even train together.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1953
01:18:48.761 --> 01:18:51.340
<v Speaker 3>what is it for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just to distract you and give you</v>

1954
01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:54.940
<v Speaker 3>something fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're so close to Roman times where</v>

1955
01:18:54.941 --> 01:18:56.310
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1956
01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.060
<v Speaker 3>we want someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1957
01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.910
<v Speaker 3>you see that bare knuckle boxing event</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did this past weekend.</v>

1958
01:19:00.911 --> 01:19:02.980
<v Speaker 3>No Sec could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't with that man.</v>

1959
01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:05.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just not into like watching violence</v>

1960
01:19:05.381 --> 01:19:07.660
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a problem with it,</v>

1961
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:10.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't know why.</v>

1962
01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:12.340
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Mohammed Ali,</v>

1963
01:19:12.970 --> 01:19:14.980
<v Speaker 3>like how he was in his later in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1964
01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:17.230
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would anyone do this?</v>

1965
01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.840
<v Speaker 3>Even when I watched professional</v>
<v Speaker 3>athletes like,</v>

1966
01:19:20.770 --> 01:19:22.990
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm saying.</v>

1967
01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't.</v>

1968
01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:26.290
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did it in Wyoming.</v>

1969
01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:29.680
<v Speaker 3>Legalized bare knuckle boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That just looks horrible.</v>

1970
01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea is you can't hit people as hard</v>

1971
01:19:33.731 --> 01:19:36.100
<v Speaker 3>with bare knuckles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're going to get cut up a little</v>

1972
01:19:36.101 --> 01:19:37.570
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're not.</v>

1973
01:19:37.630 --> 01:19:39.580
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>head trauma.</v>

1974
01:19:39.610 --> 01:19:41.860
<v Speaker 3>No one willing to do to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Man.</v>

1975
01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:44.650
<v Speaker 3>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's his name to hit a rudy Tom.</v>

1976
01:19:44.651 --> 01:19:46.830
<v Speaker 3>John of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who that is.</v>

1977
01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:51.460
<v Speaker 3>The coach coach from Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember when he was playing in the NBA</v>

1978
01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:54.700
<v Speaker 3>that they used to fight in the NBA in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seventies.</v>

1979
01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:58.420
<v Speaker 3>They fist to fist fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to have real fights at.</v>

1980
01:19:58.421 --> 01:20:01.300
<v Speaker 3>Somebody's got 77,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got clocked in the head and he,</v>

1981
01:20:01.301 --> 01:20:04.060
<v Speaker 3>he broke his orbital bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this like,</v>

1982
01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.800
<v Speaker 3>this was normal oil things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1983
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:08.340
<v Speaker 3>Let me say that they would just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1984
01:20:08.341 --> 01:20:09.870
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He found it.</v>

1985
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:13.770
<v Speaker 3>See now you got to see the replay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1986
01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:16.290
<v Speaker 3>Cause he came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1987
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:19.080
<v Speaker 3>so what's what's happening here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to see what's going on.</v>

1988
01:20:19.170 --> 01:20:22.350
<v Speaker 3>Rudy comes and this guy clocks him in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the head.</v>

1989
01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at the wrong dudes.</v>

1990
01:20:24.630 --> 01:20:25.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1991
01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.131
<v Speaker 3>Watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here he comes.</v>

1992
01:20:26.131 --> 01:20:29.970
<v Speaker 3>He's just coming in to like to like stop</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight and this guy thought he was</v>

1993
01:20:29.971 --> 01:20:32.930
<v Speaker 3>coming at him and he's running right</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards that.</v>

1994
01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Ruined his career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it?</v>

1995
01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.970
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's an orbital fracture and</v>

1996
01:20:36.971 --> 01:20:39.300
<v Speaker 3>that's real common in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happens all the time,</v>

1997
01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.670
<v Speaker 3>but like imagine with knuckles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1998
01:20:41.690 --> 01:20:44.820
<v Speaker 3>I do you really think that that's not as</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

1999
01:20:44.821 --> 01:20:49.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you with gloves just as bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can hit harder.</v>

2000
01:20:49.171 --> 01:20:51.180
<v Speaker 3>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can hit someone hard too because it</v>

2001
01:20:51.181 --> 01:20:53.970
<v Speaker 3>doesn't hurt your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the gloves are not protecting</v>

2002
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:56.430
<v Speaker 3>the opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gloves are protecting your hand.</v>

2003
01:20:56.490 --> 01:20:58.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get that from doing this box because I</v>

2004
01:20:58.381 --> 01:21:01.770
<v Speaker 3>take my hand out these gloves and my</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking fingers are killing me.</v>

2005
01:21:01.810 --> 01:21:02.643
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take,</v>

2006
01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:05.730
<v Speaker 3>take no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no gloves and go over to my heavy bag</v>

2007
01:21:05.731 --> 01:21:08.460
<v Speaker 3>because that heavy bag is stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go over and start punching that.</v>

2008
01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:11.940
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same with punching a person.</v>

2009
01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:13.470
<v Speaker 3>14 ounce or 16 ounce?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2010
01:21:13.471 --> 01:21:15.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure which one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to feel,</v>

2011
01:21:15.181 --> 01:21:17.160
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes I went to 14 ounces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

2012
01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.720
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a little more speed.</v>

2013
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:19.583
<v Speaker 3>I got a little more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2014
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:22.410
<v Speaker 3>two extra ounces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes and yeah.</v>

2015
01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:26.870
<v Speaker 3>Well these are zero ounces hands move</v>
<v Speaker 3>very well.</v>

2016
01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:29.890
<v Speaker 3>And MMA there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four there.</v>

2017
01:21:29.891 --> 01:21:30.750
<v Speaker 3>Four ounce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2018
01:21:30.751 --> 01:21:34.170
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That looked terrible.</v>

2019
01:21:34.230 --> 01:21:36.390
<v Speaker 3>Those guys' faces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That can't be.</v>

2020
01:21:36.710 --> 01:21:38.670
<v Speaker 3>You could break someone's nose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

2021
01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:41.490
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's nose gets broken in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody,</v>

2022
01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:43.610
<v Speaker 3>everybody's face gets broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Orbital bone.</v>

2023
01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:44.640
<v Speaker 3>This is your world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2024
01:21:44.641 --> 01:21:45.840
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear you.</v>

2025
01:21:45.841 --> 01:21:50.400
<v Speaker 3>I turned the thing on and I hear your</v>
<v Speaker 3>voice and the other day I was on Fx.</v>

2026
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:52.530
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh that's Joe Rogan and you're just</v>

2027
01:21:52.531 --> 01:21:54.390
<v Speaker 3>going in and you sound like a totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>different person.</v>

2028
01:21:54.391 --> 01:21:55.870
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get low.</v>

2029
01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.800
<v Speaker 3>Like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're,</v>

2030
01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:00.720
<v Speaker 3>you're in a whole different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in that mode too,</v>

2031
01:22:00.721 --> 01:22:02.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just sound like if it was like</v>

2032
01:22:02.131 --> 01:22:03.600
<v Speaker 3>rocky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rocky movie,</v>

2033
01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:05.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you hear the announcers,</v>

2034
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:07.830
<v Speaker 3>that's you right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got it down man.</v>

2035
01:22:09.970 --> 01:22:13.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but doing it a long time to get us all.</v>

2036
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:15.090
<v Speaker 3>But that's your world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not trying to disrespect your</v>

2037
01:22:15.091 --> 01:22:16.480
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just too violent for me.</v>

2038
01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.910
<v Speaker 3>What you've seen with that punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was 1977 and they probably didn't</v>

2039
01:22:20.911 --> 01:22:23.970
<v Speaker 3>know how to fix those things back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now they know how to fix orbital</v>

2040
01:22:23.971 --> 01:22:26.610
<v Speaker 3>fractures and things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that make it okay?</v>

2041
01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:30.800
<v Speaker 3>But I'm telling you it's not that guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>punched that guy with gloves on have</v>

2042
01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:33.810
<v Speaker 3>been just as bad as it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boxing gloves,</v>

2043
01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.880
<v Speaker 3>boxing gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably wouldn't have got hurt as</v>

2044
01:22:35.881 --> 01:22:38.100
<v Speaker 3>much because you're dealing with a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>thick,</v>

2045
01:22:38.101 --> 01:22:39.510
<v Speaker 3>heavy pad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2046
01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:42.030
<v Speaker 3>box goes eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 ounces depending on the fight,</v>

2047
01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:43.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just.</v>

2048
01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying.</v>

2049
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:50.000
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know that is what you get</v>

2050
01:22:50.251 --> 01:22:51.600
<v Speaker 3>mostly as cuts.</v>

2051
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:54.840
<v Speaker 3>Like you see those guys were all cut up</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the knuckles,</v>

2052
01:22:54.841 --> 01:22:59.841
<v Speaker 3>the bare knuckles are hitting this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heres what I do this and I'm knocking on</v>

2053
01:23:00.911 --> 01:23:01.860
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel wow.</v>

2054
01:23:01.861 --> 01:23:03.760
<v Speaker 3>I just feel how that would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh man.</v>

2055
01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:08.350
<v Speaker 3>Well it's because a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was saying for the longest time you</v>

2056
01:23:08.351 --> 01:23:12.130
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't have even wraps on your hands</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it gives people an unrealistic</v>

2057
01:23:12.131 --> 01:23:16.330
<v Speaker 3>idea of what you could do with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands and why are there pads on your</v>

2058
01:23:16.331 --> 01:23:18.310
<v Speaker 3>knuckles when there's not pads on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>shins?</v>

2059
01:23:18.311 --> 01:23:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Are Pads on your knees or pads on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>pads and your elbow because you're</v>

2060
01:23:22.361 --> 01:23:27.010
<v Speaker 3>smashing people with elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is way more power that you can</v>

2061
01:23:27.011 --> 01:23:31.090
<v Speaker 3>generate hitting someone with an elbow</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a bear elbow than you can with a</v>

2062
01:23:31.091 --> 01:23:34.870
<v Speaker 3>bare fist because a bare fist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you hit someone in the forehead or</v>

2063
01:23:34.871 --> 01:23:37.120
<v Speaker 3>even in the cheek,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you break your hand.</v>

2064
01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not with the elbow.</v>

2065
01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:41.770

2087
01:24:49.511 --> 01:24:54.460
<v Speaker 3>he went to Orlando where the fight was</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they either misdiagnosed him or they</v>

2088
01:24:54.461 --> 01:24:57.010
<v Speaker 3>missed some of the injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was still fucked up.</v>

2089
01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.420
<v Speaker 3>They didn't catch a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2090
01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:03.730
<v Speaker 3>and then he went to another doctor and</v>
<v Speaker 3>got an MRI and they immediately took him</v>

2091
01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:04.391

2093
01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.000
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it.</v>

2094
01:25:09.010 --> 01:25:10.060
<v Speaker 3>This is legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's my.</v>

2095
01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:12.550
<v Speaker 3>Have you bought yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You find this stuff?</v>

2096
01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:15.190
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no mma fight and I kickbox and</v>

2097
01:25:15.191 --> 01:25:17.220
<v Speaker 3>I fought in a lot of taekwondo</v>
<v Speaker 3>tournament.</v>

2098
01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:18.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

2099
01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.740
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing in you to know right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2100
01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:23.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm 50 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fuck am I doing doing that?</v>

2101
01:25:23.210 --> 01:25:27.460
<v Speaker 3>They got like a 42 and overleaf</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

2102
01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:29.170
<v Speaker 3>But there are some guys that are in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their forties.</v>

2103
01:25:29.171 --> 01:25:31.590
<v Speaker 3>They still fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just,</v>

2104
01:25:31.591 --> 01:25:33.310
<v Speaker 3>it's a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a young man's game,</v>

2105
01:25:33.311 --> 01:25:36.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also a young man's game because by</v>

2106
01:25:36.221 --> 01:25:37.930
<v Speaker 3>the time you're 40,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to think you've been doing it</v>

2107
01:25:37.931 --> 01:25:40.030
<v Speaker 3>for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means you've been absorbing a lot</v>

2108
01:25:40.031 --> 01:25:43.540
<v Speaker 3>of punishment for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means you're probably,</v>

2109
01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:48.780
<v Speaker 3>you should probably be done if you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to live into your seventies and eighties</v>

2110
01:25:50.081 --> 01:25:53.350
<v Speaker 3>and be able to hold your bowels in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>know where your keys are.</v>

2111
01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:56.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain point in time we can't</v>

2112
01:25:56.201 --> 01:25:59.630
<v Speaker 3>get hit anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you look at even other sports you've</v>

2113
01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:01.000
<v Speaker 3>noticed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen these old basketball</v>

2114
01:26:01.001 --> 01:26:02.140
<v Speaker 3>players?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How he can't walk?</v>

2115
01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:03.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2116
01:26:03.421 --> 01:26:04.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It needs to get devastated.</v>

2117
01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:08.060
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doc rivers,</v>

2118
01:26:08.061 --> 01:26:09.850
<v Speaker 3>I got clippers tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'd see doc rivers,</v>

2119
01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:11.600
<v Speaker 3>he's on the sideline and he can't even.</v>

2120
01:26:11.670 --> 01:26:14.570
<v Speaker 3>It was also really tall guy and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that alone,</v>

2121
01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:17.870
<v Speaker 3>all those leverage points and all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>impact,</v>

2122
01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:19.460
<v Speaker 3>the constant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially.</v>

2123
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:22.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't understand overtraining.</v>

2124
01:26:22.551 --> 01:26:25.380
<v Speaker 3>They overtrain they had injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just toughed it out and work</v>

2125
01:26:25.381 --> 01:26:26.660
<v Speaker 3>through them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know,</v>

2126
01:26:26.661 --> 01:26:29.930
<v Speaker 3>back injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird spinal issues.</v>

2127
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:33.410
<v Speaker 3>That's why I think they should let every</v>
<v Speaker 3>professional athlete for like there's a</v>

2128
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:37.310
<v Speaker 3>week period where they get to take some</v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids and recover a week.</v>

2129
01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.710
<v Speaker 3>You're just not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2130
01:26:38.730 --> 01:26:39.640
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh you know,</v>

2131
01:26:39.650 --> 01:26:42.680
<v Speaker 3>but you'd have to be on a cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to be on a cycle for six to</v>

2132
01:26:42.681 --> 01:26:46.130
<v Speaker 3>eight weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the off season you get that six to</v>

2133
01:26:46.131 --> 01:26:51.131
<v Speaker 3>eight weeks of like that cream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steroid cream and cryotherapy,</v>

2134
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:53.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can do the Cryo to get your body</v>

2135
01:26:53.691 --> 01:26:58.220
<v Speaker 3>like I agree with the doctor gives you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the doctor gives regular people steroids</v>

2136
01:26:58.221 --> 01:26:59.630
<v Speaker 3>to recover from certain injuries.</v>

2137
01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:01.410
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when paying these people there</v>

2138
01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:04.790
<v Speaker 3>to entertain us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether we should allow them to take a</v>

2139
01:27:04.791 --> 01:27:05.750
<v Speaker 3>moment to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2140
01:27:05.751 --> 01:27:09.380
<v Speaker 3>well here's my six week period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get my steroids in and get</v>

2141
01:27:09.381 --> 01:27:11.300
<v Speaker 3>myself back to normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we'll start training camp.</v>

2142
01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.970
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is when you go on a cycle,</v>

2143
01:27:13.971 --> 01:27:18.380
<v Speaker 3>let's say if you want on steroids cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your endocrine system shuts down and so</v>

2144
01:27:18.381 --> 01:27:22.490
<v Speaker 3>then when you go off the steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body has a normalization period.</v>

2145
01:27:22.491 --> 01:27:25.520
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the hard numbers,</v>

2146
01:27:25.521 --> 01:27:28.950
<v Speaker 3>but I think what they try to say is it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 percent of the time that you were on</v>

2147
01:27:28.951 --> 01:27:31.070
<v Speaker 3>the steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So say if you're on steroids for three</v>

2148
01:27:31.071 --> 01:27:33.560
<v Speaker 3>months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would need a one and a half month</v>

2149
01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:36.580
<v Speaker 3>recovery period before your hormones</v>
<v Speaker 3>normalized.</v>

2150
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:39.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes you need help getting your</v>

2151
01:27:39.351 --> 01:27:40.520
<v Speaker 3>hormones to a normalized.</v>

2152
01:27:40.530 --> 01:27:42.600
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of things called</v>
<v Speaker 3>clomiphene.</v>

2153
01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:45.500
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of pitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that although also illegal stuff?</v>

2154
01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.030
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those are illegal.</v>

2155
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:49.010
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depending on what.</v>

2156
01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.050
<v Speaker 3>You know what the regulations are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2157
01:27:51.150 --> 01:27:53.350
<v Speaker 3>what sport you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in mma you went to other sports.</v>

2158
01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:54.980
<v Speaker 3>Do you watch football,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball and all that?</v>

2159
01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:57.020

<v Speaker 3>I don't even know the rules.</v>

2160
01:27:57.170 --> 01:27:59.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I watch a football game,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're blowing hard with that.</v>

2180
01:28:41.850 --> 01:28:44.930
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go deep son.</v>

2181
01:28:45.050 --> 01:28:48.100
<v Speaker 3>You just made people throw up those</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2182
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Listening to the funny of the fluid</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out of people's noses is so vile</v>

2183
01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:54.360
<v Speaker 3>that sound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2184
01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:56.690
<v Speaker 3>like when someone like you on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball court or something like that</v>

2185
01:28:56.691 --> 01:28:58.550
<v Speaker 3>and someone does a rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2186
01:28:58.890 --> 01:29:00.540
<v Speaker 3>you see it like</v>

2187
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.890
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this from the guy that wants to watch</v>

2188
01:29:04.891 --> 01:29:07.530
<v Speaker 1>blood on people's face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to watch blood on people's</v>

2189
01:29:07.531 --> 01:29:09.150
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that it would don't get it</v>

2190
01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:11.640
<v Speaker 1>stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get a thrill out of when</v>

2191
01:29:11.641 --> 01:29:14.160
<v Speaker 1>somebody gets punched and then they turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and they're just like,</v>

2192
01:29:14.190 --> 01:29:15.150
<v Speaker 1>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2193
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:18.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't get a thrill out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a thrill out of knockouts for</v>

2194
01:29:18.841 --> 01:29:21.900
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And which is worse guys hitting people</v>

2195
01:29:22.170 --> 01:29:25.560
<v Speaker 1>with big shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like not specifically about</v>

2196
01:29:25.561 --> 01:29:26.311
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2197
01:29:26.311 --> 01:29:29.670
<v Speaker 1>I think I don't like blood because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets in the way and it stops.</v>

2198
01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Fight stops the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2199
01:29:30.901 --> 01:29:33.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the argument against elbows</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually said it.</v>

2200
01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped good fights,</v>

2201
01:29:34.801 --> 01:29:36.980
<v Speaker 1>but they also knocked people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just throw that out?</v>

2202
01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Like garbage over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had garbage and it's just fucking.</v>

2203
01:29:40.890 --> 01:29:45.890

<v Speaker 1>one thing that's weird about specials</v>

2249
01:31:43.771 --> 01:31:45.180
<v Speaker 1>now that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have to be.</v>

2250
01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.880
<v Speaker 1>You could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh they filmed that a year ago or two</v>

2251
01:31:47.881 --> 01:31:49.890
<v Speaker 1>years ago and it's like we're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to like,</v>

2252
01:31:50.210 --> 01:31:51.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>topical Shit,</v>

2253
01:31:51.490 --> 01:31:53.820
<v Speaker 1>do topical stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like because there's so much</v>

2254
01:31:53.821 --> 01:31:55.800
<v Speaker 1>content out there right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like get it out there.</v>

01:31:55.801 --> 01:31:57.000
<v Speaker 1>I want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for me,</v>

2256
01:31:57.001 --> 01:31:59.500
<v Speaker 1>like I want to know what Joe Rogan</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks about,</v>

2257
01:31:59.790 --> 01:32:01.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that's going on,</v>

2258
01:32:01.211 --> 01:32:02.970

<v Speaker 1>minutes on a,</v>

2259
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:04.180
<v Speaker 1>on a national scale.</v>

2260
01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:06.310
<v Speaker 1>And we just don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we got to do that now.</v>

2261
01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I think we should be doing that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're putting out stuff so fast</v>

2262
01:32:09.371 --> 01:32:10.210
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's like,</v>

2263
01:32:10.211 --> 01:32:12.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's not special anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you need to stop calling them</v>

<v Speaker 1>specials special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the name for them?</v>

2265
01:32:16.421 --> 01:32:20.830

<v Speaker 1>it should be like our conversations.</v>

2266
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:24.340
<v Speaker 1>So this is Erik Griffin conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling stones don't put out a special</v>

<v Speaker 1>We put out a special.</v>

2269
01:32:28.481 --> 01:32:32.080

<v Speaker 1>five of them are year and you had to be</v>

2270
01:32:32.081 --> 01:32:34.080
<v Speaker 1>a giant to get one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like a.</v>

2271
01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.180
<v Speaker 1>and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was like a celebration of your career</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your fans.</v>

2273
01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:39.670
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've made it,</v>

2274
01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:43.360
<v Speaker 1>here's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your fans could go yo to not fans.</v>

2276
01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:48.280
<v Speaker 1>And you now we're introducing four of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in a career,</v>

2277
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:51.460
<v Speaker 1>a career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my second one now.</v>

2278
01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Nobody saw the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2279
01:32:55.661 --> 01:32:57.280
<v Speaker 1>So the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't that long ago,</v>

2280
01:32:57.740 --> 01:32:58.451
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2281
01:32:58.451 --> 01:33:00.520
<v Speaker 1>it was last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It came out last year,</v>

2282
01:33:00.521 --> 01:33:02.830
<v Speaker 1>but I taped it two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>year before.</v>

2283
01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:05.260
<v Speaker 1>So it took a year to come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took a year to come out because they</v>

2284
01:33:05.261 --> 01:33:07.990
<v Speaker 1>wanted it to come out with the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dying up here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They wanted it to come out with the</v>

2286
01:33:11.291 --> 01:33:12.670
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the same thing happened this</v>

2287
01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:13.290
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm dying.</v>

<v Speaker 1>can they watch it on?</v>

2290
01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Can eventually they'll be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2291

2293
01:33:26.291 --> 01:33:28.390
<v Speaker 1>you could watch it there and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that we need to.</v>

2294
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear with all this stuff</v>

2295
01:33:30.251 --> 01:33:33.490
<v Speaker 1>that's been going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with trump and the trump era,</v>

2296
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:35.990
<v Speaker 1>I imagine like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see what he said today,</v>

2297
01:33:36.230 --> 01:33:38.310
<v Speaker 1>what he thinks he can pardon himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2298
01:33:38.311 --> 01:33:41.800
<v Speaker 1>There's always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote pardon?</v>

2299
01:33:41.801 --> 01:33:43.600
<v Speaker 1>In all caps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hardened himself.</v>

2300
01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Pardon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In all caps in all caps.</v>

2301
01:33:46.511 --> 01:33:47.344
<v Speaker 1>He wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pardon?</v>

2302
01:33:47.730 --> 01:33:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Like this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we did this.</v>

2303
01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people did it.</v>

2304
01:33:51.041 --> 01:33:52.900
<v Speaker 1>I did do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I voted for Gary Johnson.</v>

2305
01:33:52.901 --> 01:33:54.490
<v Speaker 1>He was on my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I voted for him.</v>

2306
01:33:54.810 --> 01:33:56.770
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will say,</v>

2307
01:33:56.771 --> 01:33:59.290
<v Speaker 1>well that's a vote for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really in this day and age,</v>

2308
01:33:59.350 --> 01:34:02.660
<v Speaker 1>how dare you say not because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>California and California went for</v>

2309
01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Clinton anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2310
01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:07.390
<v Speaker 1>because the coral Chia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the way,</v>

2311
01:34:07.391 --> 01:34:09.430
<v Speaker 1>if they took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they got rid of the electoral college</v>

2312
01:34:09.570 --> 01:34:12.130
<v Speaker 1>and the Republican candidate would come</v>
<v Speaker 1>to California,</v>

2313
01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:15.040
<v Speaker 1>they'd go up to northern California and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd get 10,</v>

2314
01:34:15.041 --> 01:34:16.930
<v Speaker 1>15 million votes for them.</v>

2315
01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So northern,</v>

2316
01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:21.640
<v Speaker 1>northern California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anything between San Francisco and,</v>

2317
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:25.450
<v Speaker 1>and you know all the way down the five</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come into here too,</v>

2318
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:27.520
<v Speaker 1>not just northern California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause people think in northern</v>

2319
01:34:27.521 --> 01:34:31.200
<v Speaker 1>California as being like San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

2320
01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:31.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2321
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Those hours driving above San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive for eight hours and still be in</v>

2322
01:34:36.551 --> 01:34:37.420
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2323
01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:42.280
<v Speaker 1>That's how it is a day drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go from Mexico all the way up to</v>

2324
01:34:42.281 --> 01:34:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a day it,</v>

2325
01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:45.550
<v Speaker 1>these people that live on the east coast</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Midwest,</v>

2326
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:46.200
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2328
01:34:47.561 --> 01:34:49.440
<v Speaker 1>they go through four states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2329
01:34:49.441 --> 01:34:51.370
<v Speaker 1>When they have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not us man over here.</v>

2330
01:34:51.371 --> 01:34:54.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's tough to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why they want to change into</v>

2331
01:34:54.491 --> 01:34:56.570
<v Speaker 1>like three California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you heard that shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're talking about putting on the</v>

2333
01:34:58.971 --> 01:34:59.510
<v Speaker 1>ballot.</v>

2334

<v Speaker 1>San Francisco and then farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what would that do to the electoral</v>

2340
01:35:12.531 --> 01:35:15.440
<v Speaker 1>votes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the question like we have 55 now,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jamie California is the fifth largest</v>

2345
01:35:27.411 --> 01:35:31.910
<v Speaker 1>economy in the world and the world.</v>

<v Speaker 1>population of the United States live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>California?</v>

2354
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Thirteen percent or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something silly like one and we don't</v>

2355
01:35:57.950 --> 01:36:00.460
<v Speaker 1>know the real numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was way more than that.</v>

2356
01:36:00.461 --> 01:36:02.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit less than.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was more before.</v>

2357
01:36:02.661 --> 01:36:04.940
<v Speaker 1>I thought they think there's 20 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>people here.</v>

2358
01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:08.300

2361
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:15.890

<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lady that cleans my house,</v>

2369
01:36:29.331 --> 01:36:34.331

<v Speaker 1>like this job I'm in now is the last job</v>

<v Speaker 1>going to do well,</v>

2377
01:36:51.710 --> 01:36:53.780

<v Speaker 1>I want to get the house.</v>

2378

<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a podcast?</v>

2380
01:36:56.930 --> 01:36:58.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time to get a pass to the</v>

2381
01:36:58.811 --> 01:37:00.110
<v Speaker 1>next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on it.</v>

2382
01:37:00.230 --> 01:37:03.170
<v Speaker 1>To what you're good at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be perfect at it.</v>

2383
01:37:03.190 --> 01:37:04.150
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2384
01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:05.180
<v Speaker 1>we'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll be competing.</v>

2385
01:37:05.181 --> 01:37:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2386
01:37:06.981 --> 01:37:09.380
<v Speaker 1>I have everybody on my podcast and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that.</v>

2387
01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:11.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean supposedly competing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want them to do well.</v>

2388
01:37:11.841 --> 01:37:13.550
<v Speaker 1>I think there's enough out there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

2389
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:16.460
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that this is about people's own</v>

2390
01:37:16.461 --> 01:37:21.110
<v Speaker 1>personal time anyway when they listen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your podcast and then they listened to</v>

2391
01:37:21.111 --> 01:37:24.050
<v Speaker 1>the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's like it's not live</v>

2392
01:37:24.051 --> 01:37:25.670
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's live anymore.</v>

2393
01:37:25.671 --> 01:37:28.580
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know when my favorite</v>

2394
01:37:28.581 --> 01:37:29.450
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

2395
01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:33.470

<v Speaker 1>watch him all my shows come on on Sunday</v>

2396
01:37:33.471 --> 01:37:35.300
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I look at it because that's</v>

2397
01:37:35.301 --> 01:37:37.160
<v Speaker 1>when I watch TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2398
01:37:37.161 --> 01:37:39.950
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a unique thing and most of the</v>

2399
01:37:39.951 --> 01:37:43.580
<v Speaker 1>shit I watched these days is on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all streaming.</v>

2400
01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a juggernaut they are.</v>

2401
01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:50.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't be sustainable because so.</v>

2402
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.691
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2403
01:37:50.691 --> 01:37:54.930
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I drop $60,000,000 on,</v>

2404
01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I dropped $60 million to make a project</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you watch it in 10 hours,</v>

2405
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.880
<v Speaker 1>then you're.</v>

2406
01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Then you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Netflix is going to stop this.</v>

2410
01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:10.590
<v Speaker 1>The whole show comes out in one sitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna probably do it in chunks.</v>

2411
01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Why would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you want,</v>

2412
01:38:12.330 --> 01:38:16.540
<v Speaker 1>you anticipate anticipation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it does to your brain,</v>

2413
01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.760
<v Speaker 1>to the board room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you walk out of this mine,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anticipation.</v>

2418
01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically feels just as good as</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual achieving the thing.</v>

2419
01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:34.140
<v Speaker 1>That anticipation you feel like waiting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see what happens next week you're on</v>

<v Speaker 1>successful things ever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>losing money all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pay $10 a month there.</v>

2432
01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:14.940

<v Speaker 1>but then also putting out money.</v>

2433

2436
01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:27.050
<v Speaker 1>which I know they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They paid way more than that for each of</v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to $50 million.</v>

2440
01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm the worst at doing simple math in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people are justifying that $10 a</v>

2451
01:40:03.091 --> 01:40:05.010
<v Speaker 1>month that they spend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when they have their contacts</v>

2452
01:40:05.610 --> 01:40:08.210
<v Speaker 1>constantly coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to keep that really close to</v>

2453
01:40:08.211 --> 01:40:12.180
<v Speaker 1>suppress surpassing Disney's valuation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how crazy that is?</v>

2454
01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix special by the way,</v>

2455
01:40:14.521 --> 01:40:16.590
<v Speaker 1>in 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

2456
01:40:16.591 --> 01:40:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have the original was.</v>

2457
01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh gees on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have $20,000,000 though.</v>

2458
01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy that that's showing you that</v>

2459
01:40:25.561 --> 01:40:28.800
<v Speaker 1>you're incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now netflix is making shit tons of</v>

2460
01:40:28.801 --> 01:40:29.090
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

2461
01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because they're valuable doesn't</v>

2462
01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:32.730
<v Speaker 1>mean that they're making a profit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking on debt.</v>

2463
01:40:32.731 --> 01:40:34.500
<v Speaker 1>So like they're playing a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's business.</v>

2464
01:40:34.530 --> 01:40:38.910
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how much are they making uber?</v>

2465
01:40:38.970 --> 01:40:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Uber's evaluation was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they took on like another 8</v>

2466
01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:43.440
<v Speaker 1>million area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

2467
01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:46.740
<v Speaker 1>$8,000,000,000 in debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean though when I do</v>

2468
01:40:46.741 --> 01:40:48.780
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it based on their earnings?</v>

2469
01:40:48.810 --> 01:40:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Like because they aren't they making</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars a year and they're</v>

2470
01:40:52.411 --> 01:40:54.020
<v Speaker 1>making money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they took on more debt.</v>

2471
01:40:54.021 --> 01:40:56.560
<v Speaker 1>So they just have reinvested it back</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the company like they're not really</v>

2472
01:40:56.590 --> 01:40:59.140
<v Speaker 1>interested in turning a profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe for 2017,</v>

2473
01:40:59.141 --> 01:41:00.820
<v Speaker 1>they're looking more into like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25.</v>

2474
01:41:00.850 --> 01:41:03.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking about man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what you're saying?</v>

2475
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Did you guess it's not sustainable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>

2476
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how much do they make?</v>

2477
01:41:07.601 --> 01:41:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out instead of just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I didn't give a fuck,</v>

2478
01:41:10.661 --> 01:41:13.000
<v Speaker 1>but obviously it does because he's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>invested in showtime.</v>

2479
01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this guy's model of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is showtime due to you at that</v>

2480
01:41:17.041 --> 01:41:19.800
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw you a Netflix special that I did</v>

2481
01:41:19.810 --> 01:41:22.570
<v Speaker 1>in 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually sold to showtime since I got</v>

2482
01:41:22.571 --> 01:41:24.910
<v Speaker 1>the rights to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then are you going back to Netflix?</v>

2483
01:41:24.930 --> 01:41:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Give one of them licensing deals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>licensing deal.</v>

2484
01:41:29.170 --> 01:41:30.370

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it's going to be.</v>

2485
01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2486
01:41:33.670 --> 01:41:37.210
<v Speaker 1>which was now owned by Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think you can get.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can get the audio on.</v>

2488
01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:43.150

<v Speaker 1>Watch what showtime has done for fucking</v>

01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I would want to do a four times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do.</v>

2520
01:43:02.681 --> 01:43:05.830
<v Speaker 1>And I would take the two second shows me</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one.</v>

2521
01:43:06.110 --> 01:43:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

2522
01:43:07.330 --> 01:43:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Well I did four last time at San</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francisco.</v>

2523
01:43:12.131 --> 01:43:14.500
<v Speaker 1>My last one and this one in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did for two.</v>

2524
01:43:14.530 --> 01:43:16.180
<v Speaker 1>What you got for money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2525
01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to pay more for money,</v>

2526
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:20.830
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me it was like,</v>

2527
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:21.703
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2528
01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:24.910
<v Speaker 1>you want to be loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that I was looser in the</v>

2529
01:43:24.911 --> 01:43:29.020
<v Speaker 1>first show I've ever been because I knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't just think I had two barrels</v>

2530
01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:30.720
<v Speaker 1>mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was tight as fuck.</v>

2531
01:43:30.721 --> 01:43:34.310
<v Speaker 1>And my first show here in crowd was</v>
<v Speaker 1>portland,</v>

2532
01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:37.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like these liberal pretentious</v>

2533
01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:39.850
<v Speaker 1>white people talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about all kinds of.</v>

2534
01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:40.713
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2535
01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:43.060
<v Speaker 1>you have to own it when you talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff,</v>

2536
01:43:43.061 --> 01:43:44.650
<v Speaker 1>you've got to own it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do have to own it.</v>

2537
01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Unapologetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

2538
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:49.540
<v Speaker 1>That's how you have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the second show was so loosey Goosey</v>

2539
01:43:49.541 --> 01:43:50.770
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

2540
01:43:50.771 --> 01:43:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I captured something here.</v>

2541
01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Diaz Portland's an interesting place</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's free liberal to the point</v>

2542
01:43:58.341 --> 01:44:01.790
<v Speaker 1>where they go so far left that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like militant in a way.</v>

2543
01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:02.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2544
01:44:02.301 --> 01:44:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But had a great time there,</v>

2545
01:44:03.951 --> 01:44:04.580
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

2546
01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I had a great time there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last time I was there,</v>

2547
01:44:06.381 --> 01:44:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I was like six months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking loved it.</v>

2548
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you find it like out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in this trump era.</v>

2549
01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:17.120
<v Speaker 1>I find a comedy has been challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's differently.</v>

2550
01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:20.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the trump era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the era of outrage.</v>

2551
01:44:20.851 --> 01:44:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2552
01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:24.800
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm saying is I find that trump</v>

2553
01:44:24.801 --> 01:44:27.650
<v Speaker 1>people are angry winters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2554
01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:29.150
<v Speaker 1>they're angry winters.</v>

2555
01:44:29.150 --> 01:44:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Like you won your guys in office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the globe glow and then like you say</v>

2556
01:44:33.231 --> 01:44:34.490
<v Speaker 1>anything and they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

2557
01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.610
<v Speaker 1>If you say anything bad about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

2558
01:44:37.670 --> 01:44:40.730
<v Speaker 1>I have to fucking come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come hard and I don't get it.</v>

2559
01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your guy.</v>

2560
01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:43.670
<v Speaker 1>That's your guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your guy.</v>

2561
01:44:43.671 --> 01:44:47.480

<v Speaker 1>Assholes have never been represented</v>

2562
01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:49.630
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Real.</v>

2563
01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's no for real at a few</v>

2564
01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:54.790
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politician who's overly assholeishness.</v>

2565
01:44:55.150 --> 01:44:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely.</v>

2566
01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:58.490
<v Speaker 1>What happens when has that ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened?</v>

2567
01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a very stable genius causing</v>

2568
01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:07.160
<v Speaker 1>something stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Genius to that tweet is his dark where</v>

2569
01:45:07.161 --> 01:45:09.680
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have every right to pardon and all</v>

2570
01:45:09.681 --> 01:45:14.150
<v Speaker 1>letters in all capital letters myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at that this morning.</v>

2571
01:45:14.770 --> 01:45:19.100
<v Speaker 1>I got sick to my stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little guy that does it know how to do</v>

2572
01:45:19.101 --> 01:45:24.101
<v Speaker 1>the job and it's not his fault that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was given the job like,</v>

2573
01:45:25.490 --> 01:45:26.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>

2574
01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:27.740
<v Speaker 1>He went after it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2575
01:45:27.741 --> 01:45:32.741
<v Speaker 1>but he said it's not his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the best candidate in the</v>

2576
01:45:33.170 --> 01:45:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Republican Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they should be the one that should</v>

2577
01:45:34.641 --> 01:45:38.540
<v Speaker 1>be ashamed of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching the Trevor Noah's show</v>

2578
01:45:38.541 --> 01:45:40.970
<v Speaker 1>and he was showing this clip of trump at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rally.</v>

2579
01:45:40.971 --> 01:45:43.100
<v Speaker 1>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's already won and he's up there</v>

2580
01:45:43.101 --> 01:45:44.060
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2581
01:45:44.061 --> 01:45:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2582
01:45:45.521 --> 01:45:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2583
01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:48.470
<v Speaker 1>they told me to say drained the swamp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2584
01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:50.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying this,</v>

2585
01:45:50.650 --> 01:45:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they said it would work.</v>

2586
01:45:52.341 --> 01:45:53.810
<v Speaker 1>It would stay like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2587
01:45:53.850 --> 01:45:57.920
<v Speaker 1>he even has contempt for the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed the bullshit that he was</v>

2588
01:45:57.921 --> 01:46:00.080
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has contempt for them by just going</v>

2589
01:46:00.081 --> 01:46:00.760
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2590
01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:04.010
<v Speaker 1>I said these things just to get elected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it worked.</v>

2591
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:07.730
<v Speaker 1>And like these other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just were horrible candidates.</v>

2592
01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christine.</v>

2593
01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:11.450

<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>

2594
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Chris.</v>

2595
01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin,</v>

2596
01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Krista.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on my mind,</v>

2597
01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:16.370
<v Speaker 1>the guy that drew might be awesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>artists,</v>

2598
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:18.350
<v Speaker 1>the awesome artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2599
01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Kevin is right now listening to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

2600
01:46:20.061 --> 01:46:24.400
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Run for office shit.</v>

2601
01:46:24.570 --> 01:46:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just fucking here.</v>

2602
01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:29.540
<v Speaker 1>So why wouldn't you be an asshole?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't he be like a sore winner?</v>

2603
01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:32.240
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

2604
01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:37.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's the age of outrage and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're seeing from this Roseanne.</v>

2605
01:46:37.011 --> 01:46:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2606
01:46:38.241 --> 01:46:42.260
<v Speaker 1>I've been called a racist more times</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last few days for defending</v>

2607
01:46:42.261 --> 01:46:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Rosanne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that I know her,</v>

2608
01:46:44.630 --> 01:46:47.600
<v Speaker 1>she's mentally ill and then she's on all</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of pills.</v>

2609
01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she's a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2610
01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:51.290
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to say this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that this is a.</v>

2611
01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:54.900
<v Speaker 1>just because you can doesn't mean you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should situation.</v>

2612
01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Can I tweet something inappropriate?</v>

2613
01:46:59.010 --> 01:47:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Of course you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should you,</v>

2614
01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:05.970
<v Speaker 1>when you have all of these things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for.</v>

2615
01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the lead of a show,</v>

2616
01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:11.430
<v Speaker 1>your show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a family show.</v>

2617
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:15.720
<v Speaker 1>You're on a family network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a lot of people's jobs that are</v>

2618
01:47:15.721 --> 01:47:19.230
<v Speaker 1>depending on you and I think there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just an error in judgment.</v>

2619
01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent I do.</v>

2620
01:47:20.401 --> 01:47:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I think that she's a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that.</v>

2621
01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I think that if she had just called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman just ugly and,</v>

2622
01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:28.770
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and talked about her,</v>

2623
01:47:29.190 --> 01:47:31.740
<v Speaker 1>her job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would this have been?</v>

2624
01:47:31.741 --> 01:47:33.200
<v Speaker 1>The same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

2625
01:47:33.201 --> 01:47:34.330
<v Speaker 1>you add,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2626
01:47:34.410 --> 01:47:37.560
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you call somebody a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2627
01:47:37.650 --> 01:47:39.450
<v Speaker 1>there's a pro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You people can have a problem with that.</v>

2628
01:47:39.630 --> 01:47:43.710
<v Speaker 1>You call somebody a black bitch and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden that changes it.</v>

2629
01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:44.790
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2630
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:46.620
<v Speaker 1>If you call somebody a black monkey</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

2631
01:47:46.650 --> 01:47:47.431
<v Speaker 1>then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2632
01:47:47.431 --> 01:47:49.160
<v Speaker 1>where's this coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2633
01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:54.170
<v Speaker 1>perfect example is Samantha bee calling</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivanka trump affectless cunt,</v>

2634
01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:56.400
<v Speaker 1>and she said it on TV.</v>

2635
01:47:57.260 --> 01:48:00.380
<v Speaker 3>She sent me that was prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like someone wrote that out as a part of</v>

2636
01:48:00.381 --> 01:48:02.750
<v Speaker 3>her monologue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said it on television and then they</v>

2637
01:48:02.751 --> 01:48:03.550
<v Speaker 3>apologized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2638
01:48:03.550 --> 01:48:06.470
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should just set it and tbs like we're</v>

2639
01:48:06.471 --> 01:48:09.650
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the advertisers are not good.</v>

2640
01:48:09.651 --> 01:48:13.130
<v Speaker 3>They're pulling out left and right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing with Rosanne,</v>

2641
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:15.680
<v Speaker 3>she's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2642
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:19.250
<v Speaker 3>this is a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I know I've talked to her.</v>

2643
01:48:19.251 --> 01:48:21.470
<v Speaker 3>She's told me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to other people who know</v>

2644
01:48:21.471 --> 01:48:23.120
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to people who worked with her.</v>

2645
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:26.480
<v Speaker 3>She's mentally ill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it talks openly about it.</v>

2646
01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:30.050
<v Speaker 3>She does well on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's on a host of medications.</v>

2647
01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:33.350
<v Speaker 3>She's on antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's on Ambien,</v>

2648
01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:35.690
<v Speaker 3>she's drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's smoking pot.</v>

2649
01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:38.270
<v Speaker 3>She's 66 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not,</v>

2650
01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:40.610
<v Speaker 3>she's not well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She smoked cigarettes.</v>

2651
01:48:40.611 --> 01:48:43.940
<v Speaker 3>She's out of it like she's got real</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental issues.</v>

2652
01:48:43.941 --> 01:48:48.941
<v Speaker 3>Now here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she had problems with her lungs and</v>

2653
01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:52.190
<v Speaker 3>she was smoking cigarettes and coughing</v>
<v Speaker 3>up blood,</v>

2654
01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:55.460
<v Speaker 3>what would and and doing stupid shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>like trying to run marathons.</v>

2655
01:48:55.580 --> 01:48:56.660
<v Speaker 3>When people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2656
01:48:56.661 --> 01:48:58.620
<v Speaker 3>you know what the fuck is wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>

2657
01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:00.170
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think you could run a marathon,</v>

2658
01:49:00.171 --> 01:49:01.820
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will you fucking stupid?</v>

2659
01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:03.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't because they'd go,</v>

2660
01:49:03.381 --> 01:49:04.580
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's got an illness.</v>

2661
01:49:04.670 --> 01:49:07.100
<v Speaker 3>This is why she can't run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why she's coughing up blood.</v>

2662
01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:10.250
<v Speaker 3>She's got a mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's mentally ill.</v>

2663
01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:12.200
<v Speaker 3>This is a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why she's on so many different</v>

2664
01:49:12.201 --> 01:49:14.900
<v Speaker 3>medications,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she has mental illness.</v>

2665
01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:18.210
<v Speaker 1>What if you were starting to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally ill?</v>

2666
01:49:18.450 --> 01:49:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Are you saying that like saying like</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of overtly racist things?</v>

2667
01:49:22.471 --> 01:49:22.980
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did.</v>

2668
01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:23.030
<v Speaker 1>You should</v>

2669
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:25.820
<v Speaker 3>know that lady was black though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen that woman?</v>

2670
01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:28.940
<v Speaker 3>She does not look black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She thought that lady was Jewish when</v>

2671
01:49:28.941 --> 01:49:30.890
<v Speaker 3>she said planet of the Apes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said it because of her haircut</v>

2672
01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:32.900
<v Speaker 3>because she looks like that lady from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the planet of the apes.</v>

2673
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:35.900
<v Speaker 3>She swear she swears and she swear to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the phone.</v>

2674
01:49:35.930 --> 01:49:37.280
<v Speaker 3>This is her exact word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

2675
01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:41.300
<v Speaker 3>I would never fucking say that you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so stupid that I would call black</v>

2676
01:49:41.301 --> 01:49:42.620
<v Speaker 3>lady planet of the Apes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

2677
01:49:42.621 --> 01:49:44.480
<v Speaker 3>I thought she was Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

2678
01:49:44.481 --> 01:49:46.730
<v Speaker 3>look at her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't look black or that makes it</v>

2679
01:49:46.731 --> 01:49:48.060
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't.</v>

2680
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.570
<v Speaker 3>But she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's Jewish too.</v>

2681
01:49:49.571 --> 01:49:50.271
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the other thing.</v>

2682
01:49:50.271 --> 01:49:51.041
<v Speaker 3>Someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>

2683
01:49:51.041 --> 01:49:51.520
<v Speaker 3>she did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She did.</v>

2684
01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:53.920
<v Speaker 3>She did this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She dressed up like Hitler and had jus</v>

2685
01:49:53.921 --> 01:49:55.630
<v Speaker 3>cookies and she was bacon and back in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day.</v>

2686
01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:57.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a shitster by the way.</v>

2687
01:49:57.581 --> 01:49:59.140
<v Speaker 3>She's also Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2688
01:49:59.141 --> 01:50:00.880
<v Speaker 3>I think she gets a free pass on doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2689
01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:03.710
<v Speaker 1>but I think that when you make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>

2690
01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:05.600
<v Speaker 1>this is what's missing from our society</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2691
01:50:05.690 --> 01:50:08.990
<v Speaker 1>She made a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be allowed to apologize for</v>

2692
01:50:08.991 --> 01:50:11.990
<v Speaker 1>that mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Live with the shame and then you move</v>

2693
01:50:11.991 --> 01:50:14.000
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we're trying to do now is</v>

2694
01:50:14.001 --> 01:50:17.810
<v Speaker 1>remove people from society altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2695
01:50:17.811 --> 01:50:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to like sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to like,</v>

2696
01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:23.030
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to excuse her behavior.</v>

2697
01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:24.730
<v Speaker 1>We're not even going to say that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2698
01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:26.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reason.</v>

2699
01:50:27.230 --> 01:50:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the mental illness and all this kind</v>

2700
01:50:29.811 --> 01:50:31.520
<v Speaker 1>of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still a mistake.</v>

2701
01:50:31.610 --> 01:50:34.580
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's well enough to work on a</v>

2702
01:50:34.581 --> 01:50:37.820
<v Speaker 1>television show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm saying she made this mistake and</v>

2703
01:50:37.821 --> 01:50:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm not with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not with saying that she's a racist</v>

2704
01:50:41.301 --> 01:50:42.800
<v Speaker 1>either because when I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when I read that,</v>

2705
01:50:42.801 --> 01:50:47.570
<v Speaker 1>I thought as A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying as a comic we say things</v>

2706
01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:51.870
<v Speaker 1>that a regular person that is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>translate the math into like,</v>

2707
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:55.220
<v Speaker 1>well this is because you don't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>black people or women or you don't like</v>

2708
01:50:55.221 --> 01:50:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Jews you don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not how we operate.</v>

2709
01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just trying to be funny and I think</v>

2710
01:50:59.961 --> 01:51:04.250
<v Speaker 1>that she comes from an error where this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what you would say to be funny and</v>

2711
01:51:04.251 --> 01:51:05.570
<v Speaker 1>biting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2712
01:51:05.630 --> 01:51:07.160
<v Speaker 1>and I think that when she looked back on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2713
01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:08.210
<v Speaker 1>she went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2714
01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:11.450
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know this person was black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the people out there listening,</v>

2715
01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:12.740
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't believe it or not,</v>

2716
01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:16.270
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Susan Rice comment from a long time</v>

2717
01:51:16.271 --> 01:51:17.770
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was way worse because she.</v>

2718
01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:22.090
<v Speaker 3>Susan Rice is clearly black and she did</v>
<v Speaker 3>a comment a long time ago.</v>

2719
01:51:22.091 --> 01:51:26.560
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she said Susan Rice is a man with</v>

2720
01:51:26.561 --> 01:51:29.800
<v Speaker 3>giant swinging eight balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what she said.</v>

2721
01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Now that is way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's way worse and that is a woman who</v>

2722
01:51:35.281 --> 01:51:37.030
<v Speaker 3>is clearly black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2723
01:51:37.031 --> 01:51:38.140
<v Speaker 3>you look at Susan Rice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>

2724
01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:41.110
<v Speaker 3>She's not racially ambiguous at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This other woman,</v>

2725
01:51:41.111 --> 01:51:42.550
<v Speaker 3>Valerie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know her name,</v>

2726
01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:43.960
<v Speaker 3>Gerrit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's.</v>

2727
01:51:44.170 --> 01:51:47.410
<v Speaker 3>She's got straight hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's got light complexion.</v>

2728
01:51:47.411 --> 01:51:49.060
<v Speaker 3>She's a tone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about intent though,</v>

2729
01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:50.190
<v Speaker 3>what you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2730
01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:53.470
<v Speaker 3>but it's what her intent was to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny.</v>

2731
01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:58.120
<v Speaker 3>She is obviously not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but first of all she was drunk and on</v>

2732
01:51:58.121 --> 01:52:00.340
<v Speaker 3>Ambien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ambien is a cla.</v>

2733
01:52:00.670 --> 01:52:02.770
<v Speaker 3>Hamilton Morris sent me an email about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2734
01:52:02.771 --> 01:52:05.620
<v Speaker 3>He was explaining it to me and then I</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked to a sleep therapist about it.</v>

2735
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:07.280
<v Speaker 3>There.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

2736
01:52:07.470 --> 01:52:11.830
<v Speaker 3>a type of drug that ambient is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's called a hypnotic,</v>

2737
01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:16.960
<v Speaker 3>and this is one of the reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ambien has so many weird side effects</v>

2738
01:52:16.961 --> 01:52:18.950
<v Speaker 3>associated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2739
01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:22.810
<v Speaker 3>my friend Kevin James,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin James got up in the middle of the</v>

2740
01:52:22.811 --> 01:52:24.070
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cooked a meal,</v>

2741
01:52:24.490 --> 01:52:27.520
<v Speaker 3>went to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got up in the morning and uh,</v>

2742
01:52:27.550 --> 01:52:30.130
<v Speaker 3>he had like his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I confronted him like,</v>

2743
01:52:30.131 --> 01:52:31.990
<v Speaker 3>did you do that because I didn't fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

2744
01:52:32.170 --> 01:52:33.250
<v Speaker 3>And she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's like,</v>

2745
01:52:33.251 --> 01:52:34.390
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the foods in the trash,</v>

2746
01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:35.231
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cooked it,</v>

2747
01:52:35.231 --> 01:52:35.980
<v Speaker 3>you ate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2748
01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:38.020
<v Speaker 3>I did not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not eat that.</v>

2749
01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:38.861
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2750
01:52:38.861 --> 01:52:40.130
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who did?</v>

2751
01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:43.120
<v Speaker 3>And he had to like come to grips with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that he was on Ambien.</v>

2752
01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:45.440
<v Speaker 3>He got up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cooked a meal for himself,</v>

2753
01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:47.810
<v Speaker 3>had no recollection of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went back to sleep.</v>

2754
01:52:47.930 --> 01:52:50.840
<v Speaker 3>My mom was on Ambien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She got up in the middle of the night</v>

2755
01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:54.410
<v Speaker 3>and drew on the shag carpet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had a white shag carpet in a</v>

2756
01:52:54.411 --> 01:52:58.100
<v Speaker 3>bathroom with lipstick and with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with nail Polish,</v>

2757
01:52:58.160 --> 01:52:59.660
<v Speaker 3>like a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

2758
01:52:59.661 --> 01:53:01.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember doing it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is.</v>

2759
01:53:01.730 --> 01:53:05.300
<v Speaker 3>It's scary shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a bunch of people that have had</v>

2760
01:53:05.301 --> 01:53:08.750
<v Speaker 3>weird experiences on that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you stay in somebody's house and</v>

2761
01:53:08.751 --> 01:53:12.560
<v Speaker 3>you were on Ambien and you messed up</v>
<v Speaker 3>their shag carpet,</v>

2762
01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:16.310
<v Speaker 3>you'd apologize to apologize for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is what I'm saying.</v>

2763
01:53:16.311 --> 01:53:21.311
<v Speaker 3>When they may be say she's also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's also drunk on antidepressants,</v>

2764
01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:26.000
<v Speaker 3>which you're not supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then she smoking pot,</v>

2765
01:53:26.001 --> 01:53:28.190
<v Speaker 3>which I'm sure you're probably not</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to do either when you're on</v>

2766
01:53:28.191 --> 01:53:30.650
<v Speaker 3>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's an older lady who just got off</v>

2767
01:53:30.651 --> 01:53:33.620
<v Speaker 3>of an exhausting schedule that almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>she in her words,</v>

2768
01:53:33.621 --> 01:53:34.454
<v Speaker 3>almost killed her.</v>

2769
01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:36.770
<v Speaker 3>She was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had bronchitis when she was filming.</v>

2770
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:38.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not doing well.</v>

2771
01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:41.570
<v Speaker 3>She made a fucked up mistake and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>apologized,</v>

2772
01:53:41.571 --> 01:53:43.550
<v Speaker 3>but everybody wants a berry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Herman and I,</v>

2773
01:53:43.551 --> 01:53:45.620
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you with you.</v>

2774
01:53:45.621 --> 01:53:48.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can't that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the society that we live in</v>

2775
01:53:48.411 --> 01:53:51.230
<v Speaker 3>right now that's dislike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jumped outrage right now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>not just outraged,</v>

2777
01:53:53.091 --> 01:53:56.690

<v Speaker 3>Like why do we want to end someone's</v>

2778

<v Speaker 3>career for fucking up?</v>

<v Speaker 3>like if she was not mentally ill,</v>

<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2795
01:54:44.331 --> 01:54:47.060
<v Speaker 3>this is just how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they come after and they go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>She shouldn't be on television.</v>

2797
01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:52.670
<v Speaker 3>She's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't represent how America views</v>

2798
01:54:52.730 --> 01:54:56.360
<v Speaker 3>people in 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's archaic.</v>

2799
01:54:56.450 --> 01:54:58.600
<v Speaker 3>Get her off the fucking air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what this is.</v>

2800
01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:01.220
<v Speaker 3>You can't get away with this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the 19 twenties.</v>

2801
01:55:01.490 --> 01:55:04.520
<v Speaker 3>This is 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be acceptable.</v>

2802
01:55:04.521 --> 01:55:05.300
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>

2803
01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:09.050
<v Speaker 3>If you found a real hateful person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she secretly has like a swastika tattoo</v>

2804
01:55:09.051 --> 01:55:11.180
<v Speaker 3>somewhere and she's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's an evil person.</v>

2805
01:55:11.450 --> 01:55:13.640
<v Speaker 3>This is not the case with Rosanne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just not.</v>

2806
01:55:13.641 --> 01:55:17.300
<v Speaker 3>It's just not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's an older lady who's mentally</v>

2807
01:55:17.301 --> 01:55:21.920
<v Speaker 3>disturbed and on a fucking host of</v>
<v Speaker 3>competing medications for her</v>

2808
01:55:21.921 --> 01:55:22.820
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2809
01:55:22.821 --> 01:55:25.400
<v Speaker 3>that should be the reason why she needs</v>
<v Speaker 3>help.</v>

2810
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:26.810
<v Speaker 3>That yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to get her some help,</v>

2811
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:29.930
<v Speaker 3>but he's a crazy thing is like she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>America's sweetheart just a couple of</v>

2812
01:55:29.931 --> 01:55:30.480
<v Speaker 3>weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

2813
01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:34.720
<v Speaker 3>I know now fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how quickly everybody hates is</v>

2814
01:55:34.721 --> 01:55:38.010
<v Speaker 3>how quickly and people are calling me a</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist for saying what I said right</v>

2815
01:55:38.011 --> 01:55:38.844
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not.</v>

2816
01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:42.640
<v Speaker 3>This is not an unusual thing in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>society like we this code.</v>

2817
01:55:42.641 --> 01:55:45.510
<v Speaker 3>This is very much reminds me of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Salem witch hunt,</v>

2818
01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:47.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the same kind of thing a little</v>

2819
01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:48.000
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

2820
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:48.421
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2821
01:55:48.421 --> 01:55:49.870
<v Speaker 3>it's like the scarlet letter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how,</v>

2822
01:55:49.871 --> 01:55:52.710
<v Speaker 3>how old does the scarlet letter and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're still doing that now.</v>

2823
01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:53.480
<v Speaker 3>Theism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2824
01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:54.950
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something that we're.</v>

2825
01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:56.250
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're prone to it.</v>

2826
01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:59.700
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it's because people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>scared that they're going to get called</v>

2827
01:55:59.701 --> 01:56:02.100
<v Speaker 3>out on it themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when they see someone who's doing</v>

2828
01:56:02.101 --> 01:56:04.290
<v Speaker 3>something wrong to go after him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack them with everything,</v>

2829
01:56:04.291 --> 01:56:06.860
<v Speaker 3>they have to almost to divert any sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

2830
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:09.240
<v Speaker 3>Because people are scared that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to turn on them.</v>

2831
01:56:09.241 --> 01:56:12.030
<v Speaker 3>Especially in this day and age when</v>
<v Speaker 3>people turn on people for like,</v>

2832
01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:16.230
<v Speaker 3>you know the garrison keillor story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the saddest story in this.</v>

2833
01:56:16.231 --> 01:56:19.320
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stuff because garrison keillor is a guy</v>

2834
01:56:19.321 --> 01:56:22.830
<v Speaker 3>who had the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woebegone chronicles is this pbs show</v>

2835
01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:28.100
<v Speaker 3>radio shows ongoing for decades and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a writer and he hugged a woman.</v>

2836
01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:31.920
<v Speaker 3>She was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was consoling her and hugged her,</v>

2837
01:56:32.190 --> 01:56:37.190
<v Speaker 3>and apparently while he was hugging her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his arm went down her back on her back</v>

2838
01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:38.970
<v Speaker 3>and he apologized.</v>

2839
01:56:38.970 --> 01:56:40.440
<v Speaker 3>She pulled away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He apologized.</v>

2840
01:56:40.441 --> 01:56:41.880
<v Speaker 3>He sent her a letter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He apologized.</v>

2841
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:44.230
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that.</v>

2842
01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:45.150
<v Speaker 3>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't worry.</v>

2843
01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:46.230
<v Speaker 3>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about it.</v>

2844
01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:49.410
<v Speaker 3>Years later when all this meat to</v>
<v Speaker 3>frenzy,</v>

2845
01:56:49.530 --> 01:56:51.540
<v Speaker 3>she brings this up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets fired.</v>

2846
01:56:51.541 --> 01:56:54.540
<v Speaker 3>They pull his name off the shelf for</v>
<v Speaker 3>touching a girl's back.</v>

2847
01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:59.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like the frenzy was so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want to be accused of not</v>

2848
01:56:59.041 --> 01:57:02.490
<v Speaker 3>doing anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they pulled this guy I know and you</v>

2849
01:57:02.491 --> 01:57:04.230
<v Speaker 3>know there is the worst side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2850
01:57:04.231 --> 01:57:06.240
<v Speaker 3>There's the Harvey Weinsteins of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2851
01:57:06.241 --> 01:57:09.570
<v Speaker 3>There's the people that are absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 3>monsters,</v>

2852
01:57:09.571 --> 01:57:10.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's those people,</v>

2853
01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:15.300
<v Speaker 3>but then there's people that just got</v>
<v Speaker 3>caught up in the wave of outrage and</v>

2854
01:57:15.301 --> 01:57:16.740
<v Speaker 3>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a strange,</v>

2855
01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:18.530
<v Speaker 3>a strange time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the.</v>

2856
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:20.100
<v Speaker 3>There's no balance to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2857
01:57:20.101 --> 01:57:25.101
<v Speaker 3>the pendulum is gonna swing until you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know our attitudes balance out.</v>

2858
01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:29.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that the me too movement is not</v>

2859
01:57:29.611 --> 01:57:33.240
<v Speaker 3>a bad thing because it's bringing up</v>
<v Speaker 3>some serious issues that we've had.</v>

2860
01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:37.050
<v Speaker 3>It's a great thing to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in the meantime there's going to be</v>

2861
01:57:37.051 --> 01:57:41.340
<v Speaker 3>collateral damage for that until we now</v>
<v Speaker 3>get back to a time where we can like men</v>

2862
01:57:41.341 --> 01:57:46.341
<v Speaker 3>whack like gentlemen and we'll be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have interpersonal relationships with</v>

2863
01:57:46.951 --> 01:57:49.830
<v Speaker 3>women at work and in a setting and make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it professional,</v>

2864
01:57:50.250 --> 01:57:52.560
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time we also don't want</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sterile environment.</v>

2865
01:57:52.590 --> 01:57:53.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

2866
01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:56.460
<v Speaker 3>when you go to these seminars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because like even for our show now,</v>

2867
01:57:56.461 --> 01:57:58.470
<v Speaker 3>because of all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have like a sexual</v>

2868
01:57:58.471 --> 01:57:59.910
<v Speaker 3>harassment meeting before you start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2869
01:57:59.911 --> 01:58:01.440
<v Speaker 3>they had those in the 90.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2870
01:58:01.530 --> 01:58:04.800
<v Speaker 3>I went to those for hardball show that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was on in 94,</v>

2871
01:58:04.801 --> 01:58:08.190
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things they always say</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can't define this right,</v>

2872
01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:10.200
<v Speaker 3>you know it when you see it.</v>

2873
01:58:10.530 --> 01:58:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they used to say about</v>

2874
01:58:11.671 --> 01:58:13.950
<v Speaker 3>pornography,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what we've lost.</v>

2875
01:58:13.951 --> 01:58:17.340
<v Speaker 3>That ability to understand that like I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that that applies to me,</v>

2876
01:58:17.341 --> 01:58:19.590
<v Speaker 3>that's not a good definition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably but it,</v>

2877
01:58:19.860 --> 01:58:22.560
<v Speaker 3>but that is the definition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing that goes with</v>

2878
01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:24.510
<v Speaker 3>oversensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that too.</v>

2879
01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:26.930
<v Speaker 3>We should know it when we see it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're.</v>

2880
01:58:26.931 --> 01:58:28.470
<v Speaker 3>We're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not recognizing that.</v>

2881
01:58:28.471 --> 01:58:28.831
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2882
01:58:28.831 --> 01:58:31.250
<v Speaker 3>you're acting and this is a bit much</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now sometimes.</v>

2883
01:58:31.251 --> 01:58:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear about the two college kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>that got drunk and had sex and the boy</v>

2884
01:58:35.730 --> 01:58:40.730
<v Speaker 3>upon waking up and sobering up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to preemptively accused the girl</v>

2885
01:58:41.381 --> 01:58:43.780
<v Speaker 3>of sexual assault because he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>intoxicated.</v>

2886
01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:48.580
<v Speaker 3>So he filed and went after her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She got suspended from school.</v>

2887
01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:53.050
<v Speaker 3>They had to do it because otherwise they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be sexist because they do it all</v>

2888
01:58:53.051 --> 01:58:53.710
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

2889
01:58:53.710 --> 01:58:56.500
<v Speaker 3>If it's a boy and a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always thought that if a boy,</v>

2890
01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:58.570
<v Speaker 3>do you know the Occidental College</v>
<v Speaker 3>story?</v>

2891
01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:03.340
<v Speaker 3>So pretty famous story from a few years</v>
<v Speaker 3>back with these two kids that were in</v>

2892
01:59:03.341 --> 01:59:05.650
<v Speaker 3>college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy called texts,</v>

2893
01:59:05.651 --> 01:59:07.630
<v Speaker 3>the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know I'm cone over.</v>

2894
01:59:07.631 --> 01:59:08.950
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have condoms?</v>

2895
01:59:08.951 --> 01:59:09.880
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2896
01:59:09.881 --> 01:59:12.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so clearly intent has been established,</v>

2897
01:59:12.791 --> 01:59:14.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goes overhead sex with her.</v>

2898
01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:16.630
<v Speaker 3>Her friends convinced her because she</v>
<v Speaker 3>was intoxicated,</v>

2899
01:59:16.631 --> 01:59:21.631
<v Speaker 3>that it was sex under the influence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was rape and so she goes to the</v>

2900
01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:25.480
<v Speaker 3>university officials and they suspend</v>
<v Speaker 3>the boy.</v>

2901
01:59:25.481 --> 01:59:29.650
<v Speaker 3>He sues and wins and the whole things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing's chaos because this kid</v>

2902
01:59:29.890 --> 01:59:32.620
<v Speaker 3>gets kicked out of fucking school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually did he,</v>

2903
01:59:32.621 --> 01:59:37.621
<v Speaker 3>when I need to know that if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>check fact check that Occidental,</v>

2904
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:40.660
<v Speaker 3>but now you've got to happen now to even</v>
<v Speaker 3>interact with them when you have to have</v>

2905
01:59:40.661 --> 01:59:41.410
<v Speaker 3>a notary.</v>

2906
01:59:41.410 --> 01:59:42.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they're saying.</v>

2907
01:59:42.490 --> 01:59:44.680
<v Speaker 3>People video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I consent to,</v>

2908
01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:46.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so here's where it gets even screw here.</v>

2909
01:59:46.930 --> 01:59:49.390
<v Speaker 3>There was a real article the other day</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was saying,</v>

2910
01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:53.770
<v Speaker 3>is it physically possible for two people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to simultaneously sexual assault each</v>

2911
01:59:53.771 --> 01:59:58.570
<v Speaker 3>other and they're debating this in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>college because they trying to figure</v>

2912
01:59:58.571 --> 02:00:03.100
<v Speaker 3>out if two people are both drunk and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they get together and they're both</v>

2913
02:00:03.101 --> 02:00:05.890
<v Speaker 3>sloppy and fucking hammered and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to have sex.</v>

2914
02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Did they both sexually assault each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other?</v>

2915
02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:11.710
<v Speaker 3>Isn't this really about choices that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>make?</v>

2916
02:00:12.010 --> 02:00:13.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also about taking responsibility</v>

2917
02:00:13.631 --> 02:00:14.920
<v Speaker 3>for your actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're an adult.</v>

2918
02:00:15.010 --> 02:00:18.760
<v Speaker 3>If you decide to get in your car and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're drunk and you plow into a bus and</v>

2919
02:00:18.761 --> 02:00:20.620
<v Speaker 3>kill a bunch of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one says,</v>

2920
02:00:20.650 --> 02:00:22.030
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eric was just drunk.</v>

2921
02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:25.480
<v Speaker 3>He is not responsible for his actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're responsible for your actions.</v>

2922
02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:27.010
<v Speaker 3>If you're drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're driving a car and he killed</v>

2923
02:00:27.011 --> 02:00:29.590
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea is that if a girl comes</v>

2924
02:00:29.591 --> 02:00:34.540
<v Speaker 3>over your house and you're drunk and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know you're not responsible for your</v>

2925
02:00:34.541 --> 02:00:36.370
<v Speaker 3>actions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially if you're a girl and</v>

2926
02:00:36.371 --> 02:00:38.740
<v Speaker 3>you're drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not responsible for your actions.</v>

2927
02:00:38.741 --> 02:00:41.950
<v Speaker 3>Then if you're having sex with a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're definitely responsible for</v>

2928
02:00:41.951 --> 02:00:43.690
<v Speaker 3>your actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a girl and you get in a car</v>

2929
02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:46.930
<v Speaker 3>and drive and hit someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time though,</v>

2930
02:00:47.170 --> 02:00:48.690
<v Speaker 3>like a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a girl,</v>

2931
02:00:48.730 --> 02:00:53.730
<v Speaker 3>anyone should be allowed to be with her</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends or with his friends and you get</v>

2932
02:00:55.721 --> 02:00:57.400
<v Speaker 3>sloppy drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2933
02:00:57.610 --> 02:00:59.320
<v Speaker 3>you protect it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be carrying.</v>

2934
02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:01.930
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not okay that somebody decided to</v>

2935
02:01:01.931 --> 02:01:03.040
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go further with it.</v>

2936
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:04.343
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2937
02:01:04.570 --> 02:01:07.960
<v Speaker 3>the most egregious cases obviously cosby</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that was his thing.</v>

2938
02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:09.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he did do what everybody's accusing</v>

2939
02:01:09.911 --> 02:01:12.040
<v Speaker 3>him of doing and we have no reason to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think he didn't,</v>

2940
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:17.680
<v Speaker 3>he was taking people that thought of him</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a mentor and thought that he was</v>

2941
02:01:17.681 --> 02:01:20.500
<v Speaker 3>going to help their career and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was his hustle and he would just</v>

2942
02:01:20.501 --> 02:01:23.920
<v Speaker 3>drug them and they'd wake up with their</v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy sore and their fucking pants off</v>

2943
02:01:23.921 --> 02:01:26.590
<v Speaker 3>and not knowing what happened and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>super confused.</v>

2944
02:01:26.770 --> 02:01:28.130
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2945
02:01:28.150 --> 02:01:29.560
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the worst,</v>

2946
02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:32.110
<v Speaker 3>the worst version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then it's like,</v>

2947
02:01:32.111 --> 02:01:34.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one of those things where I'm</v>

2948
02:01:34.421 --> 02:01:36.640
<v Speaker 3>saying it's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is hard to define.</v>

2949
02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 3>There's no real definition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't put it down in writing to say</v>

2950
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:41.510
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what this is.</v>

2951
02:01:41.511 --> 02:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Because then you got a situation where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out on a date with someone.</v>

2952
02:01:45.410 --> 02:01:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Things are going well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think it's going well,</v>

2953
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>you get into bed and then that person in</v>
<v Speaker 1>what for whatever reason decides,</v>

2954
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:53.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should stop.</v>

2955
02:01:53.870 --> 02:01:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

2956
02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:57.980
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be,</v>

2957
02:01:58.730 --> 02:02:02.210
<v Speaker 1>that could be on the same level as drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somebody,</v>

2958
02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clubbing them on the head.</v>

2959
02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:09.280
<v Speaker 1>That girl writes that crazy fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>story to 5,000 word story that is easy</v>

2960
02:02:09.351 --> 02:02:12.170
<v Speaker 1>as everything is just about him not</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a gentlemen.</v>

2961
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:13.191
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

2962
02:02:13.191 --> 02:02:14.630
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just dad,</v>

2963
02:02:14.631 --> 02:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>but she was just grossed out by it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to go after him.</v>

2964
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:19.880
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I can understand being in a</v>

2965
02:02:19.881 --> 02:02:21.080
<v Speaker 1>situation like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2966
02:02:21.081 --> 02:02:22.640
<v Speaker 1>people got on the woman because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

2967
02:02:22.641 --> 02:02:23.091
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2968
02:02:23.091 --> 02:02:24.620
<v Speaker 1>you still blew him three times.</v>

2969
02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I understand that being in a</v>

2970
02:02:26.511 --> 02:02:29.510
<v Speaker 1>situation where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

2971
02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Because it's happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2972
02:02:30.990 --> 02:02:32.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at a comedy club,</v>

2973
02:02:32.930 --> 02:02:34.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told this girl,</v>

2974
02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:35.540
<v Speaker 1>this was years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told her,</v>

2975
02:02:35.650 --> 02:02:36.470
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

2976
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:38.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming back to your hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2977
02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:39.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2978
02:02:39.230 --> 02:02:40.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to.</v>

2979
02:02:40.911 --> 02:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't like I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She forced herself on you.</v>

2980
02:02:43.250 --> 02:02:45.890
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't going to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you were a girl.</v>

2981
02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:47.420
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it gets really scary.</v>

2982
02:02:47.630 --> 02:02:50.900
<v Speaker 1>But first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything she's saying to me this whole</v>

2983
02:02:50.901 --> 02:02:54.680
<v Speaker 1>night up to getting to my hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I would have done that to a woman is</v>

2984
02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:58.690
<v Speaker 1>assault abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like threatening from the jump.</v>

2985
02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:01.550
<v Speaker 1>So we already talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is what happened.</v>

2986
02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:03.200
<v Speaker 1>So I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say to her,</v>

2987
02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I said it was really</v>

2988
02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:06.350
<v Speaker 1>interesting at the time I wasn't.</v>

2989
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:07.970
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is a good idea.</v>

2990
02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:09.750
<v Speaker 1>I think you should go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2991
02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:11.210
<v Speaker 1>and then she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2992
02:03:11.390 --> 02:03:14.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll walk you to your hotel because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were hanging out the whole day.</v>

2993
02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's hanging out this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the Sunday night show,</v>

2994
02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:18.813
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2995
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:20.120
<v Speaker 1>we get to the hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2996
02:03:20.121 --> 02:03:21.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for walking me,</v>

2997
02:03:21.051 --> 02:03:23.000
<v Speaker 1>but I think you should probably know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2998
02:03:23.001 --> 02:03:25.640
<v Speaker 1>I cleaned your dick with him now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2999
02:03:25.730 --> 02:03:27.920
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will give you a massage.</v>

3000
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:29.990
<v Speaker 1>It was all just kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should go.</v>

3001
02:03:29.991 --> 02:03:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then my ego kicks in because I'm like,</v>

3002
02:03:32.331 --> 02:03:32.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3003
02:03:32.841 --> 02:03:34.040
<v Speaker 1>alright you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like me like this.</v>

3004
02:03:34.041 --> 02:03:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we get up,</v>

3005
02:03:35.330 --> 02:03:38.480
<v Speaker 1>we finally get upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still am like,</v>

3006
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:40.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we shouldn't do this,</v>

3007
02:03:40.161 --> 02:03:43.160
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she starts to like,</v>

3008
02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3009
02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:47.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just because you're not into me.</v>

3010
02:03:47.570 --> 02:03:49.730
<v Speaker 1>It's because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hideous or whatever.</v>

3011
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:51.430
<v Speaker 1>So now I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3012
02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:54.500
<v Speaker 1>I have to fuck her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

3013
02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:58.820
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I got to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I had to do this because I</v>

3014
02:03:58.821 --> 02:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>don't want to become a cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm,</v>

3015
02:04:00.020 --> 02:04:02.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying about the reason how I</v>

3016
02:04:02.301 --> 02:04:06.980
<v Speaker 1>apply this to the zs situation is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that this girl is in a situation</v>

3017
02:04:06.981 --> 02:04:09.170
<v Speaker 1>where she feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I have to do this.</v>

3018
02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Like I may not want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3019
02:04:11.660 --> 02:04:15.860
<v Speaker 1>we're speculating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in a situation where I didn't</v>

3020
02:04:15.861 --> 02:04:20.510
<v Speaker 1>necessarily want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I felt like the social pressure of</v>

3021
02:04:20.511 --> 02:04:22.280
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe I have to follow through with</v>

3022
02:04:22.281 --> 02:04:23.430
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3023
02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:24.231
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3024
02:04:24.231 --> 02:04:27.320
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my hat to fly when we're not.</v>

3025
02:04:27.321 --> 02:04:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Even in the morning I say we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>finished.</v>

3026
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:29.450
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3027
02:04:29.450 --> 02:04:29.751
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3028
02:04:29.751 --> 02:04:32.720
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I got a pack and she started to</v>

3029
02:04:32.721 --> 02:04:35.870
<v Speaker 1>cry</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought this,</v>

3030
02:04:35.930 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>if this was happening now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could be a situation.</v>

3031
02:04:38.250 --> 02:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>It could easily be somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She could tell her story differently,</v>

3032
02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:44.070
<v Speaker 1>so we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's no rules.</v>

3033
02:04:44.250 --> 02:04:47.340
<v Speaker 1>What this lady did was she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive and flirting and she wanted</v>

3034
02:04:47.341 --> 02:04:49.980
<v Speaker 1>what she wanted and she got it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3035
02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:52.710
<v Speaker 1>so that's sometimes is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the person that you're</v>

3036
02:04:52.711 --> 02:04:55.500
<v Speaker 1>dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that same situation with someone</v>

3037
02:04:55.501 --> 02:04:57.240
<v Speaker 1>else could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3038
02:04:57.241 --> 02:04:58.460
<v Speaker 1>this was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3039
02:04:58.461 --> 02:04:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3040
02:04:59.140 --> 02:05:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt intimidated.</v>

3041
02:05:01.411 --> 02:05:02.244
<v Speaker 1>I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3042
02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:04.650
<v Speaker 1>it's all in how you interpreted it will</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret it.</v>

3043
02:05:04.710 --> 02:05:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely,</v>

3044
02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:10.530
<v Speaker 1>it depends on who's talking and whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not you're attract each other.</v>

3045
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you and your girlfriend decided to</v>

3046
02:05:14.311 --> 02:05:18.000
<v Speaker 1>get drunk and your girlfriend was drunk</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she called you up and said,</v>

3047
02:05:18.330 --> 02:05:19.830
<v Speaker 1>come on over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3048
02:05:19.831 --> 02:05:20.341
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3049
02:05:20.341 --> 02:05:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm horny.</v>

3050
02:05:20.850 --> 02:05:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I want you to fuck me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you went over and did it,</v>

3051
02:05:23.580 --> 02:05:26.400
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some people's eyes be guilty of</v>

3052
02:05:26.401 --> 02:05:29.340
<v Speaker 1>sexual assault because she was drunk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't consent.</v>

3053
02:05:29.730 --> 02:05:31.620
<v Speaker 1>And this is why I'd never done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3054
02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:33.660
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my ex girlfriends was like that.</v>

3055
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:35.300
<v Speaker 1>She wanted to get drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3056
02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:37.170
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to affect when I'm drunk and</v>

3057
02:05:37.171 --> 02:05:39.960
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel were nervous about it.</v>

3058
02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:42.810
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was just me personally,</v>

3059
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't drink.</v>

3060
02:05:44.821 --> 02:05:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't drink at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I always felt like if I'm not</v>

3061
02:05:47.730 --> 02:05:50.010
<v Speaker 1>drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just feels like,</v>

3062
02:05:50.011 --> 02:05:53.400
<v Speaker 1>what if she says she wants to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that like she doesn't normally</v>

3063
02:05:53.401 --> 02:05:55.890
<v Speaker 1>want to do and then she's going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>sober and be like,</v>

3064
02:05:55.950 --> 02:05:57.870
<v Speaker 1>why did you do that to my butthole or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3065
02:05:59.610 --> 02:06:00.360
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>

3066
02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:02.090
<v Speaker 1>And they like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you said she gets.</v>

3067
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Because it'll always come back to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>

3068
02:06:04.141 --> 02:06:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I was drunk but I didn't really meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

3069
02:06:06.610 --> 02:06:07.231
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm like,</v>

3070
02:06:07.231 --> 02:06:08.820
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be the choice maker.</v>

3071
02:06:08.821 --> 02:06:11.250
<v Speaker 1>And that was the best thing about not</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking.</v>

3072
02:06:11.340 --> 02:06:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that situation,</v>

3073
02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:15.600
<v Speaker 1>if you don't drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never have to think like that.</v>

3074
02:06:15.770 --> 02:06:17.850
<v Speaker 1>But that's why sometimes I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang out.</v>

3075
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:19.320
<v Speaker 1>That's thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I don't want to hang out with</v>

3076
02:06:19.321 --> 02:06:22.770
<v Speaker 1>people that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get dumb drunk,</v>

3077
02:06:22.771 --> 02:06:25.170
<v Speaker 1>you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I become responsible.</v>

3078
02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh well what's the worst when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>sober?</v>

3079
02:06:27.210 --> 02:06:27.721
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3080
02:06:27.721 --> 02:06:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to deal with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>

3081
02:06:29.590 --> 02:06:32.260
<v Speaker 1>So fucking gross gross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3082
02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Then you see your friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have like a female</v>

3083
02:06:34.441 --> 02:06:35.230
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

3084
02:06:35.230 --> 02:06:36.900
<v Speaker 1>you're not like that with them.</v>

3085
02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:39.270

02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:04.780
<v Speaker 1>It's set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3095
02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:09.820

<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad to have power.</v>

3097
02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not about ugly.</v>

3098
02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:19.170
<v Speaker 1>It's about Harvey Weinstein being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>control of a studio.</v>

3099
02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Zack and scaring all those girls into</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking man,</v>

3100
02:07:22.410 --> 02:07:24.270
<v Speaker 1>allegedly raping some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3101
02:07:24.271 --> 02:07:26.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he did or didn't do,</v>

3102
02:07:26.041 --> 02:07:27.600
<v Speaker 1>but he definitely did a lot of shit.</v>

3103
02:07:27.690 --> 02:07:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I wish I just wished it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these people will.</v>

3104
02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:32.880
<v Speaker 1>I wished it's too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe now people will have the courage</v>

3105
02:07:32.881 --> 02:07:36.790
<v Speaker 1>to come out because it's certain sex to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear about like,</v>

3106
02:07:36.791 --> 02:07:39.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened to Angelina Jolie and then</v>

3107
02:07:39.011 --> 02:07:39.671
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3108
02:07:39.671 --> 02:07:41.620
<v Speaker 1>so then she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a certain time when she was</v>

3109
02:07:41.621 --> 02:07:45.270
<v Speaker 1>like the most famous woman in Hollywood</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she didn't say,</v>

3110
02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:46.670
<v Speaker 1>still didn't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3111
02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:49.690
<v Speaker 1>So we lived in a black ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it sucks that we live in a</v>

3112
02:07:49.691 --> 02:07:53.410
<v Speaker 1>culture like so maybe that's why some</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent people are getting,</v>

3113
02:07:53.620 --> 02:07:58.330
<v Speaker 1>getting caught in the crossfire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can obliterate this sort of</v>

3114
02:07:58.450 --> 02:08:01.060
<v Speaker 1>behavior and attitude from our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the meantime,</v>

3115
02:08:01.061 --> 02:08:03.570
<v Speaker 1>while we're going through this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be some dealers and</v>

3116
02:08:03.571 --> 02:08:06.340
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be some people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get caught in the crossfire.</v>

3117
02:08:06.370 --> 02:08:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever drink?</v>

3118
02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:08.500
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

3119
02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:08.861
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3122
02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:12.750

3125
02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I would tell you I haven't had half a</v>
<v Speaker 1>beer at a party one time when I was</v>

3200
02:11:00.891 --> 02:11:04.790
<v Speaker 3>I love because I feel like I can talk to</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody and then intellectualize things</v>

3201
02:11:04.791 --> 02:11:08.060
<v Speaker 3>on a level that like you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily do with regular people and</v>

3202
02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:10.880
<v Speaker 3>understands human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3203
02:11:10.881 --> 02:11:11.870
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

3204
02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:13.990
<v Speaker 3>And they can go over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>

3205
02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:17.360
<v Speaker 3>why you did this or what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the insecurity that triggered</v>

3206
02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:18.550
<v Speaker 3>that apply?</v>

3207
02:11:18.650 --> 02:11:21.220
<v Speaker 3>And I've learned things about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm learning things about like,</v>

3208
02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:23.580
<v Speaker 3>like I was the only child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3209
02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:25.910
<v Speaker 3>single mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's all these things I've</v>

3210
02:11:25.911 --> 02:11:30.911
<v Speaker 3>learning about like why I interact with</v>
<v Speaker 3>my girlfriend the way I do because of my</v>

3211
02:11:31.131 --> 02:11:35.300
<v Speaker 3>mom and like my friendships and why get</v>
<v Speaker 3>angry about certain things.</v>

3212
02:11:35.450 --> 02:11:37.880
<v Speaker 3>It applies to things on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3213
02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:42.350
<v Speaker 3>So I'm really why I have so many of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these types of relationships in my life</v>

3214
02:11:42.351 --> 02:11:43.500
<v Speaker 3>where people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3215
02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:45.120
<v Speaker 3>needy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3216
02:11:45.121 --> 02:11:47.690
<v Speaker 3>like I find myself being like the one</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's trying to help.</v>

3217
02:11:47.691 --> 02:11:49.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a lot of equal</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>

3218
02:11:49.171 --> 02:11:52.910
<v Speaker 3>So I learned all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably felt vulnerable as a kid and</v>

3219
02:11:52.911 --> 02:11:55.660
<v Speaker 3>when you see vulnerable people you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to help them can relate.</v>

3220
02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.490
<v Speaker 3>And my mom too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom went through a lot to get to the</v>

3221
02:11:58.491 --> 02:11:59.120
<v Speaker 3>states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3222
02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:03.830
<v Speaker 3>she was from Belize in Central America</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like just coming here and hearing</v>

3223
02:12:03.831 --> 02:12:05.180
<v Speaker 3>her stories and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3224
02:12:05.210 --> 02:12:06.850
<v Speaker 3>having,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having to like be somebody to take.</v>

3225
02:12:06.850 --> 02:12:08.900
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 15 years old how we to take care</v>

3226
02:12:08.901 --> 02:12:09.561
<v Speaker 3>of my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3227
02:12:09.561 --> 02:12:10.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3228
02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:12.980
<v Speaker 3>her emotions were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then I,</v>

3229
02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:14.790
<v Speaker 3>that had an effect on me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3230
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:17.600
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't learn this until I was able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go talk to a professional.</v>

3231
02:12:17.690 --> 02:12:19.820
<v Speaker 3>Are you close with your dad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had never met my dad,</v>

3232
02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:21.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>single parent.</v>

3233
02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:23.930
<v Speaker 3>You never met my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So thanks for bringing that up.</v>

3234
02:12:24.660 --> 02:12:29.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Money that mine's name is Joe Rogan</v>

3235
02:12:29.180 --> 02:12:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's out there someplace.</v>

3236
02:12:30.041 --> 02:12:31.160
<v Speaker 3>He's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3237
02:12:31.161 --> 02:12:34.190
<v Speaker 3>I've never met my dad and then I thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3238
02:12:34.250 --> 02:12:36.470
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever want to meet your dad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see?</v>

3239
02:12:36.471 --> 02:12:38.330
<v Speaker 3>You know what's funny?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom want me to met him.</v>

3240
02:12:38.331 --> 02:12:39.910
<v Speaker 3>I knew him until I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3241
02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:41.330
<v Speaker 3>that's worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never knew.</v>

3242
02:12:41.730 --> 02:12:44.180
<v Speaker 3>So I think that that's when you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know them a little bit and then</v>

3243
02:12:44.181 --> 02:12:45.470
<v Speaker 3>they're gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sucks.</v>

3244
02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:49.730
<v Speaker 3>The good thing is that it made me</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize that you can't count on people,</v>

3245
02:12:49.850 --> 02:12:54.850
<v Speaker 3>but you can catch issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely a trusted player become</v>

3246
02:12:55.251 --> 02:12:58.430
<v Speaker 3>someone that people count on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>count on people.</v>

3247
02:12:58.460 --> 02:13:01.550
<v Speaker 3>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have a tight group of friends like me</v>

3248
02:13:01.551 --> 02:13:03.730
<v Speaker 3>and my friends are very close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

3249
02:13:03.740 --> 02:13:06.980
<v Speaker 3>I would do anything for my friends and</v>
<v Speaker 3>family to see.</v>

3250
02:13:06.981 --> 02:13:08.960
<v Speaker 3>I have a certain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain level of loyalty that</v>

3251
02:13:08.961 --> 02:13:10.760
<v Speaker 3>I have because of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3252
02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:13.880
<v Speaker 3>well you understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas someone who grows up in a big</v>

3253
02:13:13.881 --> 02:13:17.240
<v Speaker 3>household filled with people and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>family was always there and everyone was</v>

3254
02:13:17.241 --> 02:13:18.800
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might take people for granted a</v>

3255
02:13:18.801 --> 02:13:20.180
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3256
02:13:20.181 --> 02:13:24.260
<v Speaker 3>whereas for me camaraderie and closeness</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that,</v>

3257
02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:25.970
<v Speaker 3>that shit means a lot to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

3258
02:13:25.971 --> 02:13:28.520
<v Speaker 3>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember asking my mom about my dad</v>

3259
02:13:28.521 --> 02:13:29.870
<v Speaker 3>when I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3260
02:13:29.930 --> 02:13:31.370
<v Speaker 3>17,</v>
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>

3261
02:13:31.890 --> 02:13:33.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she got really offended.</v>

3262
02:13:33.690 --> 02:13:35.660
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I raised you and you know,</v>

3263
02:13:35.930 --> 02:13:38.880
<v Speaker 3>and that made me think like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but women have their secrets,</v>

3264
02:13:38.970 --> 02:13:40.830
<v Speaker 3>like they have their things and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want her to.</v>

3265
02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:42.530
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't regret your cry.</v>

3266
02:13:42.750 --> 02:13:45.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to pry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't want to find out like maybe</v>

3267
02:13:45.241 --> 02:13:47.070
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to be in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my mom was like,</v>

3268
02:13:47.071 --> 02:13:48.030
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>

3269
02:13:48.031 --> 02:13:49.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she think of my mom.</v>

3270
02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:51.240
<v Speaker 3>She could've been vindictive like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know,</v>

3271
02:13:51.540 --> 02:13:54.990
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't hold it against her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she told me his name and she was</v>

3272
02:13:54.991 --> 02:13:55.711
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to,</v>

3273
02:13:55.711 --> 02:13:56.670
<v Speaker 3>you just on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3274
02:13:56.671 --> 02:14:01.170
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had the name for like a week and</v>

3275
02:14:01.171 --> 02:14:04.350
<v Speaker 3>then I forgot it and that told me that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't matter.</v>

3276
02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:07.260
<v Speaker 3>So I had ever since I never worried</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

3277
02:14:07.550 --> 02:14:08.800
<v Speaker 3>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3278
02:14:08.801 --> 02:14:10.980
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some people that really bothers</v>

3279
02:14:10.981 --> 02:14:13.560
<v Speaker 3>them for their whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like one thing that happened though,</v>

3280
02:14:13.561 --> 02:14:16.590
<v Speaker 3>when you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your bond with your kids,</v>

3281
02:14:16.591 --> 02:14:18.090
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3282
02:14:18.091 --> 02:14:19.920
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would assume that everyone's bond with</v>

3283
02:14:19.921 --> 02:14:24.921
<v Speaker 3>their children is very tight because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an unbelievable love connection</v>

3284
02:14:26.701 --> 02:14:28.140
<v Speaker 3>that you have with children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

3285
02:14:28.141 --> 02:14:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Unconditional love is not just true</v>
<v Speaker 3>unconditional.</v>

3286
02:14:30.361 --> 02:14:32.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a drug like they give you,</v>

3287
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:35.490
<v Speaker 3>they give you love to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my daughter,</v>

3288
02:14:35.610 --> 02:14:36.870
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my youngest was,</v>

3289
02:14:36.990 --> 02:14:40.380
<v Speaker 3>we were playing the other day in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pool and there's a point in time we were</v>

3290
02:14:40.381 --> 02:14:43.110
<v Speaker 3>just laughing about something together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just laughing and I'm looking at her</v>

3291
02:14:43.111 --> 02:14:45.420
<v Speaker 3>face and she's laughing and I felt like</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on drugs.</v>

3292
02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.660
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the love that I have for these people is</v>

3293
02:14:48.661 --> 02:14:49.800
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so intense.</v>

3294
02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:50.241
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3295
02:14:50.241 --> 02:14:52.770
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also.</v>

3296
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:56.220
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get that when I was kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know exactly what you're</v>

3297
02:14:56.221 --> 02:14:56.971
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3298
02:14:56.971 --> 02:14:57.730
<v Speaker 3>The parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

3299
02:14:57.730 --> 02:14:58.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom worked,</v>

3300
02:14:58.561 --> 02:15:01.260
<v Speaker 3>my Stepdad was a really good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no one's ever around,</v>

3301
02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:02.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just,</v>

3302
02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:05.220
<v Speaker 3>there was no when they were done</v>
<v Speaker 3>working,</v>

3303
02:15:05.250 --> 02:15:07.050
<v Speaker 3>everybody was tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3304
02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:08.860
<v Speaker 3>I was a latchkey kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

3305
02:15:09.220 --> 02:15:11.390
<v Speaker 3>When I was seven years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live in San Francisco,</v>

3306
02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:14.100
<v Speaker 3>would go out and do a magic show on</v>
<v Speaker 3>fisherman's wharf by myself.</v>

3307
02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:16.950
<v Speaker 3>Just wander around the city just so they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would open the door.</v>

3308
02:15:16.951 --> 02:15:18.930
<v Speaker 3>You just leave seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can imagine that.</v>

3309
02:15:18.931 --> 02:15:23.130
<v Speaker 3>I spent a lot of time by myself too</v>
<v Speaker 3>because my mom was working by herself</v>

3310
02:15:24.090 --> 02:15:26.460
<v Speaker 3>trying to make it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to make sure that I had a good</v>

3311
02:15:26.461 --> 02:15:27.870
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was by myself.</v>

3312
02:15:27.900 --> 02:15:28.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eric,</v>

3313
02:15:28.741 --> 02:15:31.350
<v Speaker 3>if you have kids with this young lady or</v>
<v Speaker 3>another young lady,</v>

3314
02:15:31.390 --> 02:15:33.450
<v Speaker 3>your connection with that kid will be.</v>

3315
02:15:33.450 --> 02:15:36.450
<v Speaker 3>It'll blow your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Change who you are.</v>

3316
02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:37.800
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's what I've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>lacking.</v>

3317
02:15:37.801 --> 02:15:40.860
<v Speaker 3>That's why I've been more open to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3318
02:15:41.310 --> 02:15:43.650
<v Speaker 3>thinking about these kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You seem like a dad.</v>

3319
02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:44.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3320
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:45.950
<v Speaker 3>because I'm taking a picture and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>dad right now,</v>

3321
02:15:45.951 --> 02:15:47.400
<v Speaker 3>my whole life I've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3322
02:15:47.401 --> 02:15:50.250
<v Speaker 3>I've been in that role for so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in my life right now.</v>

3323
02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:52.170
<v Speaker 3>We're holding a baby and turn it over</v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk.</v>

3324
02:15:52.290 --> 02:15:53.220
<v Speaker 3>Take you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>

3325
02:15:53.310 --> 02:15:55.010
<v Speaker 3>I've been taking care of people like</v>
<v Speaker 3>pancakes,</v>

3326
02:15:55.190 --> 02:15:56.970
<v Speaker 3>care people my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3327
02:15:56.971 --> 02:15:59.370
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I always feel like I</v>

3328
02:15:59.371 --> 02:16:01.920
<v Speaker 3>always feel like you have already had</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my best friends in the world is</v>

3329
02:16:02.010 --> 02:16:04.560
<v Speaker 3>something that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had to take care of,</v>

3330
02:16:04.561 --> 02:16:06.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's had a little drinking problem and</v>

3331
02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:08.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've been there the whole time and</v>

3332
02:16:08.461 --> 02:16:09.690
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even though people would be like,</v>

3333
02:16:09.691 --> 02:16:10.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3334
02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:11.330
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to like,</v>

3335
02:16:11.370 --> 02:16:12.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that think that,</v>

3336
02:16:12.951 --> 02:16:14.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to hit rock bottom yet.</v>

3337
02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:17.240
<v Speaker 3>But I'm just not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been through that too.</v>

3338
02:16:17.241 --> 02:16:22.241
<v Speaker 3>I had a very good friend of mine is my</v>
<v Speaker 3>best friend who died of heroin and he</v>

3339
02:16:22.741 --> 02:16:24.580
<v Speaker 3>was um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3340
02:16:24.630 --> 02:16:27.030
<v Speaker 3>always fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was always something.</v>

3341
02:16:27.031 --> 02:16:28.800
<v Speaker 3>It was always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a crack problem for.</v>

3342
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:33.820
<v Speaker 3>And then he got on pills and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was either snorting it or was,</v>

3343
02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:37.630
<v Speaker 3>it was like he already lying very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reminds me of this guy.</v>

3344
02:16:37.670 --> 02:16:41.080
<v Speaker 3>And Joey Diaz did a little bit too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I first met Joey,</v>

3345
02:16:41.081 --> 02:16:44.980
<v Speaker 3>it was like right after my friend johnny</v>
<v Speaker 3>well was right before Johnny had died.</v>

3346
02:16:45.010 --> 02:16:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Johnny was still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had known people like joey because</v>

3347
02:16:49.121 --> 02:16:51.140
<v Speaker 3>of my friend Johnny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

3348
02:16:51.730 --> 02:16:52.563
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

3349
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:55.690
<v Speaker 3>I always was there for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always trying to take care of him.</v>

3350
02:16:55.691 --> 02:16:57.340
<v Speaker 3>I was always trying to help him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was just,</v>

3351
02:16:57.550 --> 02:17:01.120
<v Speaker 3>he was always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was always something going wrong</v>

3352
02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:04.000
<v Speaker 3>and it never is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there was these brief moments,</v>

3353
02:17:04.001 --> 02:17:06.190
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he'd be fine and we'd be laughing</v>

3354
02:17:06.191 --> 02:17:08.560
<v Speaker 3>and we'd have the best time and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>why you fight for it.</v>

3355
02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:12.490
<v Speaker 3>It's those times because I was always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always thinking that one day he</v>

3356
02:17:12.491 --> 02:17:13.100
<v Speaker 3>was going to get it,</v>

3357
02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:16.830
<v Speaker 1>gather I the same thing with my friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>is still going on with me right now.</v>

3358
02:17:16.831 --> 02:17:17.664
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3359
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:19.350
<v Speaker 1>when you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you deal with someone that deals</v>

3360
02:17:19.351 --> 02:17:21.120
<v Speaker 1>with depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real depression,</v>

3361
02:17:21.140 --> 02:17:25.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost his mother and how that affected</v>

3362
02:17:25.111 --> 02:17:28.140
<v Speaker 1>his whole life and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm there and he's younger than me,</v>

3363
02:17:28.141 --> 02:17:31.980
<v Speaker 1>so I feel this mentorship and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like a loyalty that I just can't</v>

3364
02:17:31.981 --> 02:17:33.360
<v Speaker 1>shake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

3365
02:17:33.361 --> 02:17:34.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's that.</v>

3366
02:17:34.441 --> 02:17:36.990
<v Speaker 1>And I know what I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I go to therapy I,</v>

3367
02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:39.870
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to ask why am I this way?</v>

3368
02:17:40.730 --> 02:17:45.730
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized that comedy has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>dampering my own depressions or my own</v>

3369
02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:48.930
<v Speaker 1>feelings because I feel like I'm dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it in some way.</v>

3370
02:17:48.931 --> 02:17:53.070
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes I go and talk about things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I talk about things in a way I just</v>

3371
02:17:53.071 --> 02:17:56.700
<v Speaker 1>no holds bar because I want wanna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get this out,</v>

3372
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:58.510
<v Speaker 1>I feel like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3373
02:17:58.511 --> 02:17:59.790
<v Speaker 1>or if I don't like something.</v>

3374
02:17:59.790 --> 02:18:03.870
<v Speaker 1>And then combined that with we live in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>society right now where people don't</v>

3375
02:18:03.871 --> 02:18:05.940
<v Speaker 1>want to necessarily hear an opinion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not,</v>

3376
02:18:05.941 --> 02:18:07.500
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3377
02:18:07.501 --> 02:18:09.000
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a little of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3378
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:10.980
<v Speaker 1>And so then therefore we get this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3379
02:18:11.340 --> 02:18:14.130
<v Speaker 1>it becomes tougher and tougher to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do,</v>

3380
02:18:14.131 --> 02:18:15.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's not gonna stop me from doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3381
02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:17.970
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sweeter and sweeter when you pull</v>

3382
02:18:17.971 --> 02:18:19.260
<v Speaker 1>it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3383
02:18:19.261 --> 02:18:23.530
<v Speaker 1>especially controversial shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just got to navigate the waters.</v>

3384
02:18:24.250 --> 02:18:26.550
<v Speaker 1>What I feel like I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing it.</v>

3385
02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:30.720
<v Speaker 1>I think I did it with this special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I tried to talk about things in</v>

3386
02:18:30.721 --> 02:18:31.860
<v Speaker 1>a way where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3387
02:18:31.861 --> 02:18:34.440
<v Speaker 1>you may not agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to vilify me,</v>

3388
02:18:34.470 --> 02:18:35.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to like,</v>

3389
02:18:35.461 --> 02:18:36.294
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3390
02:18:36.420 --> 02:18:36.750
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3391
02:18:36.750 --> 02:18:38.400
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all goes back to like,</v>

3392
02:18:38.401 --> 02:18:39.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3393
02:18:39.181 --> 02:18:41.250
<v Speaker 1>like who we are as people because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like our,</v>

3394
02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:42.310
<v Speaker 1>our parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3395
02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:43.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like I,</v>

3397
02:18:44.701 --> 02:18:46.530
<v Speaker 1>I love my Stepdad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stepdad is a great guy.</v>

3398
02:18:46.740 --> 02:18:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad he's in my mom's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3399
02:18:48.391 --> 02:18:50.400
<v Speaker 1>they're off in Spain right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They moved to Spain,</v>

3400
02:18:50.401 --> 02:18:50.740
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3401
02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:53.550
<v Speaker 1>like I say like a year and a half ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're there,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy that she's happy in the later</v>

3404
02:18:56.401 --> 02:18:57.690
<v Speaker 1>part of her life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

3405
02:18:57.900 --> 02:18:59.280
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3406
02:18:59.340 --> 02:19:01.170
<v Speaker 1>that's mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look man,</v>

3407
02:19:01.171 --> 02:19:04.410
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day it should be just</v>
<v Speaker 1>about enjoying this experience.</v>

3408
02:19:04.470 --> 02:19:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Just having time with people you care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and enjoying it and it's hard to</v>

3409
02:19:08.971 --> 02:19:09.410
<v Speaker 1>figure it out.</v>

3410
02:19:09.410 --> 02:19:09.890
<v Speaker 3>What do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean?</v>

3411
02:19:09.890 --> 02:19:12.350
<v Speaker 3>We're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very fortunate in a lot of ways,</v>

3412
02:19:12.380 --> 02:19:16.590
<v Speaker 3>but one of the big ones is that you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found comedy and you imagine.</v>

3413
02:19:16.591 --> 02:19:18.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you tell the people sometimes they</v>

3414
02:19:18.231 --> 02:19:19.400
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck they live without telling</v>

3415
02:19:19.401 --> 02:19:20.234
<v Speaker 3>me</v>

3416
02:19:21.340 --> 02:19:26.340
<v Speaker 1>how do they live without killing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I see some bullshit happened tv I</v>

3417
02:19:27.561 --> 02:19:28.100
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy</v>

3418
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:31.370
<v Speaker 3>needs to go do an open mic set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to go get that out man.</v>

3419
02:19:31.430 --> 02:19:32.630
<v Speaker 3>Go get that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3420
02:19:32.690 --> 02:19:35.390
<v Speaker 3>you know that feeling that you get like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Friday night and the,</v>

3421
02:19:35.391 --> 02:19:38.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you just mash and you get off stage?</v>

3422
02:19:38.991 --> 02:19:42.320
<v Speaker 3>You're like telling me there's a better</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling of it because whatever I was</v>

3423
02:19:42.321 --> 02:19:43.790
<v Speaker 3>feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all goes away.</v>

3424
02:19:43.870 --> 02:19:45.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's why I feel like.</v>

3425
02:19:45.590 --> 02:19:46.540
<v Speaker 3>I do think though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3426
02:19:46.550 --> 02:19:50.000
<v Speaker 3>sometimes we're like putting a damper on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and it doesn't necessarily go away,</v>

3427
02:19:50.210 --> 02:19:52.460
<v Speaker 3>but we found another outlet to get it</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

3428
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:54.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just got a little toxic hating man.</v>

3429
02:19:54.830 --> 02:19:57.230
<v Speaker 3>You take it a little happy pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3430
02:19:57.231 --> 02:20:00.320
<v Speaker 3>like there's happiness and all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you enjoy doing.</v>

3431
02:20:00.460 --> 02:20:05.460
<v Speaker 3>I found I've tried to fill my life up</v>
<v Speaker 3>with activities that I enjoy doing,</v>

3432
02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:07.820
<v Speaker 3>but family is a big one too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

3433
02:20:07.850 --> 02:20:08.900
<v Speaker 3>Family is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3434
02:20:09.860 --> 02:20:11.540
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a different thing,</v>

3435
02:20:11.541 --> 02:20:12.440
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It changes you.</v>

3436
02:20:12.460 --> 02:20:14.330
<v Speaker 3>You and I'm all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have all daughters.</v>

3437
02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:17.300
<v Speaker 3>It's all my house is off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so feminine.</v>

3438
02:20:17.301 --> 02:20:18.950
<v Speaker 3>Everything's females.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3439
02:20:19.030 --> 02:20:20.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about it on my special,</v>

3440
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.730
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3441
02:20:21.730 --> 02:20:23.580
<v Speaker 3>the Bruce Jenner thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3442
02:20:23.800 --> 02:20:25.250
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my last special,</v>

3443
02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:28.400
<v Speaker 3>the one before this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's just that if you live with</v>

3444
02:20:28.401 --> 02:20:30.220
<v Speaker 3>crazy bitches long enough eventually</v>
<v Speaker 3>become.</v>

3445
02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:37.370
<v Speaker 3>I am becoming more and more familiar</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a more feminine version of</v>

3446
02:20:37.371 --> 02:20:38.630
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3447
02:20:38.631 --> 02:20:41.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm so much more feminine than I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>been,</v>

3448
02:20:41.090 --> 02:20:46.090
<v Speaker 3>ever so much more in tune with how girls</v>
<v Speaker 3>think so much more tolerant of like</v>

3449
02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:50.000
<v Speaker 3>nonsense talk because like when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking nonsense talk,</v>

3450
02:20:50.001 --> 02:20:52.980
<v Speaker 3>it's just different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just like you realize like if,</v>

3451
02:20:53.710 --> 02:20:56.280
<v Speaker 3>if I'm around like women when they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking together and I'm going to</v>

3452
02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:59.870
<v Speaker 3>observe her and I wash them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just talk about different shit man.</v>

3453
02:21:00.350 --> 02:21:03.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when we've just talked about</v>

3454
02:21:03.471 --> 02:21:06.590
<v Speaker 3>different shift for two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you like,</v>

3455
02:21:06.591 --> 02:21:08.360
<v Speaker 3>try to interject,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interject and go,</v>

3456
02:21:08.361 --> 02:21:10.550
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you guys see that bare knuckle boxing</v>

3457
02:21:10.551 --> 02:21:13.260
<v Speaker 3>fight was fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like let's get away from the.</v>

3458
02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:14.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3459
02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:17.630
<v Speaker 3>Like for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're interested in is stupid and</v>

3460
02:21:17.631 --> 02:21:18.411
<v Speaker 3>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3461
02:21:18.411 --> 02:21:19.700
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to talk about whatever the</v>

3462
02:21:19.701 --> 02:21:21.650
<v Speaker 3>fuck they want to talk about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're into at the moment.</v>

3463
02:21:21.650 --> 02:21:25.820
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's shoes of the royal wedding</v>
<v Speaker 3>or what relationships have had been in a</v>

3464
02:21:25.821 --> 02:21:28.400
<v Speaker 3>relationship for this long now has</v>
<v Speaker 3>taught me patience,</v>

3465
02:21:28.430 --> 02:21:30.020
<v Speaker 3>patience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's taught me patience.</v>

3466
02:21:30.050 --> 02:21:35.050
<v Speaker 3>It taught me like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Except the double standard that things</v>

3467
02:21:35.271 --> 02:21:38.090
<v Speaker 3>aren't supposed to necessarily be equal</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're supposed to be.</v>

3468
02:21:38.130 --> 02:21:40.430
<v Speaker 3>I always think that it's one of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>scales,</v>

3469
02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:43.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you put stuff in the scale on this</v>

3470
02:21:43.491 --> 02:21:47.180
<v Speaker 3>side and she puts different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's how you balance out.</v>

3471
02:21:47.600 --> 02:21:49.460
<v Speaker 3>But they don't have to be the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3472
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:52.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't give love in the same way,</v>

3473
02:21:52.610 --> 02:21:55.550
<v Speaker 3>so you shouldn't accept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't expect it to be the way</v>

3474
02:21:55.551 --> 02:21:57.650
<v Speaker 3>you give it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that becomes a problem.</v>

3475
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:59.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that becomes a problem.</v>

3476
02:21:59.001 --> 02:22:01.990
<v Speaker 3>I had a girlfriend once that she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she didn't express love in a way that</v>

3477
02:22:02.010 --> 02:22:04.800
<v Speaker 3>was like hugging and she didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it that way.</v>

3478
02:22:04.810 --> 02:22:06.350
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't affectionate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she wasn't affectionate.</v>

3479
02:22:06.351 --> 02:22:08.690
<v Speaker 3>She like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she buy me a TV or something,</v>

3480
02:22:09.050 --> 02:22:13.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's so weird and I understood</v>

3481
02:22:13.761 --> 02:22:16.250
<v Speaker 3>though because it was because her family</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't like that.</v>

3482
02:22:16.251 --> 02:22:17.070
<v Speaker 3>They weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't.</v>

3483
02:22:17.070 --> 02:22:19.130
<v Speaker 3>They weren't a huggy people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was,</v>

3484
02:22:19.210 --> 02:22:21.650
<v Speaker 3>don't feel sad for people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That I do.</v>

3485
02:22:21.810 --> 02:22:24.260
<v Speaker 3>I do is we need human interaction</v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction.</v>

3486
02:22:24.261 --> 02:22:25.770
<v Speaker 3>We need to connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to,</v>

3487
02:22:26.430 --> 02:22:28.230
<v Speaker 3>we need to feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3488
02:22:28.231 --> 02:22:30.870
<v Speaker 3>we need to feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we also need smiles.</v>

3489
02:22:30.900 --> 02:22:33.210
<v Speaker 3>We need smiles from people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was telling my girlfriend,</v>

3490
02:22:33.211 --> 02:22:35.400
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that you're the most beautiful</v>

3491
02:22:35.401 --> 02:22:36.000
<v Speaker 3>when you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3492
02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.030
<v Speaker 3>happy and smiling because the moment she</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't,</v>

3493
02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:38.970
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did I do</v>

3494
02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:44.470
<v Speaker 3>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you did.</v>

3495
02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:48.300
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if she's mad and she.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is She mad about this?</v>

3496
02:22:48.670 --> 02:22:51.400
<v Speaker 3>I know she's mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did I do or,</v>

3497
02:22:51.450 --> 02:22:53.670
<v Speaker 3>or what does she think I did preemptive?</v>

3498
02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Like if I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will she get mad?</v>

3499
02:22:55.440 --> 02:22:56.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do I know</v>

3500
02:22:59.060 --> 02:23:01.630
<v Speaker 3>it's like a divinci code,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3501
02:23:01.890 --> 02:23:03.780
<v Speaker 3>We're just trying to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I'm learning with her.</v>

3502
02:23:03.781 --> 02:23:07.260
<v Speaker 3>But I remember I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was with a girl that I was dating at</v>

3503
02:23:07.261 --> 02:23:08.790
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in my twenties.</v>

3504
02:23:08.791 --> 02:23:13.170
<v Speaker 3>I was very young at the time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was with a couple of my buddies and we</v>

3505
02:23:13.171 --> 02:23:18.120
<v Speaker 3>were talking and this guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was bringing up that this guy was</v>

3506
02:23:18.121 --> 02:23:20.520
<v Speaker 3>having some crazy problem with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend.</v>

3507
02:23:20.850 --> 02:23:21.840
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to get rid of it because</v>

3511

<v Speaker 3>she's fucking hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

3512

<v Speaker 3>who's that girl from real housewives?</v>

<v Speaker 3>this guy's got a girlfriend who's hot.</v>

3530
02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:21.870
<v Speaker 3>She's hot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a young Teri hatcher.</v>

<v Speaker 3>couldn't do,</v>

3536
02:24:38.131 --> 02:24:40.540
<v Speaker 3>couldn't deal with the fact that she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling cash.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Confused.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's all you ate for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3644
02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:54.740
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I got to day five.</v>

3646
02:28:58.010 --> 02:29:01.610
<v Speaker 3>Then the two days of you got to let your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body get used to like having salad and</v>

3647

<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3650
02:29:07.131 --> 02:29:10.580
<v Speaker 3>what I learned from being Vegan for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year is that the meat is not</v>

3651
02:29:10.581 --> 02:29:12.920
<v Speaker 3>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The main course is just a side dish with</v>

3652
02:29:12.921 --> 02:29:15.800
<v Speaker 3>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you have a good thing of Broccoli,</v>

3653
02:29:15.890 --> 02:29:17.030
<v Speaker 3>a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>corn,</v>

3654
02:29:17.031 --> 02:29:19.670
<v Speaker 3>a good thing of mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you have a good thing,</v>

3655
02:29:19.671 --> 02:29:23.840
<v Speaker 3>a steak that you don't have to have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>steak and then you could have some great</v>

3656
02:29:23.841 --> 02:29:25.550
<v Speaker 3>side dishes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3657
02:29:25.610 --> 02:29:27.740
<v Speaker 3>well there's a lot of people that eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>carnivore diet now,</v>

3658
02:29:27.770 --> 02:29:29.270
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of people that are eating just</v>
<v Speaker 3>meat.</v>

3659
02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's all about moderation,</v>

3660
02:29:33.201 --> 02:29:34.130
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3661
02:29:34.290 --> 02:29:36.680
<v Speaker 3>You don't even notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different for different people,</v>

3662
02:29:37.070 --> 02:29:39.320
<v Speaker 3>but you work out your workout guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to work out a lot.</v>

3663
02:29:40.210 --> 02:29:43.220
<v Speaker 3>You got monkey bars out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been working out twice a day.</v>

3664
02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:44.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

3665
02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:47.960
<v Speaker 3>My main thing is one hard workout a day</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one less,</v>

3666
02:29:48.020 --> 02:29:50.120
<v Speaker 3>less hard workout a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if you think,</v>

3667
02:29:50.121 --> 02:29:53.000
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that your physical,</v>

3668
02:29:53.060 --> 02:29:57.290
<v Speaker 3>your physical physically change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would diminish for sure because when I</v>

3669
02:29:57.291 --> 02:29:59.300
<v Speaker 3>take time off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I take time off,</v>

3670
02:29:59.301 --> 02:30:01.400
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I noticed diminishing maybe,</v>

3671
02:30:01.460 --> 02:30:06.460
<v Speaker 3>but maybe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also let's say how proper or average</v>

3672
02:30:07.971 --> 02:30:10.400
<v Speaker 3>health or even above average health is</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

3673
02:30:10.730 --> 02:30:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Maybe what you're doing brings you up</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

3674
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:15.680
<v Speaker 3>so that diminishing you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

3675
02:30:15.681 --> 02:30:18.380
<v Speaker 3>it's just going to bring you to a more</v>
<v Speaker 3>average normal level,</v>

3676
02:30:18.381 --> 02:30:19.940
<v Speaker 3>but still in great shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3677
02:30:19.941 --> 02:30:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're overdoing it.</v>

3678
02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:24.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm just wondering if we're doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I monitor everything.</v>

3679
02:30:24.741 --> 02:30:28.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm making sure that my health is good</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my body's in good shape,</v>

3680
02:30:28.341 --> 02:30:30.260
<v Speaker 3>but I just know that if you don't use</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3681
02:30:30.261 --> 02:30:30.950
<v Speaker 3>you lose it.</v>

3682
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:33.620
<v Speaker 3>There's just a fact that and when I say</v>
<v Speaker 3>a workout twice a day,</v>

3683
02:30:33.621 --> 02:30:37.550
<v Speaker 3>what it means is usually I'll do yoga</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the day and then at night I'll</v>

3684
02:30:37.551 --> 02:30:42.200
<v Speaker 3>lift some weights or I'll run the hills</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then at night I'll lift weights.</v>

3685
02:30:42.201 --> 02:30:44.240
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing a navy seal workout</v>
<v Speaker 3>twice a day?</v>

3686
02:30:44.270 --> 02:30:44.591
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3687
02:30:44.591 --> 02:30:45.110
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One.</v>

3688
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:48.830
<v Speaker 3>One of the workouts is like pretty calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The weightlifting workouts are almost</v>

3689
02:30:48.831 --> 02:30:53.210
<v Speaker 3>always pretty calm unless I'm doing like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cardio kettlebell workout or something</v>

3690
02:30:53.211 --> 02:30:56.620
<v Speaker 3>intense at this gym they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do the boxing and then another</v>

3691
02:30:56.620 --> 02:30:59.750
<v Speaker 3>days you can come and you could do like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a a weight training.</v>

3692
02:30:59.820 --> 02:31:02.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm an active weights and that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

3693
02:31:02.570 --> 02:31:03.800
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to start doing that one</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

3694
02:31:03.860 --> 02:31:06.210
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A big thing with you is just what you're</v>

3695
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:07.930
<v Speaker 3>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

3696
02:31:08.440 --> 02:31:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The animal cookies to the circus animal</v>

3697
02:31:11.751 --> 02:31:13.580
<v Speaker 3>cookies I have in my kitchen right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

3698
02:31:13.880 --> 02:31:14.990
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not good,</v>

3699
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:19.010
<v Speaker 3>but if they come in these little packs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have a pack of 50 so every time I</v>

3700
02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 3>have one I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm only</v>

<v Speaker 1>gut area.</v>

3706
02:31:29.460 --> 02:31:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Especially as you get shaped like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ostrich.</v>

3707
02:31:31.261 --> 02:31:34.350
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm big in the middle,</v>

3708
02:31:34.450 --> 02:31:36.600
<v Speaker 1>middle legs.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Cut out everything that is delicious.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3754
02:33:27.210 --> 02:33:30.480
<v Speaker 1>it's important to alleviate a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of angst.</v>

3755
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:34.060
<v Speaker 1>You want to go on stage with a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount when you're upset and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>hating yourself.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3759
02:33:39.640 --> 02:33:41.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't like comics that go onstage</v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk,</v>

3760
02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:43.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like how they they need this</v>

3761

<v Speaker 1>alcohol or or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or people that think we'd like people to</v>

3762
02:33:47.281 --> 02:33:50.760
<v Speaker 1>think we like out of my saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weed makes you lazy,</v>

3763
02:33:51.450 --> 02:33:54.030

<v Speaker 1>Ryan.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3765
02:33:55.171 --> 02:33:58.200
<v Speaker 1>as a person who smokes weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really bothers me because I'm not</v>

3766
02:33:58.201 --> 02:34:02.820
<v Speaker 1>lazy at all and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate that connection between lazy</v>

3767
02:34:02.821 --> 02:34:04.530
<v Speaker 1>people in week because I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

3768
02:34:04.620 --> 02:34:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's what makes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>lazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

3773
02:34:12.931 --> 02:34:15.480
<v Speaker 1>This is not going to be a winning</v>
<v Speaker 1>combination.</v>

3774
02:34:15.510 --> 02:34:17.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that it just looks</v>

<v Speaker 1>stoners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he got like a.</v>

3810
02:35:49.930 --> 02:35:51.570
<v Speaker 1>He had a little blame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brain slip.</v>

3819
02:36:10.061 --> 02:36:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's a website so he smokes</v>

3820
02:36:12.071 --> 02:36:12.904
<v Speaker 1>a lot of weed.</v>

3821
02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Smoking weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

3822
02:36:16.270 --> 02:36:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Well this doesn't like one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things with the MBA has it in their</v>

3823
02:36:19.511 --> 02:36:22.060
<v Speaker 1>contract that they don't test for weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do tests,</v>

3824
02:36:22.061 --> 02:36:25.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as stringent as everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>they test for weed.</v>

3825
02:36:26.260 --> 02:36:31.260
<v Speaker 1>But these guys are all getting high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's the locker room for a pool</v>

3826
02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:32.490
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3827
02:36:32.490 --> 02:36:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I told you I play pool pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana is a performance enhancing</v>

3828
02:36:36.311 --> 02:36:37.360
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

3829
02:36:37.390 --> 02:36:39.730
<v Speaker 1>It makes me my game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe you,</v>

3830
02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:41.290
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

3831
02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:44.050
<v Speaker 1>it does not make your paint better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

3832
02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:47.050
<v Speaker 1>It makes you more sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me is the reason why basketball</v>

3833
02:36:47.051 --> 02:36:50.110
<v Speaker 1>players find it better to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It puts them into some sort of a zone.</v>

3834
02:36:50.260 --> 02:36:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Now are you saying that Lebron James</v>
<v Speaker 1>Needs?</v>

3835
02:36:51.971 --> 02:36:54.670
<v Speaker 1>We'd know like there's a lot of pro pool</v>
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>

3836
02:36:54.671 --> 02:36:56.740
<v Speaker 1>so we're top of the food chain and don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do anything right,</v>

3837
02:36:56.770 --> 02:37:01.750
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of guys who like it say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd bumps their game up quite a bit and</v>

3838
02:37:01.751 --> 02:37:03.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me play better.</v>

3839
02:37:03.910 --> 02:37:05.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know because you don't smoke.</v>

3840
02:37:05.861 --> 02:37:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you do an experiment?</v>

3841
02:37:08.830 --> 02:37:10.180
<v Speaker 1>I want to express.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to play.</v>

3842
02:37:10.340 --> 02:37:11.940
<v Speaker 1>You're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to play pool.</v>

3843
02:37:11.941 --> 02:37:12.940
<v Speaker 1>You play?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3844
02:37:13.100 --> 02:37:14.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to play pool sober.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3845
02:37:14.810 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're gonna.</v>

3846
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:20.100
<v Speaker 3>See your results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then see the problem is if weapon</v>

3847
02:37:20.101 --> 02:37:23.480
<v Speaker 3>experiments sober and then I smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I smoke pot and get high.</v>

3848
02:37:23.481 --> 02:37:26.750
<v Speaker 3>I will have been warmed up for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing pool sober and I'll definitely</v>

3849
02:37:26.751 --> 02:37:28.070
<v Speaker 3>play better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>High separate.</v>

3850
02:37:28.290 --> 02:37:31.910
<v Speaker 3>It's separate days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with separate days is</v>

3851
02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:34.970
<v Speaker 3>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body has to be like perfectly in</v>

3852
02:37:34.971 --> 02:37:37.790
<v Speaker 3>tune and running to get real accurate</v>
<v Speaker 3>results because one day I could have</v>

3853
02:37:37.791 --> 02:37:39.950
<v Speaker 3>lifted weights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which fucks up your pool game.</v>

3854
02:37:39.951 --> 02:37:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we go,</v>

3855
02:37:41.320 --> 02:37:44.210
<v Speaker 3>telling you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>day use of marijuana.</v>

3857
02:37:48.410 --> 02:37:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Matt Barnes who will not be in the hall</v>
<v Speaker 3>of fame.</v>

3858
02:37:51.530 --> 02:37:53.690
<v Speaker 3>Who did the player?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>

3859

<v Speaker 3>He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was all right.</v>

3860
02:37:54.691 --> 02:37:56.370
<v Speaker 3>But he's a role player.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to.</v>

3861
02:37:56.440 --> 02:37:58.580

<v Speaker 3>say that.</v>

3862
02:37:58.610 --> 02:37:59.930
<v Speaker 3>Then I'm going to be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>don't tell me what the role players will</v>

3865
02:38:05.551 --> 02:38:06.700
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying this though,</v>

3866

<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you for Jujitsu,</v>

3868
02:38:14.020 --> 02:38:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Lot of people get high and then to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and they say it makes the game</v>

3869
02:38:18.141 --> 02:38:20.600
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the practical use of Jujitsu?</v>

3870
02:38:21.530 --> 02:38:24.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you and I were in a fight that would</v>

3871
02:38:24.501 --> 02:38:26.850
<v Speaker 3>kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think he would kill me,</v>

3872
02:38:27.530 --> 02:38:29.450
<v Speaker 3>kill me anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but telling me the practical.</v>

3873
02:38:29.451 --> 02:38:31.190
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just for that moment,</v>

<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

3875
02:38:33.620 --> 02:38:35.330
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just you want to be high.</v>

3876
02:38:35.331 --> 02:38:39.410
<v Speaker 3>If you were to walk into your car late</v>
<v Speaker 3>at night and then three guys came at you</v>

3877
02:38:39.530 --> 02:38:41.300
<v Speaker 3>and you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you want it to be asking what's</v>

3878
02:38:41.301 --> 02:38:44.000
<v Speaker 3>the perfect circumstance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're late at night.</v>

3879
02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.670
<v Speaker 3>You're headed to your car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you understand marijuana.</v>

3880
02:38:47.270 --> 02:38:49.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you want to bother them?</v>

3881
02:38:49.690 --> 02:38:53.360
<v Speaker 3>Would you prefer to be sober or high?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neither one be fine with either one.</v>

3882
02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:54.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh good.</v>

3883
02:38:54.231 --> 02:38:55.370
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then depends.</v>

3884
02:38:55.460 --> 02:38:58.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not going to be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything different if I'm sober or.</v>

3885
02:38:58.851 --> 02:39:00.150
<v Speaker 3>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fit,</v>

3886
02:39:00.170 --> 02:39:02.930
<v Speaker 3>but we're not talking about drunk now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you said what?</v>

3887
02:39:02.931 --> 02:39:05.060
<v Speaker 3>I want to be drunk or sober,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

3888
02:39:05.061 --> 02:39:06.390
<v Speaker 3>I'd want to be sober.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no I'm not.</v>

3889
02:39:06.530 --> 02:39:07.610
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

3890
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:12.670
<v Speaker 3>If I'm worried about getting kit and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>not sure about reaction time or one of</v>

3891
02:39:12.681 --> 02:39:15.530
<v Speaker 3>the things about pod is it makes you a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit paranoid so it puts you on</v>

3892
02:39:15.531 --> 02:39:17.360
<v Speaker 3>edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you aware of Shit.</v>

3893
02:39:17.870 --> 02:39:21.710
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is it focuses you like</v>
<v Speaker 3>very cleanly on what you're doing.</v>

3894
02:39:21.910 --> 02:39:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're do this out here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just really strong there.</v>

3895
02:39:24.690 --> 02:39:28.430
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know I like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're a drawing or music or</v>

3896
02:39:28.431 --> 02:39:31.580
<v Speaker 3>something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We really try to focus a lot of writing.</v>

3897
02:39:31.610 --> 02:39:35.240
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people really like it for those</v>
<v Speaker 3>things because it makes you really focus</v>

3898
02:39:35.241 --> 02:39:36.950
<v Speaker 3>on what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then.</v>

3899
02:39:37.210 --> 02:39:41.540
<v Speaker 3>But then I think what happens then is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that whatever they were doing on</v>

3900
02:39:41.541 --> 02:39:43.160
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't apply it to.</v>

3901
02:39:43.490 --> 02:39:45.500
<v Speaker 3>Because I know a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all have a lot.</v>

3902
02:39:45.501 --> 02:39:47.720
<v Speaker 3>We both have a lot of potheads comedian</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

3903
02:39:48.290 --> 02:39:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some of them.</v>

3904
02:39:49.401 --> 02:39:52.610
<v Speaker 3>I know that when I started with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that they're not doing what</v>

3905
02:39:52.611 --> 02:39:56.150
<v Speaker 3>they're doing now that they're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't keep going.</v>

3906
02:39:56.200 --> 02:39:59.840
<v Speaker 3>It exceed their expectations and I know</v>
<v Speaker 3>proud of it was because of the pot.</v>

3907
02:39:59.900 --> 02:40:02.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the pod is just common</v>

3908
02:40:02.481 --> 02:40:03.920
<v Speaker 3>denominator uses an excuse.</v>

3909
02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:06.680
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The common denominator is no work ethic.</v>

3910
02:40:07.430 --> 02:40:08.870
<v Speaker 3>That denominator is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It did.</v>

3911
02:40:08.871 --> 02:40:12.020
<v Speaker 3>It didn't help to work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it hurts or helps.</v>

3912
02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:15.060
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a factor of study on this.</v>

3913
02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the study would be skewed because</v>

3914
02:40:18.061 --> 02:40:21.660
<v Speaker 3>a lot of failures that get high all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time would be in the study,</v>

3915
02:40:21.990 --> 02:40:25.850
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of winners that get high on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time don't want to talk about it and</v>

3916
02:40:25.860 --> 02:40:27.420
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

3917
02:40:27.421 --> 02:40:29.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you 100 percent on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

3918
02:40:29.221 --> 02:40:32.310
<v Speaker 3>What I hate is that the people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have any work ethic,</v>

3919
02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:37.200
<v Speaker 3>they look at somebody with a work ethic</v>
<v Speaker 3>that smokes weed and then say,</v>

3920
02:40:37.380 --> 02:40:39.870
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they made it because they smoke weed.</v>

3921
02:40:39.930 --> 02:40:40.763
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3922
02:40:40.770 --> 02:40:42.480
<v Speaker 3>They would have made it without the</v>
<v Speaker 3>weed.</v>

3923
02:40:42.481 --> 02:40:43.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would have made it without the way.</v>

3924
02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:46.470
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before I ever smoked weed.</v>

3925
02:40:46.471 --> 02:40:51.440
<v Speaker 3>I was already on television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a warner brothers cd as no start</v>

3926
02:40:51.450 --> 02:40:54.210
<v Speaker 3>smoking weed until like 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

3927
02:40:54.211 --> 02:40:55.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm not listening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not anti weed,</v>

3928
02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:58.890
<v Speaker 3>but I just think that with anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>there should be moderation.</v>

3929
02:40:58.920 --> 02:40:59.671
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3930
02:40:59.671 --> 02:41:02.010
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the best things I did last</v>

3931
02:41:02.010 --> 02:41:04.800
<v Speaker 3>year was Ari and Tom Segura and Bert</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kreischer nine.</v>

3932
02:41:04.801 --> 02:41:08.200
<v Speaker 3>We did this sober October thing where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw.</v>

3933
02:41:08.310 --> 02:41:10.590
<v Speaker 3>I saw no booze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no pot,</v>

3934
02:41:10.591 --> 02:41:15.360
<v Speaker 3>and we had to do 15 hot yoga classes in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the month and I learned a lot in that</v>

3935
02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:16.193
<v Speaker 3>month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really did.</v>

3936
02:41:16.230 --> 02:41:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Are you different?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you different person because of it?</v>

3937
02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:19.140
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was good.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3945

<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was we just.</v>

3946
02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:39.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the pot,</v>

3947
02:41:39.550 --> 02:41:42.600
<v Speaker 3>but I forget what was going to say stone</v>
<v Speaker 3>and thought.</v>

3948
02:41:42.810 --> 02:41:43.643
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

3949
02:41:44.390 --> 02:41:48.180
<v Speaker 3>It's not whether or not you smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's whether or not you get things done</v>

3950
02:41:48.450 --> 02:41:50.640
<v Speaker 3>and whether or not you write out what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to do,</v>

3951
02:41:50.641 --> 02:41:53.280
<v Speaker 3>whether or not you actually try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>achieve goals,</v>

3952
02:41:53.281 --> 02:41:56.760
<v Speaker 3>whether or not you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're actively trying to improve</v>

3953
02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:01.080
<v Speaker 3>whatever you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you build cars or make carpet,</v>

3954
02:42:01.110 --> 02:42:04.170
<v Speaker 3>cabinetry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just about whether or not you're</v>

3955
02:42:04.260 --> 02:42:07.470
<v Speaker 3>working towards succeeding and and</v>
<v Speaker 3>improving.</v>

3956
02:42:07.500 --> 02:42:08.610
<v Speaker 3>And I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

3957
02:42:08.611 --> 02:42:10.100
<v Speaker 3>I agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not anti pot.</v>

3958
02:42:10.340 --> 02:42:13.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't agree with based on evidence</v>

3959
02:42:13.830 --> 02:42:15.750
<v Speaker 3>of the people that are around a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

3960
02:42:15.751 --> 02:42:18.390
<v Speaker 3>We should be anti.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should be antipop dude.</v>

3961
02:42:18.391 --> 02:42:22.440
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people that were there</v>
<v Speaker 3>were made me sad like I'd run into him</v>

3962
02:42:22.441 --> 02:42:23.790
<v Speaker 3>at the comedy store and they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>

3963
02:42:23.791 --> 02:42:24.780
<v Speaker 3>you got any weed on you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3964
02:42:24.780 --> 02:42:25.500
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3965
02:42:25.500 --> 02:42:27.090
<v Speaker 3>and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not doing anything.</v>

3966
02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:29.280
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing anything with your life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you want some weed.</v>

3967
02:42:29.310 --> 02:42:31.410
<v Speaker 3>Go get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get some wheat.</v>

3968
02:42:31.450 --> 02:42:33.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you also see guys like Ari who</v>

3969
02:42:33.871 --> 02:42:35.730
<v Speaker 3>get high all the time and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly working.</v>

3970
02:42:35.740 --> 02:42:39.390
<v Speaker 3>Or Doug Benson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's like the most functional pothead</v>

3971
02:42:39.780 --> 02:42:42.060
<v Speaker 3>I've ever met in my lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All Day he's a weird one,</v>

3972
02:42:42.061 --> 02:42:45.420
<v Speaker 3>or snoop dogg there people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these are people that are.</v>

3973
02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:47.190
<v Speaker 3>They are the exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the rule.</v>

3974
02:42:47.550 --> 02:42:49.570
<v Speaker 3>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people on Wall Street</v>

3975
02:42:49.571 --> 02:42:51.090
<v Speaker 3>that get high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that are</v>

3976
02:42:51.091 --> 02:42:56.091
<v Speaker 3>involved in like the tech world that get</v>
<v Speaker 3>high a lot and what people think about</v>

3977
02:42:56.281 --> 02:42:58.200
<v Speaker 3>it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3978
02:42:58.201 --> 02:42:59.490
<v Speaker 3>it's like everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3979
02:42:59.491 --> 02:43:02.280
<v Speaker 3>It can be good for you or it could fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>your world up.</v>

3980
02:43:03.020 --> 02:43:05.610
<v Speaker 3>My ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some benefit to it and</v>

3981
02:43:05.611 --> 02:43:07.980
<v Speaker 3>what the benefit is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability,</v>

3982
02:43:08.010 --> 02:43:08.843
<v Speaker 3>creativity.</v>

3983
02:43:08.960 --> 02:43:10.980
<v Speaker 3>It makes you feel vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you.</v>

3984
02:43:11.770 --> 02:43:14.020
<v Speaker 3>Things makes you look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People call it paranoia.</v>

3985
02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:16.900
<v Speaker 3>I just think it broadens your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your awareness.</v>

3986
02:43:16.940 --> 02:43:20.890
<v Speaker 3>I think as a standup you already have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>level of vulnerability just going on</v>

3987
02:43:20.891 --> 02:43:22.510
<v Speaker 3>stage and talking about things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

3988
02:43:22.511 --> 02:43:24.430
<v Speaker 3>So that's like my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that some of that.</v>

3989
02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:26.170
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like that's my drug.</v>

3990
02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:28.120
<v Speaker 3>Does a good drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

3991
02:43:28.160 --> 02:43:30.190
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely not one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna ruin your life.</v>

3992
02:43:30.220 --> 02:43:31.260
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3993
02:43:31.330 --> 02:43:34.300
<v Speaker 3>Unless you tell a bad planet of the apes</v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes on twitter,</v>

3994
02:43:37.870 --> 02:43:38.703
<v Speaker 3>on that area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

3995
02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:43.890
<v Speaker 3>she got that old school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3996
02:43:44.570 --> 02:43:47.140
<v Speaker 3>she got that abm from the motherland.</v>

3997
02:43:49.300 --> 02:43:51.730
<v Speaker 3>I hope she bounces back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if she will.</v>

3998
02:43:52.140 --> 02:43:56.350
<v Speaker 3>Has Anybody bounced back from this new</v>
<v Speaker 3>era of fucking hate and anger?</v>

3999
02:43:56.500 --> 02:44:00.820
<v Speaker 3>No one has bounced back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think like Aziz wasn't taken out</v>

4000
02:44:01.510 --> 02:44:03.600
<v Speaker 3>well the show was canceled or anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

4001
02:44:03.610 --> 02:44:07.330
<v Speaker 3>Have a show except the Netflix show and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't do anything to the point where</v>

4002
02:44:07.331 --> 02:44:09.790
<v Speaker 3>it was like a crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people went after him like</v>

4003
02:44:09.791 --> 02:44:10.270
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam,</v>

4004
02:44:10.270 --> 02:44:14.200
<v Speaker 3>Samantha Bee lady went after him and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's going hard to everybody.</v>

4005
02:44:14.201 --> 02:44:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's going hard and everybody was</v>

4006
02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:17.590
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4007
02:44:17.590 --> 02:44:19.920
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a stick at a certain point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4008
02:44:19.980 --> 02:44:23.050
<v Speaker 3>it loses credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sort of just.</v>

4009
02:44:23.260 --> 02:44:26.110
<v Speaker 3>She means it means well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an important voice.</v>

4010
02:44:26.140 --> 02:44:30.130
<v Speaker 3>The problem with going hard on a person</v>
<v Speaker 3>is you're only getting one version of</v>

4011
02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:31.400
<v Speaker 3>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4012
02:44:31.410 --> 02:44:34.300
<v Speaker 3>like we're not talking about going hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a person who committed a crime.</v>

4013
02:44:34.300 --> 02:44:37.290
<v Speaker 3>You're going hard on a person that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in an interaction with two</v>

4014
02:44:37.300 --> 02:44:39.410
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I would like to see though is like</v>

4015
02:44:39.730 --> 02:44:43.600
<v Speaker 3>someone like Samantha Bee to like ask</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aziz to come on her show.</v>

4016
02:44:43.690 --> 02:44:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't do that and had him do it.</v>

4017
02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:47.440
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what I'm seeing is that we're</v>

4018
02:44:47.470 --> 02:44:49.810
<v Speaker 3>missing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be you wouldn't use already</v>

4019
02:44:49.811 --> 02:44:51.340
<v Speaker 3>attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's solid in entertainment.</v>

4020
02:44:51.430 --> 02:44:53.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that the whole point of it</v>

4021
02:44:53.650 --> 02:44:55.510
<v Speaker 3>probably hurts for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4022
02:44:55.690 --> 02:44:58.900
<v Speaker 3>as he can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can handle himself in that forum.</v>

4023
02:44:59.260 --> 02:45:02.500
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see even that.</v>

4024
02:45:02.501 --> 02:45:05.100
<v Speaker 3>I think those forums are hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4025
02:45:05.110 --> 02:45:10.110
<v Speaker 3>I did a bench Pieros podcast that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>aired yesterday and he is a Sunday</v>

4026
02:45:10.781 --> 02:45:14.920
<v Speaker 3>special thing that he does and is an</v>
<v Speaker 3>hour long and every 15 minutes he</v>

4027
02:45:14.921 --> 02:45:17.560
<v Speaker 3>stopped the conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does a commercial and while I was</v>

4028
02:45:17.561 --> 02:45:18.520
<v Speaker 3>sitting there doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4029
02:45:18.521 --> 02:45:19.450
<v Speaker 3>I really liked guy.</v>

4030
02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:22.240
<v Speaker 3>I really like talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant Guy,</v>

4031
02:45:22.540 --> 02:45:26.800
<v Speaker 3>but this is not the best way to stay</v>
<v Speaker 3>loose and have a conversation like this</v>

4032
02:45:26.940 --> 02:45:28.240
<v Speaker 3>pod catcher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get you.</v>

4033
02:45:28.300 --> 02:45:32.320
<v Speaker 3>This is the best format that says it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of conversations that we've had</v>

4034
02:45:32.321 --> 02:45:35.620
<v Speaker 3>over the past three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the best format because you just</v>

4035
02:45:35.621 --> 02:45:38.140
<v Speaker 3>talk nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing interrupts you.</v>

4036
02:45:38.141 --> 02:45:39.240
<v Speaker 3>There's no sensors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

4037
02:45:39.241 --> 02:45:40.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no thing that you have ahead of</v>

4038
02:45:40.511 --> 02:45:41.890
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please don't talk about this.</v>

4039
02:45:42.310 --> 02:45:45.700
<v Speaker 3>And also like it's best with friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4040
02:45:45.701 --> 02:45:47.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I care about you,</v>

4041
02:45:47.311 --> 02:45:48.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your friend,</v>

4042
02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:50.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have fun and there's no.</v>

4043
02:45:50.561 --> 02:45:53.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm not looking to get you to be weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>

4044
02:45:53.140 --> 02:45:53.830
<v Speaker 3>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gotcha.</v>

4045
02:45:53.830 --> 02:45:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to have fun with you.</v>

4046
02:45:55.451 --> 02:45:56.680
<v Speaker 3>And we had fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4047
02:45:56.681 --> 02:45:59.410
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like the best format to get to</v>

4048
02:45:59.411 --> 02:46:03.370
<v Speaker 3>understand people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what we're missing today in this</v>

4049
02:46:03.371 --> 02:46:05.880
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this is this is just</v>

4050
02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:10.220
<v Speaker 3>an open thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People need</v>

4051
02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:15.220
<v Speaker 1>more opportunities to be cool with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and less it take advantage of less</v>

4052
02:46:15.411 --> 02:46:19.640
<v Speaker 1>opportunities to attack each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see a lot of attacking lately and</v>

4053
02:46:19.641 --> 02:46:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attacking is because there have been</v>

4054
02:46:22.221 --> 02:46:25.580
<v Speaker 1>so many egregious crimes that need to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrected.</v>

4055
02:46:25.581 --> 02:46:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Like Harvey Weinstein or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4056
02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:30.110
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the other monsters that have</v>

4057
02:46:30.111 --> 02:46:31.850
<v Speaker 1>been out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's late.</v>

4058
02:46:32.030 --> 02:46:32.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not picking on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cute.</v>

4059
02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep texting you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4060
02:46:35.220 --> 02:46:38.120
<v Speaker 1>Your phones on your watch that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>that weird.</v>

4061
02:46:38.121 --> 02:46:41.280
<v Speaker 1>It's different all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's changing that x.</v>

4062
02:46:41.450 --> 02:46:43.820
<v Speaker 1>What happens when you hit that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hit the x and then it just goes to</v>

4063
02:46:43.821 --> 02:46:46.380
<v Speaker 1>whatever else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think somebody is listening to our</v>

4064
02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:47.650
<v Speaker 1>podcasts right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

4065
02:46:47.820 --> 02:46:49.970
<v Speaker 1>And somebody texted my girlfriend and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

4066
02:46:50.060 --> 02:46:51.440
<v Speaker 1>actually just sent me a text message</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

4067
02:46:51.440 --> 02:46:55.550
<v Speaker 1>You better not be married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that means,</v>

4068
02:46:57.040 --> 02:47:01.670
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that it all balances out.</v>

4069
02:47:01.790 --> 02:47:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I hope that it comes back around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just think,</v>

4070
02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:08.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being just be nice to each other</v>

4071
02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:12.050
<v Speaker 1>just by example is all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hard thing.</v>

4072
02:47:12.051 --> 02:47:14.900
<v Speaker 1>We have to lead by example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm saying these issues that</v>

4073
02:47:14.901 --> 02:47:17.930
<v Speaker 1>men as a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're having out here is we forgot</v>

4074
02:47:17.940 --> 02:47:20.280
<v Speaker 1>how to be gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've done.</v>

4075
02:47:20.310 --> 02:47:22.640
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if like say the disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

4076
02:47:22.641 --> 02:47:25.010
<v Speaker 1>if he had just been a gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he did.</v>

4077
02:47:25.070 --> 02:47:28.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've read that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously what I read the story,</v>

4078
02:47:28.101 --> 02:47:29.960
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to get with her,</v>

4079
02:47:30.180 --> 02:47:31.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were texting back and forth and it</v>

4080
02:47:31.881 --> 02:47:32.410
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

4081
02:47:32.410 --> 02:47:35.060
<v Speaker 1>y'all already went to dinner and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up at his place and it was,</v>

4082
02:47:35.061 --> 02:47:37.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like maybe you don't bring a</v>

4083
02:47:37.101 --> 02:47:38.630
<v Speaker 1>check that you barely know to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

4084
02:47:38.630 --> 02:47:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe there's two different types of</v>
<v Speaker 1>short.</v>

4085
02:47:41.010 --> 02:47:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're too.</v>

4086
02:47:42.860 --> 02:47:44.040
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4087
02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:45.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you heard Tony talk about it,</v>

4088
02:47:45.711 --> 02:47:47.570
<v Speaker 1>women are throwing themselves at you all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

4089
02:47:47.571 --> 02:47:50.640
<v Speaker 1>What are you supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Act like a gentleman is what I'm saying.</v>

4090
02:47:51.370 --> 02:47:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get up,</v>

4091
02:47:53.130 --> 02:47:55.300
<v Speaker 1>excuse the excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't be as like,</v>

4092
02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:57.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's like a man way to say it to.</v>

4093
02:47:57.891 --> 02:47:58.760
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4094
02:47:58.761 --> 02:48:01.580
<v Speaker 1>you've got all these hot chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of us will say no to these hot</v>

4095
02:48:01.581 --> 02:48:03.020
<v Speaker 1>chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4096
02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:03.913
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4097
02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Look at you all judgmental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a guy who had the girl come back</v>

4098
02:48:08.451 --> 02:48:09.380
<v Speaker 1>to his place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

4099
02:48:09.410 --> 02:48:11.780
<v Speaker 1>she would say no to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have.</v>

4100
02:48:11.860 --> 02:48:13.700
<v Speaker 1>That's my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have.</v>

4101
02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I should have stopped it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I let my ego get in the way.</v>

4102
02:48:16.700 --> 02:48:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I let my own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4103
02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:18.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insecurity.</v>

4104
02:48:18.351 --> 02:48:19.320
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this got really.</v>

4105

<v Speaker 1>You didn't let me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me,</v>

4106
02:48:20.151 --> 02:48:21.880
<v Speaker 1>let me go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
