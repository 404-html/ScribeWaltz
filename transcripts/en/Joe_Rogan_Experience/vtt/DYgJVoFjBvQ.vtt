<v Speaker 2>When you leave them in your stomach,</v>

51
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.910
<v Speaker 2>you know you get like a little puddle in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the summer and you leave a load in your </v>

52
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 2>belly button and it smells like dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish.</v>

53
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.540
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if you ever like jerk off and you're </v>

54
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.791
<v Speaker 2>so lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even bother cleaning off your </v>

55
00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:12.660
<v Speaker 2>balls and your balls smell like fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's happened like two or three times,</v>

56
00:03:12.661 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 2>but my balls and smelled like fish </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

57
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what I do is dry and </v>
<v Speaker 2>crusty.</v>

58
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.850
<v Speaker 2>How much moisture you're generating down</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

59
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.580
<v Speaker 2>This is what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a jungle son.</v>

60
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.440
<v Speaker 3>I got the treadmill next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hold the top of the total there and </v>

61
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.770
<v Speaker 3>the cop comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swells up like a fucking balloon.</v>

62
00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:33.771
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The toilet and opened up the gentleman </v>

63
00:03:33.771 --> 00:03:34.080
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

64
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 3>So it pays to be uncircumcised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cocks up.</v>

65
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.410
<v Speaker 3>You hold the tip when you're ready to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come and the cop comes up.</v>

66
00:03:40.411 --> 00:03:45.411
<v Speaker 3>But it swells up like a balloon and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just hold and draw that teach science </v>

67
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.960
<v Speaker 3>bitches.</v>

68
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.580
<v Speaker 2>How funny is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a common practice to cut your Dick </v>

69
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.090
<v Speaker 2>when you're born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most common thing,</v>

70
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you even talking about.</v>

71
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean he would if pussies came all </v>
<v Speaker 2>trimmed back.</v>

72
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.030
<v Speaker 2>We've pushed these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came out,</v>

73
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:04.800
<v Speaker 2>trim back and expose them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of that,</v>

74
00:04:04.801 --> 00:04:07.200
<v Speaker 2>they weren't as sensitive and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

75
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 2>We just got used to the way they looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their trim back and expose.</v>

76
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 2>We got mad at girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had Lips like it.</v>

77
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.070
<v Speaker 2>What do you have Pussy Lips for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are gross.</v>

78
00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:19.071
<v Speaker 2>I can't even see the pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all covered in his fucking pussy </v>

79
00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:19.071
<v Speaker 2>lip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of perception.</v>

80
00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:23.991
<v Speaker 2>You just get used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing that's smart about </v>

81
00:04:23.991 --> 00:04:24.500
<v Speaker 2>cutting a kid's Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you get your cut?</v>

82
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to ask me.</v>

83
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 2>What would you want it not cut right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

84
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.200
<v Speaker 2>I think that's supposed to be the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to clean your desk on my </v>

85
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.010
<v Speaker 2>team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a motherfucker raised were probably</v>

86
00:04:41.011 --> 00:04:46.011
<v Speaker 2>brainwashed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were raised to believe that you </v>

87
00:04:46.011 --> 00:04:46.011
<v Speaker 2>got like 700 isn't circumcised.</v>

88
00:04:46.011 --> 00:04:47.750
<v Speaker 2>It has a dirty deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're raised to believe.</v>

89
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's not true.</v>

90
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.330
<v Speaker 2>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fifty program that's not more mushrooms.</v>

91
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:56.270
<v Speaker 2>The highest self cleaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like a woman's.</v>

92
00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:59.580
<v Speaker 2>We just got to wash it more right </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside and I don't shake it because the</v>

93
00:04:59.581 --> 00:05:04.581
<v Speaker 2>cops are coming to some gonna smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's everybody in this room now </v>

94
00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 2>say ours is built so it just has like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gutter.</v>

95
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:08.160
<v Speaker 2>It just drips right off into your inner </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs.</v>

96
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a smart move.</v>

97
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 2>You can't argue chopping the forest can </v>
<v Speaker 2>offer.</v>

98
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.300
<v Speaker 2>That's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do lose sensitivity though.</v>

99
00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You lose a lot of sensitivity.</v>

100
00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:17.580
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to feel much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to feel better.</v>

101
00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't need help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kick your belly,</v>

102
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:23.731
<v Speaker 2>take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't need any more knowing that </v>

103
00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:25.050
<v Speaker 2>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not less sensitivity.</v>

104
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.050
<v Speaker 2>It just would feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you treat them like that?</v>

105
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.110
<v Speaker 2>More sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't necessarily mean you come </v>

106
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.110
<v Speaker 2>quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just means it feels better.</v>

107
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever used a condom on a check </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that you can last longer?</v>

108
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.950
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've never done that.</v>

109
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.040
<v Speaker 2>What about you Brian?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use a condom on my flashlight so you </v>

00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 4>There's no movie that can fuck with that</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight forever.</v>

123
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible to make a movie that's </v>

<v Speaker 4>She also had the guy pretends not to tap</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it hangs in there.</v>

130
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is gonna happen here?</v>

131
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.610

<v Speaker 4>He fucking pulled it off.</v>

133
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 4>He pulled it off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

134
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:58.110
<v Speaker 4>He.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He kept in there for five rounds and </v>

135
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.110
<v Speaker 4>getting the fuck beat out of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting taken down,</v>

136
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 4>getting punished,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting beat up.</v>

137
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.880
<v Speaker 4>Very little success on the fee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hits them a little bit,</v>

138
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:04.430
<v Speaker 4>but then it gets taken down every time </v>
<v Speaker 4>for fucking rounds.</v>

139
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:09.431
<v Speaker 4>Chael Sonnen did that shit and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>knocked him down and he knocked them </v>

140
00:07:09.431 --> 00:07:09.431
<v Speaker 4>down and people are giving them 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight rounds.</v>

141
00:07:09.431 --> 00:07:10.460
<v Speaker 4>He got some 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight rounds.</v>

142
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 4>That's rare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's rare you're going to take it round.</v>

143
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.520
<v Speaker 4>I used to argue with people at King of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the cage all the time where they were </v>

144
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 4>really back in like 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2001 there were seriously thinking about</v>

145
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.930
<v Speaker 4>making a 32nd ground rule because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>groundwork is boring and it's all about </v>

146
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.670
<v Speaker 4>putting asses in seats and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>

147
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.860
<v Speaker 4>The groundwork as bar?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you kidding me?</v>

148
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.440
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's someone getting put on a triangle</v>

149
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 4>isn't as exciting to someone getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>knocked out.</v>

150
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:38.210
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it all depends on the situation that not</v>

151
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.340
<v Speaker 4>in a prelim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one gives a fuck.</v>

152
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 4>That's what it gets knocked out in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>championship fight.</v>

153
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:45.440
<v Speaker 4>It's different and I mean it's all about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the situation.</v>

154
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:47.720
<v Speaker 4>That was Anderson Silva losing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>

155
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.450
<v Speaker 4>losing every round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting Jack.</v>

156
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.270
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's invincible.</v>

157
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:58.300
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking everybody up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was going to crush son and son and </v>

158
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.110
<v Speaker 4>does everything to everything right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Takes him down,</v>

159
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:02.960
<v Speaker 4>stays away from submissions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beat some standing,</v>

160
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 4>knocked him down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

161
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.640
<v Speaker 4>did everything right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything was perfect.</v>

162
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:13.090
<v Speaker 4>And Anderson Silva out of his ass throws</v>
<v Speaker 4>up a fucking triangle and it sticks Joe </v>

163
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 4>Rogan because Joe Rogan goes where?</v>
<v Speaker 4>As soon as the fifth round started,</v>

164
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:20.330
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's chill southern.</v>

165
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.740
<v Speaker 4>How's he going to start to celebrate?</v>

166
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.500
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

167
00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:24.790
<v Speaker 4>is it too early for celebrate?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

168
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.800
<v Speaker 4>this is through the kiss,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you catch the drama over three </v>

169
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.210
<v Speaker 4>minutes left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can never,</v>

170
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.930
<v Speaker 4>as long as he's acting thing can happen </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that guy.</v>

171
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.730
<v Speaker 4>He to knock you out in one second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can get up.</v>

172
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 4>He can get up out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You charge forward.</v>

173
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.180
<v Speaker 4>You get fucking flying kneed in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>

174
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 4>I liked Carlos Newton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that fight?</v>

175
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.820
<v Speaker 4>Carlos Newton was dominating him on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>

176
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:51.910
<v Speaker 4>He got back up to his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They restarted him because he couldn't </v>

177
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.000
<v Speaker 4>do anything on his feet and pride and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking left through the air and slammed</v>

178
00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:55.200
<v Speaker 4>Carlos Newton in the head with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>flying knee and put them away.</v>

179
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 4>He's a beast,</v>

180
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.180
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a bad mother.</v>

181
00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.190
<v Speaker 5>Anderson Silva is a</v>

182
00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.780
<v Speaker 3>skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't even break.</v>

183
00:08:59.781 --> 00:09:01.760
<v Speaker 3>He got hit 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking times.</v>

184
00:09:01.761 --> 00:09:03.920
<v Speaker 3>The skin didn't even break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that credible.</v>

185
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.780
<v Speaker 3>That's that Brazilian lizard kid he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>got.</v>

186
00:09:05.781 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted that,</v>

187
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.260
<v Speaker 3>but my grandmother went their different </v>
<v Speaker 3>directions.</v>

188
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 3>He thought guys is tough as hell talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about tough guys because I've always </v>

189
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:16.820
<v Speaker 3>liked them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard pro and con,</v>

190
00:09:16.821 --> 00:09:19.550
<v Speaker 3>but I've always liked him because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>came up to me and talked to me.</v>

191
00:09:19.551 --> 00:09:20.990
<v Speaker 3>It was very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the farm,</v>

192
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I called the farmer Matt Hughes.</v>

193
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
<v Speaker 3>I love him to death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but after last week I just want to say </v>

194
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.461
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did the remake of Chinese connection </v>

195
00:09:30.461 --> 00:09:30.461
<v Speaker 3>because he'd beat the whole fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gracie family.</v>

196
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.350
<v Speaker 3>It needs to do is wait for the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 3>to come over.</v>

197
00:09:33.351 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a handle on the lamppost.</v>

198
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.840
<v Speaker 3>And so the uncle of fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other wise voice one was the worst </v>

<v Speaker 3>Ricardo.</v>

201
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.140

262
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:08.200
<v Speaker 4>there's guys who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

263

<v Speaker 4>It's not like John e Dot d dot </v>

264
00:12:13.201 --> 00:12:15.880
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] from the part that was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy who killed him was this billionaire </v>

265
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.390
<v Speaker 4>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He slipped a bunch of paint.</v>

266
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that the rest was gay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying if some guy who was a gay</v>

267
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:21.720
<v Speaker 4>guy just wants to wrestle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just meet up.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu privates.</v>

270
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:36.210
<v Speaker 4>I think for a lot of gay dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same game as for a lot of </v>

271
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.511
<v Speaker 4>dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're looking to turn somebody that </v>

<v Speaker 4>suck their Dick.</v>

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.360
<v Speaker 4>They're looking to get some dude who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not gay to let them fuck them.</v>

279
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:03.220
<v Speaker 4>They want to turn straight guys and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know there was a guy that was working in</v>

280
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:08.310
<v Speaker 4>one of the shows I used to work on who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>working behind the scenes and he was a </v>

281
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.041
<v Speaker 4>gay dude who would tell me how many </v>
<v Speaker 4>straight guys who would get drunk and </v>

282
00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:11.220
<v Speaker 4>let them suck their Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

283
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.580
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

284
00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:14.710

<v Speaker 4>honey.</v>

285
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 4>You'd be fucking surprised.</v>

286
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:21.970
<v Speaker 3>Excel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many of these straight guys that I met </v>

287
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.281
<v Speaker 3>at a gay bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're acting straight and that's what </v>

288
00:13:25.281 --> 00:13:27.861
<v Speaker 3>it is that I met at a gay bar that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>acting straight because I haven't come </v>

289
00:13:27.861 --> 00:13:31.071
<v Speaker 3>out of the closet yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's probably a lot of guys that are </v>

290
00:13:31.071 --> 00:13:31.071
<v Speaker 3>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that hang out in that.</v>

291
00:13:31.071 --> 00:13:32.280

<v Speaker 3>These guys think it's that</v>

292
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:37.310
<v Speaker 4>or do you think there are some straight </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys who are just so silly that might </v>

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.370
<v Speaker 4>suck a dick once now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

294
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.640
<v Speaker 4>I think if you want to suck a Dick,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

<v Speaker 4>friends.</v>

297
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.120
<v Speaker 4>That's like your bisexual joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no such thing as bisexual estate</v>

<v Speaker 3>end of the night.</v>

00:16:00.851 --> 00:16:01.040
<v Speaker 3>with the kind of shit that you had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with,</v>

347
00:16:01.041 --> 00:16:03.680
<v Speaker 3>the drama that you have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were like 14 and 15?</v>

348
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.230
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine you have to go back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and do that today.</v>

349
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:08.810
<v Speaker 3>You fit right in.</v>

350
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.840
<v Speaker 3>You didn't have to change your clothes </v>
<v Speaker 3>already do it.</v>

351
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.370
<v Speaker 3>You just slide right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dated Peter Pan.</v>

352
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:20.420
<v Speaker 3>Parents hated spics needed fucking specs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get mad at you.</v>

353
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would say right in front of me,</v>

354
00:16:22.101 --> 00:16:27.101
<v Speaker 3>but the chicken was so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't give a fuck all you want the </v>

355
00:16:27.101 --> 00:16:31.510
<v Speaker 3>way out the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just knock on the door and </v>

356
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:31.510
<v Speaker 3>they'd open the door and just walk away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from me.</v>

357
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:32.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then she'll come up and then she'd go,</v>

358
00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:34.340
<v Speaker 3>fuck you mom or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut up mom.</v>

<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

360
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.940
<v Speaker 3>like 10 minutes and all of a sudden I </v>
<v Speaker 3>turned around.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The father was right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was like red in the face.</v>

362
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.350

<v Speaker 3>jeans and I just fucking went.</v>

363
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:50.460
<v Speaker 3>I never called her again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

364
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.060
<v Speaker 3>I seen him like years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her brother hated me.</v>

365
00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:55.750
<v Speaker 3>He was a fireman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they couldn't do dick to me.</v>

366
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:56.450
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

367
00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:02.790
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ever get caught bone in your </v>

368
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.830

<v Speaker 4>She stayed for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I passed fucking out the closet.</v>

377
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.960
<v Speaker 4>If you were snoring in the closet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how they caught you.</v>

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.210
<v Speaker 4>The cost and there you are naked with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>condom on.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Condom was stuck in my leg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Motherfucker is in the closet and he can</v>

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:45.040
<v Speaker 4>condom on and he got busted.</v>

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.130
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is it?</v>

384
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.320
<v Speaker 4>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might be the worst way to meet </v>

385
00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.820
<v Speaker 4>your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your girlfriend's dad if he wakes you up</v>

386
00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:03.350
<v Speaker 4>because you're snoring because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>naked in the closet with a condom on.</v>

387
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:09.690
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend who just got arrested </v>

388
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.270
<v Speaker 4>because he found his 15 year old </v>
<v Speaker 4>daughter and her boyfriend having sex in</v>

389
00:18:12.271 --> 00:18:14.290
<v Speaker 4>the garage and he beat the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the go.</v>

390
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.930
<v Speaker 4>You told me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

391
00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.450
<v Speaker 4>You told him that I know a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a friend.</v>

392
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:23.280
<v Speaker 4>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kids are kids are going to do it.</v>

393
00:18:23.281 --> 00:18:28.281
<v Speaker 4>Kids are gonna do man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you be so you think you could have</v>

394
00:18:28.651 --> 00:18:31.650
<v Speaker 4>sympathy on a guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His daughter's getting banged.</v>

395
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:36.730
<v Speaker 4>The real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real problem with men and women is </v>

396
00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.141
<v Speaker 4>that a lot of kids grow up in an </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment with their mother and their </v>

397
00:18:39.141 --> 00:18:39.141
<v Speaker 4>father don't get along and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

398
00:18:39.141 --> 00:18:41.790
<v Speaker 4>they're volatile and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting and yelling and so that's their</v>

399
00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:44.070
<v Speaker 4>model of what a relationship should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>light.</v>

400
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.660
<v Speaker 4>And if you grow up in a happy household </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everybody's cool and everybody,</v>

401
00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:53.661
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's like friendly with each </v>

402
00:18:53.661 --> 00:18:53.661
<v Speaker 4>other and that's what you associate with</v>
<v Speaker 4>human behavior with.</v>

403
00:18:53.661 --> 00:18:55.500
<v Speaker 4>Then that's the type of person you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>with your daughter.</v>

404
00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:57.240
<v Speaker 4>That's the type of girl you want with </v>
<v Speaker 4>your son.</v>

405
00:18:57.241 --> 00:19:02.241
<v Speaker 4>You don't want no crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is that most people </v>

406
00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:02.580
<v Speaker 4>aren't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people a fucking wreck,</v>

407
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:07.850
<v Speaker 4>so the real problem with some kid coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>over and wanting to finger banged your </v>

408
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:08.860
<v Speaker 4>daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't that your daughter shouldn't enjoy</v>

409
00:19:08.861 --> 00:19:10.260
<v Speaker 4>a good finger banging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

410
00:19:10.261 --> 00:19:13.470
<v Speaker 4>this kid might be a fucking creep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you have to worry about.</v>

411
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.250
<v Speaker 4>What people have to worry about is how </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people are raising their kids.</v>

412
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:18.750
<v Speaker 4>You have to worry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to worry.</v>

413
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:21.230
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are completely ignoring their kids.</v>

414
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.250
<v Speaker 4>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before he beat that get up,</v>

415
00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:28.251
<v Speaker 4>you should have stopped him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what kind of a house full of abuse </v>

416
00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:31.371
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want some kid growing up in a </v>

417
00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:31.371
<v Speaker 4>house full of abuse finger and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>daughters.</v>

418
00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:31.620
<v Speaker 4>That's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a normal reaction,</v>

419
00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:36.621
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden you walk in on your </v>

420
00:19:36.621 --> 00:19:37.580
<v Speaker 4>daughter have done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not normal and hold them up.</v>

421
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.930
<v Speaker 4>If you look at your daughter wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it,</v>

422
00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:43.250
<v Speaker 4>if she wanted to do it and he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it is absolutely not right that you'd</v>

423
00:19:43.251 --> 00:19:43.890
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

424
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:44.760
<v Speaker 4>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Way.</v>

425
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:45.720
<v Speaker 4>You have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

426
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.370
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is irresponsible.</v>

427
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.910

<v Speaker 4>You have to be wearing protection.</v>

428

<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't be doing this so young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

429
00:19:53.101 --> 00:19:58.101

<v Speaker 4>the garage.</v>

431
00:19:58.101 --> 00:19:59.520

<v Speaker 4>Is Everybody happy?</v>

432
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.200
<v Speaker 4>That's what the conversation you have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>

433
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.100
<v Speaker 4>If the girl was crying and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You can't beat the kid up because that's</v>

438
00:20:12.781 --> 00:20:13.410
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

439
00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:17.450
<v Speaker 4>It's a kid too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to remember that's a big manner,</v>

440
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.360
<v Speaker 4>so why to beat him up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>His brain's not big.</v>

441
00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.120
<v Speaker 4>He's just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's what you want to do all the time.</v>

442
00:20:24.121 --> 00:20:25.560
<v Speaker 4>It's what everybody wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

443
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.580
<v Speaker 4>let me tell you something guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it comes to daughters or wives,</v>

444
00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.730
<v Speaker 4>it's all fucking different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not in that room,</v>

445
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.480
<v Speaker 4>so wipe the slate right now when it </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to the daughters and wives.</v>

446
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.130
<v Speaker 4>It's a whole different animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gentlemen.</v>

447
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.860
<v Speaker 4>So relaxed with that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying isn't wise?</v>

448
00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:46.890
<v Speaker 4>It's a duplicate shotgun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you should look if the guy's hurting</v>

449
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.990
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he's hurting your daughter,</v>

450
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:51.790
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if your daughter's liking it,</v>

451
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.770
<v Speaker 2>your daughter shouldn't be able to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>

452
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

453
00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.440
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying is right.</v>

454
00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:02.230
<v Speaker 2>When the animal instincts take over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to real animal instincts,</v>

455
00:21:02.231 --> 00:21:04.240
<v Speaker 2>those should be about disrespect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

456
00:21:04.241 --> 00:21:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disrespect about disrespect.</v>

457
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:12.420
<v Speaker 2>If you were the 15 year old kid and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>got caught banging his daughter and he </v>

458
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.780
<v Speaker 2>walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you be terrified?</v>

459
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of movies,</v>

460
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.870
<v Speaker 2>because the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because guys have no.</v>

461
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:26.930
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of natural instincts of born.</v>

462
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Thinking that the whole time from when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a kid.</v>

463
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Don't think it's a thinking thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

464
00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:34.210
<v Speaker 2>I think that's an animal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what I'm saying.</v>

465
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.970
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're born thinking that takes over</v>

466
00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:44.140
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why men have such a huge problem </v>

467
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:44.140
<v Speaker 3>with men like grown men having sex with </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 14,</v>

468

<v Speaker 3>girls like that.</v>

471
00:21:49.511 --> 00:21:54.511
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is one of the most disturbing </v>

472
00:21:54.511 --> 00:21:54.610
<v Speaker 3>things in one of the things that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the least acceptable.</v>

473
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.640
<v Speaker 3>Least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the least likely to be </v>

474
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.551
<v Speaker 3>forgiven.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's probably how lesbians are </v>

574
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.490
<v Speaker 5>created.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When it's not natural,</v>

575
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.651
<v Speaker 5>that's probably how you create them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get the father to get you to try to </v>

576
00:26:19.651 --> 00:26:21.680
<v Speaker 5>fuck his friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's probably formula.</v>

577
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:26.820
<v Speaker 5>That's the best way to have a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Completely distrust men for the rest of </v>

578
00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:26.820
<v Speaker 5>her life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just get.</v>

579
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.250
<v Speaker 5>Get your daughter to fuck your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get your daughter.</v>

580
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.480
<v Speaker 5>Fuck your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

581
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.230
<v Speaker 5>She's just going to try to rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How's she going to rebel?</v>

582
00:26:35.231 --> 00:26:36.040
<v Speaker 5>It's going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's go.</v>

583
00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.950
<v Speaker 5>That's the only move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you've got to check my father in law,</v>

584
00:26:38.951 --> 00:26:41.410
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a great father in law.</v>

585
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 5>He's the one that bailed me out of jail </v>
<v Speaker 5>the first time.</v>

586
00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:46.830
<v Speaker 5>We were like shaky when I got in </v>
<v Speaker 5>trouble.</v>

587
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.380
<v Speaker 5>Then all of a sudden he was definitely.</v>

588
00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.520
<v Speaker 5>There was a weird relationship because </v>
<v Speaker 5>he had boys,</v>

589
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.940
<v Speaker 5>but he was kind of upset how his boys </v>
<v Speaker 5>had turned that they turned into </v>

590
00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:55.940
<v Speaker 5>pussies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

591
00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.510
<v Speaker 5>Will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wanted them to be very educated.</v>

592
00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:00.360
<v Speaker 5>They didn't want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he was kind of upset with them.</v>

593
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:01.650
<v Speaker 5>In a way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't understand,</v>

594
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:03.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I think you told me this,</v>

595
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:03.750
<v Speaker 5>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

596
00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:05.520
<v Speaker 5>He was very upset with them and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were successful.</v>

597
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.860
<v Speaker 5>This roofing company,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

598
00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:10.480
<v Speaker 5>to read different states,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he just wasn't into that stuff.</v>

599
00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:13.440
<v Speaker 5>So we're always going to be weird when </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone's fucking your baby,</v>

600
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all my relationships in high school when</v>

601
00:27:16.561 --> 00:27:21.561
<v Speaker 5>I was dating a girl and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as soon as the parents knew or bone and </v>

602
00:27:21.561 --> 00:27:21.990
<v Speaker 5>it was always creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'd be around them like you're stealing</v>

603
00:27:21.991 --> 00:27:23.360
<v Speaker 5>food from them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

604
00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.280
<v Speaker 5>it's like just filled.</v>

605
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.480
<v Speaker 7>I had my parents walk in and my dad </v>
<v Speaker 7>walked in and my step mom walk into was </v>

606
00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.520

<v Speaker 7>step mom got pissed.</v>

607

<v Speaker 5>Like she couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she couldn't come over my house and be </v>

612
00:27:43.131 --> 00:27:43.131
<v Speaker 5>in my bedroom with the door closed.</v>

613
00:27:43.131 --> 00:27:45.050
<v Speaker 7>All right mom,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just get the fuck outta here.</v>

615
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:52.190
<v Speaker 7>this other girl I dated,</v>
<v Speaker 7>her parents let me spend the night when </v>

616
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:55.091
<v Speaker 7>I was 16 sleep in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She would wake up the next morning time </v>

617
00:27:55.091 --> 00:27:58.751
<v Speaker 7>to wake up school bus or whatever time </v>
<v Speaker 7>to wake up to go to school and I just </v>

618
00:27:58.751 --> 00:28:01.870
<v Speaker 7>remember looking up and seeing her dad </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I never thought it was crazy and my </v>

619
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:02.460
<v Speaker 7>parents knew I would stay tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but now I look back at it.</v>

620
00:28:02.461 --> 00:28:03.680
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's fucking weird.</v>

621
00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.230
<v Speaker 7>The only time it happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was 21.</v>

622
00:28:06.231 --> 00:28:08.930
<v Speaker 7>She was 17,</v>
<v Speaker 7>was my girlfriend for about three years.</v>

623
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.810
<v Speaker 7>She.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She was 17 million.</v>

624
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.110
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know what you mean.</v>

625
00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:17.140
<v Speaker 7>18 right now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we didn't have sex at 17 when she </v>

626
00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:17.140
<v Speaker 7>was 17.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When she turned 18,</v>

627
00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.160
<v Speaker 7>that's when the SEC started.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was just like a month later.</v>

628
00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:24.270
<v Speaker 7>You're not under Clinton definitions so </v>
<v Speaker 7>that when you're just pen pals before </v>

629
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:24.270
<v Speaker 7>you know.</v>

630
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:29.110
<v Speaker 7>I didn't even think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't even think about 21 slash 17.</v>

631
00:28:29.571 --> 00:28:34.340
<v Speaker 7>That didn't even enter my mind at all at</v>
<v Speaker 7>our parents were totally cool with it.</v>

632
00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.470
<v Speaker 7>She,</v>
<v Speaker 7>their parents let me spend the night.</v>

633
00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:41.860
<v Speaker 7>They were totally cool in the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>unless you're an Iowa where you're now </v>

634
00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.651
<v Speaker 7>allowed to be 16 to be a stripper,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the only law is you have to come </v>

<v Speaker 7>home before 11:00</v>

766
00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.330

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.830
<v Speaker 5>you remember that band live and other </v>
<v Speaker 5>live.</v>

768
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:30.370
<v Speaker 5>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an article that I was reading about how </v>

769
00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.340
<v Speaker 5>they broke up and about how the singer </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted all the money.</v>

770
00:37:31.341 --> 00:37:36.341
<v Speaker 5>He wanted them to sign off all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights to the songs and everything to </v>

771
00:37:36.341 --> 00:37:39.941
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who was right or who was </v>

772
00:37:39.941 --> 00:37:41.471
<v Speaker 5>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was looking at that and I was </v>

773
00:37:41.471 --> 00:37:42.230
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how fucking hard is it to make it in the</v>

774
00:37:42.231 --> 00:37:45.770
<v Speaker 5>music business?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that the hardest thing in all of show</v>

775
00:37:45.771 --> 00:37:47.270
<v Speaker 5>business?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it is,</v>

776
00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.340
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think that's the hardest thing?</v>

777
00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:54.180

<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

780
00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:00.380
<v Speaker 7>sometimes it just depends on how good </v>
<v Speaker 7>you are.</v>

781
00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:05.450
<v Speaker 7>It's a good product.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you have persistence and you keep </v>

782
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:09.721
<v Speaker 7>pushing if you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but some people will never get the good </v>

00:51:51.761 --> 00:51:51.761
<v Speaker 4>doesn't do it as much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you know,</v>

1037
00:51:51.761 --> 00:51:56.621
<v Speaker 4>there's this new thing where you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>choose if you want the at replies are </v>

1038
00:51:56.621 --> 00:51:56.621
<v Speaker 4>not on each profile.</v>

1039
00:51:56.621 --> 00:51:56.900
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1040
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:59.900
<v Speaker 4>Twitter on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you use twitter on the website now if</v>

1041
00:51:59.901 --> 00:52:04.901
<v Speaker 4>you go to their profile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this little logo you can click </v>

1042
00:52:04.901 --> 00:52:05.750
<v Speaker 4>on and say show at replies or turn it on</v>
<v Speaker 4>or off.</v>

1043
00:52:05.751 --> 00:52:09.590
<v Speaker 4>So his problem was is he was replying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these fucking people and it was just</v>

1044
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:14.650
<v Speaker 4>clogging up my twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But now I have this little button I </v>

1045
00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:14.650
<v Speaker 4>pushed and I don't get any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1046
00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:17.380
<v Speaker 4>Well I don't mind it when people spam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let them talk to you.</v>

1047
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:20.150
<v Speaker 4>Like a who?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whose tweets to enjoy.</v>

1048
00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.120
<v Speaker 4>I Love Kevin Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I want one of the reasons why</v>

1049
00:52:23.121 --> 00:52:24.180
<v Speaker 4>I brought it up because he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1050
00:52:24.181 --> 00:52:25.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1051
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:26.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I liked how he talks to people,</v>

1052
00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said Anthony Kumina from opiod.</v>

1053
00:52:29.691 --> 00:52:30.710
<v Speaker 4>Anthony didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1054
00:52:30.711 --> 00:52:32.240
<v Speaker 4>he's always fucking replying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

1055
00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.610
<v Speaker 4>Like he tweets too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was like,</v>

1056
00:52:34.611 --> 00:52:36.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't bother me.</v>

1057
00:52:36.111 --> 00:52:38.540
<v Speaker 4>I can look over that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are so impatient,</v>

1058
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:40.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't look over,</v>

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:44.990
<v Speaker 4>seven lines of texts and just scroll </v>
<v Speaker 4>down the annoys you that much.</v>

1061
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:47.060
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes people end up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's cogs,</v>

1062
00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:52.090

<v Speaker 4>it would be the whole page and then you </v>

1063
00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:52.320
<v Speaker 4>have to go to the second page and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1064
00:52:52.321 --> 00:52:54.170
<v Speaker 4>isn't that hard to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's annoying.</v>

1065
00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:54.720
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why.</v>

1066
00:52:54.721 --> 00:52:55.730

<v Speaker 4>why is this guy spamming and does it </v>

<v Speaker 4>every now and then for like a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes.</v>

1070
00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:07.100
<v Speaker 4>Does he do it too much?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Slow down,</v>

1071
00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:08.580
<v Speaker 4>slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no.</v>

1072
00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.620

<v Speaker 4>but now it doesn't bother me because you</v>

1073
00:53:10.621 --> 00:53:12.170
<v Speaker 4>can turn it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I follow him,</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's the most entertaining thing to </v>
<v Speaker 5>listen to on the radio.</v>

1108
00:54:35.541 --> 00:54:40.541
<v Speaker 5>But people get tired of listening to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>radio and that satellite radio came </v>

<v Speaker 5>along and so much freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So commercials kill.</v>

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:13.420
<v Speaker 5>They get this off of a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>different things.</v>

<v Speaker 5>successful.</v>

1127
00:55:21.941 --> 00:55:24.040

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:12.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it takes to do that.</v>

1151
00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:15.950
<v Speaker 3>He said he can take bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever stood in there with junior</v>

1152
00:56:15.951 --> 00:56:20.951
<v Speaker 3>dos Santos for three rounds like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think we get to the point where he </v>

1153
00:56:20.951 --> 00:56:22.080
<v Speaker 3>just snaps and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>

1154
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to watch my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get in</v>

1155
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.360
<v Speaker 4>great shape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go down a two.</v>

1156
00:56:25.361 --> 00:56:27.910
<v Speaker 4>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How you think that'll with those punches</v>

1157
00:56:27.911 --> 00:56:32.911
<v Speaker 4>to the head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he might be able to move faster away </v>

1158
00:56:32.911 --> 00:56:32.911
<v Speaker 4>from him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1159
00:56:32.911 --> 00:56:34.120
<v Speaker 4>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would definitely be.</v>

1160
00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:39.130
<v Speaker 4>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way to a champion to be a </v>

1161
00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:42.181
<v Speaker 4>champion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have to be in the best shape of your </v>

1162
00:56:42.181 --> 00:56:43.651
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's obviously not in the best shape of </v>

1163
00:56:43.651 --> 00:56:45.691
<v Speaker 4>his life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know he likes to eat and all that </v>

1164
00:56:45.691 --> 00:56:47.311
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm thinking something's eventually </v>

1165
00:56:47.311 --> 00:56:47.710
<v Speaker 4>will make them snap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll get shredded.</v>

1166
00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.930
<v Speaker 4>He'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll be training like a fucking home.</v>

1167
00:56:49.931 --> 00:56:54.931
<v Speaker 4>So I think of Roy Nelson was really in </v>
<v Speaker 4>shape and in shape or bad motherfucker </v>

1168
00:56:55.181 --> 00:56:55.740
<v Speaker 4>two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh five.</v>

1169
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:58.150
<v Speaker 4>He would crush.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got some serious knockout power.</v>

1170
00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.280
<v Speaker 4>Let's just is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu's awesome.</v>

1171
00:57:00.281 --> 00:57:03.250
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1172
00:57:03.251 --> 00:57:05.430
<v Speaker 4>he's not afraid to fight and he can.</v>

1173
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 4>He just needs to get in shape and enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the belly.</v>

1174
00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:14.790
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now what about my job is kind of cool </v>

1175
00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:16.320
<v Speaker 4>about when that fucking big belly </v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker knocks essentially.</v>

1176
00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:22.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm a huge fan of right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I would just like to see him </v>

1177
00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:22.050
<v Speaker 4>shredded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my boy.</v>

1178
00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:24.520
<v Speaker 4>Roy Rogers Nelson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that Roy Rogers,</v>

1179
00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:28.240
<v Speaker 4>Roy Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roy Rogers,</v>

1180
00:57:28.241 --> 00:57:33.241
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there any news on cro cop at all use </v>

1181
00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:35.740
<v Speaker 4>on cro cop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where'd that come from?</v>

1182
00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:38.560
<v Speaker 4>The chat room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't listen to them.</v>

1183
00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:40.460
<v Speaker 4>Those people are looking for a UFC </v>
<v Speaker 4>questions.</v>

1184
00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.390

<v Speaker 4>When you got a question for both of you </v>

1186
00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:52.330
<v Speaker 4>guys in the rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you think it'll go down?</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm interested in seeing </v>

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:03.310

<v Speaker 4>Anderson.</v>

1192
00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.620
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

1193
00:58:05.621 --> 00:58:08.230
<v Speaker 4>A rematch for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I would still love to see,</v>

1194
00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:09.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause it was such a close fight.</v>

1195
00:58:09.641 --> 00:58:11.950
<v Speaker 4>But the reality is an interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1196
00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:13.990
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did tap him and won convincingly,</v>

1197
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:19.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the fight is an interesting </v>

1198
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.390
<v Speaker 4>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1199
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:21.210
<v Speaker 4>I think I'd like to see that next.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about you?</v>

1200
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.760
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to see a rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either one would be fine with me.</v>

1201
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:26.380
<v Speaker 4>I'd be fine with the rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love,</v>

1202
00:58:26.381 --> 00:58:29.350
<v Speaker 4>I would love to see a rematch and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would love to see the or fight.</v>

1203
00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 4>I would like to see him against a </v>
<v Speaker 4>different guy.</v>

1204
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think we have Anderson for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1205
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:38.430
<v Speaker 4>only a certain amount of fights more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to make sure that the fight </v>

1206
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:41.341
<v Speaker 4>actually does happen and if it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they set it up now it can actually </v>

1207
00:58:41.341 --> 00:58:41.380
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a big fight.</v>

1208
00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:44.980
<v Speaker 4>If Dana decided to go with Silva son and</v>
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>

1209
00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:49.030
<v Speaker 4>how do you think that would go down?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think so would fuck them up quicker.</v>

1210
00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:51.040
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

1211
00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:56.250
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe now he really worked at me like I </v>

1212
00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:57.760
<v Speaker 3>was telling jody and I the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you predicted all this shit and the last</v>

1213
00:58:57.761 --> 00:59:00.560
<v Speaker 3>two big fights they will onboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1214
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:03.490
<v Speaker 3>fader and this guy went down at the last</v>
<v Speaker 3>minute.</v>

1215
00:59:03.491 --> 00:59:08.491
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the only sport that if you </v>

1216
00:59:08.491 --> 00:59:10.351
<v Speaker 3>really watch UFC for a new watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the evolution and the vows so </v>

1217
00:59:11.021 --> 00:59:16.021
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like baseball where they had </v>

1218
00:59:16.021 --> 00:59:16.390
<v Speaker 3>like Sam gloves and 2000 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1219
00:59:16.391 --> 00:59:19.900
<v Speaker 3>it's evolved so much and these files </v>
<v Speaker 3>that a top level fighters,</v>

1220
00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.300
<v Speaker 3>they evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolve</v>

1221
00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:27.320
<v Speaker 5>also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the only way to stay at the top </v>

1222
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:27.320
<v Speaker 5>level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1223
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:27.320
<v Speaker 5>as we evolve also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

1224
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:27.680
<v Speaker 5>And Silva,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1225
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:32.770
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody keeps saying he pulled this </v>

1226
00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:32.770
<v Speaker 5>out of his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1227
00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:32.770
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he didn't pull it out,</v>

1228
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:37.930
<v Speaker 5>pull it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was asked this guy pull triangles out </v>

1229
00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:37.930
<v Speaker 5>of your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You pull punches.</v>

1230
00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:39.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you wing a wild punch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy runs into it and you're like,</v>

1231
00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:41.360
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the odds are that landed that I</v>

1232
00:59:41.361 --> 00:59:43.250
<v Speaker 5>could see being kind of wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's still,</v>

1233
00:59:43.251 --> 00:59:48.251
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you were intending to punch the </v>

1234
00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:48.260
<v Speaker 5>guy in the face if you intend to punch </v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy in the face and you do.</v>

1235
00:59:48.261 --> 00:59:50.750
<v Speaker 5>How has that lucky not lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's silly.</v>

1236
00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:56.140
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not like just because you got </v>

1237
00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:56.140
<v Speaker 5>caught and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't say,</v>

1238
00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:56.140
<v Speaker 5>oh he got you with a lucky punch.</v>

1239
00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:56.590
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he fucking punched you in there.</v>

1240
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:58.910
<v Speaker 5>He wanted to punch you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what he did.</v>

1241
00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:02.540
<v Speaker 5>Like I was at Lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lucky triangle.</v>

1242
01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:07.640
<v Speaker 5>Get over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they start to use either one of the </v>

1243
01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:07.640
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the gracies,</v>

1244
01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:11.740
<v Speaker 5>their point was to to go Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it gets any other style to prove to the </v>

1245
01:00:11.751 --> 01:00:16.751
<v Speaker 5>world at Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could go up against any other style and </v>

1246
01:00:16.751 --> 01:00:17.810
<v Speaker 5>that night that really came to fruition </v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

1247
01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.020
<v Speaker 5>but it was disproven in the fight </v>
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>

1248
01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:24.950
<v Speaker 5>See what was important was that Anderson</v>
<v Speaker 5>was able to do something when he got put</v>

1249
01:00:24.951 --> 01:00:27.050
<v Speaker 5>in a bad situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But look at Damien Maia,</v>

1250
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:32.320
<v Speaker 5>when Damien.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mine was trying to get ahold of </v>

1251
01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.770
<v Speaker 5>androgens and Jujitsu certainly wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>the answer because he needed to be able </v>

1252
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:36.941
<v Speaker 5>to close the distance and get a takedown</v>
<v Speaker 5>until he gets that take down his </v>

1253
01:00:36.941 --> 01:00:38.570
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu's it's worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was,</v>

1254
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.070
<v Speaker 5>that's what we saw in that fight.</v>

1255
01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:41.870
<v Speaker 5>But what we saw with a killer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Anderson,</v>

1256
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:47.140
<v Speaker 5>a guy who's such a killer striker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got to be dangerous off his back </v>

1257
01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:47.140
<v Speaker 5>and that's one of the beautiful things </v>
<v Speaker 5>about Anderson.</v>

1258
01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:52.031
<v Speaker 5>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I grabbed because I grabbed </v>

1259
01:00:52.031 --> 01:00:54.491
<v Speaker 5>the good and the bad child.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Southern is a bad motherfucker and I </v>

1260
01:00:54.491 --> 01:00:54.491
<v Speaker 5>applaud your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were there.</v>

1261
01:00:54.491 --> 01:00:55.590
<v Speaker 5>They're all nice and cute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He left there,</v>

1262
01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.600
<v Speaker 5>looked like Eddie Munster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like everyone gets ugly and </v>

1263
01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:00.600
<v Speaker 5>everybody fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

1264
01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.010

<v Speaker 5>I was impressed.</v>

1265
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:05.810
<v Speaker 5>He was right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love to see that rematch.</v>

1266
01:01:05.811 --> 01:01:07.730
<v Speaker 5>I would not be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would not be sad either way.</v>

1267
01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:10.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean I would not be upset one way or </v>
<v Speaker 5>another,</v>

1268
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:11.570
<v Speaker 5>either one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm really looking forward to.</v>

1269
01:01:11.571 --> 01:01:15.290
<v Speaker 5>I just thought that while Anderson is </v>
<v Speaker 5>young or relatively young man,</v>

1270
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many more years he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to want to do this.</v>

1271
01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:18.920
<v Speaker 5>I want to see him fight all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1272
01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:20.840
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to see him fight Hector Lombard.</v>

1273
01:01:20.841 --> 01:01:22.940
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to see him fight some interesting</v>

1274
01:01:22.941 --> 01:01:24.970
<v Speaker 5>dudes who were finding another place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jon Jones,</v>

1275
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:27.360
<v Speaker 5>Jon Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jon Jones up to five.</v>

1276
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:28.990
<v Speaker 5>That's the one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>

1277
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.620
<v Speaker 5>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>While we are writing from this and I,</v>

1278
01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:36.621
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a problem with the child </v>

1279
01:01:36.621 --> 01:01:36.621
<v Speaker 5>center rematch if they decide to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1280
01:01:36.621 --> 01:01:36.621
<v Speaker 5>I would love that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Either one.</v>

1281
01:01:36.621 --> 01:01:38.530
<v Speaker 5>Either one is good jail southern Jon </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jones.</v>

1282
01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.590
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we get so far the live ramp,</v>

1283
01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.440
<v Speaker 5>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Charlson is not fine at two.</v>

1284
01:01:45.441 --> 01:01:47.240
<v Speaker 5>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's always one 85.</v>

1285
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:49.880
<v Speaker 5>I mean I guess he could go up but he </v>
<v Speaker 5>never has before.</v>

1286
01:01:49.881 --> 01:01:51.980
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean maybe it was earlier.</v>

1287
01:01:51.981 --> 01:01:52.370
<v Speaker 5>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two,</v>

1288
01:01:52.371 --> 01:01:53.000
<v Speaker 5>two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh five.</v>

1289
01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember them though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was fighting into wc one 85.</v>

1290
01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:02.140
<v Speaker 5>So Wec one 85 and UFC one 85.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's ever Ms Dot Wade </v>

1291
01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.030
<v Speaker 5>because he missed weight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that I can.</v>

1292
01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:09.210
<v Speaker 5>So there's no reason to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean Anderson like had some fights at </v>

1293
01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:09.210
<v Speaker 5>two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>five.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like to go up there.</v>

1295
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:12.700
<v Speaker 5>I guess jail could do it too though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You probably walked around pretty heavy,</v>

1296
01:02:12.701 --> 01:02:12.940
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1297
01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:17.470
<v Speaker 5>Jon Jones is a scary motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

1298
01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:19.410
<v Speaker 5>That's a scary though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just got them.</v>

1299
01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:24.460
<v Speaker 5>They're in a cage right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me know when they going to let them </v>

1300
01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:24.460
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They might let them out on new years.</v>

1301
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.460
<v Speaker 5>They might let them out for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Thanksgiving thing.</v>

1302
01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:31.490
<v Speaker 5>They don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just give him a title shot right </v>

1303
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:31.490
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as possible.</v>

1304
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:34.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why I fuck around because </v>
<v Speaker 5>he wants to develop.</v>

1305
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:36.900
<v Speaker 5>He wants to be the greatest of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wants.</v>

1306
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:39.030
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't want a title shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you're saying?</v>

1307
01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:40.020
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't want a title shot.</v>

1308
01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:42.570
<v Speaker 5>You Know Greg Jackson is the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 5>guides him.</v>

1309
01:02:42.571 --> 01:02:43.160
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gary?</v>

1310
01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:48.180
<v Speaker 5>Greg Jackson said to me that what he </v>
<v Speaker 5>wants to do is make sure that he's </v>

1311
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:51.111
<v Speaker 5>tested before he fights for the title.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wants him to really be tested and </v>

1312
01:02:51.111 --> 01:02:51.200
<v Speaker 5>really to get worn on.</v>

1313
01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:56.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Greg Jackson's a smart man and he got </v>

1314
01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:56.440
<v Speaker 5>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He got tested.</v>

1315
01:02:56.450 --> 01:03:00.140
<v Speaker 5>He ran through brandon that he did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did Vladimir.</v>

1316
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:01.800
<v Speaker 5>Those are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are some tests,</v>

1317
01:03:01.801 --> 01:03:06.801
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Buddy hasn't been put in an adverse </v>

1318
01:03:06.801 --> 01:03:08.751
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what he's good because he's </v>

1319
01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:08.751
<v Speaker 5>bright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he wants to set them up with someone</v>

1320
01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.750
<v Speaker 5>who may test them.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he might be able to win the </v>

1325
01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:22.200
<v Speaker 5>title.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good to.</v>

1426
01:07:29.090 --> 01:07:32.860
<v Speaker 4>Steve Mcqueen is always an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy looking at San Francisco and</v>

1427
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:33.380
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1428
01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:34.290
<v Speaker 5>in the 19,</v>
<v Speaker 5>60,</v>

1429
01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.210
<v Speaker 5>19,</v>
<v Speaker 5>68,</v>

1430
01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:36.770
<v Speaker 5>there's nobody on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1431
01:07:36.771 --> 01:07:39.320
<v Speaker 5>you just driving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's easier on the highway.</v>

1432
01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:40.830
<v Speaker 5>You just drive and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>straighten.</v>

1433
01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:42.300
<v Speaker 5>Just driving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1434
01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:47.320
<v Speaker 5>Realize how much the population has </v>
<v Speaker 5>increased until you watch like a movie </v>

1435
01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.801
<v Speaker 5>from the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He still like New York Street in New </v>

1436
01:07:50.801 --> 01:07:50.801
<v Speaker 5>York in the 19 fifties movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Hustler.</v>

1437
01:07:50.801 --> 01:07:53.270
<v Speaker 5>There's not too many cars and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just driving around.</v>

1438
01:07:53.271 --> 01:07:58.271
<v Speaker 5>No problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we just take it for granted that </v>

1439
01:07:58.271 --> 01:07:58.640
<v Speaker 5>anywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's gonna be a city,</v>

1440
01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:00.180
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be too many people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>too many cars.</v>

1441
01:08:00.181 --> 01:08:01.100
<v Speaker 5>You're not gonna be able to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>anywhere.</v>

1442
01:08:01.101 --> 01:08:04.130
<v Speaker 5>But at one point in time that wasn't the</v>
<v Speaker 5>case when they first made cities.</v>

1443
01:08:04.131 --> 01:08:06.470
<v Speaker 5>Like why would everybody lived together </v>
<v Speaker 5>in this one thing?</v>

1444
01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:11.590
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because when there's not that many </v>

1445
01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:11.590
<v Speaker 5>people and you can drive around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really pretty fucking cool.</v>

1446
01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:13.640
<v Speaker 5>New York City with no traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be the shit.</v>

1447
01:08:13.930 --> 01:08:16.580
<v Speaker 5>The drop boring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate to be boring,</v>

1448
01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:19.130
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would it be boring?</v>

1449
01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:21.540
<v Speaker 5>That wouldn't be that many people will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can use.</v>

1450
01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.530
<v Speaker 5>There would still be plenty of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're still gonna have some traffic.</v>

1451
01:08:24.531 --> 01:08:26.810
<v Speaker 5>You're just not going to have the kind </v>
<v Speaker 5>of traffic that you have now or it takes</v>

1452
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:31.811
<v Speaker 5>you half an hour to get across town.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At least you know it can take you hours </v>

1453
01:08:31.811 --> 01:08:32.120
<v Speaker 5>to get around New York when it's around </v>
<v Speaker 5>rush hour.</v>

1454
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:33.920
<v Speaker 5>It can take you forever to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the city,</v>

1455
01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get to long island to get the fuck.</v>

1456
01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.410
<v Speaker 5>It's a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's too many fucking people.</v>

1457
01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.920
<v Speaker 5>I sway people as an ongoing subject in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this podcast.</v>

1458
01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.930
<v Speaker 5>There's no answers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the unfortunate problem.</v>

1459
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:50.000
<v Speaker 5>Answers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just happened to move out of la or a </v>

1460
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:50.000
<v Speaker 5>big cities and Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ohio.</v>

1461
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:50.960
<v Speaker 5>It was always one mile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one minute or better.</v>

1462
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:55.910
<v Speaker 5>Here it's like 15 minutes per mile is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the average or something retarded,</v>

1463
01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.730
<v Speaker 5>but people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's be honest,</v>

1464
01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.920
<v Speaker 5>it's more fun here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1465
01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.120
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the weather's better.</v>

1466
01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:06.680
<v Speaker 5>The weather's better for what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's better here by other people.</v>

1467
01:09:06.681 --> 01:09:08.870
<v Speaker 5>Wines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You run into more interesting people out</v>

1468
01:09:08.871 --> 01:09:12.200
<v Speaker 5>here that you don't hang out with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Retards that like any city,</v>

1469
01:09:12.201 --> 01:09:17.201
<v Speaker 5>there's cool people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you've met some of my friends from </v>

1470
01:09:17.201 --> 01:09:17.201
<v Speaker 5>Columbus if you know we all hung out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1471
01:09:17.201 --> 01:09:18.410
<v Speaker 5>All Nice guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1472
01:09:18.411 --> 01:09:19.460
<v Speaker 5>they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Earth people.</v>

1473
01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:22.400
<v Speaker 5>So where do you think is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't you think like there's certain</v>

1474
01:09:22.401 --> 01:09:26.240
<v Speaker 5>parts of the country where people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>more interesting per capita?</v>

1475
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:31.600
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just because you have more people like </v>

1476
01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:32.890
<v Speaker 5>top Texas is awesome is one of my </v>
<v Speaker 5>favorite places ever been because it's </v>

1477
01:09:32.890 --> 01:09:32.890
<v Speaker 5>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a big city.</v>

1478
01:09:32.890 --> 01:09:34.100
<v Speaker 5>People say that it's because there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>more people,</v>

1479
01:09:34.101 --> 01:09:36.020
<v Speaker 5>but I also think that when you get a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>of people together,</v>

1480
01:09:36.021 --> 01:09:38.660
<v Speaker 5>like in New York and in any big city </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>

1481
01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:42.530
<v Speaker 5>just the sheer competition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many people in there.</v>

1482
01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:47.710
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's moving fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's got to keep up with </v>

1483
01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:50.381
<v Speaker 5>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like no one is like no one's faster </v>

1484
01:09:50.381 --> 01:09:52.160
<v Speaker 5>thinker or faster talker than like East </v>
<v Speaker 5>Coast people like New Jersey,</v>

1485
01:09:52.161 --> 01:09:56.000
<v Speaker 5>New York where they're angry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The angry hustle competition,</v>

1486
01:09:56.001 --> 01:09:58.550
<v Speaker 5>sort of a right jolly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think New Yorkers?</v>

1487
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:00.140
<v Speaker 5>No one's more aggressive than New </v>
<v Speaker 5>Yorkers</v>

1488
01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:02.900
<v Speaker 3>as aggressive people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're really aggressively.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you look at and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>The other day,</v>

1499
01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:30.650
<v Speaker 3>three people behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beeper.</v>

1500
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:32.630
<v Speaker 3>I went upstairs and got my police badge </v>
<v Speaker 3>and said,</v>

1501
01:10:32.631 --> 01:10:35.720
<v Speaker 3>move the fucking car bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they fucking moved,</v>

1502
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:37.190
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's like,</v>

1503
01:10:37.210 --> 01:10:38.960
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that part of it.</v>

1504
01:10:38.961 --> 01:10:39.840
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta go,</v>

1505

<v Speaker 3>What's all this knowledge?</v>

1506
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:42.620
<v Speaker 3>And you have really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1507
01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.550
<v Speaker 5>whether in really good conditions and </v>
<v Speaker 5>things are easy,</v>

1508
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:49.120
<v Speaker 5>it tends to make you a bit soft and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I think.</v>

1509
01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:51.580
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>grow up out here,</v>

1510
01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:53.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a lot of Chad's,</v>

1511
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:58.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the type of guy I'm talking </v>

1512
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.910
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's a softness.</v>

1513
01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:00.550
<v Speaker 5>They don't have to deal with like harsh </v>
<v Speaker 5>winters.</v>

1514
01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:05.740
<v Speaker 5>They don't have to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>craziness that the northeast has to deal</v>

1515
01:11:05.741 --> 01:11:07.930
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1516
01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.330
<v Speaker 5>I think people think faster and the east</v>
<v Speaker 5>coast</v>

<v Speaker 8>in general.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I watched the interview with William </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chapman.</v>

1522
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:20.580
<v Speaker 3>He interviewed Bernard Goetz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1523
01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:21.810
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1524
01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:23.850
<v Speaker 3>Is that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very interesting.</v>

1525
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:26.100
<v Speaker 3>I heard Bernie gets used to be on opie </v>
<v Speaker 3>and anthony all the time.</v>

1526
01:11:26.101 --> 01:11:31.101
<v Speaker 3>He's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just shot for motherfuckers for just </v>

1527
01:11:31.101 --> 01:11:31.410
<v Speaker 3>insinuating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he proved them right.</v>

1528
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:32.440
<v Speaker 3>He said they like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1529
01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:33.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to mug them.</v>

1530
01:11:33.301 --> 01:11:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Well look at 20 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three out of the four in prison.</v>

1531
01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it couldn't be because he shot him and </v>

1532
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:44.450
<v Speaker 3>fuck their hand up and then they want </v>
<v Speaker 3>that motherfucker what was crawling and </v>

1533
01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:44.870
<v Speaker 3>he went over and pulled the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>trigger.</v>

1534
01:11:44.871 --> 01:11:49.871
<v Speaker 3>He had the bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see the fucking interviews he gave </v>

1535
01:11:49.871 --> 01:11:49.871
<v Speaker 3>afterwards?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1536
01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:53.580
<v Speaker 3>He told The New York Times that mothers </v>
<v Speaker 3>should have had abortions.</v>

1537
01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't talk like that before you go </v>

1538
01:11:58.820 --> 01:11:58.820
<v Speaker 3>to the sentencing.</v>

1539
01:11:58.820 --> 01:11:58.820
<v Speaker 3>That's the shit you say from behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>bars.</v>

1540
01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:01.860
<v Speaker 3>He was a stern guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think about that guy.</v>

1541
01:12:01.861 --> 01:12:03.270
<v Speaker 3>When I think about New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1542
01:12:03.271 --> 01:12:06.270
<v Speaker 3>I ain't even giving them the opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's out of jail.</v>

1543
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.740
<v Speaker 3>Out of jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long has it been out of jail?</v>

1544
01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:10.870
<v Speaker 3>A long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got thrown out of jail.</v>

1545
01:12:10.871 --> 01:12:12.840
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to throw it out.</v>

1546
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
<v Speaker 3>I did he go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened was he made bold </v>

1547
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:18.000
<v Speaker 3>statements afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His attorneys were like,</v>

1548
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.490
<v Speaker 3>shut the fuck up guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they prosecuted him for something </v>

1549
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:22.650
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget the story now.</v>

1550
01:12:22.651 --> 01:12:24.750
<v Speaker 3>If you look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They prosecuted him for something else,</v>

1551
01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:28.710
<v Speaker 3>but he was a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want to encourage people to</v>

1552
01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:32.100
<v Speaker 3>be vigilantes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is man,</v>

1553
01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:35.880
<v Speaker 3>but I look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do though?</v>

1554
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.040
<v Speaker 3>Do you know anthony from opie and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthony.</v>

1555
01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.810
<v Speaker 3>He's got to carry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He carries a pistol.</v>

1556
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:45.230
<v Speaker 3>They don't talk about it on the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess the station doesn't like </v>

1557
01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:45.230
<v Speaker 3>bringing it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

1558
01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:46.470
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a fucking gun on him.</v>

1559
01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:50.220
<v Speaker 3>You have to kind of carry pit permit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to,</v>

1560
01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:53.520
<v Speaker 3>you have Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can carry it with you.</v>

1561
01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:58.190
<v Speaker 3>It's way better when you need it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>need it.</v>

1562
01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:03.220
<v Speaker 3>And I'm a firm believer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guy carried a gun for years and </v>

1563
01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:05.400
<v Speaker 3>fucking bad guns and hot guns and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you what,</v>

1564
01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.960
<v Speaker 3>and this is what I tell people all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1565
01:13:06.961 --> 01:13:08.580
<v Speaker 3>You carry a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you carry a knife,</v>

1566
01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:11.700
<v Speaker 3>you attract that energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The next time you get into a beef,</v>

1567
01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:14.370
<v Speaker 3>some of these in have a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never carried a knife again.</v>

1568
01:13:14.410 --> 01:13:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Nobody ever attacked me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I got to tackle in life in Aspen,</v>

1569
01:13:16.801 --> 01:13:19.530
<v Speaker 3>Colorado really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I picked up a fucking pipe,</v>

1570
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.960
<v Speaker 3>but that if I wouldn't have slipped away</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

1571
01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:26.960
<v Speaker 3>That guy would have caught me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>picked up a pipe and hit him across the </v>

1572
01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:26.960
<v Speaker 3>fucking leg with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he had a,</v>

1573
01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.860
<v Speaker 3>he had like a little fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where were you attack that?</v>

1574
01:13:28.861 --> 01:13:33.861
<v Speaker 3>We were hanging behind like a strip club</v>
<v Speaker 3>at three and I was at a gas station and </v>

1575
01:13:33.861 --> 01:13:35.940
<v Speaker 3>the guy was fixing my car like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a big garage place.</v>

1576
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:38.250
<v Speaker 3>And the guy thought I had said something</v>
<v Speaker 3>to them.</v>

1577
01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:39.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't send them to you.</v>

1578
01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:40.140
<v Speaker 3>My car's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1579
01:13:40.141 --> 01:13:40.590
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1580
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:43.890
<v Speaker 3>you cut me off before I haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 3>here for two hours.</v>

1581
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.210
<v Speaker 3>He was just looking for somebody to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stamp.</v>

1582
01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:48.870
<v Speaker 3>He was just a little crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She pulled the knife out,</v>

1583
01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:54.140
<v Speaker 3>he went like this and I moved back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I moved back there was a pipe on </v>

1584
01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:54.140
<v Speaker 3>the fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1585
01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:58.261
<v Speaker 3>those pipes for wiring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were doing the place and I slipped </v>

1586
01:13:58.261 --> 01:13:58.261
<v Speaker 3>and I picked up the fucking pipe.</v>

1587
01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:01.140
<v Speaker 3>But I always remembered that when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>carried a gun,</v>

1588
01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:03.420
<v Speaker 3>everywhere I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people had fucking guns.</v>

1589
01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:06.060
<v Speaker 3>I got a gram of coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The motherfucker had a gun.</v>

1590
01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:10.040
<v Speaker 3>What are the odds?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stopped casual.</v>

1591
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:12.970
<v Speaker 3>There was a coke dealer with a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>

1592
01:14:12.971 --> 01:14:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Once I stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1593
01:14:14.341 --> 01:14:19.341
<v Speaker 3>like one time I heard a bullet go off </v>
<v Speaker 3>one night when I had a gun real 20 feet </v>

1594
01:14:19.341 --> 01:14:20.440
<v Speaker 3>behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy shot another guy in a club,</v>

1595
01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:21.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was,</v>

1596
01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:27.300
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember hearing that fucking thing </v>

1597
01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:27.300
<v Speaker 3>and I stopped with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old were you?</v>

1598
01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:32.670
<v Speaker 3>Twenty four maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never ever cared after I got </v>

1599
01:14:32.670 --> 01:14:33.680
<v Speaker 3>caught for the machine gun with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kidnapping.</v>

1600
01:14:33.681 --> 01:14:38.681
<v Speaker 3>I never bought the last time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When was the last time you went out?</v>

1601
01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:43.420

1603
01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:48.460
<v Speaker 3>What you got pitched the things over </v>
<v Speaker 3>here like with the ammo.</v>

1604
01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:53.440
<v Speaker 3>That's the ultimate shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell somebody.</v>

1605
01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.660
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little things.</v>

1606
01:14:54.670 --> 01:14:58.570
<v Speaker 3>The little instant respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me you were arrested for kidnapping</v>

1607
01:14:58.571 --> 01:15:00.660
<v Speaker 3>and yet a machine gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn,</v>

1608
01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:02.650
<v Speaker 3>that's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to fuck with that dude.</v>

1609
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:06.600
<v Speaker 3>That's the way to get out of a wedding </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a gun.</v>

1610
01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:08.380
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trust me,</v>

1611
01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:14.370
<v Speaker 3>I got something to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carry your weapon that it'd be prepared </v>

1612
01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:16.000
<v Speaker 3>to carry that weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell that to people all the time.</v>

1613
01:15:16.001 --> 01:15:16.570
<v Speaker 3>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>

1614
01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:19.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about getting a gun bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before you take that gun out,</v>

1615
01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.840
<v Speaker 3>you better think twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible?</v>

1616
01:15:22.841 --> 01:15:27.841
<v Speaker 3>Here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it possible for human beings to ever </v>

1617
01:15:27.841 --> 01:15:29.680
<v Speaker 3>evolve past this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible for people to ever evolve</v>

1618
01:15:29.681 --> 01:15:33.220
<v Speaker 3>past violence and bullshit and lies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>and hate?</v>

1619
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:36.490
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible or do we need it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need it.</v>

1620
01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:39.700
<v Speaker 3>We needed to because it fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you appreciate,</v>

1621
01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.710
<v Speaker 3>love more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes you struggle more.</v>

1622
01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:45.910
<v Speaker 3>It makes the competition greater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about what's going on.</v>

1623
01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:47.740
<v Speaker 3>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Half a world away.</v>

1624
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:50.440
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's got a machine gun shooting </v>
<v Speaker 3>at each other.</v>

1625
01:15:50.441 --> 01:15:55.441
<v Speaker 3>Right now you're going to be walking in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel and fucking a bus going home and </v>

1626
01:15:55.441 --> 01:16:00.211
<v Speaker 3>somebody comes up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck the Jews and they fucking pull the </v>

1627
01:16:00.211 --> 01:16:00.320
<v Speaker 3>switches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on a,</v>

1628
01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:03.010
<v Speaker 3>on a smaller scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if people can be.</v>

1629
01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Is it just a certain amount?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a certain number?</v>

1630
01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.190
<v Speaker 3>Is it like after a certain number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't be friends with everybody.</v>

1631
01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:11.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck the wars get started?</v>

1632
01:16:11.501 --> 01:16:13.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean it doesn't get started with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>group as small as us,</v>

1633
01:16:13.751 --> 01:16:15.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not for people.</v>

1634
01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:19.000
<v Speaker 3>So if four people can get along what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the numbers?</v>

1635
01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:21.190
<v Speaker 3>What are the numbers where everybody can</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a good,</v>

1636
01:16:21.191 --> 01:16:25.760
<v Speaker 3>healthy every 20 people 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one bad motherfucker,</v>

1637
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:29.680
<v Speaker 3>but if you can get rid of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's a manageable size?</v>

1638
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:32.980
<v Speaker 3>Like if you wanted to start a tribe of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all your own people,</v>

1639
01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.440
<v Speaker 3>what's a manageable size where everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be cool with each other.</v>

1640
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:40.830
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's going to have any problems with</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other where we're all going to be </v>

1641
01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:41.300
<v Speaker 3>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's going to whine.</v>

1642
01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.510
<v Speaker 3>One in the cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cat,</v>

1643
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:47.230
<v Speaker 3>the of flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>

1644
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.440
<v Speaker 3>Listen man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And and and,</v>

1645
01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:51.730
<v Speaker 3>and a drama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you need it.</v>

1646
01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:54.790
<v Speaker 3>I think so to change this an expression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember.</v>

1647
01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.060
<v Speaker 3>I've said this before and it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>

1648
01:16:58.061 --> 01:17:00.370
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's all a mathematical </v>
<v Speaker 3>equation.</v>

1649
01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:04.300
<v Speaker 3>I think everything you do in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the people you come in contact with,</v>

1650
01:17:04.301 --> 01:17:06.190
<v Speaker 3>all your actions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all your motions,</v>

1651
01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 3>it's all part of a giant equation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's equation that's piling</v>

1652
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:12.290
<v Speaker 5>up together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's numbers.</v>

1653
01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:17.291
<v Speaker 5>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you're doing is affecting me when </v>

1654
01:17:17.291 --> 01:17:19.481
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing is affecting him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're all doing it together and it's </v>

1655
01:17:19.481 --> 01:17:21.050
<v Speaker 5>we're working towards some fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 5>goal that we just can't say.</v>

1656
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:26.900
<v Speaker 5>I believe that me to Vinton Zeus wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>the god of war.</v>

1657
01:17:26.901 --> 01:17:30.790
<v Speaker 5>What was the mythology?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Zeus or thor was a goddess.</v>

1658
01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:35.920
<v Speaker 5>Thunder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A war was one of those guys said he was </v>

1659
01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:35.920
<v Speaker 5>so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Motherfucker.</v>

1660
01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:40.900
<v Speaker 5>The grand poupon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of those guys sent this sudden down </v>

1661
01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:44.021
<v Speaker 5>to see what was going on at this </v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker came back and everything </v>

1662
01:17:44.021 --> 01:17:45.260
<v Speaker 5>talked about war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the damage this guy had done.</v>

1663
01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:49.490
<v Speaker 5>His son when he went and he asked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is something what the fuck is going on?</v>

1664
01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:50.810
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing?</v>

1665
01:17:50.811 --> 01:17:52.110
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's chopping these heads off.</v>

1666
01:17:52.111 --> 01:17:53.340
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>without war,</v>

1667
01:17:53.341 --> 01:17:55.760
<v Speaker 5>there's no change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

1668
01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:57.860
<v Speaker 5>Something to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1669
01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:00.670
<v Speaker 5>but the question is can we evolve past </v>
<v Speaker 5>us?</v>

1670
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:04.190
<v Speaker 5>The problem is you look at the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you look at sustainability,</v>

1671
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:07.250
<v Speaker 5>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just the sheer numbers of human beings,</v>

1672
01:18:07.251 --> 01:18:12.251
<v Speaker 5>and then you look at the amount of space</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we have and you've got to think if </v>

1673
01:18:12.251 --> 01:18:15.071
<v Speaker 5>we're at like six or $7 billion now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's gonna Happen when it's $20 </v>

1674
01:18:15.071 --> 01:18:15.280
<v Speaker 5>million?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's going to happen when it's $80?</v>

1675
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:15.470
<v Speaker 5>Million?</v>

1676
01:18:16.570 --> 01:18:18.770
<v Speaker 7>There's a shitload of land now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there's,</v>

1677
01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.820
<v Speaker 7>there's tons and tons of land.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you go to Ohio,</v>

1678
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:24.820
<v Speaker 7>there's just millions and millions of </v>
<v Speaker 7>acres of land.</v>

1679
01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:26.730
<v Speaker 7>So think everybody's just moved to Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know,</v>

1680
01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.950
<v Speaker 7>I'm just saying that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 7>states out there like,</v>

1681
01:18:29.951 --> 01:18:34.951
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>South Dakota is that there's fucking </v>

1682
01:18:34.951 --> 01:18:34.951
<v Speaker 7>land everywhere</v>

1683
01:18:34.951 --> 01:18:35.120
<v Speaker 5>growing their food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1684
01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:37.220
<v Speaker 5>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where are they getting their meat?</v>

1685
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:38.510
<v Speaker 5>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mexico,</v>

1686

<v Speaker 5>nostalgic part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It made me remember all these idiots </v>

1831
01:24:48.211 --> 01:24:48.370
<v Speaker 7>no bullet in it and it's blown their </v>
<v Speaker 7>brains out.</v>

1832
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.900
<v Speaker 7>You know that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1833
01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:49.990
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But that's not what happened.</v>

1834
01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:51.840
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he would happen with.</v>

1835
01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:56.880
<v Speaker 7>What I read was that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was something in the barrel on </v>

1836
01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:57.880
<v Speaker 7>that as he fired the blank,</v>
<v Speaker 7>something,</v>

1837
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:59.080
<v Speaker 7>something,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever it was in the barrel,</v>

1838
01:24:59.081 --> 01:25:01.750
<v Speaker 7>we should probably look it up when we </v>
<v Speaker 7>were talking out of our ass,</v>

1839
01:25:01.751 --> 01:25:03.820
<v Speaker 7>but he did get shot and killed on sap.</v>

1840
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:09.250
<v Speaker 3>I always felt that the father got ice </v>
<v Speaker 3>because when he left Rudd Rudd and those</v>

1841
01:25:09.351 --> 01:25:12.290
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers to come to the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States to shoot into the dragon,</v>

<v Speaker 3>there's no three d go Sag.</v>

01:26:16.490 --> 01:26:18.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If anybody knows anything about anything</v>

1867
01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:24.040
<v Speaker 3>mafia concept and even the Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those morons could never figure that </v>

1868
01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:24.050
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking Chinese.</v>

1869
01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:26.000
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at Japan.</v>

1870
01:26:26.001 --> 01:26:31.001
<v Speaker 3>When you fuck up in the in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't they cut your fucking finger or </v>

1871
01:26:31.001 --> 01:26:31.880
<v Speaker 3>don't you have to color up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I told you to cut your finger off,</v>

1872
01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:34.040
<v Speaker 3>what were the chances you understand me?</v>

1873
01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:35.840
<v Speaker 3>These people don't fuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not white.</v>

1874
01:26:35.841 --> 01:26:40.841
<v Speaker 3>They're not sure if these people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were making tons of money to </v>

1875
01:26:40.841 --> 01:26:45.771
<v Speaker 3>leave them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He decided to go to warner brothers to </v>

1876
01:26:45.771 --> 01:26:45.771
<v Speaker 3>make enter the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they killed.</v>

1877
01:26:45.771 --> 01:26:47.480
<v Speaker 3>They gave him a little taste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not the taste.</v>

1878
01:26:47.481 --> 01:26:49.820
<v Speaker 3>They were waiting on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not The big taste they were waiting on.</v>

1879
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:54.850
<v Speaker 3>They made Raymond Chow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little partner and then they gave him </v>

1880
01:26:54.850 --> 01:26:57.671
<v Speaker 3>a piece of death with Charles Bronson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that wasn't enough.</v>

1881
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:59.520
<v Speaker 3>So you really think that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

1882
01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.850
<v Speaker 3>Any other ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1883
01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:03.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's officially.</v>

1884
01:27:04.150 --> 01:27:06.230
<v Speaker 3>It was a brain aneurysm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a brain aneurysm.</v>

1885
01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:08.540
<v Speaker 3>While when someone shooting in the head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain bleeds,</v>

1886
01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:10.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's mysterious.</v>

1887
01:27:10.521 --> 01:27:12.230
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1888
01:27:12.231 --> 01:27:14.660
<v Speaker 3>he was 33 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in perfect health.</v>

1889
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:16.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could have been poisoned.</v>

1890
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:17.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1891
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:19.220
<v Speaker 3>You could say that we could have paid </v>
<v Speaker 3>for this,</v>

1892
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:22.670
<v Speaker 3>the Chinese could have paid for this all</v>
<v Speaker 3>across the line to the,</v>

1893
01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:24.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a corrupt country.</v>

1894
01:27:24.231 --> 01:27:29.231
<v Speaker 3>Like any other place like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could have paid dr to say whatever </v>

1895
01:27:29.231 --> 01:27:29.231
<v Speaker 3>the fuck they would've said they buried </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1896
01:27:29.231 --> 01:27:30.740
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why hasn't Linda,</v>

1897
01:27:30.741 --> 01:27:35.741
<v Speaker 3>Lisa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's dig up the motherfucking body and </v>

1898
01:27:35.741 --> 01:27:35.741
<v Speaker 3>see what's really crackalackin lacking </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they probably gave her.</v>

1899
01:27:35.741 --> 01:27:37.250
<v Speaker 3>She knows they killed his son to boot </v>
<v Speaker 3>brush.</v>

1900
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:39.170
<v Speaker 3>So your husband and your fucking son </v>
<v Speaker 3>dies.</v>

1901
01:27:39.171 --> 01:27:42.380
<v Speaker 3>This is a coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was there any threats on his life?</v>

1902
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:50.390
<v Speaker 7>Reading how it actually happened?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess they were using blanks but they </v>

1903
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:54.381
<v Speaker 7>were rushed at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they took real bullets and took out </v>

1904
01:27:54.381 --> 01:27:58.311
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the powder out of the bullets that I </v>

1905
01:27:58.311 --> 01:27:58.920
<v Speaker 7>guess would also make a blank.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1906
01:27:59.250 --> 01:28:02.010
<v Speaker 7>so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But what happened is somebody on unknown</v>

1907
01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:07.100
<v Speaker 7>fired those blanks and they reinserted </v>
<v Speaker 7>like bullets on top of it,</v>

1908
01:28:07.141 --> 01:28:12.141
<v Speaker 7>like more blanks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so eight exploded in a piece of a </v>

1909
01:28:12.141 --> 01:28:13.320
<v Speaker 7>bullet flew out of it or something like </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

1910
01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:21.520
<v Speaker 3>Because not only are we going to shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were going to shoot you on fucking </v>

1911
01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:21.520
<v Speaker 3>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

1912
01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was crazy videos on </v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube.</v>

1913
01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1914
01:28:26.661 --> 01:28:28.290
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just so many.</v>

1915
01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:32.990
<v Speaker 3>It's just weird going to watch it by so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many doubts with both of them.</v>

1916
01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:34.520
<v Speaker 3>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

1917
01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:39.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just the brandon sounds like it </v>

1918
01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:40.850
<v Speaker 3>could be just a coincidence that all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a sudden he was dead and buried and gun.</v>

1919
01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:46.120
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the movie came out two weeks </v>

1920
01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:46.550
<v Speaker 3>later because he died before the break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect timing died.</v>

1921
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:50.460
<v Speaker 3>He died July 16th or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1922
01:28:50.461 --> 01:28:55.461
<v Speaker 3>And the movie came out eight days later </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were filming the movie and they </v>

1923
01:28:55.461 --> 01:28:57.170
<v Speaker 3>were done filming and then they released</v>
<v Speaker 3>it eight days later after he died.</v>

1924
01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:01.290
<v Speaker 3>None of the movie was done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two weeks before they it.</v>

1925
01:29:01.291 --> 01:29:01.950
<v Speaker 3>He died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He died.</v>

1926
01:29:02.150 --> 01:29:04.290
<v Speaker 4>He never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wait one more movie.</v>

1927
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:08.910
<v Speaker 4>It was legend wasn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was 10 minutes.</v>

1928
01:29:08.911 --> 01:29:11.320
<v Speaker 4>I thought you were talking about Brandon</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lee though.</v>

1929
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:12.690
<v Speaker 4>Bruce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1930
01:29:13.290 --> 01:29:17.640
<v Speaker 4>So you know the cell body catalysis as </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is American studio,</v>

1931
01:29:17.641 --> 01:29:19.490
<v Speaker 4>they would never kill somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1932
01:29:19.530 --> 01:29:21.930
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's some crazy producers out</v>

1933
01:29:21.931 --> 01:29:23.670
<v Speaker 4>there that we kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They understand.</v>

1934
01:29:23.850 --> 01:29:26.370
<v Speaker 4>They understand the depth equals money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1935
01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:28.520
<v Speaker 4>is there a documentary out there about </v>
<v Speaker 4>brandon?</v>

1936
01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:33.530
<v Speaker 4>I think there is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think was it legend or survivor </v>

1937
01:29:34.021 --> 01:29:39.021
<v Speaker 4>producer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>His wife and Cancun and he's back.</v>

1938
01:29:39.810 --> 01:29:44.810
<v Speaker 4>He's back in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mexican government's trying to figure </v>

1939
01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:46.290
<v Speaker 4>out how to prosecute him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to from Mexico can kill his</v>

1940
01:29:46.291 --> 01:29:48.280
<v Speaker 4>wife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bob will tell you something.</v>

1941
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:51.090
<v Speaker 4>I'll know if you seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1942
01:29:51.150 --> 01:29:56.150
<v Speaker 4>I've been on that side of the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just watched that Michael Jackson </v>

1943
01:29:56.150 --> 01:29:58.200
<v Speaker 4>documentary again a couple of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at his death,</v>

1944
01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.580
<v Speaker 4>but know about the thing we want to see </v>
<v Speaker 4>that night.</v>

1945
01:30:03.490 --> 01:30:08.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm watching him watching him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does he look like a fucking dude?</v>

1946
01:30:09.691 --> 01:30:13.080
<v Speaker 4>That's fucked up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As much as they said he was fucked up to</v>

1947
01:30:13.081 --> 01:30:14.140
<v Speaker 4>do all those dance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Move.</v>

1948
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:15.900
<v Speaker 4>Watch the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're an intelligent guy.</v>

1949
01:30:15.901 --> 01:30:19.080
<v Speaker 4>You get back to me or he wasn't just </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing coke or whatever.</v>

1950
01:30:19.081 --> 01:30:24.081
<v Speaker 4>He was doing oxygen or whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>they said he was doing that one part </v>

1951
01:30:24.081 --> 01:30:25.890
<v Speaker 4>where he freaks out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember he fucking freaked out.</v>

1952
01:30:25.891 --> 01:30:28.980
<v Speaker 4>There's one part where they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They show most of the movies.</v>

1953
01:30:28.981 --> 01:30:33.981
<v Speaker 4>Just all good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even get into drugs or anything </v>

1954
01:30:33.981 --> 01:30:33.981
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all good,</v>

1955
01:30:33.981 --> 01:30:37.490
<v Speaker 4>but they showed a piece where he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>freaking out with the director and he </v>

1956
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.970
<v Speaker 4>doesn't feel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels like it feels like just.</v>

1957
01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:43.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to get the right mixture,</v>

1958
01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.430
<v Speaker 4>but that guy was a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going.</v>

1959
01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.100
<v Speaker 4>They were going to take this little </v>
<v Speaker 4>Afro.</v>

1960
01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:48.960
<v Speaker 4>We're going to take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never,</v>

1961
01:30:48.961 --> 01:30:53.961
<v Speaker 4>never land so much money on </v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfuckers made since he's been dead </v>

1962
01:30:53.961 --> 01:30:53.961
<v Speaker 4>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1963
01:30:53.961 --> 01:30:53.961
<v Speaker 4>Punch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>punch.</v>

1964
01:30:53.961 --> 01:30:58.720
<v Speaker 4>They're all jumping up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Red Dragon was the documentary by </v>

1965
01:30:58.720 --> 01:30:58.720
<v Speaker 4>Red Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Bruce Lee documentary.</v>

1966
01:30:59.070 --> 01:31:00.190
<v Speaker 4>It's Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brandon Lee.</v>

1967
01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:01.880
<v Speaker 4>Both Brandon Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

1968
01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:05.100
<v Speaker 4>grabbing Red Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>red dragon.</v>

1969
01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:09.540
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Little bit conspiracy guy,</v>

1970
01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:14.240
<v Speaker 4>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to his death definitely sounds like</v>

1971
01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:17.220
<v Speaker 4>if he had some very few really pissed </v>
<v Speaker 4>off some Chinese mob guys,</v>

1972
01:31:17.221 --> 01:31:19.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they would let that slide </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the guy became a movie star,</v>

1973
01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he's making some other people.</v>

1974
01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:22.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could see them killing them.</v>

1975
01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:25.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the details either where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they shot those movies.</v>

1976
01:31:25.861 --> 01:31:28.020
<v Speaker 4>They shut those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like those movies cost nothing.</v>

1977
01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:30.480
<v Speaker 4>They shot those in the jungles of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Thailand.</v>

1978
01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:35.780
<v Speaker 4>Fist of fury.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first one they shot that there was </v>

1979
01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:38.541
<v Speaker 4>no set.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They shot that in the jungle with pilot </v>

1980
01:31:38.541 --> 01:31:38.541
<v Speaker 4>on a dark street.</v>

1981
01:31:38.541 --> 01:31:39.480
<v Speaker 4>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no crap services.</v>

1982
01:31:39.481 --> 01:31:44.481
<v Speaker 4>There was no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was one tons and a fucking type </v>

1983
01:31:44.481 --> 01:31:44.481
<v Speaker 4>with Chinese music on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1984
01:31:44.481 --> 01:31:49.310
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you think about how recent movies </v>

1985
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:50.400
<v Speaker 4>really are when a recent invention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean movies were,</v>

1986
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:55.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe in the 19 hundreds they were </v>

1987
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.430
<v Speaker 4>silent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1988
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:56.680
<v Speaker 4>When did they start making sound movies?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1989
01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 4>A 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>

1990
01:31:59.981 --> 01:32:01.360
<v Speaker 4>that was Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

1991
01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:04.000
<v Speaker 4>what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Red Dragon.</v>

1992
01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.070
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the documentary on Brandon,</v>

1993
01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:08.880
<v Speaker 4>Bruce Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bruce Lee.</v>

1994
01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:10.590
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think it was like 1940.</v>

1995
01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:15.640
<v Speaker 4>I would say 19.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that when you start thinking about </v>

1996
01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:18.420
<v Speaker 4>how recent invention movies are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the crazy thing about the whole movie </v>

1997
01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:20.230
<v Speaker 4>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really does program you.</v>

1998
01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:24.130
<v Speaker 4>We have some certain things that we want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to see in life and when you show them to</v>

1999
01:32:24.131 --> 01:32:27.220
<v Speaker 4>us like we have a natural inclination to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fall successful people.</v>

2000
01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:28.570
<v Speaker 4>It's natural,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2001
01:32:28.571 --> 01:32:33.571
<v Speaker 4>fall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone who's better than you learn how </v>

2002
01:32:33.571 --> 01:32:33.571
<v Speaker 4>to be better than you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2003
01:32:33.571 --> 01:32:36.781
<v Speaker 4>learn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn from people that have already </v>

2004
01:32:36.781 --> 01:32:36.781
<v Speaker 4>learned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you see a movie,</v>

2005
01:32:36.781 --> 01:32:39.490
<v Speaker 4>it's like the guy has all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>attributes of the hero in real life,</v>

2006
01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:44.520
<v Speaker 4>but it's fake and he's 60 feet tall and </v>
<v Speaker 4>every time he talks fucking music plays </v>

2007
01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:48.040
<v Speaker 4>and your whole system gets so confused </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you really.</v>

2008
01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:50.260
<v Speaker 4>The girls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially girls,</v>

2009
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:55.530
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>that life really should be like a movie </v>

2010
01:32:55.530 --> 01:32:56.830
<v Speaker 4>that was really shocked that life </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't turn out like a moving.</v>

2011
01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.230
<v Speaker 4>How crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't that when Bruce Lee,</v>

2012
01:32:59.231 --> 01:33:03.320
<v Speaker 4>all he ever wanted was a shot in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood and he got ripped off.</v>

2013
01:33:03.321 --> 01:33:05.680
<v Speaker 4>He got rejected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got sent back to China,</v>

2014
01:33:05.681 --> 01:33:08.590
<v Speaker 4>he blows up in China and now warner </v>
<v Speaker 4>brothers wants him back.</v>

2015
01:33:08.591 --> 01:33:11.410
<v Speaker 4>Now they want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he finally gets a shot.</v>

2016
01:33:11.410 --> 01:33:16.410
<v Speaker 4>He gets the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gets to call the shots of the movie </v>

2017
01:33:16.410 --> 01:33:16.410
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't show up to the set.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has cold feet.</v>

2018
01:33:16.410 --> 01:33:19.300
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking nervous as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're shooting around him.</v>

2019
01:33:19.390 --> 01:33:21.160
<v Speaker 4>He won't show up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's freaking out.</v>

2020
01:33:21.190 --> 01:33:23.320
<v Speaker 4>He's having a nervous breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How close is that?</v>

2021
01:33:23.321 --> 01:33:26.470
<v Speaker 4>Then he finally shows up and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>crushes you.</v>

2022
01:33:26.471 --> 01:33:29.080
<v Speaker 4>Watch that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm sure there's some corniness from</v>

2023
01:33:29.081 --> 01:33:30.430
<v Speaker 4>enter the dragon and that's an old </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie,</v>

2024
01:33:30.431 --> 01:33:33.850
<v Speaker 4>but there's so like a good 75 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just stands.</v>

2025
01:33:33.851 --> 01:33:35.500
<v Speaker 4>The test of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The scenes,</v>

2026
01:33:35.650 --> 01:33:40.650
<v Speaker 4>the wet shot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when he's out with are out during </v>

2027
01:33:40.650 --> 01:33:42.610
<v Speaker 4>the day and he's those when he fights </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bob Wall and Bolo Young,</v>

2028
01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:46.180
<v Speaker 4>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are the best fucking scenes.</v>

2029
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:51.870
<v Speaker 4>It was so intense like Muhammad Ali had </v>
<v Speaker 4>come along before that that represented </v>

2030
01:33:52.571 --> 01:33:55.320
<v Speaker 4>martial arts at all in a mainstream way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no,</v>

2031
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:57.550
<v Speaker 4>there's been no one that grabbed the </v>
<v Speaker 4>public's attention.</v>

2032
01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:59.770
<v Speaker 4>He was the first and when he did pick </v>
<v Speaker 4>bosses,</v>

2033
01:33:59.790 --> 01:34:01.690
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he wasn't even the start first.</v>

2034
01:34:01.691 --> 01:34:06.691
<v Speaker 4>He was like built third or fourth and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then he just started directing and </v>

2035
01:34:06.691 --> 01:34:10.351
<v Speaker 4>fucking putting together the fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>scenes and then they bumped them up and </v>

2036
01:34:10.351 --> 01:34:10.351
<v Speaker 4>made them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>

2037
01:34:10.351 --> 01:34:11.420
<v Speaker 4>this motherfucker's just taken over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This dude just start.</v>

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.140
<v Speaker 4>They just throw them on the film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2039
01:34:14.230 --> 01:34:19.230
<v Speaker 4>last minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he took over and then from that </v>

2040
01:34:19.230 --> 01:34:19.230
<v Speaker 4>point on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just took a lot,</v>

2041
01:34:19.230 --> 01:34:22.180
<v Speaker 4>which is one of my all time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>top five and when I get down and dirty,</v>

2042
01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:24.210
<v Speaker 4>what am I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>old time movies as a child,</v>

<v Speaker 4>whatever the big boss here,</v>

2044
01:34:27.070 --> 01:34:31.960
<v Speaker 4>fist of fury in that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his fucking anger comes through.</v>

2045
01:34:31.961 --> 01:34:33.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's so good in that movie.</v>

2046
01:34:33.851 --> 01:34:35.360
<v Speaker 4>Everything he does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hang with.</v>

2047
01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:38.230
<v Speaker 4>This guy took clint eastwood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took them a step further.</v>

2048
01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:43.440
<v Speaker 4>He would kill the guys and then hang </v>
<v Speaker 4>them on the streets so people could see </v>

2049
01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.950
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's nobody's done that shit.</v>

2050
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:49.270
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's ever thought Charles Bronson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hung up twice.</v>

2051
01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:50.950
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why'd you kill my teacher?</v>

2052
01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:51.770
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2053
01:34:51.771 --> 01:34:56.771
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think of that last fight scene where he </v>

2054
01:34:56.771 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 4>goes to the school and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this does not concern you.</v>

2055
01:34:58.490 --> 01:35:03.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm allowing you to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He throws them out and then three that </v>

2056
01:35:03.621 --> 01:35:06.320
<v Speaker 3>stick around,</v>

<v Speaker 3>The beginning of that movie.</v>

2109
01:37:41.691 --> 01:37:46.691
<v Speaker 3>Then they shut the whole rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie with like anytime you get a good </v>

<v Speaker 2>This is the ship.</v>

2290
01:47:39.901 --> 01:47:44.901
<v Speaker 2>That yellow heavy music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a real grind court death metal.</v>

2291
01:47:46.930 --> 01:47:48.320
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that there.</v>

2292
01:47:48.530 --> 01:47:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Keep it playing in the background with </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the guys.</v>

2293
01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just give us a little background.</v>

2294
01:47:52.171 --> 01:47:55.320
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a good fucking jam.</v>

2300
01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:17.550
<v Speaker 2>music like some don't like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pop music's good because it gets.</v>

2301
01:48:17.551 --> 01:48:18.780
<v Speaker 2>Once it gets into your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

2302
01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That eminem song with Brianna,</v>

2303
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:26.580
<v Speaker 2>I listening to her saying her parts </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts alerts too much.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck loves it when you lie?</v>

2306
01:48:32.490 --> 01:48:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Everyone hates that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get the lyrics.</v>

2307
01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I just love her voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to liberalize this.</v>

2308
01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Riata is definitely one of my peers.</v>

2309
01:48:42.250 --> 01:48:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Something terrible thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something extra sexy about her </v>

2310
01:48:47.250 --> 01:48:52.150
<v Speaker 2>and there's something extra attractive </v>
<v Speaker 2>but her that she got her ass kicked by </v>

2311
01:48:52.150 --> 01:48:53.970
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why there's something about</v>

2312
01:48:53.971 --> 01:48:58.140
<v Speaker 2>her that she's been through some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I can understand this pain.</v>

2313
01:48:58.230 --> 01:49:00.030
<v Speaker 2>This is the legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2314
01:49:00.031 --> 01:49:01.450
<v Speaker 2>This girl's crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is crying.</v>

2315
01:49:01.451 --> 01:49:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she loved.</v>

2316
01:49:02.191 --> 01:49:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Beat the fuck out of her and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>world knows about it.</v>

2317
01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:06.490
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's allowed to be in pain.</v>

2318
01:49:06.491 --> 01:49:09.000
<v Speaker 2>She's allowed to be twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's allowed to cry.</v>

2319
01:49:09.001 --> 01:49:12.420
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like when Tupac went to jail,</v>

2320
01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:17.720
<v Speaker 2>he came out better than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Painful songs,</v>

2321
01:49:23.401 --> 01:49:26.040
<v Speaker 2>better than anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know she got beat up.</v>

2322
01:49:26.041 --> 01:49:30.370
<v Speaker 2>How sad is knows that when I first heard</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

2323
01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:32.270
<v Speaker 2>it was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even like rnb.</v>

2324
01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:37.280
<v Speaker 2>When I heard that song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was going to be fucking </v>

2325
01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:38.490
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a great song.</v>

2326
01:49:38.491 --> 01:49:43.491
<v Speaker 2>And then it blew the fuck up because </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically you pull the vocals out of </v>

2327
01:49:43.491 --> 01:49:43.500
<v Speaker 2>umbrella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be something.</v>

2328
01:49:43.930 --> 01:49:47.620
<v Speaker 2>That could be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's alternative music with an RNB chick</v>

2329
01:49:47.621 --> 01:49:47.970
<v Speaker 2>over it</v>

2330
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:50.560
<v Speaker 4>with a hip hop drum beat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking perfect.</v>

2331
01:49:54.730 --> 01:49:59.730
<v Speaker 4>Music man doesn't even make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking believe.</v>

2332
01:50:00.041 --> 01:50:01.570
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much impact?</v>

2333
01:50:01.630 --> 01:50:04.980
<v Speaker 4>Just a bunch of frequencies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People talking and you know,</v>

2334
01:50:05.610 --> 01:50:08.380
<v Speaker 4>and the songs frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it resonate with yours?</v>

2335
01:50:08.381 --> 01:50:10.150
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's real simple science.</v>

2336
01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:12.670
<v Speaker 4>So amazing though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that something like that is</v>

2337
01:50:12.671 --> 01:50:13.600
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2338
01:50:13.601 --> 01:50:15.010
<v Speaker 4>that people don't respect it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2339
01:50:15.011 --> 01:50:17.020
<v Speaker 4>when you get really baked and you start </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about music,</v>

2340
01:50:17.230 --> 01:50:22.230
<v Speaker 4>people don't smell pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't even know what music sounds </v>

2341
01:50:22.230 --> 01:50:22.230
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>

2342
01:50:22.230 --> 01:50:23.290
<v Speaker 4>You really don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you actually don't.</v>

2343
01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:25.750
<v Speaker 4>You're missing like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like about 30 percent of it.</v>

2344
01:50:26.050 --> 01:50:28.570
<v Speaker 4>You're missing some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some extra layers that you wouldn't even</v>

2345
01:50:28.571 --> 01:50:33.571
<v Speaker 4>see her here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Try listening to a seal when your baked </v>

2346
01:50:33.571 --> 01:50:38.490
<v Speaker 4>seal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That song by a road was a big seal fan </v>

2347
01:50:38.490 --> 01:50:39.490
<v Speaker 4>back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen to that shit with some headphones</v>

2348
01:50:39.491 --> 01:50:40.450

<v Speaker 4>crafted,</v>

2351
01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:49.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it all flows together.</v>

2352
01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:54.300
<v Speaker 4>That dude was a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a bad motherfucker done with some</v>
