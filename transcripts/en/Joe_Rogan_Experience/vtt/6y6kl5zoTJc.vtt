00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 1>but there's no way of getting a New York City less.</v>

3
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:05.320
<v Speaker 1>You pay him some money.</v>

4
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.410
<v Speaker 1>You want to take those bridges from Staten Island,</v>

5
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:08.131
<v Speaker 1>you can pay me,</v>

6
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:08.964
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

7
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 1>you're coming in from Jersey,</v>

8
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:11.010

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>You got to pay to get in here dog.</v>

10
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like an amusing because it cost anything to leave.</v>

11
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't Cost York and deleted all of my funds.</v>

12
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.253
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

13
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>both times when I moved out of New York,</v>

14
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

15
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>as I crossed the free bridge,</v>

16
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I thought it doesn't cost anything to leave.</v>

17
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that fascinating?</v>

18
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.780
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

19
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.250
<v Speaker 1>is it to regulate how many people come in and is it to mitigate traffic and to</v>

20
00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>make it like problematic because it cost so much money.</v>

21
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a Carpool.</v>

22
00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Is that the idea?</v>

23
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.833
<v Speaker 1>To tell you a little story?</v>

24
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.693
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

25
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

26
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.973
<v Speaker 1>and they won.</v>

27
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>It is a big story actually,</v>

28
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>and I was reminded of,</v>

29
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>but you're talking about the George Washington Bridge and when I was 20 years</v>

30
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:47.971
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I lived in Washington heights for a year.</v>

32
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Worst Year of my life.</v>

00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:53.071
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

36

<v Speaker 1>I had three marble balconies.</v>

66
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I was on this corner unit,</v>

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>I could lie in my bed.</v>

73
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Look up at the World Trade Center.</v>

74
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Must've been insane.</v>

75
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.271
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

76
00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:57.091
<v Speaker 1>it was fantastic,</v>

77
00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>but it was a time in my life,</v>

78
00:01:58.411 --> 00:01:58.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>the Sitcom had ended.</v>

80
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.641
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

81
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 1>I felt I was angry.</v>

82
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I was angry and I was,</v>

83
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:04.951
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

84
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>I was searching for meaning and,</v>

85
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

86
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>what was important in life and what was making you angry?</v>

87
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.021
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

88
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:13.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>that I had the Sitcom and it didn't work out.</v>

90
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:16.321
<v Speaker 1>And then I just,</v>

91
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:16.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to just go focus on being a comedian and live in New York.</v>

93
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.670
<v Speaker 1>So the Dalai Lama was going to give a speech for free in central park on</v>

94
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:29.970
<v Speaker 1>happiness for six months.</v>

95
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I had the flyer on my refrigerator.</v>

96
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Nothing in the world was going to make me miss the Dalai Lama's speech on</v>

97
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:37.374
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

98
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>So the night before,</v>

99
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm headlining at Caroline's on Broadway and there were these two Puerto Rican</v>

100
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:50.451
<v Speaker 1>lesbian strippers and they loved me and they stuck around after the show and</v>

101
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:53.910
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to talk to me and we're high,</v>

102
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.063
<v Speaker 1>we're talking.</v>

103
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.303
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>

104
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>they invited me out with them and know what,</v>

107
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>the other girl was off limits because she had a boyfriend.</v>

108
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I ain't give a fuck about the other girl.</v>

109
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>It was all about the queen bee and the other girl was in love with the Queen</v>

110
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:09.250

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>We go to some dance club in Soho.</v>

150
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 1>It's packed.</v>

151
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to be a packed dance club.</v>

152
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I want to be with these girls.</v>

153
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>She knew the DJ.</v>

154
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 1>We get up these steps were in this private area behind the DJ.</v>

155
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>No one can see us,</v>

156
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 1>the Djs like 10,</v>

157
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>15 feet in front of us just like jamming and the place is packed downstairs but</v>

158
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 1>you can't see them.</v>

159
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 1>And we got this horse shoe leather couch and we're just rocking and she's got</v>

160
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>more bottles of Pinot Grigio and ice and we're just fucking dancing and grinding</v>

161
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:24.364
<v Speaker 1>on each other.</v>

162
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>And we go back to my apartment and about five o'clock in the morning,</v>

163
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:29.741
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

164
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:30.011
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

165
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:35.011
<v Speaker 1>we dance on my furniture and we'll play music and stuff and we got in my bed and</v>

166
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>honestly there was no sex.</v>

167
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.283
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

168
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.620
<v Speaker 1>we had our bottoms underwear on and it was so tender and just resting and</v>

169
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>kissing and tasting of fleshing and touching of private areas.</v>

170
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

171
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.120
<v Speaker 1>at one point the queen bee got up on her knees and she starts French kissing</v>

172
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:00.580
<v Speaker 1>this other girl and she's rubbing her mound.</v>

173
00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:00.731
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

174
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 1>She's just kissing her.</v>

175
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.250
<v Speaker 1>And I got behind this,</v>

176
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

177
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 1>behind the Queen Bee and I just start kissing this big beautiful brown bulbous</v>

178
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.893
<v Speaker 1>acid.</v>

179
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

180
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I got my hands up on the top curvature of it and I pulled her panties aside,</v>

181
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>them stuck my nose in our honeypot and I'm just tasting these delicious flesh</v>

182
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>rose petals and,</v>

183
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:24.034
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

184
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 2>I overslept and I missed the Dalai Lama's speech.</v>

185
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.170
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

186
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.810
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

187
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.643
<v Speaker 2>why would you,</v>

188
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 2>why would you even think that that would be a bad thing?</v>

189
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.300
<v Speaker 2>The Dalai Lama is a true story,</v>

190
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a joke.</v>

191
00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:45.200
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a true story story.</v>

192
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.480
<v Speaker 2>The Dalai Lama represents a,</v>

193
00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 2>an interesting point of view and that's it.</v>

194
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.871
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

195
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:53.600
<v Speaker 2>the idea that this guy's guy for define what happiness is.</v>

196
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.630
<v Speaker 2>The I,</v>

197
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.080
<v Speaker 2>it's the idea of a one uh,</v>

198
00:05:57.081 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 2>one figurehead like that is kind of preposterous to the idea of enlightenment.</v>

199
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:02.864
<v Speaker 2>The idea,</v>

200
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're dealing with a guy who dresses like a wizard and doesn't</v>

201
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
