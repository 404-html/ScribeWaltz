00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.520
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of time,</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.473
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>

3
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well my dad is hilarious.</v>

4
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:10.101
<v Speaker 1>My Dad is 86 and three quarters and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>sent me an email today and it said,</v>

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>here's a link to an article about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana reform,</v>

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.181
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

7
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be legal in my lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

8
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.981
<v Speaker 1>Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

9
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I hope you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:22.970
<v Speaker 1>even if you have to live another 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

11
00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>So I would have never thought in 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was still be illegal.</v>

12
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.740
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a matter of time.</v>

13
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Well I was on the board of normal for</v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile,</v>

14
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>quite awhile and I was with people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>started normal in 1970 and 71 and</v>

15
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 1>thought it would be legal in a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

16
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>So that sort of tempers my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sense of time to be with people who,</v>

17
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over 40 years ago thought it was only</v>

18
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>going to be a few years away that</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana will be legal.</v>

19
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately they're still working to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to help bring that about.</v>

20
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Do you lose enthusiasm sometimes when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that it's still illegal after</v>

21
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's the,</v>

22
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about,</v>

23
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 1>it's a worthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on a worthy opponent.</v>

24
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a worthy goal and so I think we</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do what we want to do.</v>

25
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:10.671
<v Speaker 1>There's times when I felt like I was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>blocked that I needed to do something</v>

26
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>where I could actually see change and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped work for a week and painted my</v>

27
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:16.614
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

28
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really must,</v>

29
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>must,</v>
<v Speaker 1>must get to feel like you're spinning</v>

30
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:26.080
<v Speaker 1>your wheels sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.700
<v Speaker 1>for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we just spent four years with Health</v>

32
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Canada trying to get an import export</v>
<v Speaker 1>permit to bring in eight grams of Mgma</v>

33
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:40.311
<v Speaker 1>and this is after Health Canada had</v>
<v Speaker 1>approved the protocol and our irb had</v>

34
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>approved the protocol and the four years</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took and they went through all these</v>

35
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous things about the pharmacy had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have bulletproof glass.</v>

36
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>It had to have all these alarm systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Class people are gonna come in and steal</v>

37
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>your eight grams of acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was eight grams.</v>

38
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be in a safe and the safe had</v>

39
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>to be disguised in a wooden cabinet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the had to be bolted to the floor.</v>

40
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.770
<v Speaker 1>They were harder than the U.</v>
<v Speaker 1>S it was ridiculous,</v>

41
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we eventually prevailed.</v>

42
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.420
<v Speaker 1>We just took every ridiculous thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did it.</v>

43
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my policy is surrender when there's</v>

44
00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of irrational things</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from people who are more</v>

45
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to give it to them.</v>

46
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably why you're in the</v>

47
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>position that you're in your facilitator</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>

48
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to dialogue venture forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the legislation that is</v>

51
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.460
<v Speaker 2>being passed right now in several states</v>
<v Speaker 2>to start to try to stop,</v>

52
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.190
<v Speaker 2>to prohibit with these guys are doing my</v>
<v Speaker 2>filming under cover,</v>

53
00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:37.671
<v Speaker 2>so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

54
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:39.020
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How has,</v>

55
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's that flying?</v>

56
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.460
<v Speaker 2>How are they allowing people to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because everyone is outraged when they</v>

57
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:45.050
<v Speaker 2>see those videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the media,</v>

58
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.220
<v Speaker 2>they watched those videos of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I saw one of this abuse that was</v>

59
00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:52.960
<v Speaker 2>going on with these cows were the sky</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like hitting a cow with a crowbar</v>

60
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.620
<v Speaker 2>and it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So horrific.</v>

61
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.170
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another thing is being exposed by</v>

62
00:02:57.171 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that that video could</v>

63
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 3>have very well come from the guy that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>feature.</v>

64
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's sort of the main one of the biggest</v>

65
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.800
<v Speaker 3>undercover animal rights activist and</v>
<v Speaker 3>blur out his face or his voice.</v>

66
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 3>But we definitely heard his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually he has,</v>

67
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 3>he's had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many name changes</v>

68
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 3>throughout his life and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been doing it for 10 years and he's</v>

69
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.730
<v Speaker 3>sort of a few ever want to do any</v>
<v Speaker 3>undercover filming.</v>

70
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 3>This is the guy who needs to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

71
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 3>And he actually gave me some training</v>
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of all of this show is</v>

72
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 3>about undercover filming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gave me some training into filming</v>

73
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.560
<v Speaker 3>undercover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sent me out into the parking lot and</v>

74
00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 3>told me that first I had to go to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman over there.</v>

75
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 3>She's a perfect stranger and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask her.</v>

76
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 3>You have to get information from her.</v>

77
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 3>I want to know where she lived before</v>
<v Speaker 3>she lived here and I had to go and do</v>

78
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 3>that and I passed that really easily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then the second test that he made me</v>

79
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:51.751
<v Speaker 3>do was I had to go out there and make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman sort of run away from me because</v>

80
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 3>she was scared and I'm not very good at</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

81
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm good at getting information from</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

82
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 3>but I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not in my nature to be mean or</v>

83
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 3>scary or intimidating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I went to a parking lot and I</v>

84
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 3>just started acting wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy and not really scary.</v>

85
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 3>Just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where is water?</v>

86
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 3>Where can I find some water?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were just staring at me with this</v>

87
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 3>crazy woman probably thinking that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>on bath salts.</v>

88
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 3>Are they trying to get you to do all</v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

89
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 3>So this is part of the training is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to make people feel</v>

90
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 3>either very comfortable with you so they</v>
<v Speaker 3>give you information that you need,</v>

91
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 3>that you want to get for your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your undercover filming or very</v>

92
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable with you so that you feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>the need to either leave.</v>

93
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 3>So you can fill more or intimidating to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a point,</v>

94
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 3>intimidated to the point that you will</v>
<v Speaker 3>release any information you give without</v>

95
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 3>actually resorting to violence</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>

96
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 3>So it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really an interesting little</v>

97
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:44.980
<v Speaker 3>practice that we had with them.</v>

98
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.500
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing how much people identify</v>
<v Speaker 2>with their genitals because there's a</v>

99
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.460
<v Speaker 2>thing that women hate more than not want</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than anything was left.</v>

100
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a massive generalization</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has taught myself.</v>

101
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 2>But there's one thing that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>women really do not appreciate.</v>

102
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.800
<v Speaker 2>And that's stinky pussy jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

103
00:05:03.801 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 2>you could talk about your stinky feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who can talk about a girl.</v>

104
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Stinky feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can talk about a girl's breath.</v>

105
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 2>You can talk about our girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't talk about a girl stinky</v>

106
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 2>pussy to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can lose a lot of people that don't</v>

107
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:18.820
<v Speaker 2>like when you talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even onstage,</v>

108
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.481
<v Speaker 2>really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

109
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

110
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 2>I've seen someone do a stinky pussy joke</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen women in the audience</v>

111
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

112
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just upset that you put that possibility</v>

113
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never smelled a bed fucking pussy</v>

114
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.180
<v Speaker 2>like</v>
<v Speaker 2>coke.</v>

115
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking gets that.</v>

116
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.010

<v Speaker 2>Smells like fish.</v>

136
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.960
<v Speaker 2>So realizing I used to take ladies about</v>
