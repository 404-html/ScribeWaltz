1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my boy woke me up at like every hour.</v>

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping I didn't have mommy brain</v>

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.750
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're alive.</v>

4
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.330
<v Speaker 2>The newly mommy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Rhonda Patrick.</v>

5
00:00:10.331 --> 00:00:12.430
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>congratulations on making people.</v>

6
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Thank you Mandy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Person.</v>

7
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the colonial project was a success.</v>

8
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>We were talking</v>

9
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.710
<v Speaker 2>for the show about what a strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological shift happens in your mind </v>

10
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 2>and isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing,</v>

11
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not just your mind,</v>

12
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:26.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your person.</v>

13
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:32.641
<v Speaker 1>It's completely amazing am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea that I would love being a </v>

15
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:35.890
<v Speaker 1>mom so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of waited till later in life to,</v>

16
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.030
<v Speaker 1>to have a child and that was for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason because as you know,</v>

17
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.970
<v Speaker 1>really driven and loved what I was doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in science and I felt I didn't feel that</v>

18
00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>calling to like I've got to reproduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

19
00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Forgot to reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then finally I was like,</v>

20
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:52.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I don't reproduce now I might not get</v>

21
00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:53.170
<v Speaker 1>a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

22
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

23
00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:58.420
<v Speaker 1>that sort of pressure kind of nudged me </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit I think.</v>

24
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

25
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>the whole process of getting pregnant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and having this like,</v>

26
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>person growing inside of me,</v>

27
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>just the whole thing was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after having the baby and he's </v>

28
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.201
<v Speaker 1>like a person now and he's four months </v>
<v Speaker 1>old and developing this little </v>

29
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:19.201
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like so amazed by how in love I am </v>

30
00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:23.590
<v Speaker 1>with him and how like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much I would do anything for him and</v>

31
00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:28.591
<v Speaker 1>how almost nothing really affects me as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much like stress of various things in </v>

32
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:29.140
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.260
<v Speaker 1>I just look at him and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see him,</v>

34
00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:37.261
<v Speaker 1>smile at me and do some little things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are like uniquely him and the </v>

35
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:38.620
<v Speaker 1>wonder and awe in his eyes and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like gone,</v>

36
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.440
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really amazing sound.</v>

37
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

38
00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:45.770
<v Speaker 2>It changes your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It changes who you are as a human being,</v>

39
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in uh,</v>

40
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.920
<v Speaker 2>changes in a way that you did have a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of friends that are like,</v>

41
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:53.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't want kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never wanted kids.</v>

42
00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:55.700
<v Speaker 2>And like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of didn't really want kids either</v>

43
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 2>when I was 30 kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then once you have them,</v>

44
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.040
<v Speaker 2>you realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

45
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:09.041
<v Speaker 2>like I was just sort of attached to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of living my life the way I was </v>

46
00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:09.440
<v Speaker 2>living it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

47
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.650
<v Speaker 2>this is the way I like to live life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have a kid,</v>

48
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:13.130
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

49
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:15.680
<v Speaker 2>I love this kid more than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like.</v>

50
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.740
<v Speaker 2>So now my whole idea of what life is </v>
<v Speaker 2>shifts into this new paradigms and also </v>

51
00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 2>the thing like reproduce always weirds </v>
<v Speaker 2>me out because you're not,</v>

52
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.670
<v Speaker 2>you're making people not reproducing </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

53
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>

54
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:32.780
<v Speaker 2>you're making people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole new person.</v>

55
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:34.130
<v Speaker 2>You're not reproducing you.</v>

56
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.040
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

57
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>it is in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's definitely reproductions </v>

58
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>the right way to say you're passing on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the same,</v>

59
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>variations in genes that you have and </v>

60
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously,</v>

61
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are similarities in the way they </v>

62
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 1>look to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

63
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>to both you and your spouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

64
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>it is a completely new person with a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

65
00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.110
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that is shaped a lot by your diet </v>

66
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.110
<v Speaker 1>and exercise</v>

67
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 3>and all those things that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even aside from your actual genetics and</v>

68
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 3>passing on the sequence of DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just,</v>

69
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you do in your lifestyle </v>

70
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.120
<v Speaker 3>actually can affect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

71
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the child's neurocognitive development </v>

72
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.690
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

73
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.920
<v Speaker 3>met metabolism now where you cognizant </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that or you obviously you're very </v>

74
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 3>aware of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But did you,</v>

75
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 3>what did you do to act on that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should ask?</v>

76
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean I did.</v>

77
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely became obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to optimize everything I could,</v>

78
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm a scientist and I can sort </v>

79
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.680
<v Speaker 3>of sift through the literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I,</v>

80
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.780
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of get stuck in this loop </v>

81
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.831
<v Speaker 3>where you want to like optimize </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and you kind of have to like </v>

82
00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:40.831
<v Speaker 3>chill out a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

83
00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 3>during pregnancy I wanted to make sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

84
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 3>all the micronutrients I was getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

85
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:50.851
<v Speaker 3>because they're so important for brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>development and like full late </v>

86
00:03:50.851 --> 00:03:50.851
<v Speaker 3>magnesium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>iron,</v>

87
00:03:50.851 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 3>zinc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then Dha,</v>

88
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 3>vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these things were super important.</v>

89
00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually with the Dha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found out that I'm taking,</v>

90
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:05.761
<v Speaker 3>so Dha is the marine omega three fatty </v>
<v Speaker 3>acid that's predominantly found in like </v>

91
00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 3>micro algae for vegetarians versus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in fish fatty fish,</v>

92
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.240
<v Speaker 3>well it turns out that the Dha that's in</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's called phospholipid form,</v>

93
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 3>which is something that's found in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>row of fish.</v>

94
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 3>So like fish eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also found in Krill as well.</v>

95
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fish only have like a small </v>

96
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.111
<v Speaker 3>percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fish have Dha like one percent of </v>

97
00:04:31.111 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 3>their djs and phospholipid form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the row of the fish,</v>

98
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 3>anywhere between 40 to 70 percent is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>phospholipid form.</v>

99
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 3>And the thing that's really cool about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is that the fossil liquid form,</v>

100
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 3>it's been shown when you take that </v>
<v Speaker 3>orally,</v>

101
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.770
<v Speaker 3>it stays more of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it ends up in the phospho lip,</v>

102
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.840
<v Speaker 3>a certain type of phospholipid form in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the blood that has been shown to get </v>

103
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.261
<v Speaker 3>into the developing fetal brain 10 times</v>
<v Speaker 3>better than an Dha and non libet form </v>

104
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 3>free fatty acid form.</v>

105
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.210
<v Speaker 3>So it was just something that should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>consumed.</v>

106
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 3>Look for regular people as well or for </v>
<v Speaker 3>primarily mothers.</v>

107
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for I think both,</v>

108
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.350
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that it gets taken up into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the developing fetal brain 10 times </v>

109
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 3>better was enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

110
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.430
<v Speaker 3>ammunition for me to be like I'm eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Salmon Roe,</v>

111
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:16.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

112
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.820
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're all have also been studies on</v>

113
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.950
<v Speaker 3>preclinical studies on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

114
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking Dha,</v>

115
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 3>EPA and fossil performing in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in mice.</v>

116
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.650
<v Speaker 3>It's taken up better than non fossil </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lippitt.</v>

117
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.660
<v Speaker 3>And then there's been some clinical </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies where they like radio label and </v>

118
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.660
<v Speaker 3>follow it in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

119
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 3>it's taken up better in the brain by </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans as well.</v>

120
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.060
<v Speaker 3>And actually what's really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>is I just submitted a paper for </v>

121
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.531
<v Speaker 3>publication on Alzheimer's disease and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain variation in a gene called apoe </v>

122
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:52.321
<v Speaker 3>e four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think you and I talked a lot </v>

123
00:05:52.321 --> 00:05:52.321
<v Speaker 3>about traumatic brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

124
00:05:52.321 --> 00:05:53.680
<v Speaker 3>and susceptibility to Alzheimer's </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>

125
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 3>And basically I'm a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

126
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 3>dementia type of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

127
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 3>well April before sort of helps increase</v>
<v Speaker 3>that risk.</v>

128
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 3>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

129
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.220
<v Speaker 3>turns out there is because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>different transport mechanisms to get </v>

130
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.280
<v Speaker 3>Dha into the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The phospholipid form appears to be </v>

131
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 3>better for April before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's sort of my finding.</v>

132
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to get all into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanism,</v>

133
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:21.251
<v Speaker 3>but that's hopefully fingers crossed </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be accepted for peer review </v>

134
00:06:21.251 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 3>from peer review with the next couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

135
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you eating Salmon Roe,</v>

136
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 3>that's what you were saying you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting your source from?</v>

137
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

138
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was eating Salmon Roe.</v>

139
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was ordering it from a company that,</v>

140
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has wild Alaskan Salmon Roe and then you</v>

141
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:39.220
<v Speaker 3>can buy it in bulk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The company was called a vital choice is</v>

142
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.260
<v Speaker 3>nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It tasted nasty during my first </v>

143
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.810
<v Speaker 3>trimester.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

144
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I should wait.</v>

145
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.060
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the texture a lot of people don't like,</v>

146
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.210
<v Speaker 3>like Dan doesn't like the texture </v>
<v Speaker 3>because like the salmon roe is like </v>

147
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.270
<v Speaker 3>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fish eggs are bigger and so it can </v>

148
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.101
<v Speaker 3>kind of pop in like you get like little </v>
<v Speaker 3>fish to fish for trout really trout </v>

149
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:07.421
<v Speaker 3>would eat salmon roe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we would fish for trout using salmon </v>

150
00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:07.421
<v Speaker 3>eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

151
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean the salmon eggs are like quite a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit larger.</v>

152
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The credit larger,</v>

153
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:16.271
<v Speaker 3>there's other ones like I think it's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>flying fish that are really small in the</v>

154
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:21.731
<v Speaker 3>Fascial Epa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dha and foster the bid form varies from </v>

155
00:07:21.731 --> 00:07:21.731
<v Speaker 3>species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

156
00:07:21.731 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 3>different types of fish and things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

157
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:24.830
<v Speaker 3>But generally speaking they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

158
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:29.831
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a good thing to eat and especially </v>

159
00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:30.350
<v Speaker 3>during pregnancy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how did you consume it on Avocados?</v>

160
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:33.010
<v Speaker 3>I put it on top of Bob Ocado is with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some lemon juice and like,</v>

161
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:33.990
<v Speaker 3>like hot sauce.</v>

162
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 3>So just kind of like a Paleo training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

163
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:40.870
<v Speaker 3>it was like a lot of fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So avocados have potassium,</v>

164
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.670
<v Speaker 3>low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mono unsaturated fat and vitamin E,</v>

165
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.060
<v Speaker 3>all the different forms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

166
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:50.070
<v Speaker 3>So Avocados,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mono unsaturated fat and saturated </v>

167
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.070
<v Speaker 3>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

168
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 3>They have a small amount of saturated </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>

169
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.510
<v Speaker 3>Probably a small amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

170
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.710
<v Speaker 3>When I say they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

171
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.380
<v Speaker 3>typically when I talk about foods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

172
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.610
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk about what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

173
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:03.670
<v Speaker 3>what's concentrated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like really concentrated in </v>

174
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Mahnomen saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whereas like if you say,</v>

175
00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:09.951
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>butter or cheese and it's concentrated </v>

176
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:12.661
<v Speaker 3>in saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but typically you'll find mono poly and </v>

177
00:08:12.661 --> 00:08:14.420
<v Speaker 3>saturated fat in all different forms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>

178
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 3>It just very varying amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

179
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 3>And to some degree it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's not even really significant.</v>

180
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:24.041
<v Speaker 3>It's such a small amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much of the Salmon Roe </v>

181
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:24.041
<v Speaker 3>were you consuming?</v>

182
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:29.470
<v Speaker 3>It really depends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I started to really start to ramp </v>

183
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.920
<v Speaker 3>up my consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the third trimester when brain </v>

184
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.670
<v Speaker 3>development and just like really getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy thinking about this every day.</v>

185
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.600
<v Speaker 3>So every day I was putting a big old </v>
<v Speaker 3>tablespoon full on top of my avocado.</v>

186
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.960
<v Speaker 3>A really third trimester was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like almost everyday trying to </v>

187
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.830
<v Speaker 3>consume it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was hard for me.</v>

188
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:52.850
<v Speaker 3>The first trimester I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started to try a little bit and it </v>

189
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.621
<v Speaker 3>made me a little nauseous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I know if your kid can read minds </v>

190
00:08:56.621 --> 00:08:57.180
<v Speaker 3>when it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes out and he's like super brain.</v>

191
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.140
<v Speaker 3>Everyone probably is super biased about </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own children,</v>

192
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got great verbal skills and him </v>

193
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 3>super smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're super smart.</v>

194
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 3>Like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're eating all these fish,</v>

195
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 3>eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>

196
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.040
<v Speaker 3>This kid said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

197
00:09:12.041 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be interesting.</v>

198
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 3>It can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can talk to him.</v>

199
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.060
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be forced sitting right </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

200
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.290
<v Speaker 3>What's funny is he was like early on </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was six weeks old,</v>

201
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went through a really short stage of.</v>

202
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.410
<v Speaker 3>He was making sounds that sounded like </v>
<v Speaker 3>hello.</v>

203
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.410
<v Speaker 3>And so my mom would come over and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>would in his face,</v>

204
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 3>she would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hello,</v>

205
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.380
<v Speaker 3>hello.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he would.</v>

206
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.300
<v Speaker 3>And we have a video of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I could send it to you,</v>

207
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:41.301
<v Speaker 3>I'll send it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would go and it like literally seems </v>

208
00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 3>like he's saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but clearly he's not.</v>

209
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:43.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's six weeks old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

210
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:48.410
<v Speaker 3>But he was able to sort of mimic the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sound because I think it was easier for </v>

211
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 3>him since he was already sort of making </v>
<v Speaker 3>those sounds.</v>

212
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.070
<v Speaker 3>So of course Dan and Ryan and Dan and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>were super pumped.</v>

213
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna be a genius.</v>

214
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 3>We're sending the video to other family </v>
<v Speaker 3>members.</v>

215
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.780
<v Speaker 3>You should really listen to what we say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

216
00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.540
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

217
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 3>of course you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not really saying hello,</v>

218
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.730
<v Speaker 3>but making noises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's making noises.</v>

219
00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:10.731
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was totally coincidental but was </v>

220
00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:13.540
<v Speaker 3>just the difference between like a kid </v>
<v Speaker 3>making a noise and a kid knowing what </v>

221
00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.060
<v Speaker 3>the noise means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when they're actually talking to my</v>

222
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:16.830
<v Speaker 3>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my seven year old,</v>

223
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:22.300
<v Speaker 3>the seven year old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she didn't really start talking in full </v>

224
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Speaker 3>sentences until she was like a year and </v>
<v Speaker 3>a half,</v>

225
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.070
<v Speaker 3>but my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my nine year old,</v>

226
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 3>like when she was like nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 months old,</v>

227
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 3>she was talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>

228
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like she's really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she was talking like right away,</v>

229
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.600
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she was stood up quicker too.</v>

230
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.780
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was standing at like nine months </v>

231
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:41.780
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I found pretty shocking,</v>

232
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.660
<v Speaker 3>like an unassisted standing.</v>

233
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.470
<v Speaker 3>That's when she wanted to stand in nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>months old.</v>

234
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:50.130
<v Speaker 3>She was getting her stand on and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to take some steps and I was like</v>

235
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:51.930
<v Speaker 3>this crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she's just,</v>

236
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.360
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how she is as a little person </v>

237
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:57.360
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a little go getter.</v>

238
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.860
<v Speaker 3>I often wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

239
00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 3>that the earlier the first borns and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ones that are born earlier,</v>

240
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:06.330
<v Speaker 3>like if they get more attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's novel here,</v>

241
00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:09.390
<v Speaker 3>they're first time parents and then as </v>
<v Speaker 3>more children come,</v>

242
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're just,</v>

243
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.460
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're spread a little more thin and you</v>

244
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:14.990
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

245
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.480
<v Speaker 3>it's not necessarily the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's certainly something I've often </v>

246
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:20.520
<v Speaker 3>wondered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

247
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.070
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we,</v>

248
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.780
<v Speaker 3>if I want to have another child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will I be able to do it,</v>

249
00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:26.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because I really just wanted.</v>

250
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.550
<v Speaker 3>There's so much work that goes into not </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

251
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nutrition part.</v>

252
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.150
<v Speaker 3>And I was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you asked me about,</v>

253
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:38.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things during pregnancy and something I </v>

254
00:11:38.151 --> 00:11:38.760
<v Speaker 3>think people don't realize is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

255
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.670
<v Speaker 3>epigenetics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is basically the transference of,</v>

256
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

257
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.950
<v Speaker 3>it's heritable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can transfer things that </v>

258
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.141
<v Speaker 3>happened to you in your lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 3>without actually altering the sequence </v>

259
00:11:51.141 --> 00:11:52.670
<v Speaker 3>of DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can do that by changing how much</v>

260
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.020
<v Speaker 3>gene is activated or not activated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's been studies,</v>

261
00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:59.110
<v Speaker 3>lots and lots of stomach studies in </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals showing this to be the case.</v>

262
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:04.410
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's animals and how much of that </v>

263
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:04.610
<v Speaker 3>actually translates to humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a really interesting study</v>

264
00:12:04.611 --> 00:12:09.611
<v Speaker 3>a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was late 2015 that was </v>

265
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:13.111
<v Speaker 3>published that looked at the effect of </v>
<v Speaker 3>obesity and obesity was actually looked </v>

266
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:15.360
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in the mothers but the fathers.</v>

267
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so a sperm DNA was collected from,</v>

268
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:25.590
<v Speaker 3>for males that were obese and males that</v>
<v Speaker 3>were lean and that there's a variety of </v>

269
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:31.171
<v Speaker 3>different genes like hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different genes that were looked at and </v>

270
00:12:31.171 --> 00:12:34.050
<v Speaker 3>about 300 different genes were different</v>
<v Speaker 3>in how they were activated or not </v>

271
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.890
<v Speaker 3>activated in the sperm Dna of the obese </v>
<v Speaker 3>men.</v>

272
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.710
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of those genes had to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognition,</v>

273
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.570
<v Speaker 3>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>memory and metabolism.</v>

274
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:46.050
<v Speaker 3>So that's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what was super interesting was that </v>

275
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:46.780
<v Speaker 3>these men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were morbidly obese or obese.</v>

276
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.730
<v Speaker 3>They underwent bariatric surgery and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their sperm DNA was collected,</v>

277
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:52.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

278
00:12:52.541 --> 00:12:54.850
<v Speaker 3>a couple of months after then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like close to a year after.</v>

279
00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:00.240
<v Speaker 3>And as time went on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their sperm DNA looked like the lean </v>

280
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:01.060
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

281
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.540
<v Speaker 3>so basically losing the weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just losing the weight.</v>

282
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Had an effect on these genes that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in cognition and metabolism.</v>

283
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.270
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

284
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.940
<v Speaker 3>lots of animal studies have shown </v>
<v Speaker 3>obesity has a negative effect on like,</v>

285
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:20.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>causing type one diabetes later in life </v>

286
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.240
<v Speaker 3>and different cognitive disabilities and</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

287
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:27.241
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is something like people that are </v>

288
00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:28.060
<v Speaker 3>wanting to conceive my might consider,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

289
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:32.500
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their health before trying to procreate.</v>

290
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:33.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

291
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:34.840
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that,</v>

292
00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:39.841
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't procreate if you're not </v>

293
00:13:39.841 --> 00:13:39.841
<v Speaker 3>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just something,</v>

294
00:13:39.841 --> 00:13:43.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another thing to think about and also I </v>

295
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.931
<v Speaker 3>think it's a motivating factor for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people because sometimes you don't care </v>

296
00:13:45.931 --> 00:13:45.970
<v Speaker 3>as much about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean some people don't,</v>

297
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:49.360
<v Speaker 3>they're just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but their child or their unborn child,</v>

298
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.760
<v Speaker 3>that's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

299
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:56.390
<v Speaker 3>a driver for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people to make a change like that </v>

300
00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:56.390
<v Speaker 3>would certainly hope it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

301
00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:00.871
<v Speaker 3>you have this opportunity to really </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally changed the way your child </v>

302
00:14:00.871 --> 00:14:01.630
<v Speaker 3>develops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just by your discipline,</v>

303
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:06.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just by whether or not you're taking </v>

304
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.701
<v Speaker 3>care of your own body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can literally change the future of </v>

305
00:14:08.701 --> 00:14:11.071
<v Speaker 3>your trial because you're saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these genes that are in this obese man </v>

306
00:14:11.071 --> 00:14:12.520
<v Speaker 3>sperm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they're represented that's going</v>

307
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:17.521
<v Speaker 3>to be passed onto the kid versus the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lean version of him pass those genes.</v>

308
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.890
<v Speaker 3>We've passed on to the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kid literally will have a different </v>

309
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:22.890
<v Speaker 3>starting point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

310
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.550
<v Speaker 3>Different starting point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's totally crazy.</v>

311
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

312
00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:30.190
<v Speaker 3>of course the child itself can change </v>
<v Speaker 3>things through epigenetics,</v>

313
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.060
<v Speaker 3>through their diet and lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're giving them a baseline here,</v>

314
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:34.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

315
00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:36.370
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

316
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.580
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a growing field.</v>

317
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:44.260
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the research has done in </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals because it's really difficult to</v>

318
00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.750
<v Speaker 3>do that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these sorts of experiments in humans.</v>

319
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:52.020
<v Speaker 3>But I think that this is sort of a proof</v>
<v Speaker 3>of principle at the very least looking </v>

320
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:52.880
<v Speaker 3>at sperm DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

321
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it,</v>

322
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.600
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something to consider.</v>

323
00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:59.870
<v Speaker 3>And I've had like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like friends of friends that have,</v>

324
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>

325
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.250
<v Speaker 3>that are overweight or obese and wanting</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have children.</v>

326
00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:06.620
<v Speaker 3>And so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to talk to them about that in a,</v>

327
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:09.380
<v Speaker 3>in a way that's not like condescending,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

328
00:15:09.381 --> 00:15:11.300
<v Speaker 3>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people do have a hard time,</v>

329
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.670
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to lose weight and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

330
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.680
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to find the right combination </v>

331
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:18.680
<v Speaker 3>of things that works for them.</v>

332
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:18.680
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

333
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 3>but I do think that people would get </v>
<v Speaker 3>more motivated if they're like,</v>

334
00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:21.680
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

335
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>affect my future child risk for type one</v>

336
00:15:24.531 --> 00:15:26.540
<v Speaker 3>diabetes or for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

337
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:31.630
<v Speaker 3>like how well what their Iq is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how well they're performing on learning </v>

338
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.920
<v Speaker 3>and memory test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it also avoid the horrific guilt that</v>

339
00:15:33.921 --> 00:15:38.921
<v Speaker 3>you would feel if you didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you started to see these things </v>

340
00:15:38.921 --> 00:15:40.170
<v Speaker 3>manifesting in your child when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize,</v>

341
00:15:40.171 --> 00:15:45.171
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sent this kid up in a shitty way </v>

342
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:47.291
<v Speaker 3>because I'm lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is essentially what a lot of the </v>

343
00:15:47.291 --> 00:15:48.220
<v Speaker 3>problem is with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that they don't have what,</v>

344
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.640
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mental,</v>

345
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:54.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people get angry if you say that </v>

346
00:15:54.641 --> 00:15:54.641
<v Speaker 3>either they're lazy because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>die it for.</v>

347
00:15:54.641 --> 00:15:55.790
<v Speaker 3>Forget that word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget to take away the word Lazy.</v>

348
00:15:55.791 --> 00:15:59.720
<v Speaker 3>You're unmotivated will say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for whatever reason,</v>

349
00:15:59.721 --> 00:16:04.721
<v Speaker 3>if you choose not to take care of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>health and you see that transfer into </v>

350
00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:07.670
<v Speaker 3>your child and you know that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>unhappy with your existence,</v>

351
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.760
<v Speaker 3>you know you're unhappy with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical body and you refuse to do or </v>

352
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.200
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason don't do enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you see these same problems </v>

353
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.540
<v Speaker 3>manifesting in your own baby and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize like,</v>

354
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.720
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started this kid off in a shitty way.</v>

355
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.610
<v Speaker 3>Like you're going to be riddled with </v>
<v Speaker 3>guilt.</v>

356
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:23.810
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

357
00:16:23.811 --> 00:16:28.811
<v Speaker 3>the thing is most people don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>about avid genetics and they don't </v>

358
00:16:28.811 --> 00:16:28.811
<v Speaker 3>really know that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're able to do that.</v>

359
00:16:28.811 --> 00:16:31.460
<v Speaker 3>So the more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more people are educated,</v>

360
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.730
<v Speaker 3>I think the better the outcome will be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like you said,</v>

361
00:16:34.731 --> 00:16:36.620
<v Speaker 3>the people that do now and then still do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

362
00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:37.400
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

363
00:16:37.401 --> 00:16:39.770
<v Speaker 3>the guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's like unbelievable.</v>

364
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like people who smoke when they </v>

365
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:44.800
<v Speaker 3>have a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

366
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:44.800
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so insane.</v>

367
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.010
<v Speaker 3>You see people that are pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking.</v>

368
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.740
<v Speaker 3>I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what state it was in,</v>

369
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:54.070
<v Speaker 3>but we were outside this convenience </v>
<v Speaker 3>store and there was a lady who was </v>

370
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:54.860
<v Speaker 3>clearly pregnant and she clearly was </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking cigarettes and I was like,</v>

371
00:16:54.861 --> 00:16:57.680
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just gross Canada.</v>

372
00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.540
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this hurts my feelings.</v>

373
00:16:59.541 --> 00:17:01.460
<v Speaker 3>Just watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That just hurts my feelings.</v>

374
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:02.720
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just make you sick.</v>

375
00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:03.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>

376
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:09.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's all sorts of studies that </v>

377
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:09.010
<v Speaker 3>have shown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

378
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:12.611
<v Speaker 3>of course smoking during pregnancy </v>
<v Speaker 3>causes or not causes associated with </v>

379
00:17:12.611 --> 00:17:15.080
<v Speaker 3>like Adhd and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

380
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:18.390
<v Speaker 3>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the movement,</v>

381
00:17:18.391 --> 00:17:20.420
<v Speaker 3>just like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a dyskinesia thing,</v>

382
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:21.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of problems.</v>

383
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:26.860
<v Speaker 3>So it's certainly like I having the </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge and continuing to read </v>

384
00:17:27.201 --> 00:17:28.370
<v Speaker 3>throughout pregnancy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then once,</v>

385
00:17:28.371 --> 00:17:29.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having the baby,</v>

386
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.030
<v Speaker 3>like one thing that I knew that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

387
00:17:32.031 --> 00:17:34.130
<v Speaker 3>really wanted to do was I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>breastfeed.</v>

388
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.810
<v Speaker 3>Like that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

389
00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:41.290
<v Speaker 3>like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the benefits of breastfeeding are just </v>

390
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.320
<v Speaker 3>amazing and this is something that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

391
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.460
<v Speaker 3>like my stepmother for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her generation also my,</v>

392
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.340
<v Speaker 3>my grandmother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know about like,</v>

393
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 3>so they weren't</v>

394
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.260
<v Speaker 1>recommended to breastfeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

395
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:55.140
<v Speaker 1>back in like the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it just wasn't,</v>

396
00:17:55.141 --> 00:17:57.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the benefits weren't known,</v>

397
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 1>but now we know like breastfeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of amazing.</v>

398
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:07.460
<v Speaker 1>There are something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something in breast milk called </v>

399
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:07.860
<v Speaker 1>human milk oligosaccharides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of these?</v>

400
00:18:07.861 --> 00:18:12.861
<v Speaker 1>Hmo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like 200 different of oligos </v>

401
00:18:12.861 --> 00:18:13.860
<v Speaker 1>human milk oligosaccharides in breast </v>
<v Speaker 1>milk.</v>

402
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.920
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the third most common factor </v>

403
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.011
<v Speaker 1>in breast milk behind lactose and fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 different ones and they cannot be </v>

404
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:26.130
<v Speaker 1>digested at all by like the infants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm digestive system.</v>

405
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like they co evolved specifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>to feed the microbiome in the gut of </v>

406
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.800
<v Speaker 1>these infants and they're in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically increasing the species of </v>

407
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.401
<v Speaker 1>bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm bifidobacteria in fantasy is one </v>

408
00:18:40.401 --> 00:18:40.401
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really important one,</v>

409
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing that they're,</v>

410
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.780
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only purpose that they serve </v>

411
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.540
<v Speaker 1>is to feed and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically populate the infant gut with </v>

412
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:55.011
<v Speaker 1>this beneficial bacteria and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this bacteria has been shown to one </v>

413
00:18:55.011 --> 00:18:59.570
<v Speaker 1>setup the immune system because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>digest these oligosaccharides and they </v>

414
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.801
<v Speaker 1>produce other molecules called short </v>
<v Speaker 1>chain fatty acids and those short chain </v>

415
00:19:03.801 --> 00:19:04.830
<v Speaker 1>fatty acids like lactate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>butyrate,</v>

416
00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Acetate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you've heard of those act as</v>

417
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:13.671
<v Speaker 1>what are called signaling molecules to </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically determine what kind of immune </v>

418
00:19:13.671 --> 00:19:13.860
<v Speaker 1>cells you're going to make.</v>

419
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.970
<v Speaker 1>So a big one that they do is they make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>t regulatory cells,</v>

420
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:20.280
<v Speaker 1>which are kind of immune cells that </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevents autoimmunity,</v>

421
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.010
<v Speaker 1>autoimmune responses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like children that are not,</v>

422
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

423
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.480
<v Speaker 1>that are not breastfed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lack like four different species </v>

424
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:29.480
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

425
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.800
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of gut bacteria and they have like a </v>

426
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.681
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three fold increased risk of allergies </v>

427
00:19:36.681 --> 00:19:36.681
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

428
00:19:36.681 --> 00:19:37.370
<v Speaker 1>autoimmune related diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

429
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.290
<v Speaker 1>it's doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also it's like preventing pathogenic</v>

430
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.080
<v Speaker 1>bacteria from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from like taking residents there.</v>

431
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because these human milk </v>

432
00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:48.490
<v Speaker 1>oligosaccharides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only are they feeding the beneficial</v>

433
00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:53.181
<v Speaker 1>bacteria will recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been found that they like break </v>

434
00:19:53.181 --> 00:19:55.200
<v Speaker 1>down biofilms that bacteria create to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

435
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:58.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically escape antimicrobial activity.</v>

436
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.310
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of antimicrobial things</v>
<v Speaker 1>in breast milk like lauric acid,</v>

437
00:20:02.311 --> 00:20:04.680
<v Speaker 1>which is also found in coconut oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

438
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:09.710
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human milk oligosaccharides </v>

439
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:10.140
<v Speaker 1>basically break down the biofilm so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lord acid can work better.</v>

440
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.790
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

441
00:20:11.791 --> 00:20:14.430
<v Speaker 1>and their stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are stem cells in breast milk,</v>

442
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.120
<v Speaker 1>mammary stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

443
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:21.140
<v Speaker 1>that blew my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's been like 10 years since </v>

444
00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.320
<v Speaker 1>the discovery of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like it's been.</v>

445
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's that the studies have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly done in mice,</v>

446
00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:30.690
<v Speaker 1>but they have measured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans have the same memory type of stem</v>

447
00:20:30.691 --> 00:20:34.020
<v Speaker 1>cells in their breast milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in animals and preclinical studies,</v>

448
00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:35.350
<v Speaker 1>it's been shown that those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

449
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.890
<v Speaker 1>those breast stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get digested.</v>

450
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.650
<v Speaker 1>They go into the bloodstream and they go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to various organs.</v>

451
00:20:40.651 --> 00:20:41.890
<v Speaker 1>They go to the kidney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the liver,</v>

452
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.020
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they start to,</v>

453
00:20:43.021 --> 00:20:48.021
<v Speaker 1>like in the pancreas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start to make like insulin </v>

454
00:20:48.021 --> 00:20:48.021
<v Speaker 1>producing cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

455
00:20:48.021 --> 00:20:48.021
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

456
00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.290
<v Speaker 1>So that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's only 10 years ago.</v>

457
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:51.640
<v Speaker 1>They didn't notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

458
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

459
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:57.270
<v Speaker 2>It's all happening so fast when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to knowledge of nutrition and the effect</v>

460
00:20:57.461 --> 00:20:58.400
<v Speaker 2>on the body and especially</v>

461
00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.740
<v Speaker 1>developing children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

462
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:04.210
<v Speaker 1>the breast milk thing is really what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because once I like,</v>

463
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:09.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my son and you immediately start </v>

464
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.830
<v Speaker 1>breastfeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had no idea it was going to be so</v>

465
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.500
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I thought it was just,</v>

466
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.330
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's not difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>

467
00:21:13.331 --> 00:21:18.331
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's difficult for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>women and a lot of women give up after </v>

468
00:21:18.331 --> 00:21:22.111
<v Speaker 1>like the first two weeks they give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know that it's just for </v>

469
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.050
<v Speaker 1>various reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets,</v>

470
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.350
<v Speaker 1>it can be extremely frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a new parent,</v>

471
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:29.360
<v Speaker 1>you're getting no sleep and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so um,</v>

472
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:34.770
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my son had a little bit of a tongue </v>

473
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:34.770
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

474
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Like the little thing on underneath his </v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue kind of prevented a tongue from </v>

475
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.470
<v Speaker 1>moving like as much as it's supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like he,</v>

476
00:21:41.471 --> 00:21:43.060
<v Speaker 1>when he opened his mouth and he'd latch </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

477
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:44.380
<v Speaker 1>there was a little bit of problem.</v>

478
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.630
<v Speaker 1>So the first two weeks were really hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

479
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:51.010
<v Speaker 1>but that sort of resolved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really had to try like my,</v>

480
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.750
<v Speaker 1>like Dan and I were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were taking,</v>

481
00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I was pumping some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some milk and we are putting it in a </v>

482
00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:57.880
<v Speaker 1>syringe with a little tube and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting them on the breast,</v>

483
00:21:57.881 --> 00:22:02.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't want to introduce the </v>

484
00:22:02.881 --> 00:22:02.881
<v Speaker 1>bottle so early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

485
00:22:02.881 --> 00:22:03.100
<v Speaker 1>and that was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

486
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I was getting no sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could totally see if you didn't know </v>

487
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.820
<v Speaker 1>all the benefits of breastfeeding that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>

488
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I could see how new mothers would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would give up because it's extremely </v>

489
00:22:15.491 --> 00:22:16.870
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

490
00:22:16.871 --> 00:22:21.871
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that I completely </v>

491
00:22:21.871 --> 00:22:21.871
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand now.</v>

492
00:22:21.871 --> 00:22:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I think previously I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can anyone not press feed,</v>

493
00:22:24.341 --> 00:22:24.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

494
00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.260
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>

495
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of problems that women</v>

496
00:22:28.991 --> 00:22:31.930
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are actually breast milk banks</v>

497
00:22:31.931 --> 00:22:36.931
<v Speaker 1>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so women can donate their breast milk </v>

498
00:22:36.931 --> 00:22:36.931
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

499
00:22:36.931 --> 00:22:37.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

500
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 1>can buy the breast milk instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting formula.</v>

501
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Now of course there's all sorts of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

502
00:22:41.831 --> 00:22:42.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

503
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:47.311
<v Speaker 1>they're getting enough vitamin D and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Omega three and what else are they </v>

504
00:22:47.311 --> 00:22:47.540
<v Speaker 1>taking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

505
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:53.060
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many different things that </v>

506
00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:53.060
<v Speaker 2>happen once you have children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breast milk,</v>

507
00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.810
<v Speaker 2>being a breastfeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure being one of them,</v>

508
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.840
<v Speaker 2>but the lack of sleep thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think most people just really </v>

509
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.150
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have any idea like what,</v>

510
00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:05.170
<v Speaker 2>what is happening and that they also </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand how difficult it is to </v>

511
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:06.630
<v Speaker 2>watch a child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right now it's difficult.</v>

512
00:23:06.631 --> 00:23:11.631
<v Speaker 2>Wait until the kid starts walking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start walking around and you have </v>

513
00:23:11.631 --> 00:23:14.811
<v Speaker 2>to follow them around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're literally like walking around </v>

514
00:23:14.811 --> 00:23:14.811
<v Speaker 2>with them everywhere they go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

515
00:23:14.811 --> 00:23:18.560
<v Speaker 2>don't put that in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't touch that lick that you'll get </v>

516
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.230
<v Speaker 2>electrocuted until it's like everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

517
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.640
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a,</v>

518
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say a project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

519
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:24.420
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

520
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.950
<v Speaker 2>it's just way more difficult in </v>
<v Speaker 2>consuming then.</v>

521
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
<v Speaker 2>And also your protective instincts are </v>
<v Speaker 2>ramped up so high.</v>

522
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:40.190
<v Speaker 2>Like my friend Eddie had a cats and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rabbits and he's talking about how much </v>

523
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.150
<v Speaker 2>he loves his rabbits and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

524
00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:47.210
<v Speaker 2>just wait until you have your kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to want to kill fucking </v>

525
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.450
<v Speaker 2>rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

526
00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:48.260
<v Speaker 2>no way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

527
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I love the cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the rabbits.</v>

528
00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:51.140
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as he had the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

529
00:23:51.141 --> 00:23:52.820
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right cats.</v>

530
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.020
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my cat wakes up,</v>

531
00:23:54.021 --> 00:23:55.350
<v Speaker 2>my kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to kill this fucking cat.</v>

532
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.740
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your protective mechanisms I know </v>

533
00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.020
<v Speaker 2>changes you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It changes you so much and you know,</v>

534
00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.170
<v Speaker 2>people that don't have children and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>complained about kids that are crying.</v>

535
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to bother me if I was on a plane </v>

536
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:11.560
<v Speaker 2>and babies are crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

537
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.250
<v Speaker 2>I used to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aww baby won't shut up.</v>

538
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.840
<v Speaker 2>But now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

539
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:18.050
<v Speaker 2>poor little baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like literally it doesn't bother me.</v>

540
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like someone could be a break right next</v>

541
00:24:20.151 --> 00:24:22.670
<v Speaker 2>to me with a crying baby and I feel bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the baby.</v>

542
00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:23.780
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

543
00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:25.190
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his baby won't shut up.</v>

544
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like a different.</v>

545
00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

546
00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I've started to experience that to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree in,</v>

547
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.760
<v Speaker 1>in various ways as well where it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

548
00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor baby.</v>

549
00:24:34.241 --> 00:24:35.850
<v Speaker 1>You become a different person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

550
00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.380
<v Speaker 1>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You relate to it.</v>

551
00:24:37.381 --> 00:24:37.980
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

552
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

553
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.080
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the best thing ever.</v>

554
00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

555
00:24:40.651 --> 00:24:42.450
<v Speaker 2>it creates so much empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

556
00:24:42.451 --> 00:24:45.690
<v Speaker 2>it just changed my whole perspective of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what a person is,</v>

557
00:24:45.691 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 2>is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

558
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.860
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my idea of a person used to be a static </v>

559
00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:51.990
<v Speaker 2>form like Jamie's 35,</v>
<v Speaker 2>35,</v>

560
00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.330
<v Speaker 2>34.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would say,</v>

561
00:24:54.331 --> 00:24:56.010
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's 34 year old Jamie.</v>

562
00:24:56.011 --> 00:24:57.330
<v Speaker 2>That's who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought,</v>

563
00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie was a baby.</v>

564
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.890
<v Speaker 2>Like Jamie used to be a four year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Jamie went to preschool.</v>

565
00:25:01.891 --> 00:25:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Jamie went to kindergarten there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about it that way.</v>

566
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.430
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

567
00:25:05.431 --> 00:25:06.180
<v Speaker 2>there's Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

568
00:25:06.181 --> 00:25:07.980
<v Speaker 2>what's up Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's always been Jamie.</v>

569
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:13.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like how I used to look at </v>

570
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.871
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're looking at everybody as a </v>

571
00:25:14.871 --> 00:25:14.871
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called,</v>

572
00:25:14.871 --> 00:25:17.070
<v Speaker 2>that's a baby that became a grown man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how I look at everyone now.</v>

573
00:25:17.071 --> 00:25:17.820
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

574
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:22.860
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a paradigm shift happened in </v>

575
00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:22.860
<v Speaker 2>my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

576
00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:23.730
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely weird.</v>

577
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.890
<v Speaker 2>It made me way more compassionate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way,</v>

578
00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:28.410
<v Speaker 2>way nicer to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is way I just,</v>

579
00:25:28.411 --> 00:25:31.830
<v Speaker 2>I think I don't want anybody's life to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall apart anymore.</v>

580
00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.830
<v Speaker 2>I used to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quieter.</v>

581
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.620
<v Speaker 2>I hope that guy gets hit by a truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

582
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:35.940
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

583
00:25:35.941 --> 00:25:38.400
<v Speaker 2>I hope that little baby figures out why </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's such an asshole.</v>

584
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Interesting to kind of see the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>activation pathways that change.</v>

585
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

586
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.840
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking about being more </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate,</v>

587
00:25:47.841 --> 00:25:52.841
<v Speaker 1>that's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a certain type of </v>

588
00:25:52.841 --> 00:25:56.531
<v Speaker 1>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the compassion meditation that </v>

589
00:25:56.531 --> 00:25:56.531
<v Speaker 1>people do that changes like certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the brain.</v>

590
00:25:56.531 --> 00:26:01.240
<v Speaker 1>It kind of interesting to see my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dan thinks that I've gotten more </v>

591
00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.600
<v Speaker 1>creative because I make up all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>like mommy games and mommy songs.</v>

592
00:26:02.601 --> 00:26:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Just like I never was really a super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super creative person.</v>

593
00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:08.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm more analytical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

594
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely have some creativity,</v>

595
00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:11.930
<v Speaker 1>but like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of like,</v>

596
00:26:11.931 --> 00:26:16.931
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if just like becoming a mommy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you just all of a sudden become </v>

597
00:26:16.931 --> 00:26:16.931
<v Speaker 1>more creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

598
00:26:16.931 --> 00:26:17.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

599
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's a bunch of stuff going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

600
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain just gets activated.</v>

601
00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:26.520
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do stuff with my seven year old </v>

602
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:26.650
<v Speaker 2>sometimes and half the time we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff I'm like,</v>

603
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:31.680
<v Speaker 2>I can't even believe you're real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm having these little </v>

604
00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.040
<v Speaker 2>conversations with her were playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>little games and you know,</v>

605
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:35.650
<v Speaker 2>like we play this really stupid game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so dumb.</v>

606
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:40.670
<v Speaker 2>So you spin this thing and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it corresponds to a different color </v>

607
00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:43.650
<v Speaker 2>acorns and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when she wins and she jumps up,</v>

608
00:26:43.651 --> 00:26:43.920
<v Speaker 2>she like,</v>

609
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.980
<v Speaker 4>oh I beat you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's like doing her little dance </v>

610
00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.950
<v Speaker 4>and she's like throwing her arms in the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

611
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:52.710
<v Speaker 4>this is like half of me is laughing </v>
<v Speaker 4>because she's funny,</v>

612
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.860
<v Speaker 4>but half of me is going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is so strange that you're a little </v>

613
00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:58.120
<v Speaker 4>person that I'm talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>

614
00:26:58.121 --> 00:27:03.121
<v Speaker 4>you were a baby and now you're this </v>
<v Speaker 4>little seven year old playing this game </v>

615
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:03.121
<v Speaker 4>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

616
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:05.730
<v Speaker 4>it's so odd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel that way with my four month old.</v>

617
00:27:05.731 --> 00:27:08.700
<v Speaker 4>I see little personality things already </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of creeping up and it's like,</v>

618
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:14.450
<v Speaker 4>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I can only imagine like as he </v>

619
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 4>continues to develop and that's why it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>very.</v>

620
00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:19.941
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very difficult for people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that don't have children to sort of </v>

621
00:27:19.941 --> 00:27:21.090
<v Speaker 4>develop that same level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>compassionate.</v>

622
00:27:21.091 --> 00:27:23.100
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like a cop out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like it sounds weird,</v>

623
00:27:23.101 --> 00:27:24.060
<v Speaker 4>but I really do.</v>

624
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:29.060
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's actually something to be gained </v>

625
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.500
<v Speaker 4>and as far as like everyone reproducing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well obviously we have too many people,</v>

626
00:27:31.501 --> 00:27:33.270
<v Speaker 4>so that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's the best thing.</v>

627
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 4>I certainly think that you could be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fully formed,</v>

628
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:42.231
<v Speaker 4>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wonderful person who contributes an </v>

629
00:27:42.231 --> 00:27:42.480
<v Speaker 4>amazing thing to the world if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have children.</v>

630
00:27:42.481 --> 00:27:45.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you have to have children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think for me it was,</v>

631
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.400
<v Speaker 4>it was very much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a,</v>

632
00:27:47.401 --> 00:27:51.250
<v Speaker 4>there was a giant learning experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>along with it.</v>

633
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.600
<v Speaker 4>There's a giant evolving experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>along with just being a parent.</v>

634
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.220
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something happened to me.</v>

635
00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.780
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

636
00:27:57.781 --> 00:27:59.820
<v Speaker 4>it's absolutely life changing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

637
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:01.730
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

638
00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:02.880
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea.</v>

639
00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:05.190
<v Speaker 4>Like I've always heard people say that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the best thing that happened to me,</v>

640
00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.980
<v Speaker 4>it truly is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It truly is the best thing.</v>

641
00:28:07.981 --> 00:28:09.040
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

642
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.470
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

643
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:11.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

644
00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:15.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm excited to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to continue to see how it changes me and</v>

645
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.600
<v Speaker 4>it just unfortunately corresponds with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of financial stress with a lot of </v>

646
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:20.600
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

647
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:20.750
<v Speaker 4>stress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>financial stress,</v>

648
00:28:20.751 --> 00:28:23.550
<v Speaker 4>last lack of sleep and sometimes they </v>
<v Speaker 4>just don't appreciate it,</v>

649
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:26.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just you're so overwhelmed by the burden</v>

650
00:28:26.461 --> 00:28:30.510
<v Speaker 4>of just trying to get by that sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't appreciate this amazing moment</v>

651
00:28:30.511 --> 00:28:32.580
<v Speaker 4>that happened in front of you and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

652
00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.140
<v Speaker 4>it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to,</v>

653
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.050
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to have a good perspective and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>

654
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.980
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to like be able to see things </v>
<v Speaker 4>from above,</v>

655
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.860
<v Speaker 4>like to sort of rise above and look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the big picture of this thing.</v>

656
00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.800
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

657
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.190
<v Speaker 4>something that really helps with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

658
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:48.870
<v Speaker 4>is exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

659
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.210
<v Speaker 4>I think that also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

660
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:55.980
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have any postpartum depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least I think I didn't.</v>

661
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think there's a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 4>factors.</v>

662
00:28:59.701 --> 00:29:00.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so for one,</v>

663
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

664
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:04.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during pregnancy,</v>

665
00:29:04.801 --> 00:29:06.450
<v Speaker 4>your estrogen levels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they,</v>

666
00:29:06.451 --> 00:29:11.451
<v Speaker 4>like they go through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like 100 fold higher and </v>

667
00:29:11.451 --> 00:29:15.790
<v Speaker 4>undertold something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's really high compared to your </v>

668
00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:17.370
<v Speaker 4>baseline,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and don't quote me,</v>

669
00:29:17.371 --> 00:29:19.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be something I'm thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

670
00:29:19.411 --> 00:29:24.411
<v Speaker 4>like I've just orders and orders of </v>
<v Speaker 4>magnitude higher and estrogen and has </v>

671
00:29:24.411 --> 00:29:29.121
<v Speaker 4>been shown to increase the expression of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a gene called Tryptophan hydroxylase to </v>

672
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.880
<v Speaker 4>in the brain that produces serotonin </v>
<v Speaker 4>from tryptophan.</v>

673
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.450
<v Speaker 4>So you're constantly making serotonin </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly,</v>

674
00:29:36.451 --> 00:29:37.200
<v Speaker 4>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly.</v>

675
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:38.400
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

676
00:29:38.401 --> 00:29:42.310
<v Speaker 4>after you have the baby that goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's Kinda like</v>

677
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:48.390
<v Speaker 3>a withdrawal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's sort of one biochemical </v>

678
00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:48.610
<v Speaker 3>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are many others.</v>

679
00:29:48.611 --> 00:29:50.830
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think your circadian rhythm is off.</v>

680
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.860
<v Speaker 3>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not getting enough light because </v>

681
00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:55.860
<v Speaker 3>you're like nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you.</v>

682
00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:55.860
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we left.</v>

683
00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:01.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even remember going outside for </v>

684
00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:01.140
<v Speaker 3>like two weeks maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

685
00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:01.490
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

686
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.700
<v Speaker 3>especially with the difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>breastfeeding part.</v>

687
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.760
<v Speaker 3>So it was like you're constantly inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not getting that bright light </v>

688
00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.490
<v Speaker 3>exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your sleep is completely disrupted.</v>

689
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:11.440
<v Speaker 3>So your circadian rhythm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

690
00:30:11.441 --> 00:30:12.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely,</v>

691
00:30:12.821 --> 00:30:15.340
<v Speaker 3>extremely important for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for mood,</v>

692
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.740
<v Speaker 3>for the way you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

693
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.630
<v Speaker 3>that is completely disrupted because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

694
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:20.620
<v Speaker 3>you're waking up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

695
00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:24.160
<v Speaker 3>multiple times a night and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely gone.</v>

696
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

697
00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.310
<v Speaker 3>and it's stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like completely new experience.</v>

698
00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:33.250
<v Speaker 3>You have this very fragile baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

699
00:30:33.251 --> 00:30:38.251
<v Speaker 3>that you're responsible for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that combination of all </v>

700
00:30:38.251 --> 00:30:39.610
<v Speaker 3>these things really can play a role in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

701
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and for me,</v>

702
00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:46.480
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really tried to make sure I was </v>

703
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.620
<v Speaker 3>getting exercise as soon as I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

704
00:30:47.621 --> 00:30:50.860
<v Speaker 3>so that is something because exercise </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a variety of reasons,</v>

705
00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:55.861
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been shown to increase the </v>

706
00:30:55.861 --> 00:30:57.250
<v Speaker 3>production of Serotonin by getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>transport of Tryptophan into the brain.</v>

707
00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:01.660
<v Speaker 3>So branched chain amino acids which are </v>
<v Speaker 3>found in a variety of,</v>

708
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.370
<v Speaker 3>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>proteins,</v>

709
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:08.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can outcompete trip to fan and to </v>

710
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:08.700
<v Speaker 3>get into the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're not exercising,</v>

711
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.410
<v Speaker 3>you're constantly getting the branch </v>
<v Speaker 3>chain amino acids in the brain which are</v>

712
00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:14.470
<v Speaker 3>serving other important roles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're not getting that trip to fan.</v>

713
00:31:14.471 --> 00:31:17.050
<v Speaker 3>So you're not getting the precursor to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make serotonin.</v>

714
00:31:17.051 --> 00:31:20.080
<v Speaker 3>And so the exercise alleviates that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that competition,</v>

715
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.080
<v Speaker 3>branch chain amino acids get taken up </v>
<v Speaker 3>into your muscle where they're,</v>

716
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:28.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're used to help build muscle which </v>

717
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.110
<v Speaker 3>is good.</v>

718
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.110
<v Speaker 3>And the Japan gets into the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're making Serotonin,</v>

719
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.200
<v Speaker 3>that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two,</v>

720
00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:30.290
<v Speaker 3>you're making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

721
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:31.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>endorphins,</v>

722
00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.960
<v Speaker 3>a Beta endorphins help so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another thing.</v>

723
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.980
<v Speaker 3>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

724
00:31:36.981 --> 00:31:41.981
<v Speaker 3>you're increasing the production of new </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurons through Serotonin also through </v>

725
00:31:41.981 --> 00:31:46.561
<v Speaker 3>brain drive neurotrophic factor that </v>
<v Speaker 3>also has been shown to help alleviate </v>

726
00:31:46.561 --> 00:31:47.710
<v Speaker 3>depression and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and prevent depression.</v>

727
00:31:47.711 --> 00:31:52.711
<v Speaker 3>The actual neurogenesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that helps you to stave off </v>

728
00:31:52.711 --> 00:31:52.711
<v Speaker 3>brain aging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>

729
00:31:52.711 --> 00:31:57.691
<v Speaker 3>there's been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was like 14 clinical trials that </v>

730
00:31:57.691 --> 00:31:59.410
<v Speaker 3>have been analyzed on looking at humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

731
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:04.500
<v Speaker 3>that undergo like a real big exercise </v>
<v Speaker 3>and how they have like their left part </v>

732
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.610
<v Speaker 3>of their hippocampus doesn't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>atrophy.</v>

733
00:32:06.611 --> 00:32:08.680
<v Speaker 3>Like people who do not exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

734
00:32:08.681 --> 00:32:10.660
<v Speaker 3>So that's like because the neurogenesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

735
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:15.690
<v Speaker 3>that's another reason you can visually </v>
<v Speaker 3>see it atrophy you some sort of animal </v>

736
00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.380
<v Speaker 3>products.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever looked,</v>

737
00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.960
<v Speaker 3>if you like google,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Alzheimer's Disease Brain,</v>

738
00:32:19.961 --> 00:32:24.961
<v Speaker 3>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's even images all over the place </v>

739
00:32:24.961 --> 00:32:27.421
<v Speaker 3>where they show like before and after </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's just like big holes in the </v>

740
00:32:27.421 --> 00:32:27.421
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just like,</v>

741
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:31.940
<v Speaker 3>it's like because someone was comparing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it to a football player was,</v>

742
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:33.970
<v Speaker 3>what's the guy's name who fell off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>car?</v>

743
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:36.910
<v Speaker 3>The guy was Henry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris and Chris Henry.</v>

744
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.410
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

745
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 3>I think he was only 28,</v>

746
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty six.</v>

747
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.100
<v Speaker 2>He was a young man who was an nfl </v>
<v Speaker 2>football player.</v>

748
00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.680
<v Speaker 2>No one had any idea he had cte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like a earlier,</v>

749
00:32:48.681 --> 00:32:50.540
<v Speaker 2>understandably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like seven years ago,</v>

750
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.380
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

751
00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:57.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm much less understanding about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects of cte and he had some sort of </v>

752
00:32:58.401 --> 00:33:01.250
<v Speaker 2>an altercation with his girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chased after her.</v>

753
00:33:01.251 --> 00:33:06.251
<v Speaker 2>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she jumped in a car and he didn't want </v>

754
00:33:06.251 --> 00:33:08.561
<v Speaker 2>her to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he jumped on top of the truck to try </v>

755
00:33:08.561 --> 00:33:09.290
<v Speaker 2>to hang on and fell off the truck and </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed himself.</v>

756
00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

757
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:16.210
<v Speaker 2>So they do an autopsy on him and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>find out that he has a brain of a 70 </v>

758
00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.020
<v Speaker 2>year old man with Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well and he's 28,</v>

759
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.210
<v Speaker 2>26,</v>
<v Speaker 2>28,</v>

760
00:33:20.211 --> 00:33:25.211
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was young under 30 and super athlete </v>

761
00:33:25.211 --> 00:33:28.370
<v Speaker 2>just and they were stunned and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at his brain and they're like,</v>

762
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:29.610
<v Speaker 2>well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

763
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:34.710
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't even make sense and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're finding that this is the case </v>

764
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.710
<v Speaker 2>with so many football players.</v>

765
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:35.750
<v Speaker 2>Just when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

766
00:33:35.751 --> 00:33:40.751
<v Speaker 2>when you went to see the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you and Dan with the see the UFC </v>

767
00:33:40.751 --> 00:33:45.640
<v Speaker 2>and I talked to you afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all went to dinner afterwards and </v>

768
00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.071
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your eyes were as big as dinner plates </v>

769
00:33:48.071 --> 00:33:48.071
<v Speaker 2>and you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so bad.</v>

770
00:33:48.071 --> 00:33:52.810
<v Speaker 2>So many bad things are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you started going into detail </v>

771
00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:54.380
<v Speaker 2>about the various things that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

772
00:33:54.381 --> 00:33:58.880
<v Speaker 2>It was so fascinating to watch you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientist.</v>

773
00:33:58.881 --> 00:34:03.560
<v Speaker 2>Watch people get head kicked and punched</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the face and watch.</v>

774
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.420
<v Speaker 2>Watch mma take place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

775
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:10.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of crazy to think about how </v>

776
00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:12.170
<v Speaker 2>people will like as a profession go and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

777
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:17.260
<v Speaker 2>like they're getting Tbi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like constantly getting their head and </v>

778
00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:17.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

779
00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:21.980
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely like if you look at </v>

780
00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:21.980
<v Speaker 2>the non,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

781
00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.630
<v Speaker 2>fighting forms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts where there like it,</v>

782
00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:26.930
<v Speaker 2>it seems a lot more beautiful like cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>moves and stuff,</v>

783
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

784
00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:33.340
<v Speaker 2>like the actual like getting your head </v>
<v Speaker 2>bashed and stuff like that's crazy.</v>

785
00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.530
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

786
00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:40.540
<v Speaker 2>and I understand money is a big driving </v>
<v Speaker 2>factor because they probably make a lot </v>

787
00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:40.540
<v Speaker 2>of money but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

788
00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:44.890
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's it worth when you're not able to </v>

789
00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:46.580
<v Speaker 2>enjoy it when you're older and you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>lose your brain.</v>

790
00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not just money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the excitement of it.</v>

791
00:34:49.011 --> 00:34:54.011
<v Speaker 2>The way I describe it is it's high level</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem solving with dire physical </v>

792
00:34:54.011 --> 00:34:55.310
<v Speaker 2>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high level problem solving.</v>

793
00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.660
<v Speaker 2>That's what fighting is like you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>skillset.</v>

794
00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:02.770
<v Speaker 2>I have a skill set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're playing a game and the game </v>

795
00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:05.561
<v Speaker 2>is I want to try to hit you with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>bones and you're trying to hit me with </v>

796
00:35:05.561 --> 00:35:09.131
<v Speaker 2>your bones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're trying to figure out who's </v>

797
00:35:09.131 --> 00:35:09.950
<v Speaker 2>better at it and I know that you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I know you,</v>

798
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:13.750
<v Speaker 2>you like if you get to a certain level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say what are.</v>

799
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:17.510
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I love about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is a Jujitsu sort of solve this,</v>

800
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:18.380
<v Speaker 2>but it does.</v>

801
00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:23.380
<v Speaker 2>So without hitting each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is all grappling and there's </v>

802
00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.230
<v Speaker 2>obviously a lot of injuries that come </v>
<v Speaker 2>through from Jujitsu.</v>

803
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:29.410
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what I meant when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was using something that looks </v>

804
00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:29.410
<v Speaker 2>kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

805
00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:33.411
<v Speaker 2>I like the world you just do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Championships just happened this past </v>

806
00:35:33.411 --> 00:35:33.411
<v Speaker 2>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching some of the videos online</v>

807
00:35:33.411 --> 00:35:35.970
<v Speaker 2>and you watch these really high level </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys going after it and it's,</v>

808
00:35:35.971 --> 00:35:40.971
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're attacking and counter attacking </v>

809
00:35:40.971 --> 00:35:42.480
<v Speaker 2>and you just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And me in my mind,</v>

810
00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:46.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking of the countless hours of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dedication and focus.</v>

811
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:49.680
<v Speaker 2>It's required to reach this level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>proficiency where they're just,</v>

812
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:54.980
<v Speaker 2>they know what to do and when to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to counter and they know and </v>

813
00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:55.500
<v Speaker 2>they're both black belts at a very high </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

814
00:35:55.501 --> 00:35:57.460
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

815
00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:02.540
<v Speaker 2>you're examining this game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't have the same feeling </v>

816
00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:05.340
<v Speaker 2>when someone loses that an mma fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>

817
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:10.341
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched the UFC this past weekend and </v>

818
00:36:10.341 --> 00:36:12.021
<v Speaker 2>there's some brutal knockouts and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you watch someone get caseload and you </v>

819
00:36:12.021 --> 00:36:12.630
<v Speaker 2>see their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their brain shut off,</v>

820
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.700
<v Speaker 2>their leg stiffened up and they'd go </v>
<v Speaker 2>flat.</v>

821
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 3>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw someone get knocked out,</v>

822
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.310
<v Speaker 3>I forgot who it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was like one of the last,</v>

823
00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:22.800
<v Speaker 3>like most exciting fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like he,</v>

824
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.600
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was crazy.</v>

825
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

826
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:31.360
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think we talked about this last </v>

827
00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.821
<v Speaker 3>time a couple years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the apoe e four gene I think really </v>

828
00:36:34.821 --> 00:36:38.661
<v Speaker 3>is something that would at least give </v>
<v Speaker 3>some insight because I mean it's known </v>

829
00:36:38.661 --> 00:36:40.840
<v Speaker 3>that people that have at least one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those gene,</v>

830
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:44.040
<v Speaker 3>that gene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can have really,</v>

831
00:36:44.041 --> 00:36:49.041
<v Speaker 3>really bad consequences if they get Tbi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're talking 10 to 20 fold more </v>

832
00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:53.100
<v Speaker 3>risk for Cte for other 20 fold more if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have.</v>

833
00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:54.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they have two copies of it.</v>

834
00:36:54.901 --> 00:36:57.390
<v Speaker 3>So they're like homozygous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a lot less common.</v>

835
00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:00.240
<v Speaker 3>One copy is more common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be,</v>

836
00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:01.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

837
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.590
<v Speaker 3>anywhere like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a two to five fold,</v>

838
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:09.180
<v Speaker 3>but when you have two copies it can be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be up 10 to 20 fold higher.</v>

839
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:11.700
<v Speaker 3>So that's something that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

840
00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:12.860
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

841
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:17.010
<v Speaker 3>with the MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC kind of fighting,</v>

842
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:19.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or football or boxing or you know,</v>

843
00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.590
<v Speaker 3>fill in the blank sports that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is very,</v>

844
00:37:22.591 --> 00:37:24.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a high risk for,</v>

845
00:37:24.311 --> 00:37:29.311
<v Speaker 3>for Tbi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think that's something that </v>

846
00:37:29.311 --> 00:37:31.671
<v Speaker 3>athletes should consider and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you probably would find ones that </v>

847
00:37:31.891 --> 00:37:32.340
<v Speaker 3>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

848
00:37:32.341 --> 00:37:34.200
<v Speaker 3>maybe I shouldn't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

849
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:39.470
<v Speaker 3>especially with football players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know quite a few football players who </v>

850
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:42.060
<v Speaker 3>are aware of this are actually backing </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the NFL at a very young age.</v>

851
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.120
<v Speaker 3>I think headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was a guy recently was 24 years</v>

852
00:37:45.121 --> 00:37:46.390
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just retired and he's like,</v>

853
00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

854
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:49.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he has a bright future apparently.</v>

855
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.320
<v Speaker 3>Well let's do it.</v>

856
00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:55.360
<v Speaker 2>We got sidetracked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you were talking about exercise and </v>

857
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:55.360
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>

858
00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:57.840
<v Speaker 3>what put the hippocampus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

859
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:58.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

860
00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:01.470
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the benefits of exercise on the brain,</v>

861
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:05.300
<v Speaker 3>which I know that I constantly talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this to you because it,</v>

862
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.200
<v Speaker 3>but it's just so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

863
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.450
<v Speaker 3>it's so damn important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so important,</v>

864
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.580
<v Speaker 3>so important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it is,</v>

865
00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:16.581
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it helps me with everything with the </v>

866
00:38:16.581 --> 00:38:17.160
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aging is like,</v>

867
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:21.360
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's the longterm effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it helps me with the short term which</v>

868
00:38:21.361 --> 00:38:23.160
<v Speaker 3>is like handling life and handling </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress.</v>

869
00:38:23.161 --> 00:38:28.161
<v Speaker 3>You were talking about how people have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard time seeing things from a higher </v>

870
00:38:28.161 --> 00:38:28.950
<v Speaker 3>level and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's so true,</v>

871
00:38:28.951 --> 00:38:31.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because life is hard,</v>

872
00:38:31.861 --> 00:38:33.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to like make it,</v>

873
00:38:33.331 --> 00:38:35.830
<v Speaker 3>you have to survive and if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a starting place,</v>

874
00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.960
<v Speaker 3>a starting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your baseline is,</v>

875
00:38:37.961 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 3>is kind of like you don't have a lot to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start with and you have to work all,</v>

876
00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the more work you have to put in.</v>

877
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.390
<v Speaker 3>So I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

878
00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.220
<v Speaker 3>getting distracted with trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

879
00:38:48.221 --> 00:38:50.050
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to like survive and try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

880
00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:55.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to like live a good life and get </v>

881
00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:55.120
<v Speaker 3>married and have kids and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be really stressful.</v>

882
00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:56.590
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

883
00:38:56.591 --> 00:39:01.591
<v Speaker 3>I have of course my own stresses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that the exercises,</v>

884
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:03.730
<v Speaker 3>the short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the short term effects I get from that,</v>

885
00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are helping with clarity.</v>

886
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.890
<v Speaker 3>Helping me with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

887
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:11.200
<v Speaker 3>being able to kind of take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a step back and not be so anxious.</v>

888
00:39:11.201 --> 00:39:16.201
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's controlled trials showing this </v>

889
00:39:16.201 --> 00:39:16.201
<v Speaker 3>as well with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with exercise.</v>

890
00:39:16.201 --> 00:39:16.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

891
00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:21.420
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the longest time have been a runner </v>

892
00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:21.760
<v Speaker 3>and running is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

893
00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:23.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the,</v>

894
00:39:23.791 --> 00:39:25.630
<v Speaker 3>the frame of mind I'm in when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>running,</v>

895
00:39:25.631 --> 00:39:28.990
<v Speaker 3>like it's kind of like this reflective </v>
<v Speaker 3>daydreaming,</v>

896
00:39:28.991 --> 00:39:33.991
<v Speaker 3>which some people in some studies say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well Jay dreaming is not good because </v>

897
00:39:33.991 --> 00:39:35.200
<v Speaker 3>you're ruminating when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>daydreaming.</v>

898
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:40.200
<v Speaker 3>But I think the daydreaming that you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're like running is a lot </v>

899
00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.920
<v Speaker 3>different from like if you and I are </v>
<v Speaker 3>having this conversation right now,</v>

900
00:39:41.921 --> 00:39:43.670
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

901
00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.780
<v Speaker 3>So that's called rumination and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like,</v>

902
00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:48.110
<v Speaker 3>that's a stressful kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

903
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:53.320
<v Speaker 3>Where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're not present because you're </v>

904
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:53.320
<v Speaker 3>worried about this other thing you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

905
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:53.320
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

906
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:57.100
<v Speaker 3>the daydreaming effect when I'm running </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a little bit more of a reflective.</v>

907
00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:00.250
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a cleansing for me.</v>

908
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.930
<v Speaker 3>So I've always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you run.</v>

909
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:07.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that you've recently gotten into </v>

910
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.470
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is over the past year.</v>

911
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:11.100
<v Speaker 3>The literally last January started </v>
<v Speaker 3>because a friend of mine how to run a </v>

912
00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:12.380
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Vegas.</v>

913
00:40:12.381 --> 00:40:15.930
<v Speaker 3>So five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I jumped in it with zero running at all.</v>

914
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:16.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

915
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:18.280
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

916
00:40:18.281 --> 00:40:18.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm in shape.</v>

917
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:21.310
<v Speaker 3>I'll just go run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I never ran.</v>

918
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.490
<v Speaker 3>I literally never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I run every week and it was hard for</v>

919
00:40:24.491 --> 00:40:24.820
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

920
00:40:24.821 --> 00:40:29.821
<v Speaker 3>because you're right part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's interesting is my cardio for </v>

921
00:40:29.821 --> 00:40:29.821
<v Speaker 3>everything else has gone through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>roof.</v>

922
00:40:29.821 --> 00:40:31.480
<v Speaker 3>It's because I'm running like brutal </v>
<v Speaker 3>trails,</v>

923
00:40:31.481 --> 00:40:36.210
<v Speaker 3>like really steep mountain trails and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing the most.</v>

924
00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.620
<v Speaker 3>It was four miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The least I do is one mile.</v>

925
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:40.530
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I do too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

926
00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:43.030
<v Speaker 3>it's essentially hill sprints.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

927
00:40:43.031 --> 00:40:48.031
<v Speaker 3>So you're doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting some high intensity in </v>

928
00:40:48.031 --> 00:40:48.031
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sprinting.</v>

929
00:40:48.031 --> 00:40:49.780
<v Speaker 3>It's very high intensity and it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all like really extensive cardio.</v>

930
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:52.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's heavy duty stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I run with my dog now.</v>

931
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.570
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's interesting is for me,</v>

932
00:40:55.571 --> 00:40:56.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after pregnancy,</v>

933
00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:01.150
<v Speaker 3>like I couldn't wait to go out running </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I think it was four weeks in four</v>

934
00:41:01.151 --> 00:41:02.310
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four weeks postpartum.</v>

935
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.630
<v Speaker 3>I went out for a run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw your instagram post.</v>

936
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:05.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

937
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.060
<v Speaker 3>So I went out for a run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was super extreme.</v>

938
00:41:07.061 --> 00:41:12.061
<v Speaker 3>That's probably the only post I did </v>
<v Speaker 3>because what I found out as I was </v>

939
00:41:12.061 --> 00:41:15.781
<v Speaker 3>running is I didn't feel so great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I felt like my bladder felt full </v>

940
00:41:15.781 --> 00:41:17.040
<v Speaker 3>even though it wasn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I would,</v>

941
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.470
<v Speaker 3>I would stop and go to the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on my run and then I was like,</v>

942
00:41:20.471 --> 00:41:21.550
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then run again.</v>

943
00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:26.080
<v Speaker 3>It still felt full and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not normal like this,</v>

944
00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so um,</v>

945
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:32.560
<v Speaker 3>so I went to my ob Gyn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked to him and apparently your pelvic</v>

946
00:41:32.561 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 3>floor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like changes</v>

947
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.430
<v Speaker 1>after having a baby and that can like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

948
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.260
<v Speaker 1>fall down and kind of hit your bladder a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>

949
00:41:39.261 --> 00:41:44.261
<v Speaker 1>And so it feels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some women actually like pee urinate </v>

950
00:41:44.261 --> 00:41:44.261
<v Speaker 1>when they're running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I never had it like that.</v>

951
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Well he looked at my pelvic floor was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like on a scale from zero to 10,</v>

952
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:50.150
<v Speaker 1>zero being the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your one.</v>

953
00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:50.870
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

954
00:41:50.871 --> 00:41:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Because I feel like a seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

955
00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.790
<v Speaker 1>And so he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you probably shouldn't have started</v>

956
00:41:55.791 --> 00:41:57.560
<v Speaker 1>running so soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't do that.</v>

957
00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you start doing some low </v>
<v Speaker 1>impact exercise and start doing these </v>

958
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.560
<v Speaker 1>like strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like strengthening your pelvic floor </v>

959
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:06.560
<v Speaker 1>with like key goals and some core </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>

960
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.910
<v Speaker 1>which I've been doing so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

961
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:09.200
<v Speaker 1>crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do?</v>

962
00:42:09.201 --> 00:42:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Like running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just walk out the door and go,</v>

963
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:12.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>

964
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:16.250
<v Speaker 1>And that was like my escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started doing this.</v>

965
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.720
<v Speaker 1>The cycling class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high intensity interval cycling class,</v>

966
00:42:20.721 --> 00:42:25.721
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an hour long and it's a spin class </v>

967
00:42:25.721 --> 00:42:25.721
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like the dance spin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's the,</v>

968
00:42:25.721 --> 00:42:28.940
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a spin class where you do hills and</v>

969
00:42:28.941 --> 00:42:31.670
<v Speaker 1>sprints and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an hour long,</v>

970
00:42:31.671 --> 00:42:36.671
<v Speaker 1>but you're mixing it with just a robotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you get these sprints and these </v>

971
00:42:36.671 --> 00:42:37.580
<v Speaker 1>hills and I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

972
00:42:37.581 --> 00:42:42.581
<v Speaker 1>really like it for multiple reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the group setting where I feel </v>

973
00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:46.040
<v Speaker 1>like the people around me and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still going at it,</v>

974
00:42:46.041 --> 00:42:47.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like motivating.</v>

975
00:42:47.211 --> 00:42:52.211
<v Speaker 1>So I keep going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that group that </v>

976
00:42:52.211 --> 00:42:55.541
<v Speaker 1>really like I push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it were just me on that bike for an </v>

977
00:42:55.541 --> 00:42:55.970
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I would be pushing it.</v>

978
00:42:55.971 --> 00:42:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Like I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I am pushing it.</v>

979
00:42:57.591 --> 00:42:59.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like amazing pushing it.</v>

980
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I feel that way about yoga class.</v>

981
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the growth is everyone's sort of </v>

982
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:07.200
<v Speaker 1>feeding off each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

983
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:07.200
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

984
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.460
<v Speaker 1>And then also having the instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a couple instructors that I</v>

985
00:43:09.461 --> 00:43:11.260
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really like and you know,</v>

986
00:43:11.261 --> 00:43:16.261
<v Speaker 1>because they liked their style and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of more like coaches and </v>

987
00:43:16.261 --> 00:43:19.650
<v Speaker 1>then the kind of instructor that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you want to feel there's an </v>

988
00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:22.351
<v Speaker 1>instructor that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they their cheerleader kind of want to </v>

989
00:43:22.351 --> 00:43:25.951
<v Speaker 1>make you feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the instructor where </v>

990
00:43:25.951 --> 00:43:25.951
<v Speaker 1>they're like a coach where they're like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trying to help you get better.</v>

991
00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:29.470
<v Speaker 1>So this icon does high intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high intensity interval training.</v>

992
00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:32.530
<v Speaker 1>And I've never really been into it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

993
00:43:32.531 --> 00:43:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

994
00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I would do some like jump squats and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>

995
00:43:36.521 --> 00:43:41.521
<v Speaker 1>like at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the first time I'm like </v>

996
00:43:41.521 --> 00:43:41.521
<v Speaker 1>really it's structured environment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really doing it.</v>

997
00:43:41.521 --> 00:43:46.381
<v Speaker 1>So I started reading about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like wanting to know because that's how </v>

998
00:43:46.381 --> 00:43:48.721
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I do something I'm like well I'm </v>

999
00:43:48.721 --> 00:43:50.861
<v Speaker 1>going to look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And either it will motivate me to like </v>

1000
00:43:50.861 --> 00:43:50.861
<v Speaker 1>really keep it up and do it more or I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

1001
00:43:50.861 --> 00:43:51.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't good,</v>

1002
00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:53.620
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started reading more and more about</v>

1003
00:43:53.621 --> 00:43:58.621
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's amazing the benefits of the </v>

1004
00:43:58.621 --> 00:43:58.621
<v Speaker 1>high intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were talking about how,</v>

1005
00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:00.280
<v Speaker 1>how your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1006
00:44:00.281 --> 00:44:02.710
<v Speaker 1>I think what you were describing was </v>
<v Speaker 1>your aerobic capacity</v>

1007
00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:08.330
<v Speaker 2>change for the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is kickboxing like the when when I hit </v>

1008
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:09.470
<v Speaker 2>the bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used to be that I would,</v>

1009
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I would struggle to do a three minute </v>
<v Speaker 2>round of,</v>

1010
00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:14.330
<v Speaker 2>of high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high intensity,</v>

1011
00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:17.420
<v Speaker 2>like hitting the bag kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now I can,</v>

1012
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:19.700
<v Speaker 2>I get through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bell goes off and I'm like,</v>

1013
00:44:19.701 --> 00:44:20.750
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1014
00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Like the bell just went off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1015
00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:27.371
<v Speaker 2>that's three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll have the 32nd rest by the </v>

1016
00:44:27.371 --> 00:44:27.371
<v Speaker 2>term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 second rest is up.</v>

1017
00:44:27.371 --> 00:44:28.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm fully recovered and I'm back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1018
00:44:28.911 --> 00:44:29.480
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1019
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I have more than double</v>

1020
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.040
<v Speaker 5>the endurance stay.</v>

1021
00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.190
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>

1022
00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:39.310
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're experiencing has been </v>

1023
00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:41.531
<v Speaker 1>studied in clinical studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically this aerobic capacity also </v>

1024
00:44:41.531 --> 00:44:46.210
<v Speaker 1>people call it a vo two Max,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the ability of your </v>

1025
00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:50.201
<v Speaker 1>lungs and your blood and your heart to </v>
<v Speaker 1>carry oxygen to your muscles are places </v>

1026
00:44:50.201 --> 00:44:50.520
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1027
00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:53.480
<v Speaker 1>during that intense push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the capacity to do that.</v>

1028
00:44:53.481 --> 00:44:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well as we age,</v>

1029
00:44:56.841 --> 00:44:59.990
<v Speaker 1>over the age of 25,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once we hit 25 and we continue on,</v>

1030
00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.230
<v Speaker 1>our aerobic capacity decreases by 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent per decade.</v>

1031
00:45:03.231 --> 00:45:05.120
<v Speaker 1>So like one percent per year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1032
00:45:05.121 --> 00:45:06.690
<v Speaker 1>So you're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1033
00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:08.430
<v Speaker 1>25 year 35,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1034
00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:13.500
<v Speaker 1>your vo two Max.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your is like 10 percent less than you </v>

1035
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.571
<v Speaker 1>were when you were 25.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it turns out doing these high </v>

1036
00:45:16.571 --> 00:45:17.210
<v Speaker 1>intensity interval classes during 24 of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1037
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:22.510
<v Speaker 1>which in this study it was like there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were 40 minutes long and there was four </v>

1038
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:23.970
<v Speaker 1>four minute pushes and then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1039
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:29.030
<v Speaker 1>recoveries in between and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah blah stuff they were able to </v>

1040
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.030
<v Speaker 1>improve.</v>

1041
00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:34.090
<v Speaker 1>And after eight weeks of doing 24 high </v>
<v Speaker 1>intensity classes improve their vo two </v>

1042
00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Max by like 12 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're basically adding a decade,</v>

1043
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to your point.</v>

1044
00:45:38.381 --> 00:45:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Many weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they did it.</v>

1045
00:45:39.711 --> 00:45:41.870
<v Speaker 1>They did 24 classes of this in eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>

1046
00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the interesting thing about that</v>

1047
00:45:44.121 --> 00:45:46.120
<v Speaker 1>study was they were also testing whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not like,</v>

1048
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:51.480
<v Speaker 1>like I'm doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like four weeks or </v>

1049
00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.941
<v Speaker 1>something really like short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just packing them all in the actually </v>

1050
00:45:54.941 --> 00:45:59.320
<v Speaker 1>didn't increase the vo two Max as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the recovery time was actually </v>

1051
00:45:59.320 --> 00:45:59.320
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

1052
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:02.890
<v Speaker 5>It's actually changed the way I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>about when it comes to training and my </v>

1053
00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:03.770
<v Speaker 5>advice that I give to people for </v>
<v Speaker 5>training because I used to think that it</v>

1054
00:46:03.771 --> 00:46:08.080
<v Speaker 5>was adequate to just do the sports </v>
<v Speaker 5>specific workouts like say if you wanted</v>

1055
00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:10.580
<v Speaker 5>to get better at Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just do Jujitsu.</v>

1056
00:46:10.581 --> 00:46:12.930
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to get better at kickboxing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just to your kickboxing.</v>

1057
00:46:12.931 --> 00:46:14.900
<v Speaker 5>The cardio you get from that will be </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough.</v>

1058
00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:20.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's the case anymore </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I'm stunned at how much of an </v>

1059
00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:23.921
<v Speaker 5>increase in cardio that I've gotten from</v>
<v Speaker 5>these hill sprints and now I realize </v>

1060
00:46:23.921 --> 00:46:23.921
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1061
00:46:23.921 --> 00:46:28.570
<v Speaker 5>what you can do is you can do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>independently of that work and it </v>

1062
00:46:29.511 --> 00:46:34.511
<v Speaker 5>doesn't really mess with that work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like say if I run in the morning and I </v>

1063
00:46:34.511 --> 00:46:39.011
<v Speaker 5>get a good two mile run,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can still hit the bag at three in the </v>

1064
00:46:39.011 --> 00:46:40.900
<v Speaker 5>afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the difference will be is I like,</v>

1065
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:45.910
<v Speaker 5>my legs will be tired from running,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not the same muscles that I </v>

1066
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:48.920
<v Speaker 5>use when I kick box.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what's similar in a lot of ways,</v>

1067
00:46:48.921 --> 00:46:53.921
<v Speaker 5>but with what's really changing for sure</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that my aerobic capacity is just way </v>

1068
00:46:53.921 --> 00:46:54.200
<v Speaker 5>bigger.</v>

1069
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.650
<v Speaker 1>It's just awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just different.</v>

1070
00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.960
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a marker of aging </v>
<v Speaker 1>aerobic capacity.</v>

1071
00:46:57.961 --> 00:47:02.961
<v Speaker 1>Vo Two Max.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never actually measured my own vo </v>

1072
00:47:02.961 --> 00:47:02.961
<v Speaker 1>two Max.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1073
00:47:02.961 --> 00:47:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I probably have to put that hosting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it because now that </v>

1074
00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:09.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing all this high intensity work </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm totally going to stick with it.</v>

1075
00:47:09.601 --> 00:47:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Like I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely want to get back to the</v>

1076
00:47:13.291 --> 00:47:17.070
<v Speaker 1>running and I've been sort of worried </v>
<v Speaker 1>about I can only do so much as a new mom</v>

1077
00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:22.071
<v Speaker 1>and working on a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you be interested in a treadmill </v>

1078
00:47:22.071 --> 00:47:22.071
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No?</v>

1079
00:47:22.071 --> 00:47:24.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love running outside like in nature,</v>

1080
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.140
<v Speaker 1>whether it's in the beach or I'm like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hills,</v>

1081
00:47:28.141 --> 00:47:29.790
<v Speaker 1>rolling hills and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1082
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 1>for</v>

1083
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:35.040
<v Speaker 3>the longest time I lived in Tennessee </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the weather there is not great and </v>

1084
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:37.780
<v Speaker 3>so I did do treadmill running and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1085
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.910
<v Speaker 3>I definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1086
00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:45.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't have the same daydreaming like </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect that I,</v>

1087
00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:50.130
<v Speaker 3>but I do definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's definitely good and I get a </v>

1088
00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:52.300
<v Speaker 3>lot from it from a treadmill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's something about,</v>

1089
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.840
<v Speaker 3>in fact there was some interesting study</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I don't know how long ago,</v>

1090
00:47:55.841 --> 00:47:59.620
<v Speaker 3>maybe a year ago or two that looked at </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that exercise,</v>

1091
00:47:59.621 --> 00:48:04.621
<v Speaker 3>I think they went for like walks or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something in nature versus like in the </v>

1092
00:48:04.621 --> 00:48:06.460
<v Speaker 3>metropolitan area and the benefits there</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

1093
00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:11.170
<v Speaker 3>there was more benefits in going for </v>
<v Speaker 3>walks in nature in terms of like,</v>

1094
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:12.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological benefits,</v>

1095
00:48:12.611 --> 00:48:15.340
<v Speaker 3>but also some of the variety of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>biomarkers that were measured.</v>

1096
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:18.910
<v Speaker 3>So it kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1097
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:19.840
<v Speaker 3>it is interesting.</v>

1098
00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:25.040
<v Speaker 5>I think we like to think of ourselves as</v>
<v Speaker 5>being detached from what we experienced </v>

1099
00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.700
<v Speaker 5>just in terms of even just visually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

1100
00:48:26.701 --> 00:48:31.650
<v Speaker 5>I think that those things have an effect</v>
<v Speaker 5>on not just how you think,</v>

1101
00:48:31.651 --> 00:48:33.990
<v Speaker 5>like how you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but who you are.</v>

1102
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1103
00:48:34.601 --> 00:48:39.601
<v Speaker 5>I think we are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have some sort of a symbiotic </v>

1104
00:48:39.601 --> 00:48:42.060
<v Speaker 5>relationship with our environment and </v>
<v Speaker 5>when your environment is cement in glass</v>

1105
00:48:42.061 --> 00:48:46.230
<v Speaker 5>and concrete and rubber and all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that we've created in cities that</v>

1106
00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.850
<v Speaker 5>there's a dull feeling that you get from</v>
<v Speaker 5>those things and then when you,</v>

1107
00:48:49.851 --> 00:48:53.250
<v Speaker 5>you can go and see a green meadow and </v>
<v Speaker 5>birds flying around and,</v>

1108
00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:58.410
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wind whistling through the leaves </v>

1109
00:48:58.410 --> 00:48:58.410
<v Speaker 5>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just,</v>

1110
00:48:58.410 --> 00:48:59.850
<v Speaker 5>it does something to your body does </v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

1111
00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:03.650
<v Speaker 5>not just your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something going on like you,</v>

1112
00:49:03.651 --> 00:49:05.700
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have like this feeling of,</v>

1113
00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:07.140
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is medicine.</v>

1114
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.060
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting something out of this.</v>

1115
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1116
00:49:10.331 --> 00:49:13.390
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's the noise </v>
<v Speaker 3>pollution,</v>

1117
00:49:13.391 --> 00:49:14.110
<v Speaker 3>the sound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1118
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:19.210
<v Speaker 3>like the cars and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's been shown to have a negative </v>

1119
00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:20.470
<v Speaker 3>effect on people's emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1120
00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:22.150
<v Speaker 3>and I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1121
00:49:22.151 --> 00:49:27.151
<v Speaker 3>there's the environmental things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're breathing in pollution and that </v>

1122
00:49:27.151 --> 00:49:28.240
<v Speaker 3>has been shown to increase inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>biomarkers and all that.</v>

1123
00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:33.660
<v Speaker 3>But there's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the just going out into nature </v>

1124
00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:33.660
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1125
00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.110
<v Speaker 3>you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Do,</v>

1126
00:49:35.111 --> 00:49:36.910
<v Speaker 3>you definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you definitely feel better.</v>

1127
00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:38.860
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1128
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:43.870
<v Speaker 3>not I live in the city and I live off of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a busy place and thankfully we're going </v>

1129
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:48.121
<v Speaker 3>to be moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's something I'm considering </v>

1130
00:49:48.121 --> 00:49:49.891
<v Speaker 3>where it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you moving specifically for that </v>

1131
00:49:49.891 --> 00:49:49.891
<v Speaker 3>reason?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1132
00:49:49.891 --> 00:49:53.450
<v Speaker 3>we're just in a small apartment right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and it's like I have a baby now and </v>

1133
00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.450
<v Speaker 3>it's fun to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1134
00:49:55.451 --> 00:49:58.360
<v Speaker 3>it was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was close to the beach and you know,</v>

1135
00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.170
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fun like,</v>

1136
00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.580
<v Speaker 3>but just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not something that,</v>

1137
00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:03.510
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1138
00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:05.100
<v Speaker 3>I could do with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1139
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:06.970
<v Speaker 3>with the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in such a small space.</v>

1140
00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:09.640
<v Speaker 3>And there's motorcycles that go by and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1141
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:15.270
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the motorcycles that they wrap up </v>

1142
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:18.130
<v Speaker 3>their writing by exactly the writing by </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like that's a bummer.</v>

1143
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.140
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1144
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:24.910
<v Speaker 5>to now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm also like a yard is good for a </v>

1145
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:24.910
<v Speaker 5>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1146
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:24.910
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1147
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:26.130
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's hard.</v>

1148
00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:27.830
<v Speaker 3>It's hard in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1149
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:28.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

1150
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.270
<v Speaker 1>like we were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1151
00:50:29.271 --> 00:50:31.960
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's things you have,</v>

1152
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.100
<v Speaker 1>there's just all this stuff you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider when you're,</v>

1153
00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:36.680
<v Speaker 1>your priorities changed now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that you,</v>

1154
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:38.930
<v Speaker 1>when you have a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you've got to think of all the</v>

1155
00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:43.931
<v Speaker 1>things schools and this and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbors and who were they going to be </v>

1156
00:50:43.931 --> 00:50:43.931
<v Speaker 1>friends with and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1157
00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:46.450
<v Speaker 5>before I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to tell people,</v>

1158
00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.300
<v Speaker 5>go to Chris Kresser,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his instagram or his,</v>

1159
00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.800
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his twitter page,</v>

1160
00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:56.010
<v Speaker 5>and there's an article on Acetaminophen </v>
<v Speaker 5>and women who are pregnant consuming </v>

1161
00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:00.640
<v Speaker 5>Acetaminophen and the negative </v>
<v Speaker 5>consequences it has for children.</v>

1162
00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:05.970
<v Speaker 5>See more evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It says here that the exposure to </v>

1163
00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:06.850
<v Speaker 5>Acetaminophen may be a part of adhd </v>
<v Speaker 5>puzzle.</v>

1164
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:10.840
<v Speaker 5>A Norwegian study,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pregnant women took Acetaminophen for 29</v>

1165
00:51:10.841 --> 00:51:15.841
<v Speaker 5>days or more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had a more than twofold risk of having </v>

1166
00:51:15.841 --> 00:51:15.841
<v Speaker 5>children with Adhd.</v>

1167
00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1168
00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Tylenol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've seen.</v>

1169
00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:23.660
<v Speaker 1>I think I even tweeted something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this like a couple of years ago where </v>

1170
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.440
<v Speaker 1>this isn't the first study where in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York Times right now apparently,</v>

1171
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:29.370
<v Speaker 1>and that's what people are prescribed </v>
<v Speaker 1>right during pregnancy.</v>

1172
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:31.030
<v Speaker 5>Scary Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

1173
00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:36.050
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's how many things we find out </v>
<v Speaker 5>from like the 19 sixties were terribly </v>

1174
00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:40.691
<v Speaker 5>detrimental to children and doctors are </v>
<v Speaker 5>telling you this is the way you should </v>

1175
00:51:40.691 --> 00:51:40.691
<v Speaker 5>go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's.</v>

1176
00:51:40.691 --> 00:51:43.410
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1177
00:51:43.411 --> 00:51:44.040
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1178
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:49.280
<v Speaker 1>when I was pregnant there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were certainly some things that I </v>

1179
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.690
<v Speaker 1>opted out of that we're probably more </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard of care,</v>

1180
00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:53.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1181
00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:56.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because of concern and,</v>

1182
00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.790
<v Speaker 1>and not that I knew for a fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something was gonna happen,</v>

1183
00:51:59.791 --> 00:52:04.791
<v Speaker 1>but I had doubt and that was enough for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me to sort of weigh the benefits and the</v>

1184
00:52:04.891 --> 00:52:05.640
<v Speaker 1>risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1185
00:52:05.641 --> 00:52:07.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1186
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:08.100
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1187
00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:12.270
<v Speaker 5>Well there's even talk about vaccination</v>
<v Speaker 5>protocols.</v>

1188
00:52:12.271 --> 00:52:13.560
<v Speaker 5>Like not whether or not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1189
00:52:13.561 --> 00:52:16.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm not an anti vaccination person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think vaccinations are important,</v>

1190
00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:21.000
<v Speaker 5>but I think that there's a lot of merit </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the idea of that.</v>

1191
00:52:21.001 --> 00:52:26.001
<v Speaker 5>You shoot a kid up at 36 different shots</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they're six weeks old or whatever </v>

1192
00:52:26.001 --> 00:52:28.470
<v Speaker 5>age they start them out right out of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>box.</v>

1193
00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:33.890
<v Speaker 5>They give a lot of doctors want to give </v>
<v Speaker 5>your kid a series of shots and that </v>

1194
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:38.630
<v Speaker 5>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some concern that the actual </v>

1195
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:43.221
<v Speaker 5>consequences of all these different </v>
<v Speaker 5>vaccines being put into your child's </v>

1196
00:52:43.221 --> 00:52:48.201
<v Speaker 5>body very early and a large number of </v>
<v Speaker 5>them have some sort of negative </v>

1197
00:52:48.201 --> 00:52:48.690
<v Speaker 5>consequences.</v>

1198
00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:49.840
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1199
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>

1200
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm also not an antibody or I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaccines are important.</v>

1201
00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to vaccinate my son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1202
00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.670
<v Speaker 1>and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've already given.</v>

1203
00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little behind on the schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've given him one.</v>

1204
00:52:59.601 --> 00:53:04.601
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying is true there is </v>

1205
00:53:04.601 --> 00:53:05.360
<v Speaker 1>like even on the CDC website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says that,</v>

1206
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:10.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these vaccines can cause I'm </v>

1207
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.970
<v Speaker 1>fevers and epileptic seizures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seizures,</v>

1208
00:53:10.971 --> 00:53:15.971
<v Speaker 1>seizures in infants and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that there's no longterm consequence</v>

1209
00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:16.780
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1210
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:18.770
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1211
00:53:18.771 --> 00:53:21.740
<v Speaker 1>if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the literature and,</v>

1212
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:26.800
<v Speaker 1>and how the immune,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immune system response to some of </v>

1213
00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.510
<v Speaker 1>these vaccines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're giving like five at</v>

1214
00:53:27.511 --> 00:53:32.511
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the first round of vaccines that </v>

1215
00:53:32.511 --> 00:53:32.511
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

1216
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.320
<v Speaker 1>it was like five different vaccines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I'm opting to do is actually</v>

1217
00:53:37.321 --> 00:53:38.760
<v Speaker 1>do them in singles where you.</v>

1218
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:43.820
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like why the immune </v>

1219
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:45.760
<v Speaker 1>response is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1220
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:51.110
<v Speaker 1>kind of the thing that's scary and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really know how a child's immune </v>

1221
00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:52.260
<v Speaker 1>system is going to react.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are studies.</v>

1222
00:53:52.261 --> 00:53:57.261
<v Speaker 1>I was particularly worried about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>during pregnancy and that's when one of </v>

1223
00:53:57.261 --> 00:53:57.610
<v Speaker 1>the things I opted out of was getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1224
00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.930
<v Speaker 1>the td APP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vaccine,</v>

1225
00:54:00.931 --> 00:54:02.670
<v Speaker 1>which is they want to give it to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

1226
00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I forgot how many weeks pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 30 something I think.</v>

1227
00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:12.410
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect basically pass on antibodies </v>

1228
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:12.410
<v Speaker 1>for whooping cough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1229
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:12.410
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the baby.</v>

1230
00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:16.050
<v Speaker 1>And so I opted out and I said I would do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it post basically postpartum,</v>

1231
00:54:16.051 --> 00:54:21.051
<v Speaker 1>like one day postpartum because it takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>about four weeks to transfer the </v>

1232
00:54:21.051 --> 00:54:21.760
<v Speaker 1>antibodies in breast milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I still was gonna,</v>

1233
00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the vaccine.</v>

1234
00:54:22.891 --> 00:54:24.350
<v Speaker 1>But I was going to do it after I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

1235
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:29.990
<v Speaker 1>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I made that decision is </v>

1236
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:31.671
<v Speaker 1>because there have been multiple studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>now in nonhuman primates that have </v>

1237
00:54:32.791 --> 00:54:35.100
<v Speaker 1>looked on these studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out of UC Davis,</v>

1238
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:39.840
<v Speaker 1>looked at pregnant female monkeys on </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're,</v>

1239
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:42.030
<v Speaker 1>when they have a really strong immune </v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

1240
00:54:42.031 --> 00:54:45.840
<v Speaker 1>So like a strong infection or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows a vaccine.</v>

1241
00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:50.340
<v Speaker 1>The study didn't use vaccines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sort of drawing a parallel here.</v>

1242
00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Whereas just the immune response having </v>
<v Speaker 1>very strong immune response.</v>

1243
00:54:53.671 --> 00:54:58.671
<v Speaker 1>There was an autoimmune response that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up having antibodies that attack </v>

1244
00:54:58.671 --> 00:55:02.390
<v Speaker 1>the developing brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the monkeys that were born from </v>

1245
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.390
<v Speaker 1>those mothers were had autistic like </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>

1246
00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:06.480
<v Speaker 1>It's been shown in humans that mothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>of autistic children are five times more</v>

1247
00:55:06.481 --> 00:55:11.481
<v Speaker 1>likely to have antibodies floating </v>
<v Speaker 1>around in their blood against fetal </v>

1248
00:55:11.481 --> 00:55:14.661
<v Speaker 1>brain proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not supposed to have </v>

1249
00:55:14.661 --> 00:55:14.661
<v Speaker 1>antibodies against fetal brain proteins </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their blood.</v>

1250
00:55:14.661 --> 00:55:19.340
<v Speaker 1>So there's definitely been some link </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the immune system and autoimmunity,</v>

1251
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:24.480
<v Speaker 1>particularly during pregnancy and autism</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk.</v>

1252
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like the,</v>

1253
00:55:26.491 --> 00:55:28.230
<v Speaker 1>the young baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1254
00:55:28.231 --> 00:55:28.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1255
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do.</v>

1256
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I do worry that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1257
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:38.030
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my son's developing so great and like I </v>

1258
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:38.030
<v Speaker 1>don't want to do something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1259
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:38.600
<v Speaker 1>it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

1260
00:55:38.601 --> 00:55:39.930
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely,</v>

1261
00:55:39.931 --> 00:55:41.880
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to vaccinate my son and I have</v>

1262
00:55:41.881 --> 00:55:44.400
<v Speaker 1>been doing singles and that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1263
00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:49.440
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little more inconvenient because </v>

1264
00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:49.440
<v Speaker 1>you have to go to the doctor like so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many times to do it.</v>

1265
00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:52.890
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is that when you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're not giving so many different</v>

1266
00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:55.740
<v Speaker 1>vaccines at once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immune response isn't going to be as</v>

1267
00:55:55.741 --> 00:55:56.160
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>

1268
00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:01.420
<v Speaker 5>And there's a problem with this </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation and one of the problems </v>

1269
00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:01.820
<v Speaker 5>with this conversation is as soon as you</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk about vaccines,</v>

1270
00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:07.090
<v Speaker 5>you immediately get lumped into a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 5>of fucking crazy people that think that </v>

1271
00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:11.111
<v Speaker 5>vaccines or some sort of a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the government's trying to make </v>

1272
00:56:11.111 --> 00:56:13.940
<v Speaker 5>money from you and you were an </v>
<v Speaker 5>anti-vaxxer and they immediately box you</v>

1273
00:56:13.941 --> 00:56:15.940
<v Speaker 5>in and start getting angry at you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1274
00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:16.940
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost,</v>

1275
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.000
<v Speaker 5>it's a weird thing because you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about chemicals that you're </v>

1276
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:22.010
<v Speaker 5>injecting into a child,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1277
00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:27.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but still people are very hesitant to,</v>

1278
00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:29.470
<v Speaker 5>to even look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're very,</v>

1279
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:34.360
<v Speaker 5>they'll you want to automatically just </v>
<v Speaker 5>go with whatever the doctor says when it</v>

1280
00:56:34.361 --> 00:56:39.361
<v Speaker 5>comes to vaccines until.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the real problem is until you look </v>

1281
00:56:39.361 --> 00:56:42.991
<v Speaker 5>at like how much work has been done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>determining what the consequences are </v>

1282
00:56:42.991 --> 00:56:43.990
<v Speaker 5>and how can you find out?</v>

1283
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:45.510
<v Speaker 5>How can you even know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1284
00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:48.340
<v Speaker 5>you really can't unless you have to have</v>
<v Speaker 5>the exact,</v>

1285
00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:49.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of copies.</v>

1286
00:56:49.661 --> 00:56:54.661
<v Speaker 5>You make a bunch of clowns have a baby </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you expose them to the exact same </v>

1287
00:56:54.661 --> 00:56:54.661
<v Speaker 5>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Zach,</v>

1288
00:56:54.661 --> 00:56:59.580
<v Speaker 5>exact same epigenetics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exact same environmental factors and </v>

1289
00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:01.600
<v Speaker 5>then one of you and inject a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>chemicals into and one you don't.</v>

1290
00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:05.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean we know that vaccines are </v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing.</v>

1291
00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:10.530
<v Speaker 5>They have prevented polio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have prevented a host of different </v>

1292
00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:13.861
<v Speaker 5>diseases becoming real issues and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>know that people who don't vaccinate </v>

1293
00:57:13.861 --> 00:57:17.281
<v Speaker 5>their kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the the reason why measles are coming </v>

1294
00:57:17.281 --> 00:57:17.281
<v Speaker 5>back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they might just.</v>

1295
00:57:17.281 --> 00:57:17.470
<v Speaker 5>There's real concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1296
00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:20.230
<v Speaker 5>I think vaccines are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so happy they exist,</v>

1297
00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:24.700
<v Speaker 5>but I also think that we have to be very</v>
<v Speaker 5>careful with just jumping into things.</v>

1298
00:57:24.701 --> 00:57:29.701
<v Speaker 5>Just like we were talking before about </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that they did as standard care </v>

1299
00:57:29.701 --> 00:57:30.190
<v Speaker 5>during the 19 sixties are now </v>
<v Speaker 5>prohibited.</v>

1300
00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:31.900
<v Speaker 5>Like we know they're dangerous for you.</v>

1301
00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1302
00:57:32.981 --> 00:57:37.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely 100 percent agree and I </v>

1303
00:57:37.981 --> 00:57:37.981
<v Speaker 1>think that there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1304
00:57:37.981 --> 00:57:40.300
<v Speaker 1>there are now it's a growing field at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least in science where there are,</v>

1305
00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:43.780
<v Speaker 1>there are scientists that are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the,</v>

1306
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000
<v Speaker 1>the gene interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gene interaction with the immune </v>

1307
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.171
<v Speaker 1>system because it obviously almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone gets vaccinated,</v>

1308
00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:52.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1309
00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:58.260
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have everyone walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with all these with autism and </v>

1310
00:57:58.260 --> 00:57:58.260
<v Speaker 1>all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there,</v>

1311
00:57:58.350 --> 00:58:01.240
<v Speaker 1>there is something that is going on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1312
00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:04.750
<v Speaker 1>a lot of parents have noticed changes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course after the vaccinations.</v>

1313
00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:08.560
<v Speaker 1>And so there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a new field of inquiry.</v>

1314
00:58:08.561 --> 00:58:13.561
<v Speaker 1>I do know that's ongoing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're scientists are beginning to now </v>

1315
00:58:13.561 --> 00:58:17.311
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition to how the immune system is </v>

1316
00:58:17.311 --> 00:58:19.870
<v Speaker 1>reacting to some of these vaccines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how specific genes,</v>

1317
00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:25.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulating certain immune functions may </v>

1318
00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:29.050
<v Speaker 1>differences in those genes called </v>
<v Speaker 1>polymorphisms may predispose a child.</v>

1319
00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Now how are you going to know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like without doing a DNA test before you</v>

1320
00:58:32.081 --> 00:58:33.850
<v Speaker 1>do the vaccine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a risk,</v>

1321
00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:35.240
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know it's it.</v>

1322
00:58:35.241 --> 00:58:39.700
<v Speaker 1>It definitely is a risk and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's the scary thing,</v>

1323
00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

1324
00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:42.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1325
00:58:42.391 --> 00:58:47.391
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a dilemma that I've been facing </v>

1326
00:58:47.391 --> 00:58:47.391
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1327
00:58:47.391 --> 00:58:47.710
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm currently,</v>

1328
00:58:47.711 --> 00:58:52.711
<v Speaker 1>the reason I even delayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only given my son to vaccines so </v>

1329
00:58:52.711 --> 00:58:55.801
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just because I'm trying to like </v>

1330
00:58:55.801 --> 00:58:56.740
<v Speaker 1>exhaustively read the literature as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I can.</v>

1331
00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:58.150
<v Speaker 5>Well good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad.</v>

1332
00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:03.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad that you're looking at it this </v>
<v Speaker 5>way because it's something that there's </v>

1333
00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:04.240
<v Speaker 5>a lot of pressure on people to not look </v>
<v Speaker 5>at it that way.</v>

1334
00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.700
<v Speaker 5>There's like this just having this </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation,</v>

1335
00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:08.800
<v Speaker 5>Joe Rogan and Rhonda Patrick are </v>
<v Speaker 5>anti-vaxxers.</v>

1336
00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:11.500
<v Speaker 5>That could be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that could be the title of some bullshit</v>

1337
00:59:11.501 --> 00:59:13.570
<v Speaker 5>arc article that someone writes about </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

1338
00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:18.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've seen it time and time again </v>
<v Speaker 5>where someone will write a clickbait </v>

1339
00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:21.800
<v Speaker 5>title to an article and then someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>will just that and go,</v>

1340
00:59:21.801 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1341
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.440
<v Speaker 2>you're an anti-vaxxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you are,</v>

1342
00:59:24.441 --> 00:59:29.441
<v Speaker 2>you loser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll get angry at you and throw </v>

1343
00:59:29.441 --> 00:59:32.261
<v Speaker 2>some twitter message your way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not representative of your </v>

1344
00:59:32.261 --> 00:59:33.170
<v Speaker 2>actual thoughts on this at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a very complex,</v>

1345
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:36.650
<v Speaker 2>very nuanced issue and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1346
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:38.540
<v Speaker 2>I do think people should vaccinate their</v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

1347
00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:41.520
<v Speaker 2>Do as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have been all right.</v>

1348
00:59:41.521 --> 00:59:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1349
00:59:42.471 --> 00:59:46.340
<v Speaker 2>It's a nuanced topic that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1350
00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:48.830
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what the answer to.</v>

1351
00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was his name?</v>

1352
00:59:52.131 --> 00:59:57.131
<v Speaker 2>The guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the doctor that got disbarred because he</v>

1353
00:59:57.741 --> 01:00:02.741
<v Speaker 2>liked falsified some data on a thumb </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rosalda mercury and causing autism.</v>

1354
01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Falsified some data or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the story behind that data that</v>

1355
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:12.920
<v Speaker 2>was published that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that linked thimerosal,</v>

1356
01:00:12.921 --> 01:00:16.850
<v Speaker 2>which is the agile that was found in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of vaccines in California.</v>

1357
01:00:16.851 --> 01:00:20.570
<v Speaker 2>They don't use that as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as like it's not used anymore.</v>

1358
01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Was that the needle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>measles,</v>

1359
01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:23.690
<v Speaker 2>mumps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rubella,</v>

1360
01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.920
<v Speaker 2>MMR,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1361
01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what did he do?</v>

1362
01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.540
<v Speaker 2>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't you know,</v>

1363
01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:34.660
<v Speaker 2>it's not like I haven't done super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super in depth analysis of what he did </v>

1364
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:38.150
<v Speaker 2>to my understanding was that he just </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold it up here.</v>

1365
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.500
<v Speaker 2>Journal retracts 1998 paper linking </v>
<v Speaker 2>autism to vaccines are prominent.</v>

1366
01:00:42.501 --> 01:00:47.501
<v Speaker 2>British medical journal Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>retracted in 1998 research paper that </v>

1367
01:00:47.501 --> 01:00:49.580
<v Speaker 2>set off a sharp decline of vaccinations </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Britain after the papers.</v>

1368
01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Lead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Author suggested that vaccines could </v>

1369
01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:54.850
<v Speaker 2>cause autism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the retraction,</v>

1370
01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:54.890
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1371
01:00:54.891 --> 01:00:56.270
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reassessment,</v>

1372
01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's lasted for years,</v>

1373
01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:03.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the scientific methods and financial </v>

1374
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:03.470
<v Speaker 2>conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Andrew Wakefield,</v>

1375
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.410
<v Speaker 2>who contended that his research show </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the combined measles,</v>

1376
01:01:06.411 --> 01:01:08.480
<v Speaker 2>mumps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rubella rubella.</v>

1377
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:10.100
<v Speaker 2>How do you say it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rubella.</v>

1378
01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Rubella vaccine may be unsafe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the retraction may do little to </v>

1379
01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:19.601
<v Speaker 2>tarnish Dr Wakefield's fields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reputation among parents groups in the </v>

1380
01:01:19.601 --> 01:01:23.440
<v Speaker 2>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite a wealth of scientific studies </v>

1381
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:23.990
<v Speaker 2>that have failed to find any link </v>
<v Speaker 2>between vaccines and autism,</v>

1382
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.330
<v Speaker 2>the parents fervently.</v>

1383
01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I love that word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that their children's medical </v>

1384
01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:34.181
<v Speaker 2>problems resulted from vaccines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people that think their </v>

1385
01:01:34.251 --> 01:01:38.420
<v Speaker 2>kid's medical issues came from vaccines </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not wanting to tell them they're</v>

1386
01:01:38.421 --> 01:01:40.190
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who's right or who's wrong,</v>

1387
01:01:40.191 --> 01:01:44.870
<v Speaker 2>but I know there's a massive amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money to discourage any sort of talk and</v>

1388
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:48.340
<v Speaker 2>thinking that no one wants you to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's anything wrong with vaccines and</v>

1389
01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:50.720
<v Speaker 2>vaccines can do no harm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1390
01:01:50.721 --> 01:01:53.030
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars have been given out </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the vaccine courts.</v>

1391
01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:58.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's vaccine courts that take care of</v>

1392
01:01:59.121 --> 01:02:02.300
<v Speaker 2>cases where people have been damaged by </v>
<v Speaker 2>vaccines.</v>

1393
01:02:02.301 --> 01:02:04.470
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>

1394
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:09.520
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about this before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast started that we're going to </v>

1395
01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:09.520
<v Speaker 2>discuss the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

1396
01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:13.590
<v Speaker 2>There's people very biologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much that one person can eat at my </v>

1397
01:02:16.251 --> 01:02:17.150
<v Speaker 2>friend Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1398
01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:19.530
<v Speaker 2>his mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she eats a Brazil nut,</v>

1399
01:02:19.531 --> 01:02:20.280
<v Speaker 2>she will die.</v>

1400
01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.920
<v Speaker 5>I could eat a whole bowl of those boring</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking nuts.</v>

1401
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.920
<v Speaker 5>They don't do anything to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they're boring but increase your</v>

1402
01:02:25.921 --> 01:02:26.700
<v Speaker 5>selenium.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1403
01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:27.840
<v Speaker 5>that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's good to have,</v>

1404
01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:30.120
<v Speaker 5>but I mean they don't do anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>negative to me,</v>

1405
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:34.860
<v Speaker 5>but his mom will eat them and she dies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that you can,</v>

1406
01:02:34.861 --> 01:02:39.861
<v Speaker 5>I believe that you can extrapolate that </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you can look at all sorts of </v>

1407
01:02:39.861 --> 01:02:39.861
<v Speaker 5>different things that you take into your</v>
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>

1408
01:02:39.861 --> 01:02:43.020
<v Speaker 5>There are some people that are allergic </v>
<v Speaker 5>to a host of different things that don't</v>

1409
01:02:43.021 --> 01:02:48.021
<v Speaker 5>do a damn thing to me and there's going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be people that are going to have </v>

1410
01:02:48.021 --> 01:02:50.490
<v Speaker 5>reactions to vaccines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just it's a chemical.</v>

1411
01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:52.530
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 5>happens in your body,</v>

1412
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:57.710
<v Speaker 5>so the idea that there's no link </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatsoever to a chemical causing an </v>

1413
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:59.310
<v Speaker 5>adverse reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't jive.</v>

1414
01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:02.370
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make sense to say that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>impossible.</v>

1415
01:03:02.371 --> 01:03:05.760
<v Speaker 5>You could say it's extremely rare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That makes more sense,</v>

1416
01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.270
<v Speaker 5>but when they say there's no link,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you say no link,</v>

1417
01:03:09.271 --> 01:03:11.850
<v Speaker 5>I have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's motivating this?</v>

1418
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.880
<v Speaker 5>What's motivating you to say no link?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because with when you're dealing with </v>

1419
01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:21.291
<v Speaker 5>chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's always going to be a small </v>

1420
01:03:21.291 --> 01:03:21.291
<v Speaker 5>percentage of a chance that your body </v>
<v Speaker 5>has an adverse reaction.</v>

1421
01:03:21.291 --> 01:03:21.870
<v Speaker 5>Those chemicals,</v>

1422
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.080
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1423
01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:25.190
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>

1424
01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:29.150
<v Speaker 1>these are live bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria and you're listening and immune</v>

1425
01:03:29.151 --> 01:03:31.550
<v Speaker 1>response and immune response is very as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1426
01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people have autoimmune </v>

1427
01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>disease diseases because their immune </v>
<v Speaker 1>system gets so ramped up.</v>

1428
01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:38.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1429
01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>some people have type one diabetes </v>
<v Speaker 1>because their immune system is </v>

1430
01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.140
<v Speaker 1>destroying their pancreatic Beta islet </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells that produce insulin.</v>

1431
01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.320
<v Speaker 1>People are different like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's funny because when that,</v>

1432
01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:53.680
<v Speaker 1>when Jamie pulled that up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mind went to the same place where </v>

1433
01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:53.680
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1434
01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:57.760
<v Speaker 1>it's the perfect example of how people </v>
<v Speaker 1>respond differently to different things </v>

1435
01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:00.300
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1436
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:03.830
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a chemical but food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a big,</v>

1437
01:04:03.831 --> 01:04:08.831
<v Speaker 1>big field of inquiry is like the food </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've got people battling just </v>

1438
01:04:08.831 --> 01:04:13.431
<v Speaker 1>like with the vaccine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are anti-vaxxers versus </v>

1439
01:04:13.431 --> 01:04:13.431
<v Speaker 1>people that want to vaccinate.</v>

1440
01:04:13.431 --> 01:04:15.110
<v Speaker 1>You've got people that are saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat is bad.</v>

1441
01:04:15.111 --> 01:04:16.580
<v Speaker 1>It's good proteins bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1442
01:04:16.581 --> 01:04:21.581
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got all these camps of people </v>

1443
01:04:21.581 --> 01:04:22.700
<v Speaker 1>that all you know are just basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1444
01:04:22.701 --> 01:04:24.170
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a religion where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1445
01:04:24.171 --> 01:04:26.330
<v Speaker 1>they know what the best diet isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone should do it.</v>

1446
01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.980
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reality is,</v>

1447
01:04:27.981 --> 01:04:31.520
<v Speaker 1>is that it may not be the best diet for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>

1448
01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:34.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that we all very.</v>

1449
01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's something,</v>

1450
01:04:35.721 --> 01:04:36.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1451
01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:40.410
<v Speaker 1>so before the industrialized </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization occur,</v>

1452
01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.070
<v Speaker 1>like occurred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food was like,</v>

1453
01:04:43.071 --> 01:04:44.840
<v Speaker 1>the food you would eat was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1454
01:04:44.841 --> 01:04:46.790
<v Speaker 1>according to where you live </v>
<v Speaker 1>geographically,</v>

1455
01:04:46.791 --> 01:04:51.791
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you weren't getting food from </v>

1456
01:04:51.791 --> 01:04:51.791
<v Speaker 1>all parts of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were basically were at whatever</v>

1457
01:04:51.791 --> 01:04:54.080
<v Speaker 1>you could grow and that part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is what you would eat.</v>

1458
01:04:54.081 --> 01:04:59.081
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like people would eat </v>

1459
01:04:59.081 --> 01:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates or fats saturated fats or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1460
01:04:59.570 --> 01:05:01.090
<v Speaker 1>various foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1461
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:03.140
<v Speaker 1>different at different rates because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

1462
01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they had,</v>

1463
01:05:04.221 --> 01:05:04.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1464
01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:06.650
<v Speaker 1>And it's thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1465
01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:12.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over over time that humans have adapted </v>

1466
01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:15.611
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the region and they've adapted so </v>

1467
01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:15.611
<v Speaker 1>that they could process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1468
01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:16.940
<v Speaker 1>basically processed that food better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at least that's the theory.</v>

1469
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>The reality is it doesn't matter how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

1470
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:25.500
<v Speaker 1>We know that it's true when people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>different variations in genes that are </v>

1471
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.710
<v Speaker 1>involved in nutrition and also in </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

1472
01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>So regardless of whether or not that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how it actually occurred,</v>

1473
01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:32.290
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens.</v>

1474
01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:37.650
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the best examples of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the study that was published in </v>

1475
01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>2015 in the journal cell from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Weizmann Institute.</v>

1476
01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:44.790
<v Speaker 1>800 different people were given a </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuous glucose monitor where their </v>

1477
01:05:44.790 --> 01:05:46.330
<v Speaker 1>blood glucose levels were measured every</v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes.</v>

1478
01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:48.450
<v Speaker 1>And these people were then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1479
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:50.490
<v Speaker 1>they submitted samples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1480
01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.300
<v Speaker 1>for their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their DNA to be analyzed.</v>

1481
01:05:52.301 --> 01:05:57.301
<v Speaker 1>And then also their microbiome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the bacteria that live in the </v>

1482
01:05:57.301 --> 01:05:57.301
<v Speaker 1>gut.</v>

1483
01:05:57.301 --> 01:06:00.190
<v Speaker 1>And so scientists then gave these groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people various food types,</v>

1484
01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:03.310
<v Speaker 1>either refined carbohydrate like white </v>
<v Speaker 1>bread,</v>

1485
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.890
<v Speaker 1>complex carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1486
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:07.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a banana,</v>

1487
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:12.950
<v Speaker 1>and then saturated fat like cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they measured people's Glucose </v>

1488
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:15.670
<v Speaker 1>response to these various foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>800 different people.</v>

1489
01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:21.540
<v Speaker 1>And what was found was that the glucose </v>
<v Speaker 1>response varied vastly according to a </v>

1490
01:06:22.571 --> 01:06:25.000
<v Speaker 1>person's genetic and also microbiome </v>
<v Speaker 1>makeup.</v>

1491
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.740
<v Speaker 1>So people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think,</v>

1492
01:06:26.741 --> 01:06:31.741
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to have a high blood </v>

1493
01:06:31.741 --> 01:06:31.741
<v Speaker 1>glucose response to white bread and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe somewhat to the banana,</v>

1494
01:06:31.741 --> 01:06:33.550
<v Speaker 1>but there's fiber in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of changes the way,</v>

1495
01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:34.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1496
01:06:34.171 --> 01:06:35.910
<v Speaker 1>the glucose levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1497
01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:37.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reach the blood.</v>

1498
01:06:37.601 --> 01:06:42.070
<v Speaker 1>But the reality was that some people had</v>
<v Speaker 1>high blood glucose to the saturated fat,</v>

1499
01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:43.420
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1500
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:47.380
<v Speaker 1>not people don't think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so that this is,</v>

1501
01:06:47.381 --> 01:06:52.381
<v Speaker 1>this was sort of like one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>proof of principle studies showing and </v>

1502
01:06:52.381 --> 01:06:56.041
<v Speaker 1>800 different people that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>different and they measured the various </v>

1503
01:06:56.041 --> 01:06:56.080
<v Speaker 1>genes to show it.</v>

1504
01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:01.080
<v Speaker 1>And also their microbiome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gut bacteria varied as well because </v>

1505
01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:01.080
<v Speaker 1>that changes the way you're metabolizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

1506
01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:01.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1507
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:04.180
<v Speaker 1>some of these genes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we know,</v>

1508
01:07:04.181 --> 01:07:06.220
<v Speaker 1>we know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ppr,</v>

1509
01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ppr,</v>

1510
01:07:07.391 --> 01:07:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Gamma Fto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>April before,</v>

1511
01:07:09.490 --> 01:07:14.490
<v Speaker 1>which is what I have all changed the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body metabolizes fat and also the </v>

1512
01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:22.201
<v Speaker 1>way your body transports like fatty </v>
<v Speaker 1>acids and cholesterol throughout the </v>

1513
01:07:22.201 --> 01:07:25.141
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people with some of these </v>

1514
01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:25.150
<v Speaker 1>polymorphisms in these genes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they eat a high,</v>

1515
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:30.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saturated to low poly and mono </v>

1516
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:32.881
<v Speaker 1>unsaturated fat ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can actually have more adverse </v>

1517
01:07:32.881 --> 01:07:32.881
<v Speaker 1>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can have higher blood glucose,</v>

1518
01:07:32.881 --> 01:07:36.420
<v Speaker 1>they can have higher ldl cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can have higher obesity rates,</v>

1519
01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.410
<v Speaker 1>higher type two diabetes risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1520
01:07:38.411 --> 01:07:40.070
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's like,</v>

1521
01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:40.870
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1522
01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.730
<v Speaker 1>that's something that most people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

1523
01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:45.910
<v Speaker 1>that would eat a high saturated fat diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have.</v>

1524
01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:51.540
<v Speaker 1>And so I've actually been able to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at some of my jeans because there's </v>

1525
01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:51.910
<v Speaker 1>companies now that allow you to do that.</v>

1526
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:53.230
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1527
01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that I have in April before,</v>

1528
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:59.590
<v Speaker 1>so that changes my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my diet in a way so you know,</v>

1529
01:07:59.591 --> 01:08:04.591
<v Speaker 1>it because the Aicpa we for not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>predisposes you to Alzheimer's disease,</v>

1530
01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also from um,</v>

1531
01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:11.910
<v Speaker 1>adverse effects to Tbi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also affects the way cholesterol </v>

1532
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:13.330
<v Speaker 1>is transporting your body and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get recycled very well.</v>

1533
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:18.650
<v Speaker 1>So I have more cholesterol circulating </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my body at any given point,</v>

1534
01:08:19.150 --> 01:08:21.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to my husband Dan,</v>

1535
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't have an APP for a little and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we eat the exact same diet,</v>

1536
01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:27.470
<v Speaker 1>like my ldl will be like 20 points </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher than his,</v>

1537
01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:32.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like is there a negative health effect </v>

1538
01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:37.361
<v Speaker 1>of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that it gets a little more </v>

1539
01:08:37.361 --> 01:08:37.361
<v Speaker 1>complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1540
01:08:37.361 --> 01:08:37.410
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1541
01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:42.420
<v Speaker 1>the ldl cholesterol by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time it's been,</v>

1542
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:47.500
<v Speaker 1>it's been thought to be a predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart disease because with nutrition,</v>

1543
01:08:48.171 --> 01:08:53.171
<v Speaker 1>and here's the thing with nutrition is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a lot of our studies are,</v>

1544
01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:58.360
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are what's called observational studies </v>

1545
01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:58.820
<v Speaker 1>where we look at this population and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at a disease risk and we say,</v>

1546
01:08:59.030 --> 01:09:04.030
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person eat that and they have a </v>

1547
01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:04.030
<v Speaker 1>higher risk of that or a low risk or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1548
01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a correlation.</v>

1549
01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:04.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

1550
01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.400
<v Speaker 1>you're not showing it's a causal factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1551
01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's notoriously like,</v>

1552
01:09:10.911 --> 01:09:14.510
<v Speaker 1>actually my mentor from my Postdoc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Bruce Ames,</v>

1553
01:09:14.511 --> 01:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>he has this joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that analogy of.</v>

1554
01:09:16.621 --> 01:09:19.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a joke that he tells that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrates this type of study.</v>

1555
01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Epidemiology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1556
01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:26.400
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says that people that are born in </v>

1557
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Miami are born Hispanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they died Jewish.</v>

1558
01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:31.690
<v Speaker 1>So you're born Hispanics and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know the rich cultural history of </v>

1559
01:09:31.690 --> 01:09:35.141
<v Speaker 1>Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas a lot of big Latino community </v>

1560
01:09:35.141 --> 01:09:35.510
<v Speaker 1>people come there from Cuba and various </v>
<v Speaker 1>races,</v>

1561
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:39.860
<v Speaker 1>but then old people go there to retire </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they hate the cold and they want</v>

1562
01:09:39.861 --> 01:09:40.640
<v Speaker 1>to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1563
01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:42.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement move to Florida.</v>

1564
01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:47.770
<v Speaker 1>So you just look at the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just look at the birth records </v>

1565
01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:47.770
<v Speaker 1>and the death records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

1566
01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:52.031
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are born Hispanic and they die </v>

1567
01:09:52.031 --> 01:09:52.031
<v Speaker 1>Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1568
01:09:52.031 --> 01:09:53.310
<v Speaker 1>That is epidemiology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

1569
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:54.710
<v Speaker 1>that's very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1570
01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:59.740
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great analogy because it really </v>

1571
01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:00.890
<v Speaker 1>does highlight the complexity of doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>these types of studies.</v>

1572
01:10:00.891 --> 01:10:02.990
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of other factors that </v>
<v Speaker 1>play a role,</v>

1573
01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:04.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean so.</v>

1574
01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:08.000
<v Speaker 1>So the thing is is that with nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 1>in particular,</v>

1575
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:11.300
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at not just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>epidemiological study,</v>

1576
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:16.570
<v Speaker 1>but you have to look at controlled </v>
<v Speaker 1>randomized controlled trials where they </v>

1577
01:10:16.570 --> 01:10:17.390
<v Speaker 1>use biomarkers as predictors of certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>

1578
01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:22.690
<v Speaker 1>You have to look at animal studies where</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism has done to understand how </v>

1579
01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:22.740
<v Speaker 1>things are working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1580
01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:27.760
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at the whole picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you just use these studies </v>

1581
01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:27.760
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1582
01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.330
<v Speaker 1>you get a low protein diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1583
01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.430
<v Speaker 1>you have a lower all cause mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

1584
01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be a Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well guess what?</v>

1585
01:10:33.051 --> 01:10:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Lots of other things are complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1586
01:10:35.141 --> 01:10:40.141
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of other factors or the </v>

1587
01:10:40.141 --> 01:10:40.141
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat one.</v>

1588
01:10:40.141 --> 01:10:40.510
<v Speaker 1>So you asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does ldl like,</v>

1589
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:41.960
<v Speaker 1>does that predict your heart disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>risk?</v>

1590
01:10:41.961 --> 01:10:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Well on a population level for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time it can.</v>

1591
01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Because LDL LDL is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1592
01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:55.060
<v Speaker 1>one thing that transports cholesterol </v>
<v Speaker 1>and higher levels of it have been </v>

1593
01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.840
<v Speaker 1>associated with a variety of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart disease risk factors.</v>

1594
01:10:57.650 --> 01:11:02.650
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is that as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as time has gone on and tools have got </v>

1595
01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:04.160
<v Speaker 1>better and when we're able to like look </v>
<v Speaker 1>more at mechanism,</v>

1596
01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:06.740
<v Speaker 1>scientists have now started to uncover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1597
01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:09.710
<v Speaker 1>there's multiple types of ldl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just one type.</v>

1598
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>There's different sizes of it that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>circulating in the blood and one size</v>

1599
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.780
<v Speaker 3>is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The large size,</v>

1600
01:11:15.781 --> 01:11:18.480
<v Speaker 3>the large buoyant size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really good because it's delivering</v>

1601
01:11:18.481 --> 01:11:23.481
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol to yourselves and delivering</v>
<v Speaker 3>fatty acids to yourself where you need </v>

1602
01:11:23.481 --> 01:11:26.661
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time you make a new cell in your </v>

1603
01:11:26.661 --> 01:11:26.661
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>

1604
01:11:26.661 --> 01:11:26.661
<v Speaker 3>It needs cholesterol and these fatty </v>
<v Speaker 3>acids,</v>

1605
01:11:26.661 --> 01:11:29.010
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also smaller sizes that,</v>

1606
01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:30.160
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1607
01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:34.920
<v Speaker 3>that are more dense and basically they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't get recycled back to the liver.</v>

1608
01:11:34.921 --> 01:11:35.710
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1609
01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically a,</v>

1610
01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:39.820
<v Speaker 3>a life cycle of the cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's made in the liver,</v>

1611
01:11:39.821 --> 01:11:44.821
<v Speaker 3>it goes out in the bloodstream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you donate all this stuff to your </v>

1612
01:11:44.821 --> 01:11:44.821
<v Speaker 3>various self and it goes back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>liver and it's,</v>

1613
01:11:44.821 --> 01:11:45.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like recycled.</v>

1614
01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Well if you can't recycle it then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>stays in your bloodstream sort of </v>

1615
01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:54.681
<v Speaker 3>indefinitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it can undergo inflammatory </v>

1616
01:11:54.681 --> 01:11:54.960
<v Speaker 3>transformations there and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1617
01:11:54.961 --> 01:11:55.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad things happen.</v>

1618
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:58.140
<v Speaker 3>And so the longer you have something in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your bloodstream,</v>

1619
01:11:58.141 --> 01:11:59.850
<v Speaker 3>if it's there for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1620
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:04.880
<v Speaker 3>for like decades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chances are some shit's going to go </v>

1621
01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:04.880
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1622
01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:08.631
<v Speaker 3>There's this a dietary issue or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hereditary issue in terms of like the </v>

1623
01:12:08.631 --> 01:12:13.491
<v Speaker 3>size of the ldl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know how much is known about </v>

1624
01:12:13.491 --> 01:12:17.841
<v Speaker 3>the hereditary aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's known that April we for can </v>

1625
01:12:17.841 --> 01:12:20.700
<v Speaker 3>increase the risk of just having more </v>
<v Speaker 3>ldl total there.</v>

1626
01:12:20.730 --> 01:12:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what type of Ldl it not known,</v>

1627
01:12:24.121 --> 01:12:29.121
<v Speaker 3>just like regular total ldl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not looking at the particle size now </v>

1628
01:12:29.121 --> 01:12:33.350
<v Speaker 3>that particle size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we do know is there's a big </v>

1629
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:34.410
<v Speaker 3>nutrition factor that regulates that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nutrition factor that regulates that</v>

1630
01:12:34.411 --> 01:12:39.411
<v Speaker 3>is refined sugar and that's been shown </v>
<v Speaker 3>in controlled randomized controlled </v>

1631
01:12:39.411 --> 01:12:43.881
<v Speaker 3>trials were like healthy men given </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like something that was like a </v>

1632
01:12:43.881 --> 01:12:44.010
<v Speaker 3>soda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1633
01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

1634
01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:47.490
<v Speaker 3>they were given a big drink of just </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>

1635
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:52.630
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugary drink for three weeks every day </v>

1636
01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:55.250
<v Speaker 3>and it completely increase their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their inflammatory biomarkers for like </v>

1637
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:55.250
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>

1638
01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.890
<v Speaker 3>But it also ramped up their small ldl </v>
<v Speaker 3>particle size.</v>

1639
01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:00.870
<v Speaker 3>The limit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me stop right here because this is a</v>

1640
01:13:00.871 --> 01:13:05.871
<v Speaker 3>really important point for people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that drinking a large glass of </v>

1641
01:13:05.871 --> 01:13:09.390
<v Speaker 3>orange juice is different than drinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>a glass of soda.</v>

1642
01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:11.220
<v Speaker 3>It's really not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1643
01:13:11.221 --> 01:13:14.640
<v Speaker 3>it's not because you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have the fiber crazy.</v>

1644
01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:15.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

1645
01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:17.490
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you say that to most people,</v>

1646
01:13:17.491 --> 01:13:18.540
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

1647
01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:19.590
<v Speaker 3>You're talking nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1648
01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:23.100
<v Speaker 3>if you have a 24 ounce glass of orange </v>
<v Speaker 3>juice,</v>

1649
01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.220
<v Speaker 3>you're getting a giant dump of sugar in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your system.</v>

1650
01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:27.300
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's.</v>

1651
01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.940
<v Speaker 3>There's many people that think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a healthy thing to drink,</v>

1652
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so and that's,</v>

1653
01:13:31.411 --> 01:13:36.411
<v Speaker 3>and that's what complicates all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies is that you then have people </v>

1654
01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:36.411
<v Speaker 3>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1655
01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:40.610
<v Speaker 3>saturated fat which is known to increase</v>
<v Speaker 3>the large Ldl ldl.</v>

1656
01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:45.650
<v Speaker 3>It's known to increase that and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>combination you have people that are </v>

1657
01:13:45.650 --> 01:13:49.911
<v Speaker 3>drinking orange juice or even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating cookies and cake and drinking </v>

1658
01:13:49.911 --> 01:13:51.300
<v Speaker 3>soda and bread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that refined carbohydrates stuff.</v>

1659
01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:55.160
<v Speaker 3>Now those two in combination together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got that.</v>

1660
01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:00.200
<v Speaker 3>You've got the Ldl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then what happens is with the </v>

1661
01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.961
<v Speaker 3>refined sugar is inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformations happen and you get the </v>

1662
01:14:02.961 --> 01:14:05.961
<v Speaker 3>small dense and why it's a problem when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people try to look at Diet and very </v>

1663
01:14:05.961 --> 01:14:06.570
<v Speaker 3>simplistic ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1664
01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:09.390
<v Speaker 3>When people try to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you eat saturated fat,</v>

1665
01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 3>if you eat cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have</v>

1666
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:15.650
<v Speaker 5>high cholesterol in your body and your </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to have heart attacks,</v>

1667
01:14:15.651 --> 01:14:17.050
<v Speaker 5>they're going to have a stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1668
01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:19.930
<v Speaker 5>this is this a very simplistic thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that people will often say.</v>

1669
01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

1670
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:21.580
<v Speaker 1>It very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1671
01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.440
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1672
01:14:23.190 --> 01:14:24.450
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly is.</v>

1673
01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1674
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:27.180
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled trials.</v>

1675
01:14:27.181 --> 01:14:30.000
<v Speaker 1>You have to look at observational </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies are also important.</v>

1676
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1677
01:14:31.231 --> 01:14:36.231
<v Speaker 1>we also have looked controlled trials </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people that are put on a high fat </v>

1678
01:14:36.231 --> 01:14:39.330
<v Speaker 1>and low refined carbohydrate diet for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month or so,</v>

1679
01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.160
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the exact time,</v>

1680
01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:44.040
<v Speaker 1>had all like biomarkers lowered for </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart disease risk.</v>

1681
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:47.660
<v Speaker 5>Is there something that people can do to</v>
<v Speaker 5>take on that diet?</v>

1682
01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:52.690
<v Speaker 5>Like how do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you do that if you want to go </v>

1683
01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:54.701
<v Speaker 5>vegan is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know a lot of people will like to be </v>

1684
01:14:54.701 --> 01:14:57.911
<v Speaker 5>Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in order to get all those fats and </v>

1685
01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.570
<v Speaker 5>especially low carbohydrate.</v>

1686
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think that first of all,</v>

1687
01:15:01.961 --> 01:15:06.961
<v Speaker 1>for anyone doing any diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whether it's a Vegan diet or a </v>

1688
01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:12.150
<v Speaker 1>ketogenic high fat diet or a low carb </v>
<v Speaker 1>high fat diet or whatever diet they're </v>

1689
01:15:12.150 --> 01:15:16.651
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing you should do is definitely </v>

1690
01:15:16.651 --> 01:15:19.291
<v Speaker 1>measure these biomarkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>LDL particle size can be measured </v>

1691
01:15:19.291 --> 01:15:23.430
<v Speaker 1>triglycerides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory biomarkers like high </v>

1692
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.430
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>c reactive protein.</v>

1693
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Where would someone go to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's a good place to go?</v>

1694
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true health diagnostics.</v>

1695
01:15:26.351 --> 01:15:26.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1696
01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:28.480
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can ask your,</v>

1697
01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.430
<v Speaker 1>your primary care doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1698
01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.650
<v Speaker 1>I know truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true health diagnostics is one that does</v>

1699
01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.680
<v Speaker 1>like whole panel of really good ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the small dense ldl particle </v>

1700
01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:42.361
<v Speaker 1>size and a growing number of physicians </v>
<v Speaker 1>do measure Ldl particle size wellness.</v>

1701
01:15:43.421 --> 01:15:48.421
<v Speaker 1>Fx is something if you don't want your </v>
<v Speaker 1>physician to know what your ldl is </v>

1702
01:15:48.421 --> 01:15:50.080
<v Speaker 1>because they don't want them to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>some opinion about it.</v>

1703
01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Wellness effects is a company that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>also measure your ldl particle size and </v>

1704
01:15:56.141 --> 01:15:59.530
<v Speaker 1>a variety of other biomarkers as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what you're saying</v>

1705
01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:04.560
<v Speaker 5>about um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>refined carbohydrates or refined sugars </v>

1706
01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.940
<v Speaker 5>and Ldl and small Ldl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Laura,</v>

1707
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:10.090
<v Speaker 5>large Ldl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is this common knowledge amongst primary</v>

1708
01:16:10.091 --> 01:16:10.990
<v Speaker 5>care providers?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1709
01:16:10.991 --> 01:16:12.970
<v Speaker 5>is this something your doctor's going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>understand?</v>

1710
01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:14.510
<v Speaker 5>Are they going to try to put you on </v>
<v Speaker 5>standby?</v>

1711
01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:17.230
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not ubiquitous.</v>

1712
01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not standard of care and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>ubiquitous,</v>

1713
01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:20.990
<v Speaker 1>ubiquitous in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1714
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:26.110
<v Speaker 1>in the medical profession yet because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just within the past decade have </v>

1715
01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:31.730
<v Speaker 1>been starting to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientists and researchers have been </v>

1716
01:16:31.730 --> 01:16:35.221
<v Speaker 1>starting to uncover these mechanisms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it usually takes a long time to </v>

1717
01:16:35.221 --> 01:16:40.171
<v Speaker 1>translate this knowledge because now </v>
<v Speaker 1>large scale clinical trials have to be </v>

1718
01:16:40.171 --> 01:16:41.110
<v Speaker 1>done in x number of them have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

1719
01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:42.130
<v Speaker 1>A lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1720
01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:44.620
<v Speaker 1>everything that goes into how </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations are made,</v>

1721
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:49.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of clinical trials and a lot </v>

1722
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:50.020
<v Speaker 1>of things before any sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1723
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:53.800
<v Speaker 1>regulations are changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's something that is not standard</v>

1724
01:16:53.801 --> 01:16:56.950
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can always print out papers,</v>

1725
01:16:58.060 --> 01:16:59.910
<v Speaker 1>give them to your physician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed a Guy,</v>

1726
01:17:00.130 --> 01:17:02.200
<v Speaker 1>a guy on my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a cardiologist.</v>

1727
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm an md.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] name is dr ronald krauss.</v>

1728
01:17:04.241 --> 01:17:09.241
<v Speaker 1>He's actually the guy who pioneered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>test to measure small dense ldl particle</v>

1729
01:17:09.801 --> 01:17:14.801
<v Speaker 1>size and he's really been a leader in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the field for understanding the role of </v>

1730
01:17:15.051 --> 01:17:18.190
<v Speaker 1>small dense ldl particles in </v>
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular disease risk and,</v>

1731
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:23.410
<v Speaker 1>and how basically a person with high ldl</v>
<v Speaker 1>total cholesterol may not actually be at</v>

1732
01:17:24.921 --> 01:17:28.570
<v Speaker 1>risk for heart disease unless you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the actual particle size and,</v>

1733
01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:31.490
<v Speaker 1>and things like this is what confound </v>
<v Speaker 1>the literature because you can.</v>

1734
01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.040
<v Speaker 1>And this is what people often refer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>as cherry picking.</v>

1735
01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:39.820
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a pet peeve of mine have </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand people say that because it's like </v>

1736
01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:42.310
<v Speaker 1>anyone could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like really the response that </v>

1737
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:43.490
<v Speaker 1>someone should say is look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>totality of the data,</v>

1738
01:17:43.491 --> 01:17:48.491
<v Speaker 1>look at the clinical trials to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the observational studies looking at </v>

1739
01:17:48.491 --> 01:17:48.500
<v Speaker 1>mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at everything and get the picture.</v>

1740
01:17:48.501 --> 01:17:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1741
01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:52.010
<v Speaker 1>that's the way you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1742
01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.480
<v Speaker 1>approach nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

1743
01:17:53.690 --> 01:17:54.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1744
01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:59.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really been a leader in looking at </v>

1745
01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:01.851
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I kind of didn't answer your </v>

1746
01:18:01.851 --> 01:18:02.720
<v Speaker 1>question about the people that are vegan</v>
<v Speaker 1>and want to go eat more of a,</v>

1747
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:04.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high fat,</v>

1748
01:18:04.731 --> 01:18:07.250
<v Speaker 1>low carb diet or even a ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1749
01:18:07.670 --> 01:18:08.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

1750
01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:11.420
<v Speaker 1>that's something that they're vegans are</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in doing as well.</v>

1751
01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:12.710
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>

1752
01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1753
01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:19.720
<v Speaker 1>because my ape a background and by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that's kind of what motivated me to </v>

1754
01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:19.940
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

1755
01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:24.940
<v Speaker 1>I got super into this new field called </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrogenomix interaction between genes </v>

1756
01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:28.811
<v Speaker 1>and diet because I found out I had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal and I knew there were sorts of </v>

1757
01:18:28.811 --> 01:18:30.470
<v Speaker 1>risk and I'm like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's absolutely things you can do and</v>

1758
01:18:30.471 --> 01:18:32.540
<v Speaker 1>your diet and your lifestyle to modify </v>
<v Speaker 1>that disease risk.</v>

1759
01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:35.300
<v Speaker 1>And so if that's something that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interested in,</v>

1760
01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:37.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people can actually,</v>

1761
01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:40.250
<v Speaker 1>you can measure your dna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the dna doesn't tell you everything.</v>

1762
01:18:40.251 --> 01:18:43.940
<v Speaker 1>You have to measure blood biomarkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the blood biomarkers are really key</v>

1763
01:18:43.941 --> 01:18:46.160
<v Speaker 1>to know if a diet it's working for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>

1764
01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:49.490
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not working for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've had people emailing me,</v>

1765
01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:54.491
<v Speaker 1>they've used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a genetic tool that people can </v>

1766
01:18:54.491 --> 01:18:54.491
<v Speaker 1>use and if they want to look at april </v>
<v Speaker 1>before ppr gamma,</v>

1767
01:18:54.491 --> 01:18:55.640
<v Speaker 1>those are like free reports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>

1768
01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:58.700
<v Speaker 1>they've tried to kenogenic diet and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like awful for them.</v>

1769
01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Their inflammatory biomarkers went up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1770
01:19:00.621 --> 01:19:05.621
<v Speaker 1>small dense ldl particle went up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff that happened and then </v>

1771
01:19:05.621 --> 01:19:06.170
<v Speaker 1>they'd use the tool and found out they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

1772
01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:07.280
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ppa,</v>

1773
01:19:07.281 --> 01:19:12.281
<v Speaker 1>our alpha gene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a gene that's key for the </v>

1774
01:19:12.281 --> 01:19:14.060
<v Speaker 1>process of ketogenesis producing ketone </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies from,</v>

1775
01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:16.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from oxidizing fatty acids and,</v>

1776
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:18.770
<v Speaker 1>and people that have a certain one don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it very well.</v>

1777
01:19:18.771 --> 01:19:21.770
<v Speaker 1>And like the diet can be detrimental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it can,</v>

1778
01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.460
<v Speaker 1>it can do more harm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's critical because,</v>

1779
01:19:24.461 --> 01:19:25.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1780
01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:30.340
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been the irresponsibly telling </v>

1781
01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:30.340
<v Speaker 1>people to do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

1782
01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:32.480
<v Speaker 1>I think he'd agentic I responded very </v>
<v Speaker 1>well to it.</v>

1783
01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:34.830
<v Speaker 1>So I've been telling people to get on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>record,</v>

1784
01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:35.690
<v Speaker 1>delete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try it.</v>

1785
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:38.990
<v Speaker 1>So for what is exactly the gene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the issue?</v>

1786
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:40.670
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so ppr,</v>

1787
01:19:40.671 --> 01:19:42.500
<v Speaker 1>alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes,</v>

1788
01:19:42.650 --> 01:19:46.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a gene that's involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's involved in fatty acid metabolism,</v>

1789
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:48.520
<v Speaker 1>absorption of fatty acids.</v>

1790
01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

1791
01:19:49.230 --> 01:19:54.230
<v Speaker 1>it's in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the liver involved in producing </v>

1792
01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:54.410
<v Speaker 1>ketone bodies from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the fatty acid,</v>

1793
01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:59.650
<v Speaker 1>so that specific gene is essential for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the process of ketogenesis during a </v>

1794
01:19:59.650 --> 01:20:04.631
<v Speaker 1>fasted state and also if you're doing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketogenic type of diet and so a certain,</v>

1795
01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 1>there are certain variations in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gene that don't do it very well.</v>

1796
01:20:08.011 --> 01:20:10.410
<v Speaker 1>And so the high fat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what ends up happening is,</v>

1797
01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:11.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

1798
01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:14.700
<v Speaker 1>you're not metabolizing the fatty acids </v>
<v Speaker 1>and producing the ketone bodies quite as</v>

1799
01:20:14.701 --> 01:20:16.830
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you end up having more free fatty</v>

1800
01:20:16.831 --> 01:20:20.610
<v Speaker 1>acids floating around in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream which can antagonize insulin</v>

1801
01:20:20.611 --> 01:20:22.800
<v Speaker 1>receptor and make you more insulin </v>
<v Speaker 1>insensitive,</v>

1802
01:20:22.801 --> 01:20:25.710
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the opposite of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketogenic diets really do,</v>

1803
01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:27.510
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this very response.</v>

1804
01:20:27.511 --> 01:20:28.790
<v Speaker 1>You can also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1805
01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:34.100
<v Speaker 1>have more inflammatory biomarkers for </v>
<v Speaker 1>various reasons as well because you're </v>

1806
01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:35.460
<v Speaker 1>not oxidizing the fatty acids and ketone</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies as well.</v>

1807
01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:37.700
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of things that change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

1808
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:40.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing the genes is one component.</v>

1809
01:20:40.801 --> 01:20:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I think I think that you have to measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biomarkers first and once you,</v>

1810
01:20:45.170 --> 01:20:46.890
<v Speaker 1>you're doing something like a ketogenic </v>
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>

1811
01:20:46.891 --> 01:20:51.891
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you would measure all your lipid </v>

1812
01:20:51.891 --> 01:20:51.891
<v Speaker 1>particle sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your triglycerides,</v>

1813
01:20:51.891 --> 01:20:54.180
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory biomarkers to want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure hba one c,</v>

1814
01:20:54.181 --> 01:20:59.181
<v Speaker 1>which is your glycated hemoglobin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a marker of sort of your </v>

1815
01:20:59.181 --> 01:21:03.390
<v Speaker 1>longterm blood glucose levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have one test initially with a </v>

1816
01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:05.910
<v Speaker 1>baseline test before you enter into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1817
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:08.700
<v Speaker 1>That's really key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the origins of this is your</v>

1818
01:21:08.701 --> 01:21:13.701
<v Speaker 1>ancestral origins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what your ancestors diet consisted </v>

1819
01:21:13.701 --> 01:21:13.701
<v Speaker 1>of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Low fat,</v>

1820
01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:18.890
<v Speaker 1>high carbohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was kinda getting at </v>

1821
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.890
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1822
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.890
<v Speaker 1>that's the theory at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1823
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

1824
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:21.480
<v Speaker 1>we can't prove that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that there are scientists looking at</v>

1825
01:21:21.481 --> 01:21:23.460
<v Speaker 1>like different regions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people that live,</v>

1826
01:21:23.461 --> 01:21:28.461
<v Speaker 1>for example in northern europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they eat more fat and they're able </v>

1827
01:21:28.461 --> 01:21:28.461
<v Speaker 1>to do that better.</v>

1828
01:21:28.461 --> 01:21:32.000
<v Speaker 1>And so there are scientists that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigating that because it's </v>

1829
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:32.070
<v Speaker 1>interesting to know why a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why that is.</v>

1830
01:21:32.071 --> 01:21:32.640
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1831
01:21:32.670 --> 01:21:34.230
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1832
01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:37.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think it really explains a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with the ketogenic diet,</v>

1833
01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:38.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1834
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:43.170
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I've become really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in recently because I've been</v>

1835
01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:48.560
<v Speaker 1>following the field and it appears as </v>
<v Speaker 1>though there is a really,</v>

1836
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:54.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about it that is </v>

1837
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.590
<v Speaker 1>really important for the way your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitochondria age.</v>

1838
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Like it really seems to help your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitochondria age better.</v>

1839
01:21:57.810 --> 01:21:59.220
<v Speaker 1>And I think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1840
01:21:59.221 --> 01:22:00.360
<v Speaker 1>there's multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to,</v>

1841
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:02.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sort of an expert.</v>

1842
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:05.310
<v Speaker 1>He is the president of the buck </v>
<v Speaker 1>institute for research on aging,</v>

1843
01:22:05.730 --> 01:22:07.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

1844
01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:12.440
<v Speaker 1>his name is eric burdon and he just </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently published a really big paper </v>

1845
01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.801
<v Speaker 1>showing that in animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyclic ketogenic diets could extend </v>

1846
01:22:15.801 --> 01:22:16.380
<v Speaker 1>their health span.</v>

1847
01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:18.710
<v Speaker 1>So they are basically healthy part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the life they're living.</v>

1848
01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.180
<v Speaker 1>They were living longer and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>living better and,</v>

1849
01:22:21.190 --> 01:22:26.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also their memory was dramatically </v>

1850
01:22:26.190 --> 01:22:26.190
<v Speaker 1>improved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you say cyclic,</v>

1851
01:22:26.190 --> 01:22:28.620
<v Speaker 1>is there a specific range that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cycling.</v>

1852
01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:29.580
<v Speaker 1>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1853
01:22:29.581 --> 01:22:31.410
<v Speaker 1>and this is how these questions for him </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>

1854
01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.620
<v Speaker 1>that I asked him about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1855
01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.930
<v Speaker 1>and the cyclic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was every other week.</v>

1856
01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:42.200
<v Speaker 1>So one week they were key to genic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next week they were just getting normal </v>

1857
01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:42.990
<v Speaker 1>normal chow diet and then ketogenic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're recycling every other week.</v>

1858
01:22:43.410 --> 01:22:47.160
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>

1859
01:22:47.190 --> 01:22:49.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

1860
01:22:49.081 --> 01:22:51.180
<v Speaker 1>when they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you just give them food to eat,</v>

1861
01:22:51.181 --> 01:22:52.590
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ad lib them,</v>

1862
01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:55.140
<v Speaker 1>like whenever they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's ketogenic,</v>

1863
01:22:55.141 --> 01:22:56.370
<v Speaker 1>they'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll keep eating,</v>

1864
01:22:56.730 --> 01:22:59.550
<v Speaker 1>like they'll just keep eating it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can become,</v>

1865
01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:01.830
<v Speaker 1>it can become an obesogenic diet where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1866
01:23:01.890 --> 01:23:06.890
<v Speaker 1>where they become fat and it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually decrease your lifespan even </v>

1867
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:06.890
<v Speaker 1>though it's key to genic.</v>

1868
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:09.730
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's partly because fatty </v>
<v Speaker 1>acids,</v>

1869
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:11.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to use them,</v>

1870
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:16.210
<v Speaker 1>they have to get inside the mitochondria</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be used and that energy.</v>

1871
01:23:16.211 --> 01:23:17.800
<v Speaker 1>And if they don't get inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitochondria,</v>

1872
01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:22.300
<v Speaker 1>then they just get taken up into adipose</v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue and stored as fat and fatty acids</v>

1873
01:23:22.301 --> 01:23:25.450
<v Speaker 1>themselves will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the levels are high enough,</v>

1874
01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:28.060
<v Speaker 1>shut that transport system that does </v>
<v Speaker 1>that off.</v>

1875
01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:33.330
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a negative regulator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you just keep on bombarding the </v>

1876
01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:33.330
<v Speaker 1>body with fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

1877
01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:33.330
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

1878
01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:35.170
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nonstop without a rest,</v>

1879
01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:40.560
<v Speaker 1>then you start to like not be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use those fatty acids because it </v>

1880
01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:41.910
<v Speaker 1>inhibits the transport system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the karnataka,</v>

1881
01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.550
<v Speaker 1>pama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Total transfer is for those nerdy,</v>

1882
01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:46.520
<v Speaker 1>nerdy biologist geeks out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1883
01:23:46.770 --> 01:23:47.410
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1884
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:48.370
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1885
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I totally digress tigress there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1886
01:23:51.041 --> 01:23:52.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>

1887
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:54.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1888
01:23:54.341 --> 01:23:59.341
<v Speaker 1>the cycle can inject dye so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was something that extended their </v>

1889
01:23:59.341 --> 01:23:59.341
<v Speaker 1>health span and I became very interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that.</v>

1890
01:23:59.341 --> 01:24:04.260
<v Speaker 1>And so the thing that's super </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and as I was talking to dr </v>

1891
01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:04.960
<v Speaker 1>budin about this is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1892
01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:06.190
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1893
01:24:06.191 --> 01:24:10.900
<v Speaker 1>obviously you're not getting a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood glucose hits all the time,</v>

1894
01:24:10.901 --> 01:24:11.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

1895
01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:16.770
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have gene polymorphisms </v>

1896
01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:16.770
<v Speaker 1>that are changing the way you process </v>
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat,</v>

1897
01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:17.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not your,</v>

1898
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:22.590
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your insulin response is not happening </v>

1899
01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:22.590
<v Speaker 1>quite as often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's lowered and there's,</v>

1900
01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:23.170
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's benefits with from that alone,</v>

1901
01:24:23.171 --> 01:24:26.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for someone like me that doesn't eat</v>

1902
01:24:26.321 --> 01:24:28.960
<v Speaker 1>refined sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't eat any refined carbohydrates.</v>

1903
01:24:28.961 --> 01:24:33.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of my carbohydrates come from leafy </v>

1904
01:24:33.961 --> 01:24:34.420
<v Speaker 1>greens or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or vegetables and berries and some,</v>

1905
01:24:34.690 --> 01:24:35.950
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some other fruits,</v>

1906
01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:37.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1907
01:24:37.091 --> 01:24:42.091
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my blood glucose levels have always </v>

1908
01:24:42.091 --> 01:24:42.091
<v Speaker 1>been pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good,</v>

1909
01:24:42.091 --> 01:24:43.500
<v Speaker 1>like fasting blood glucose and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1910
01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:46.210
<v Speaker 1>with the exception of my lack of sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently in,</v>

1911
01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:49.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so the question I wanted to know was</v>

1912
01:24:49.611 --> 01:24:49.990
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1913
01:24:49.991 --> 01:24:51.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else is going on?</v>

1914
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:55.570
<v Speaker 1>And it seems as though the production of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the major circulating ketone body,</v>

1915
01:24:55.571 --> 01:25:00.571
<v Speaker 1>beta hydroxybutyrate really is having an</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti aging role and you know,</v>

1916
01:25:01.690 --> 01:25:03.650
<v Speaker 1>dr dan's work show that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1917
01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:07.330
<v Speaker 1>it's changing the expression of genes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like activating longevity genes</v>

1918
01:25:07.331 --> 01:25:09.460
<v Speaker 1>and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that's super,</v>

1919
01:25:09.461 --> 01:25:14.461
<v Speaker 1>super interesting to me is that the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's metabolized by mitochondria is </v>

1920
01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:19.770
<v Speaker 1>different than other energy sources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And without getting too much into </v>

1921
01:25:19.770 --> 01:25:21.400
<v Speaker 1>chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1922
01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:23.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to produce energy,</v>

1923
01:25:23.711 --> 01:25:26.100
<v Speaker 1>you have to use something called </v>
<v Speaker 1>electron reducing equivalents.</v>

1924
01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:31.140
<v Speaker 1>And they can be in the form of nad nadh </v>
<v Speaker 1>ratio or fad to agent.</v>

1925
01:25:32.890 --> 01:25:37.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's not going through one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathways that generates more free </v>

1926
01:25:37.890 --> 01:25:39.070
<v Speaker 1>radicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're basically leaky electrons that</v>

1927
01:25:39.071 --> 01:25:41.530
<v Speaker 1>can damage mitochondria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't go through that pathway,</v>

1928
01:25:41.531 --> 01:25:46.000
<v Speaker 1>like other energy sources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you end up net not,</v>

1929
01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:47.560
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1930
01:25:47.561 --> 01:25:52.561
<v Speaker 1>basically having lower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower inflammatory and lower oxidative </v>

1931
01:25:52.561 --> 01:25:52.561
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your mitochondria.</v>

1932
01:25:52.561 --> 01:25:54.910
<v Speaker 1>It also doesn't have what's called </v>
<v Speaker 1>proton proton,</v>

1933
01:25:54.911 --> 01:25:58.120
<v Speaker 1>a fork activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like the way your body,</v>

1934
01:25:58.121 --> 01:26:02.290
<v Speaker 1>your mitochondrial metabolizing it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>better because metabolism,</v>

1935
01:26:02.291 --> 01:26:04.310
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly generating damage,</v>

1936
01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:09.670
<v Speaker 3>like damaged constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now all the time it's just from </v>

1937
01:26:09.670 --> 01:26:10.310
<v Speaker 3>normal metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it seems as though there's something</v>

1938
01:26:10.311 --> 01:26:14.540
<v Speaker 3>about that beta hydroxybutyrate that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>superior and it's,</v>

1939
01:26:14.541 --> 01:26:19.541
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely gotten me super </v>

1940
01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:19.541
<v Speaker 3>interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1941
01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:23.411
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for like the longest time I was </v>

1942
01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:23.411
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'll get my beta hydroxybutyrate by</v>

1943
01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:27.770
<v Speaker 3>doing time restricted eating right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or I'm eating all my food within like 10</v>

1944
01:26:27.771 --> 01:26:29.090
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm,</v>

1945
01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:32.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm fasting for 14 hours and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1946
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:37.450
<v Speaker 3>depending on how active,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what your activity levels are and all </v>

1947
01:26:37.450 --> 01:26:37.450
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how quickly you deplete your liver,</v>

1948
01:26:37.450 --> 01:26:41.800
<v Speaker 3>liver glycogen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can start to make beta </v>

1949
01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:41.800
<v Speaker 3>hydroxybutyrate even within like seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours if you're really active,</v>

1950
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.740
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

1951
01:26:42.741 --> 01:26:45.710
<v Speaker 3>well I'm getting my beta beta </v>
<v Speaker 3>hydroxybutyrate from the fasting part of</v>

1952
01:26:45.711 --> 01:26:49.700
<v Speaker 3>the time restricted eating right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've become super interested in,</v>

1953
01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:55.120
<v Speaker 3>in this possible even because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>other reasons I don't eat a ketogenic </v>

1954
01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:55.120
<v Speaker 3>diet.</v>

1955
01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.610
<v Speaker 3>I like to get all the micronutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to get prebiotic fiber,</v>

1956
01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:03.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really good for the gut </v>

1957
01:27:03.850 --> 01:27:03.850
<v Speaker 3>microbiome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then again I don't,</v>

1958
01:27:03.850 --> 01:27:05.840
<v Speaker 3>we don't know exactly how ketogenic </v>
<v Speaker 3>diets even effecting the microbiome.</v>

1959
01:27:05.841 --> 01:27:08.240
<v Speaker 3>So that's sort of still an open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1960
01:27:08.241 --> 01:27:09.980
<v Speaker 3>open fields.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

1961
01:27:10.090 --> 01:27:12.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of thinking can I do some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of cyclic,</v>

1962
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:17.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cogenic die and also for me because I </v>

1963
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:18.080
<v Speaker 3>have april before I do eat saturated </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat,</v>

1964
01:27:18.081 --> 01:27:20.990
<v Speaker 3>but I eat it from like whole foods I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like.</v>

1965
01:27:20.991 --> 01:27:25.991
<v Speaker 3>I used to do a lot of cooking with </v>
<v Speaker 3>coconut oil which is high in saturated </v>

1966
01:27:25.991 --> 01:27:28.781
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like what do I need to do that </v>

1967
01:27:28.781 --> 01:27:30.671
<v Speaker 3>for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't really need to cook with </v>

1968
01:27:30.671 --> 01:27:30.671
<v Speaker 3>coconut oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can use avocado oil,</v>

1969
01:27:30.671 --> 01:27:34.420
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I changed that and my ldl just </v>

1970
01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:34.910
<v Speaker 3>dropped 20 points from just that alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1971
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:39.910
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what it will with large versus </v>

1972
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.910
<v Speaker 3>small?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1973
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:41.390
<v Speaker 3>my ldl overall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time.</v>

1974
01:27:41.391 --> 01:27:46.391
<v Speaker 3>So my baseline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't measure small dents so I don't </v>

1975
01:27:46.391 --> 01:27:46.580
<v Speaker 3>know what my baseline was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did measure the large,</v>

1976
01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:51.640
<v Speaker 3>so the large and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the large can transform into the small </v>

1977
01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:54.620
<v Speaker 3>events and so with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with refined sugars,</v>

1978
01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:55.910
<v Speaker 3>with refined sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's.</v>

1979
01:27:55.911 --> 01:27:57.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like you mentioned genetics,</v>

1980
01:27:57.561 --> 01:27:59.630
<v Speaker 3>there may be something that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

1981
01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:04.960
<v Speaker 3>What is the mechanism for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transference of the sugar with the ldl?</v>

1982
01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:07.940
<v Speaker 3>Like w what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What causes it to become small?</v>

1983
01:28:07.941 --> 01:28:10.610
<v Speaker 3>Dense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure we entirely understand that</v>

1984
01:28:10.611 --> 01:28:15.611
<v Speaker 3>yet just because it's definitely a </v>
<v Speaker 3>correlation in their head and it has </v>

1985
01:28:15.611 --> 01:28:19.151
<v Speaker 3>been shown in clinical studies to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to not just be correlation but causal </v>

1986
01:28:19.151 --> 01:28:19.280
<v Speaker 3>where you give people refined sugar and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>

1987
01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:21.070
<v Speaker 3>They're small dental school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1988
01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:22.640
<v Speaker 3>same diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same diet,</v>

1989
01:28:22.641 --> 01:28:24.320
<v Speaker 3>adding refined sugar.</v>

1990
01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:27.410
<v Speaker 3>You see a radical difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You measure their small dense ldl before</v>

1991
01:28:27.411 --> 01:28:29.060
<v Speaker 3>giving them the refined sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same diet,</v>

1992
01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:34.240
<v Speaker 3>and then you measure after the soda </v>
<v Speaker 3>blast of refined sugar for three weeks </v>

1993
01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:38.981
<v Speaker 3>and they're small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dense ldl particles going through the </v>

1994
01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:41.111
<v Speaker 3>roof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's causal because you're giving </v>

1995
01:28:41.111 --> 01:28:43.301
<v Speaker 3>them something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're measuring it before and after </v>

1996
01:28:43.301 --> 01:28:45.220
<v Speaker 3>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if there's anything that we can </v>

1997
01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:47.410
<v Speaker 3>conclusively point too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that refined sugar is absolutely </v>

1998
01:28:47.410 --> 01:28:48.800
<v Speaker 3>bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about that,</v>

1999
01:28:48.801 --> 01:28:49.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2000
01:28:49.330 --> 01:28:50.630
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

2001
01:28:50.631 --> 01:28:53.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many studies that have shown,</v>

2002
01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inflammatory biomarkers go up,</v>

2003
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:59.210
<v Speaker 3>your small dense ldl biomarkers go up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's correlation studies showing that</v>

2004
01:28:59.211 --> 01:29:01.990
<v Speaker 3>people that eat refined sugar have like </v>
<v Speaker 3>tila</v>

2005
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:06.990
<v Speaker 1>mirrors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are a biomarker for aging that </v>

2006
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:06.990
<v Speaker 1>looked 10 years older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2007
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:10.371
<v Speaker 1>even though people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the same chronological age is </v>

2008
01:29:10.371 --> 01:29:10.371
<v Speaker 1>other people that don't eat the refined </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar.</v>

2009
01:29:10.371 --> 01:29:14.480
<v Speaker 1>There's studies and men would like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give men 75 grams of refined sugar </v>

2010
01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.810
<v Speaker 1>and their testosterone drops by 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

2011
01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:20.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's changing a lot of things in the </v>

2012
01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:20.840
<v Speaker 1>body in a negative way.</v>

2013
01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:21.260
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mine,</v>

2014
01:29:21.261 --> 01:29:24.290
<v Speaker 5>my testosterone doubled when I changed </v>
<v Speaker 5>my diet.</v>

2015
01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:29.320
<v Speaker 5>When I cut out the pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I cut out the bread and I started </v>

2016
01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.590
<v Speaker 5>eating more saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more protein,</v>

2017
01:29:30.591 --> 01:29:35.591
<v Speaker 5>and I went to the ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally a doubled doing everything </v>

2018
01:29:35.591 --> 01:29:40.091
<v Speaker 5>exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was stunning and I felt different </v>

2019
01:29:40.091 --> 01:29:42.050
<v Speaker 5>like I can feel the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 5>feel the difference in my energy levels,</v>

2020
01:29:42.051 --> 01:29:43.790
<v Speaker 5>feel a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cognitively.</v>

2021
01:29:43.791 --> 01:29:48.791
<v Speaker 5>The cognitive thing was a big thing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I attributed it to cutting out refined </v>

2022
01:29:48.791 --> 01:29:49.200
<v Speaker 5>sugars and refined carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

2023
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:50.690
<v Speaker 5>I think that stuff's poison.</v>

2024
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been studies showing it also </v>

2025
01:29:56.050 --> 01:29:56.050
<v Speaker 1>affects your brain and negative way as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2026
01:29:56.050 --> 01:29:56.610
<v Speaker 1>and people that eat refined sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2027
01:29:56.611 --> 01:29:58.060
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more brain atrophy.</v>

2028
01:29:58.061 --> 01:29:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of correlations.</v>

2029
01:29:59.830 --> 01:30:01.930
<v Speaker 1>The one thing I will say is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2030
01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:07.200
<v Speaker 1>there are people that are super </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically active and they're like </v>

2031
01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:07.200
<v Speaker 1>working out two hours a day and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2032
01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.700
<v Speaker 1>those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all use refined sugar.</v>

2033
01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To,</v>

2034
01:30:11.641 --> 01:30:12.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

2035
01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:14.660
<v Speaker 1>their increased transport glucose </v>
<v Speaker 1>transporter,</v>

2036
01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:18.430
<v Speaker 1>their muscles and are using it as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anabolic way to like get bigger muscle.</v>

2037
01:30:18.431 --> 01:30:20.980
<v Speaker 1>And I know guys who do that after they </v>
<v Speaker 1>work out the candy.</v>

2038
01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm and,</v>

2039
01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:23.810
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's,</v>

2040
01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:28.850
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't compare like people that </v>

2041
01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:28.850
<v Speaker 1>aren't working out like two hours a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

2042
01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:30.440
<v Speaker 1>like that to normal people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raymond,</v>

2043
01:30:30.610 --> 01:30:32.980
<v Speaker 1>sedentary weightlifters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weightlifters,</v>

2044
01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:33.190
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2045
01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:35.560
<v Speaker 5>Folded or just ripping their body apart </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2046
01:30:35.770 --> 01:30:40.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a lot of savages out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there that are doing crazy power lifting</v>

2047
01:30:40.061 --> 01:30:45.061
<v Speaker 5>workouts and benching and squatting and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I know a lot of guys who like to eat </v>

2048
01:30:45.061 --> 01:30:45.220
<v Speaker 5>candy afterwards,</v>

2049
01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:45.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2050
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:46.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2051
01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:47.870
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2052
01:30:47.871 --> 01:30:50.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2053
01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:52.060
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

2054
01:30:52.170 --> 01:30:53.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not acting the same way,</v>

2055
01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:57.080
<v Speaker 1>be different requirements that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>body needs in terms of glucose.</v>

2056
01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:02.680
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean still it's like the way I think </v>

2057
01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:02.680
<v Speaker 1>about it is it's not really nutrient </v>
<v Speaker 1>dense,</v>

2058
01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:02.680
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to like,</v>

2059
01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's lots of.</v>

2060
01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:05.300
<v Speaker 1>There's reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2061
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:10.390
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why I like to like take</v>
<v Speaker 1>it if you want the sugar and eat an </v>

2062
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.800
<v Speaker 1>orange or an apple or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2063
01:31:10.801 --> 01:31:12.980
<v Speaker 1>or you should probably the better move </v>
<v Speaker 1>than eaten candy,</v>

2064
01:31:12.981 --> 01:31:13.310
<v Speaker 1>but I think</v>

2065
01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:15.450
<v Speaker 5>they just want a ton of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what is the,</v>

2066
01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:20.480
<v Speaker 5>what's the anabolic factor?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you were going to eat candy or </v>

2067
01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:23.691
<v Speaker 5>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has a bunch of refined sugar after like </v>

2068
01:31:23.691 --> 01:31:23.970
<v Speaker 5>an intense workout.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would be the anabolic effect?</v>

2069
01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the glucose,</v>

2070
01:31:24.890 --> 01:31:29.890
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the workout causes glucose transporters </v>

2071
01:31:29.890 --> 01:31:33.731
<v Speaker 1>that transport glucose to like go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the roof and so you start the </v>

2072
01:31:33.731 --> 01:31:34.940
<v Speaker 1>glucose from your bloodstream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets sucked into the muscle,</v>

2073
01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:36.770
<v Speaker 1>and then in the muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2074
01:31:36.771 --> 01:31:37.880
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're basically,</v>

2075
01:31:37.881 --> 01:31:39.280
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use that as,</v>

2076
01:31:39.281 --> 01:31:40.220
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a way to,</v>

2077
01:31:40.270 --> 01:31:42.350
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have insulin and it can be anabolic,</v>

2078
01:31:42.351 --> 01:31:43.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>

2079
01:31:43.450 --> 01:31:47.060
<v Speaker 1>where whereas if you weren't doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the glucose in your bloodstream and</v>

2080
01:31:47.061 --> 01:31:52.061
<v Speaker 1>it can also tip small dense ldl </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles can start to form because the </v>

2081
01:31:52.061 --> 01:31:53.690
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory transformations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and things like that,</v>

2082
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:59.530
<v Speaker 1>that's at least my understanding that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>in combination of course with amino </v>

2083
01:31:59.530 --> 01:32:01.090
<v Speaker 1>acids which are also important for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth of the protein and muscle.</v>

2084
01:32:01.091 --> 01:32:02.170
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2085
01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:04.170
<v Speaker 3>my understanding of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2086
01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:09.800
<v Speaker 3>So in general though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone could cut one thing out of </v>

2087
01:32:10.621 --> 01:32:14.790
<v Speaker 3>their diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>refined carbohydrates and refined sugars</v>

2088
01:32:14.791 --> 01:32:17.040
<v Speaker 3>would be a great way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the one,</v>

2089
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:22.070
<v Speaker 3>if you were to think about the one </v>
<v Speaker 3>easiest thing that you could do that </v>

2090
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.950
<v Speaker 3>would have the biggest impact on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>

2091
01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:24.870
<v Speaker 3>And if you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're talking about,</v>

2092
01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:27.630
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking about someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>already paleo or someone like,</v>

2093
01:32:27.631 --> 01:32:32.631
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about standard american </v>

2094
01:32:32.631 --> 01:32:32.631
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2095
01:32:32.631 --> 01:32:35.430
<v Speaker 3>The one thing that they could do to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest impact on their health,</v>

2096
01:32:35.490 --> 01:32:37.590
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to cut out refined sugar.</v>

2097
01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:41.760
<v Speaker 3>Like that's probably the biggest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The easiest thing.</v>

2098
01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:44.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how easy it is,</v>

2099
01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:47.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be addicted and that's been shown</v>

2100
01:32:47.311 --> 01:32:48.440
<v Speaker 3>dopamine levels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2101
01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:50.940
<v Speaker 3>can get activated and that it's also </v>
<v Speaker 3>your gut biome.</v>

2102
01:32:50.941 --> 01:32:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2103
01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:55.440
<v Speaker 3>Your gut biome literally has an impact </v>
<v Speaker 3>on what you desire,</v>

2104
01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:56.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2105
01:32:56.221 --> 01:32:57.240
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

2106
01:32:57.241 --> 01:32:59.790
<v Speaker 1>you're the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about your microbiome and your</v>

2107
01:32:59.791 --> 01:33:01.620
<v Speaker 1>gut is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2108
01:33:01.650 --> 01:33:02.530
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2109
01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:05.970
<v Speaker 1>the microbiome eats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's at the distal part of your gut.</v>

2110
01:33:05.971 --> 01:33:08.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's in the colon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the large intestine,</v>

2111
01:33:08.341 --> 01:33:13.341
<v Speaker 1>the very end of the large intestine is </v>
<v Speaker 1>where most of the trillions of bacteria </v>

2112
01:33:13.341 --> 01:33:17.451
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those bacteria actually eat the </v>

2113
01:33:17.451 --> 01:33:18.720
<v Speaker 1>fermentable fiber that we don't digest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

2114
01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:23.780
<v Speaker 1>we don't process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fermentable fiber comes from a </v>

2115
01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:24.270
<v Speaker 1>variety of plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

2116
01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:26.970
<v Speaker 1>from plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and from seeds and nuts.</v>

2117
01:33:26.971 --> 01:33:30.640
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like qms as well,</v>

2118
01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:31.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2119
01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:36.920
<v Speaker 1>so there's different types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fermentable fiber that are found in </v>

2120
01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:37.530
<v Speaker 1>different types of foods and they feed </v>
<v Speaker 1>different species of bacteria.</v>

2121
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you don't get enough of that </v>

2122
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.310
<v Speaker 1>fermentable fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what ends up happening,</v>

2123
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:48.081
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been studies showing that 75 </v>

2124
01:33:48.081 --> 01:33:48.081
<v Speaker 1>percent of the microbiome population </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>

2125
01:33:48.081 --> 01:33:51.300
<v Speaker 1>And like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you don't get at all any fiber,</v>

2126
01:33:51.630 --> 01:33:52.920
<v Speaker 1>and what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of things,</v>

2127
01:33:52.921 --> 01:33:53.870
<v Speaker 1>one is those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mike,</v>

2128
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:56.070
<v Speaker 1>those bacteria species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start to eat,</v>

2129
01:33:56.530 --> 01:34:01.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the carbohydrate that's lining your gut </v>

2130
01:34:01.530 --> 01:34:04.131
<v Speaker 1>called mucin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what makes up the gut barrier </v>

2131
01:34:04.131 --> 01:34:04.140
<v Speaker 1>that separates the immune cells in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>gut from the bacteria.</v>

2132
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:05.900
<v Speaker 1>They start to eat it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate.</v>

2133
01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:09.570
<v Speaker 1>And so you actually start to break down </v>
<v Speaker 1>your gut barrier just from that.</v>

2134
01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:14.930
<v Speaker 1>The second thing that happens is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned is that a lot of the </v>

2135
01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:15.930
<v Speaker 1>pathogenic bacteria will swim up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>small intestine where they're really not</v>

2136
01:34:15.931 --> 01:34:20.931
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small intestine is where you absorb </v>

2137
01:34:20.931 --> 01:34:20.931
<v Speaker 1>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protein,</v>

2138
01:34:20.931 --> 01:34:21.960
<v Speaker 1>fats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this warmup there,</v>

2139
01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:26.980
<v Speaker 1>and guess what sugar they start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they start to like eat the sugar and </v>

2140
01:34:27.091 --> 01:34:32.091
<v Speaker 1>they start to multiply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about having bacteria in </v>

2141
01:34:32.091 --> 01:34:32.091
<v Speaker 1>the small intestine where it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be,</v>

2142
01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:35.030
<v Speaker 1>is that it causes the same response </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2143
01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:38.630
<v Speaker 1>that eating gluten causes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it basically those,</v>

2144
01:34:38.631 --> 01:34:40.470
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called small bacteria,</v>

2145
01:34:40.471 --> 01:34:41.760
<v Speaker 1>intestinal overgrowth.</v>

2146
01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:47.120
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that the tight </v>
<v Speaker 1>junctions that make up the gut barrier </v>

2147
01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:51.410
<v Speaker 1>starts to open up and open up and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows the inflammatory immune cells to </v>

2148
01:34:51.931 --> 01:34:56.931
<v Speaker 1>be in contact with bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course the immune cells go </v>

2149
01:34:56.931 --> 01:35:00.170
<v Speaker 1>bacteria and they started to like try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill it because they think this not </v>

2150
01:35:00.170 --> 01:35:02.520
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be potentially harmful </v>

2151
01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:05.230
<v Speaker 1>pathogenic bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that starts to set off an immune </v>

2152
01:35:05.230 --> 01:35:05.330
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory immune response.</v>

2153
01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:07.820
<v Speaker 1>And the more you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more sugar you eat,</v>

2154
01:35:07.850 --> 01:35:11.240
<v Speaker 1>the more your population of bacteria is </v>
<v Speaker 1>flourishing.</v>

2155
01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:13.100
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's like,</v>

2156
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:14.720
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2157
01:35:14.721 --> 01:35:16.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's changing that.</v>

2158
01:35:16.131 --> 01:35:19.960
<v Speaker 1>But it's also the one of the reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was saying with um,</v>

2159
01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:22.310
<v Speaker 1>and I've never actually tried a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketogenetic diet,</v>

2160
01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:23.470
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2161
01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:24.890
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2162
01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:26.840
<v Speaker 1>for various reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

2163
01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how much plants you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

2164
01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:33.610
<v Speaker 1>like can you eat like a good amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you get like some roots,</v>

2165
01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:37.060
<v Speaker 2>depends on the individual on a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>small scale.</v>

2166
01:35:37.110 --> 01:35:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>robb wolf and his wife have done some </v>

2167
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:42.340
<v Speaker 2>pretty interesting tasks where they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>both eat the same thing and they'll both</v>

2168
01:35:42.341 --> 01:35:44.410
<v Speaker 2>tests themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll test the,</v>

2169
01:35:44.411 --> 01:35:45.280
<v Speaker 2>both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2170
01:35:45.281 --> 01:35:50.281
<v Speaker 2>x amount of minutes later and they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a radically different response between </v>

2171
01:35:50.281 --> 01:35:50.281
<v Speaker 2>the two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>

2172
01:35:50.281 --> 01:35:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Like his wife is much more resilient and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has much more of a difficult time </v>

2173
01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:55.340
<v Speaker 2>getting back into ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real,</v>

2174
01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:57.960
<v Speaker 2>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just documented a lot of it on his,</v>

2175
01:35:57.980 --> 01:35:59.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his instagram page.</v>

2176
01:35:59.561 --> 01:36:04.561
<v Speaker 2>But I think it speaks to what you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about before that it really </v>

2177
01:36:04.561 --> 01:36:06.580
<v Speaker 2>depends on where your ancestors evolved </v>
<v Speaker 2>and really has.</v>

2178
01:36:06.581 --> 01:36:09.940
<v Speaker 2>There's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We very biologically so much</v>

2179
01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:11.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do.</v>

2180
01:36:11.151 --> 01:36:16.151
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that affects how we respond to </v>

2181
01:36:16.151 --> 01:36:16.151
<v Speaker 1>these foods and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2182
01:36:16.151 --> 01:36:17.930
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

2183
01:36:17.931 --> 01:36:20.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the other thing I wanted to ask</v>

2184
01:36:20.061 --> 01:36:20.960
<v Speaker 1>you about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2185
01:36:20.961 --> 01:36:25.961
<v Speaker 1>the nad to remember the nad I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about like the nad and nadh </v>

2186
01:36:26.181 --> 01:36:28.460
<v Speaker 1>ratio in ned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is something,</v>

2187
01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:30.380
<v Speaker 1>what does that add stand for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2188
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:34.400
<v Speaker 1>nicotinamide attending die nucleotide </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's something,</v>

2189
01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:36.110
<v Speaker 1>it's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2190
01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:41.860
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of in a way similar to atp </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's used as an energetic currency</v>

2191
01:36:43.101 --> 01:36:44.870
<v Speaker 1>throughout the body for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

2192
01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:49.900
<v Speaker 1>for various things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually required to like </v>

2193
01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:53.860
<v Speaker 1>forgive metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you need it to metabolize fatty </v>

2194
01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:57.860
<v Speaker 1>acids and glucose and amino acids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also,</v>

2195
01:36:57.890 --> 01:37:02.890
<v Speaker 1>you need it to repair damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need it for a variety of other </v>

2196
01:37:02.890 --> 01:37:05.360
<v Speaker 1>things that are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>

2197
01:37:05.361 --> 01:37:10.361
<v Speaker 1>is that these nad levels in tissues that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very energetically demanding,</v>

2198
01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:12.470
<v Speaker 1>they deplete.</v>

2199
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:13.540
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're immune,</v>

2200
01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:17.150
<v Speaker 1>if you have chronic inflammation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your immune system's chronic chronically</v>

2201
01:37:17.151 --> 01:37:19.730
<v Speaker 1>being activated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nad levels are going to that.</v>

2202
01:37:19.731 --> 01:37:24.731
<v Speaker 1>And it's kinda like triaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is your metabolism </v>

2203
01:37:24.731 --> 01:37:28.001
<v Speaker 1>suffers and it's been shown now that nad</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels in like multiple tissues with </v>

2204
01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:30.920
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they deplete.</v>

2205
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Lots of preclinical studies have shown </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it plays a role in the aging </v>

2206
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:37.070
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

2207
01:37:37.071 --> 01:37:39.860
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take like a mouse that has progeria this</v>

2208
01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.920
<v Speaker 1>pro aging phenotype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you give them the nad it like </v>

2209
01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:48.071
<v Speaker 1>can like basically kind of rescue that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way and they like live a more </v>

2210
01:37:48.071 --> 01:37:48.710
<v Speaker 1>normal health span and more normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifespan.</v>

2211
01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:50.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of studies showing that</v>

2212
01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:55.960
<v Speaker 1>in various ways there's recently been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of interest in it because the nad </v>

2213
01:37:56.430 --> 01:38:01.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a way to replenish it through </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplemental form called nicotinamide </v>

2214
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.430
<v Speaker 1>riboside.</v>

2215
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:04.230
<v Speaker 1>So nad is actually formed from vitamin b</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2216
01:38:04.231 --> 01:38:09.150
<v Speaker 1>like nicotinic acid or nicotinamide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or from tryptofan.</v>

2217
01:38:09.690 --> 01:38:11.670
<v Speaker 1>But nicotine in my driver's side is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2218
01:38:11.730 --> 01:38:14.220
<v Speaker 1>another precursor that you can take in </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplemental form.</v>

2219
01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:19.260
<v Speaker 1>And there's been studies over the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>few years looking at how in animals it's</v>

2220
01:38:19.261 --> 01:38:21.180
<v Speaker 1>been able to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase nad levels.</v>

2221
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:24.540
<v Speaker 1>It's able to like basically improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical performance,</v>

2222
01:38:24.541 --> 01:38:29.541
<v Speaker 1>cognitive performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's able to make your tissues age </v>

2223
01:38:29.541 --> 01:38:29.541
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your organs,</v>

2224
01:38:29.541 --> 01:38:30.540
<v Speaker 1>age better and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in animals.</v>

2225
01:38:31.050 --> 01:38:34.290
<v Speaker 1>So I'm now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like ben preclinical trials that</v>

2226
01:38:34.291 --> 01:38:34.880
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

2227
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:39.950
<v Speaker 1>clinical trials that have been under </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergoing one showing that you actually</v>

2228
01:38:40.411 --> 01:38:45.411
<v Speaker 1>can take the supplemental form of nad </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicotinamide riboside and you can </v>

2229
01:38:45.411 --> 01:38:48.471
<v Speaker 1>increase your nad levels it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent manner so as to say that just </v>

2230
01:38:48.471 --> 01:38:51.980
<v Speaker 1>came out recently and there's now um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2231
01:38:52.110 --> 01:38:57.110
<v Speaker 1>there's now like 10 clinical trials that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been under that are undergoing </v>

2232
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:58.590
<v Speaker 1>right now looking at the role of </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplemental nicotine,</v>

2233
01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:02.670
<v Speaker 1>nicotine in my right beside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a dementia in obesity,</v>

2234
01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:08.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic brain injuries and other one </v>

2235
01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:09.240
<v Speaker 1>and then some other type of metabolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>dysfunction so that the,</v>

2236
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:12.090
<v Speaker 1>these are currently being investigated </v>
<v Speaker 1>in humans.</v>

2237
01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.970
<v Speaker 1>So the sad thing is another real big </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest of mine.</v>

2238
01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:20.960
<v Speaker 1>I did buy the supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not taking it right now because </v>

2239
01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:20.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm breastfeeding and I'm just not sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>how that,</v>

2240
01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:25.800
<v Speaker 1>you know how that goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're asking me about the ib stuff.</v>

2241
01:39:25.801 --> 01:39:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that's something that is now </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular everywhere I've looked at,</v>

2242
01:39:29.821 --> 01:39:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I've looked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's becoming really popular.</v>

2243
01:39:31.981 --> 01:39:36.981
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's really no clinical </v>

2244
01:39:36.981 --> 01:39:36.981
<v Speaker 1>evidence of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2245
01:39:36.981 --> 01:39:39.480
<v Speaker 1>of like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you intravenously take ned,</v>

2246
01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:42.420
<v Speaker 1>is that gonna have the same effect that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2247
01:39:42.450 --> 01:39:44.880
<v Speaker 1>taking nicotinamide riboside does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it get into your cells?</v>

2248
01:39:45.210 --> 01:39:47.640
<v Speaker 1>So it's an open question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems,</v>

2249
01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:52.700
<v Speaker 1>it seems like people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting results and obviously it's </v>

2250
01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:54.560
<v Speaker 1>all anecdotal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have anything ivy.</v>

2251
01:39:54.570 --> 01:39:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever done like ivy vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 1>infusions?</v>

2252
01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:58.740
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2253
01:39:58.820 --> 01:39:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I haven't either.</v>

2254
01:39:59.790 --> 01:40:01.820
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always look at it.</v>

2255
01:40:01.821 --> 01:40:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2256
01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:03.470
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2257
01:40:03.970 --> 01:40:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't want to sit there and </v>

2258
01:40:08.970 --> 01:40:08.970
<v Speaker 1>have vitamins pumped into my veins for </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

2259
01:40:08.970 --> 01:40:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I've had people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had people tell me that like great </v>

2260
01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:15.150
<v Speaker 1>things about doing the nad nad plus is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's actually called.</v>

2261
01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:18.540
<v Speaker 1>But I've never actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never tried that.</v>

2262
01:40:18.541 --> 01:40:21.660
<v Speaker 1>And I think before I would do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

2263
01:40:21.661 --> 01:40:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I would probably try the nicotine in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>beside,</v>

2264
01:40:23.490 --> 01:40:26.460
<v Speaker 1>which we know for a fact does increase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2265
01:40:26.610 --> 01:40:31.610
<v Speaker 1>nad levels and multiple tissues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it would be nice to have some of </v>

2266
01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:33.270
<v Speaker 1>these clinics that are doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like aggregate the data.</v>

2267
01:40:33.271 --> 01:40:38.271
<v Speaker 1>And publish it because no one's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fund this study like people aren't </v>

2268
01:40:38.271 --> 01:40:38.271
<v Speaker 1>studying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2269
01:40:38.271 --> 01:40:42.900
<v Speaker 1>so there's no way to really know if it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>placebo or really,</v>

2270
01:40:42.901 --> 01:40:45.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's no data.</v>

2271
01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:50.600
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be kinda nice to like people would </v>

2272
01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:53.680
<v Speaker 1>start to aggregate data on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But well it's really interesting when it</v>

2273
01:40:53.681 --> 01:40:54.430
<v Speaker 1>comes to data</v>

2274
01:40:54.490 --> 01:40:59.490
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you know the whole throw the </v>

2275
01:40:59.490 --> 01:41:03.931
<v Speaker 5>baby out with the bathwater thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the studies that I've read pretty</v>

2276
01:41:03.971 --> 01:41:08.971
<v Speaker 5>recently was about the amount of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that suffered ill health consequences </v>

2277
01:41:09.161 --> 01:41:13.510
<v Speaker 5>that ate red meat five days per week </v>
<v Speaker 5>versus people who didn't.</v>

2278
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:18.870
<v Speaker 5>But what they didn't take into account </v>
<v Speaker 5>was what the people ate with the red </v>

2279
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:20.380
<v Speaker 5>meat when they drank soda with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How did you get your form of red meat?</v>

2280
01:41:20.410 --> 01:41:24.370
<v Speaker 5>Was it grass fed beef?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was it bison or wild game?</v>

2281
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:29.550
<v Speaker 5>Or was it a burger from wendy's with </v>
<v Speaker 5>fries and the sugar bond and all the </v>

2282
01:41:29.770 --> 01:41:32.680
<v Speaker 5>bullshit that people eat along with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>food and that you,</v>

2283
01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:37.740
<v Speaker 5>you literally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And people would cite these things as </v>

2284
01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:38.410
<v Speaker 5>being evidence that something is </v>
<v Speaker 5>negative for you,</v>

2285
01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:42.220
<v Speaker 5>that red meat is negative for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're not taking into consideration</v>

2286
01:41:42.221 --> 01:41:44.230
<v Speaker 5>all of the things that we're eating with</v>
<v Speaker 5>that red meat.</v>

2287
01:41:44.230 --> 01:41:47.430
<v Speaker 5>So these studies that come out like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are so they're.</v>

2288
01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:50.530
<v Speaker 5>They're really annoying because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>like you have to,</v>

2289
01:41:50.531 --> 01:41:53.410
<v Speaker 5>you usually talk to people about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to like sit down with them.</v>

2290
01:41:53.411 --> 01:41:54.100
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sit down.</v>

2291
01:41:55.230 --> 01:42:00.230
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a long process to try to try to </v>

2292
01:42:01.450 --> 01:42:06.450
<v Speaker 5>figure out what is the cause of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>issues when you're talking about a </v>

2293
01:42:06.450 --> 01:42:10.141
<v Speaker 5>lifetime of abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about like all sorts of </v>

2294
01:42:10.141 --> 01:42:13.591
<v Speaker 5>different health consequences of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>variety of different foods and you're </v>

2295
01:42:13.591 --> 01:42:16.381
<v Speaker 5>attributing it all to one part of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>diet and that's very difficult to do </v>

2296
01:42:16.381 --> 01:42:17.710
<v Speaker 5>unless you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've isolated everything else and done</v>

2297
01:42:17.711 --> 01:42:22.711
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of different studies where okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ate nothing but fruits and vegetables </v>

2298
01:42:22.711 --> 01:42:26.701
<v Speaker 5>and I really healthy and I read meet </v>
<v Speaker 5>five days a week or I nothing but shit </v>

2299
01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:32.760
<v Speaker 5>and fries and bonds and pasta and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't eat red meat at all.</v>

2300
01:42:33.490 --> 01:42:34.630
<v Speaker 5>And now here's the result.</v>

2301
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're making a really good point and</v>

2302
01:42:36.961 --> 01:42:41.961
<v Speaker 1>that is the combination of how these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different foods are interacting in our </v>

2303
01:42:42.301 --> 01:42:44.820
<v Speaker 1>bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely important.</v>

2304
01:42:44.821 --> 01:42:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Like we talked about the refined sugar </v>
<v Speaker 1>and saturated fat combo.</v>

2305
01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2306
01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2307
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:53.130
<v Speaker 1>the red meat and even just protein like </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

2308
01:42:53.131 --> 01:42:53.650
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2309
01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:58.860
<v Speaker 1>essential amino acids that are coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>from animal protein itself and how that </v>

2310
01:42:58.860 --> 01:42:58.860
<v Speaker 1>is interacting with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2311
01:42:58.890 --> 01:43:03.890
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating a terrible diet like refined </v>

2312
01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:03.890
<v Speaker 1>sugar which is causing damage to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

2313
01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:08.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also exercise and this is something </v>

2314
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.390
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2315
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.460
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2316
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:11.430
<v Speaker 1>the protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a exercise thing seems to be really key.</v>

2317
01:43:11.431 --> 01:43:16.431
<v Speaker 1>But there was a recent study that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>published that was the largest study </v>

2318
01:43:16.431 --> 01:43:21.170
<v Speaker 1>observational study done so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at protein intake and all cause </v>

2319
01:43:21.170 --> 01:43:23.870
<v Speaker 1>mortality and cancer mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it found a,</v>

2320
01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:27.300
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of other studies that higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>protein consumption,</v>

2321
01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:32.720
<v Speaker 1>higher meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protein consumption from meat was </v>

2322
01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:34.050
<v Speaker 1>associated with a higher all cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality in a higher cancer mortality.</v>

2323
01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:36.930
<v Speaker 1>But then when the data was analyzed and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2324
01:43:36.970 --> 01:43:39.450
<v Speaker 1>and other unhealthy lifestyle factors </v>
<v Speaker 1>will look at.</v>

2325
01:43:39.451 --> 01:43:41.100
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

2326
01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:46.160
<v Speaker 1>if someone had one other unhealthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle factor being either obesity,</v>

2327
01:43:46.261 --> 01:43:51.261
<v Speaker 1>smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excessive alcohol consumption or being </v>

2328
01:43:51.261 --> 01:43:51.290
<v Speaker 1>sedentary than they had a higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

2329
01:43:51.291 --> 01:43:54.110
<v Speaker 1>had a higher all cause mortality in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher cancer mortality if they meat.</v>

2330
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:56.180
<v Speaker 1>But guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they had zero,</v>

2331
01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:00.230
<v Speaker 1>none of those other unhealthy lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors they didn't have.</v>

2332
01:44:00.231 --> 01:44:05.231
<v Speaker 1>They had the same aisle all cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality and cancer related mortality </v>

2333
01:44:05.231 --> 01:44:08.951
<v Speaker 1>that the non meat eater tat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that really highlights the </v>

2334
01:44:08.951 --> 01:44:11.990
<v Speaker 1>importance of other lifestyle factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other foods,</v>

2335
01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:14.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really important when we're at,</v>

2336
01:44:14.171 --> 01:44:15.950
<v Speaker 1>when we're looking at these </v>
<v Speaker 1>observational studies,</v>

2337
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:20.990
<v Speaker 5>when you were talking about saturated </v>
<v Speaker 5>fat and the negative consequences of </v>

2338
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:23.160
<v Speaker 5>eating refined sugar with saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there a negative,</v>

2339
01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:25.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm a corresponding negative </v>
<v Speaker 5>consequence.</v>

2340
01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:31.280
<v Speaker 5>Like if you had a negative or if you had</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2341
01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:36.940
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a diet that didn't have any saturated </v>

2342
01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:36.940
<v Speaker 5>fat in it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you ate refined sugar,</v>

2343
01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:41.600
<v Speaker 5>like say if you eat a vegan diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does saturated or does refined sugar </v>

2344
01:44:41.761 --> 01:44:42.990
<v Speaker 5>have less of an impact</v>

2345
01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:46.910
<v Speaker 1>of eating refined sugars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ldl,</v>

2346
01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:50.000
<v Speaker 1>it's an issue with fat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2347
01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the ldl will go down if you're eating</v>

2348
01:44:54.171 --> 01:44:59.171
<v Speaker 1>a vegan diet and even though you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>still eating cookies or some whatever </v>

2349
01:44:59.171 --> 01:44:59.650
<v Speaker 1>vegan stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2350
01:44:59.830 --> 01:45:04.830
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sugar's probably like less dangerous to </v>

2351
01:45:04.830 --> 01:45:04.830
<v Speaker 5>someone on a vegan diet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that?</v>

2352
01:45:04.830 --> 01:45:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

2353
01:45:04.830 --> 01:45:05.610
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing,</v>

2354
01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:07.730
<v Speaker 1>the thing with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you look at,</v>

2355
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:12.750
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at refined sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also refined sugar is associated with </v>

2356
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:13.740
<v Speaker 1>heart disease risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact it's like one of the,</v>

2357
01:45:13.741 --> 01:45:14.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a big,</v>

2358
01:45:14.491 --> 01:45:19.491
<v Speaker 1>big study like 400,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>different individuals looked at refined </v>

2359
01:45:19.491 --> 01:45:23.031
<v Speaker 1>shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that had the highest refined </v>

2360
01:45:23.031 --> 01:45:23.031
<v Speaker 1>sugar intake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

2361
01:45:23.031 --> 01:45:25.461
<v Speaker 1>saturated fats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a confounding factor there had like a </v>

2362
01:45:25.461 --> 01:45:26.220
<v Speaker 1>four times higher risk of getting heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a heart attack.</v>

2363
01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:29.250
<v Speaker 1>But it's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You illustrated it perfectly.</v>

2364
01:45:29.251 --> 01:45:34.251
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where I think a lot of these </v>

2365
01:45:34.251 --> 01:45:34.251
<v Speaker 1>guidelines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the american heart association come</v>

2366
01:45:34.251 --> 01:45:36.000
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you on a population level,</v>

2367
01:45:36.210 --> 01:45:39.420
<v Speaker 1>if you say to someone reduce your </v>
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat intake,</v>

2368
01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:45.080
<v Speaker 1>you're going to lower the ldl risk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of all the other stuff </v>

2369
01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:45.080
<v Speaker 1>they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2370
01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:48.150
<v Speaker 1>it probably will on a population level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower their heart disease risk,</v>

2371
01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:51.150
<v Speaker 1>but on an individual level like someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you and I,</v>

2372
01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.340
<v Speaker 1>we don't eat all that other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2373
01:45:53.341 --> 01:45:56.250
<v Speaker 1>we were very health conscious and do all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

2374
01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:59.280
<v Speaker 1>You and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we stopped our saturated fat intake,</v>

2375
01:45:59.790 --> 01:46:01.120
<v Speaker 1>likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2376
01:46:01.230 --> 01:46:06.230
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess my jeans are a little different </v>

2377
01:46:06.230 --> 01:46:06.230
<v Speaker 1>but likely wouldn't have the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

2378
01:46:06.230 --> 01:46:08.580
<v Speaker 1>So if you were to take that same </v>
<v Speaker 1>population of people and say,</v>

2379
01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:10.590
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat your saturated fat,</v>

2380
01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:15.090
<v Speaker 1>but take out the refined sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may see the same thing where the,</v>

2381
01:46:15.330 --> 01:46:19.140
<v Speaker 1>where the heart disease risk goes down </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like it does with saturated fat.</v>

2382
01:46:19.230 --> 01:46:24.230
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there had been studies where a </v>

2383
01:46:24.230 --> 01:46:24.230
<v Speaker 1>replacement foods have done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have looked at,</v>

2384
01:46:24.230 --> 01:46:25.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>replacement fruits for saturated fat.</v>

2385
01:46:25.381 --> 01:46:27.160
<v Speaker 1>And if you replace saturated fat with </v>
<v Speaker 1>refined sugar,</v>

2386
01:46:27.161 --> 01:46:28.450
<v Speaker 1>it does not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2387
01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:33.830
<v Speaker 1>lower the risk of heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically that's kind of a proof of </v>

2388
01:46:35.131 --> 01:46:37.360
<v Speaker 1>principle there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that it's,</v>

2389
01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:42.420
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an important point and it's </v>

2390
01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:42.420
<v Speaker 1>something that the american heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>association there,</v>

2391
01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:46.020
<v Speaker 1>they're now starting to at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned the small dense ldl particles.</v>

2392
01:46:46.350 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 1>So I think that moving in that direction</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because it means</v>

2393
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.750
<v Speaker 3>that possibly then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2394
01:46:51.751 --> 01:46:53.460
<v Speaker 3>over the next decade we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start to see,</v>

2395
01:46:53.790 --> 01:46:55.320
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we got to start.</v>

2396
01:46:55.321 --> 01:47:00.321
<v Speaker 3>It's not just the ldl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm confused about something you just </v>

2397
01:47:00.321 --> 01:47:02.841
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said if you replace saturated fat </v>

2398
01:47:02.841 --> 01:47:05.180
<v Speaker 3>with refined sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you replace the saturated fat with </v>

2399
01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:07.800
<v Speaker 3>refined sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>refined carbohydrates,</v>

2400
01:47:07.801 --> 01:47:09.840
<v Speaker 3>which I usually think of as refined </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>

2401
01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:12.510
<v Speaker 3>refined carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does not.</v>

2402
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:15.570
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is of saturated fat was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

2403
01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:20.900
<v Speaker 3>If you replaced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you took the saturated fat and </v>

2404
01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:22.701
<v Speaker 3>replaced it with refined carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would lower the risk of heart </v>

2405
01:47:22.701 --> 01:47:22.701
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it does,</v>

2406
01:47:22.701 --> 01:47:23.910
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't lower the risk.</v>

2407
01:47:24.170 --> 01:47:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2408
01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:29.960
<v Speaker 3>so basically other saturated fats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the saturated fat along with refined </v>

2409
01:47:30.061 --> 01:47:33.000
<v Speaker 3>sugar that has some sort of a negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>synergistic effect.</v>

2410
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:35.340
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what the data and aggregation,</v>

2411
01:47:35.341 --> 01:47:37.680
<v Speaker 3>looking at the clinical trials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at the mechanism,</v>

2412
01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:41.340
<v Speaker 3>looking at the observational studies and</v>
<v Speaker 3>and understanding the interaction of all</v>

2413
01:47:41.341 --> 01:47:45.030
<v Speaker 3>these foods together and the wideness </v>
<v Speaker 3>when the american heart association puts</v>

2414
01:47:45.031 --> 01:47:46.830
<v Speaker 3>out sort of a blanket statement like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2415
01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:52.220
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people take it as fact and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>what my research has shown my reading </v>

2416
01:47:53.731 --> 01:47:55.170
<v Speaker 3>rather shouldn't say research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a dummy,</v>

2417
01:47:55.440 --> 01:48:00.440
<v Speaker 3>but the people that I've read who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticized this are actually scientists </v>

2418
01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:04.731
<v Speaker 3>and researchers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a huge issue with that </v>

2419
01:48:04.731 --> 01:48:04.731
<v Speaker 3>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think that this is just,</v>

2420
01:48:04.731 --> 01:48:09.081
<v Speaker 3>it's too simplistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not taking into account all the </v>

2421
01:48:09.081 --> 01:48:09.240
<v Speaker 3>various nuances in genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>

2422
01:48:09.241 --> 01:48:11.280
<v Speaker 3>ancestry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the different factors,</v>

2423
01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:16.520
<v Speaker 3>but people read that and it sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this cookie cutter approach and then </v>

2424
01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:17.700
<v Speaker 3>they paired it out to everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2425
01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:19.300
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's.</v>

2426
01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:24.340
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what happens and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing goes with the protein in it </v>

2427
01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:28.911
<v Speaker 3>being bad as well and there's all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of nuances and the combination of the </v>

2428
01:48:28.911 --> 01:48:30.630
<v Speaker 3>protein with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the bad diet and also the exercise,</v>

2429
01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:32.930
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things with the,</v>

2430
01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:37.440
<v Speaker 3>with the protein is that it increases </v>
<v Speaker 3>igf one and igf one growth factor and it</v>

2431
01:48:37.441 --> 01:48:40.830
<v Speaker 3>can allow b cells that are damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would otherwise die,</v>

2432
01:48:40.831 --> 01:48:45.831
<v Speaker 3>not die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it can allow precancerous cells </v>

2433
01:48:45.831 --> 01:48:45.831
<v Speaker 3>to form a tumor and that's.</v>

2434
01:48:45.831 --> 01:48:48.310
<v Speaker 3>We know that from mechanistic studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know that's.</v>

2435
01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:53.340
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of a big part of the the </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating protein essential amino acids </v>

2436
01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:58.011
<v Speaker 3>specifically or what does it do do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're found in animal protein and </v>

2437
01:48:58.011 --> 01:48:58.011
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sort of the big argument there,</v>

2438
01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:03.380
<v Speaker 3>but there's also this whole argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>where if you are one exercising the igf </v>

2439
01:49:03.781 --> 01:49:08.781
<v Speaker 3>one goes into your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been trying to cross the blood </v>

2440
01:49:08.781 --> 01:49:08.781
<v Speaker 3>brain barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes into your brain and also in your</v>

2441
01:49:08.781 --> 01:49:11.690
<v Speaker 3>muscle where it grows new neurons in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain and actually repairs damaged,</v>

2442
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:14.580
<v Speaker 3>damaged muscle tissue and helps grow </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle tissue.</v>

2443
01:49:14.581 --> 01:49:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Which is also an a predictor of of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>caused mortality.</v>

2444
01:49:17.730 --> 01:49:19.680
<v Speaker 3>So you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2445
01:49:19.681 --> 01:49:24.681
<v Speaker 3>the exercise comes in there and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>also the fact that if you're eating a </v>

2446
01:49:24.681 --> 01:49:28.491
<v Speaker 3>good diet and you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not causing as much damage to </v>

2447
01:49:28.491 --> 01:49:31.311
<v Speaker 3>happen in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then those growth factors being there </v>

2448
01:49:31.311 --> 01:49:34.071
<v Speaker 3>aren't as big of a deal because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have all these damaged cells from </v>

2449
01:49:34.071 --> 01:49:37.701
<v Speaker 3>all this refined sugar you're eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can basically become cancerous </v>

2450
01:49:37.701 --> 01:49:37.701
<v Speaker 3>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's kind of,</v>

2451
01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:39.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that study,</v>

2452
01:49:39.361 --> 01:49:42.060
<v Speaker 3>the observational study that looked at </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that were eating me,</v>

2453
01:49:42.061 --> 01:49:44.250
<v Speaker 3>if they didn't have any of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>unhealthy lifestyle factors,</v>

2454
01:49:44.251 --> 01:49:49.251
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all cause mortality and cancer </v>

2455
01:49:49.251 --> 01:49:49.251
<v Speaker 3>mortality was the same as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetarians.</v>

2456
01:49:49.251 --> 01:49:50.810
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's kind of highlighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2457
01:49:50.850 --> 01:49:51.880
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that issue,</v>

2458
01:49:51.970 --> 01:49:52.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2459
01:49:52.510 --> 01:49:57.510
<v Speaker 2>well I have a friend who's a scientist </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's talking to me about me and he </v>

2460
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.510
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ms dot essentially amino acids,</v>

2461
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:58.760
<v Speaker 2>protein and water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2462
01:49:58.761 --> 01:50:03.761
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to cause you cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is not what the problem </v>

2463
01:50:03.761 --> 01:50:03.761
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2464
01:50:03.761 --> 01:50:07.031
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have some issues with the way it's </v>

2465
01:50:07.031 --> 01:50:07.031
<v Speaker 2>cooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for sure like things that are charred</v>

2466
01:50:07.031 --> 01:50:08.930
<v Speaker 2>or not good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's carcinogens right?</v>

2467
01:50:08.931 --> 01:50:10.580
<v Speaker 2>And in the black and charred.</v>

2468
01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's heterocyclic aiming </v>

2469
01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:17.530
<v Speaker 1>second forum when you cook meat at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really high temperature and those are </v>

2470
01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:18.720
<v Speaker 1>carcinogens and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But our body,</v>

2471
01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:23.010
<v Speaker 1>our bodies have genes that are able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>inactivate those somebodies,</v>

2472
01:50:23.011 --> 01:50:26.220
<v Speaker 1>but some not people can do it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to various levels.</v>

2473
01:50:26.221 --> 01:50:29.340
<v Speaker 1>There's certain polymorphisms in genes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm basically,</v>

2474
01:50:29.341 --> 01:50:32.280
<v Speaker 1>some people can detoxify it really well </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>

2475
01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:37.320
<v Speaker 1>they're called detoxification enzymes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people don't do it quite as </v>

2476
01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:37.320
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people that don't do it quite as</v>

2477
01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:39.690
<v Speaker 1>well probably shouldn't charge their </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat as much.</v>

2478
01:50:39.691 --> 01:50:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Like you shouldn't eat it like everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like charred,</v>

2479
01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:43.260
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not.</v>

2480
01:50:43.261 --> 01:50:47.850
<v Speaker 1>The big issue isn't so much that as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the igf one,</v>

2481
01:50:47.851 --> 01:50:50.610
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't cause cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it allows cancer cells to grow.</v>

2482
01:50:50.970 --> 01:50:52.740
<v Speaker 1>So the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like one is like,</v>

2483
01:50:52.770 --> 01:50:54.210
<v Speaker 1>oh you eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it causes cancer.</v>

2484
01:50:54.211 --> 01:50:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not necessarily true.</v>

2485
01:50:56.220 --> 01:51:01.220
<v Speaker 1>You eat a lot of meat and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise and you keep having igf one </v>

2486
01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:04.161
<v Speaker 1>around and you have all these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>damaged cells because you're eating all </v>

2487
01:51:04.161 --> 01:51:06.640
<v Speaker 1>this other crap which is causing damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're allowing the igf one no,</v>

2488
01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:11.790
<v Speaker 1>to allow those damaged cells to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one is like a promoting where it's </v>

2489
01:51:11.790 --> 01:51:15.201
<v Speaker 1>promoting the growth of cancer and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other one's saying it causes so it </v>

2490
01:51:15.201 --> 01:51:16.930
<v Speaker 1>doesn't cause in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in the carcinogen,</v>

2491
01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:22.380
<v Speaker 1>if you're getting a ton of carcinogens </v>
<v Speaker 1>and plus there's studies showing that </v>

2492
01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:27.510
<v Speaker 1>eating cruciferous vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the isothiocyanates and people that have</v>

2493
01:51:27.511 --> 01:51:32.511
<v Speaker 1>that gene polymorphism that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>detoxify the heterocyclic amiens as </v>

2494
01:51:32.511 --> 01:51:34.290
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they eat a diet high in,</v>

2495
01:51:34.291 --> 01:51:37.360
<v Speaker 1>in cruciferous vegetables and they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>isothiocyanates it,</v>

2496
01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:42.560
<v Speaker 1>they also inactivate those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those web pro carcinogens and so a </v>

2497
01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:46.290
<v Speaker 1>broccoli sprouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broccoli,</v>

2498
01:51:46.350 --> 01:51:47.550
<v Speaker 1>cauliflower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cabbage,</v>

2499
01:51:47.551 --> 01:51:50.520
<v Speaker 1>brussels sprouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broccoli sprouts industry.</v>

2500
01:51:50.521 --> 01:51:52.590
<v Speaker 1>The last time you were on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

2501
01:51:52.591 --> 01:51:57.591
<v Speaker 1>I've had people emailing me that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're either them themselves or their </v>

2502
01:51:57.591 --> 01:52:01.320
<v Speaker 1>father or someone there taking care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their prostate cancer biomarker.</v>

2503
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:06.350
<v Speaker 1>The prostate stimulating angela antigen </v>
<v Speaker 1>has like gone down like two fold after </v>

2504
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:08.730
<v Speaker 1>doing the broccoli sprouts every day for</v>
<v Speaker 1>x amount of time,</v>

2505
01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:11.670
<v Speaker 1>which is something we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's clinical.</v>

2506
01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Clinical trials have shown that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very powerful.</v>

2507
01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Now when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2508
01:52:15.630 --> 01:52:16.550
<v Speaker 1>when you look at animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal</v>

2509
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:19.430
<v Speaker 2>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm including fish in this for this,</v>

2510
01:52:19.431 --> 01:52:23.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there any benefit to a specific type?</v>

2511
01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:28.280
<v Speaker 2>Like someone was telling me that red </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat is better for you than chicken and </v>

2512
01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:28.280
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2513
01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:29.600
<v Speaker 2>how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

2514
01:52:29.601 --> 01:52:31.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it makes me feel kind said,</v>

2515
01:52:31.821 --> 01:52:36.821
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that doesn't seem to make much </v>

2516
01:52:36.821 --> 01:52:36.821
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is.</v>

2517
01:52:36.821 --> 01:52:37.430
<v Speaker 2>But is there a difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously there's a difference in</v>

2518
01:52:37.431 --> 01:52:42.431
<v Speaker 2>the protein content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like have some meats or wild game has </v>

2519
01:52:42.431 --> 01:52:44.540
<v Speaker 2>much higher protein content than say </v>
<v Speaker 2>domestic beef.</v>

2520
01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:45.770
<v Speaker 2>But when you</v>

2521
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:47.690
<v Speaker 1>think like fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like is there,</v>

2522
01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:51.560
<v Speaker 1>is our living animals all created equal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question.</v>

2523
01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Well of course there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>

2524
01:52:53.361 --> 01:52:58.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean if the protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amino acid makeup are different and </v>

2525
01:52:58.361 --> 01:52:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an expert on that so I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you all the differences there.</v>

2526
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:03.050
<v Speaker 1>But there's differences in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the micronutrient concentrations.</v>

2527
01:53:03.051 --> 01:53:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean omega three fatty acids are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>

2528
01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:08.250
<v Speaker 1>are a lot of irons and in red meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's difference,</v>

2529
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:09.620
<v Speaker 1>different zinc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2530
01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:11.270
<v Speaker 1>iron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selenium,</v>

2531
01:53:11.330 --> 01:53:16.330
<v Speaker 1>omega three fatty acids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different things are found in </v>

2532
01:53:16.330 --> 01:53:17.150
<v Speaker 1>different concentrations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in different types of meat and you know,</v>

2533
01:53:17.151 --> 01:53:22.151
<v Speaker 1>so for that reason it's kind of good to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat a diverse array of different types </v>

2534
01:53:22.151 --> 01:53:22.810
<v Speaker 1>because you're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2535
01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:27.820
<v Speaker 1>22 percent of all your enzymes in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body require micronutrients as a </v>

2536
01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:27.820
<v Speaker 1>cofactor to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2537
01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:29.750
<v Speaker 1>and the omega three fatty acids are </v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

2538
01:53:29.751 --> 01:53:31.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really important for the brain,</v>

2539
01:53:31.670 --> 01:53:33.590
<v Speaker 1>hugely important for the brain.</v>

2540
01:53:33.590 --> 01:53:36.890
<v Speaker 1>So I think that in that respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2541
01:53:37.090 --> 01:53:42.090
<v Speaker 1>there are obviously differences in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the different types of meat that </v>

2542
01:53:42.090 --> 01:53:43.040
<v Speaker 1>you're eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2543
01:53:43.041 --> 01:53:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2544
01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:46.280
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2545
01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:48.960
<v Speaker 1>and then the ratio of the proteins are </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

2546
01:53:48.990 --> 01:53:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2547
01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:53.090
<v Speaker 1>what those differences are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2548
01:53:53.091 --> 01:53:55.070
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that affects things as well.</v>

2549
01:53:55.270 --> 01:54:00.270
<v Speaker 1>So do you think what a good healthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach if someone does eat meat is to </v>

2550
01:54:00.270 --> 01:54:00.740
<v Speaker 1>d a little bit of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little bit of salmon,</v>

2551
01:54:01.130 --> 01:54:03.230
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little bit of red meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of bias and a little bit of</v>

2552
01:54:03.231 --> 01:54:08.231
<v Speaker 1>chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the approach I like to </v>

2553
01:54:08.231 --> 01:54:10.991
<v Speaker 1>take because I like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to look at things in terms of </v>

2554
01:54:10.991 --> 01:54:13.880
<v Speaker 1>nutrient quality and why am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I eating this food?</v>

2555
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating this food because I want this</v>

2556
01:54:16.161 --> 01:54:17.420
<v Speaker 1>type of amino acid profile.</v>

2557
01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:19.640
<v Speaker 1>I want these micronutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2558
01:54:19.641 --> 01:54:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want 'em either this type of prebiotic</v>

2559
01:54:22.701 --> 01:54:27.701
<v Speaker 1>fiber or not and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I kind of look at it as these </v>

2560
01:54:27.701 --> 01:54:28.460
<v Speaker 1>nutrient delivery vesicles that I'm like</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking in.</v>

2561
01:54:28.690 --> 01:54:31.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the approach I like.</v>

2562
01:54:31.641 --> 01:54:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2563
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:37.310
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little biased because I've been </v>

2564
01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:37.400
<v Speaker 1>doing a lot of research on </v>
<v Speaker 1>micronutrients and so I,</v>

2565
01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:40.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how important they are and I've,</v>

2566
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:45.870
<v Speaker 1>and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've studied even in people things like </v>

2567
01:54:45.870 --> 01:54:48.580
<v Speaker 1>biomarkers of aging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dna damage and seeing how they </v>

2568
01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:51.161
<v Speaker 1>change with different micro nutrient </v>
<v Speaker 1>intakes or different types of fiber </v>

2569
01:54:51.161 --> 01:54:51.410
<v Speaker 1>intakes or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

2570
01:54:51.411 --> 01:54:52.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2571
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:53.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

2572
01:54:53.181 --> 01:54:56.420
<v Speaker 1>I kind of am a little biased in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

2573
01:54:56.421 --> 01:54:57.350
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2574
01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:59.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the approach that I like to take,</v>

2575
01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:00.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2576
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:02.390
<v Speaker 1>this is a really good story.</v>

2577
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:04.430
<v Speaker 1>And my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mentor Bruce Bruce ames,</v>

2578
01:55:04.431 --> 01:55:07.460
<v Speaker 1>who I talk about a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the inventor of the ames test,</v>

2579
01:55:07.461 --> 01:55:12.461
<v Speaker 1>which is a test that really cheap test </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can do to determine whether or </v>

2580
01:55:12.461 --> 01:55:12.470
<v Speaker 1>not something is a carcinogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2581
01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure the heterocyclic amines were </v>
<v Speaker 1>determined from his test because you can</v>

2582
01:55:15.861 --> 01:55:20.861
<v Speaker 1>dump something on and he can base it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically can tell you like in a matter </v>

2583
01:55:20.861 --> 01:55:20.861
<v Speaker 1>of minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2584
01:55:20.861 --> 01:55:21.410
<v Speaker 1>So he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was his,</v>

2585
01:55:21.411 --> 01:55:23.050
<v Speaker 1>like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2586
01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:28.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pioneered that back in like the late </v>

2587
01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:28.060
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early eighties,</v>

2588
01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:28.990
<v Speaker 1>and he was responsible for getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>carcinogens out of hair dye,</v>

2589
01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:31.640
<v Speaker 1>women's hair dyes out of children's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pajamas.</v>

2590
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Lots of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of really big health impacts that </v>

2591
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.030
<v Speaker 1>he was in pajamas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2592
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:39.710
<v Speaker 1>there was some kind of polyurethane ish </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2593
01:55:39.711 --> 01:55:41.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not there anymore,</v>

2594
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:42.960
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2595
01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:44.880
<v Speaker 1>it was to prevent them from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a flame retardant.</v>

2596
01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a flame retardant and it was,</v>

2597
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:51.950
<v Speaker 1>it was completely a carcinogen and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was ending up in children's urine and </v>

2598
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.950
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were measuring it.</v>

2599
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

2600
01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:57.940
<v Speaker 1>my point is is that he used to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole like cancer or chemical </v>

2601
01:55:58.051 --> 01:56:01.590
<v Speaker 1>carcinogen field and then one day like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2602
01:56:01.591 --> 01:56:02.730
<v Speaker 1>someone in his loud did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blab,</v>

2603
01:56:02.731 --> 01:56:07.731
<v Speaker 1>did an experiment where they like left </v>
<v Speaker 1>full laid out of the sample and there </v>

2604
01:56:07.731 --> 01:56:09.270
<v Speaker 1>was massive amounts of dna damage </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

2605
01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:10.980
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>

2606
01:56:11.250 --> 01:56:16.250
<v Speaker 1>And they started to do this in mice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>found that like a low folate dial diet </v>

2607
01:56:16.381 --> 01:56:20.520
<v Speaker 1>caused damage to dna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same as being irradiated by an x ray</v>

2608
01:56:20.521 --> 01:56:21.810
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The exact same.</v>

2609
01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:27.380
<v Speaker 1>And then he went into people and found </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a really small pilot </v>

2610
01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:31.761
<v Speaker 1>experiment but similar the cause dna </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage on people that had a low full a </v>

2611
01:56:31.761 --> 01:56:31.761
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

2612
01:56:31.761 --> 01:56:36.230
<v Speaker 1>And he said that one experiment right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there changed the whole course of his </v>

2613
01:56:36.230 --> 01:56:39.741
<v Speaker 1>field of study where he all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>went into nutrition and micronutrients </v>

2614
01:56:39.741 --> 01:56:43.551
<v Speaker 1>and that became his thing from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties on and kind of from an </v>

2615
01:56:43.551 --> 01:56:43.551
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2616
01:56:43.551 --> 01:56:44.620
<v Speaker 1>from an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't that happen all the time in lab?</v>

2617
01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:46.440
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's with the best stuff.</v>

2618
01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:49.200
<v Speaker 1>It was funny because the guy in his lab </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like calling.</v>

2619
01:56:49.201 --> 01:56:52.130
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to figure out what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on here and then he.</v>

2620
01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:57.200
<v Speaker 1>He looked at his assistant had ordered </v>
<v Speaker 1>this media that you put on cells and he </v>

2621
01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:01.341
<v Speaker 1>looked at the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to figure out what was in it and </v>

2622
01:57:01.341 --> 01:57:03.441
<v Speaker 1>they saw it was a specific type of media</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the assistant had ordered </v>

2623
01:57:03.441 --> 01:57:07.340
<v Speaker 1>incorrectly that lacked full late and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing was all started from </v>

2624
01:57:07.351 --> 01:57:09.310
<v Speaker 1>that and so credible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2625
01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:14.360
<v Speaker 1>So he published that seminal paperwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally he compared my being </v>

2626
01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:18.260
<v Speaker 1>irradiated under an x ray machine to low</v>
<v Speaker 1>folate and it was identical.</v>

2627
01:57:18.690 --> 01:57:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would that be</v>

2628
01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:24.600
<v Speaker 5>be something that people should take </v>
<v Speaker 5>into their diet of say if they are </v>

2629
01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:28.110
<v Speaker 5>flight attendants are pilots because </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't they isn't like flying like a form</v>

2630
01:57:28.661 --> 01:57:31.420
<v Speaker 5>of radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do get some radiation that's similar</v>

2631
01:57:31.421 --> 01:57:32.620
<v Speaker 5>to an x ray,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2632
01:57:32.830 --> 01:57:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the full eight.</v>

2633
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:37.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a different mechanism by how it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>preventing it.</v>

2634
01:57:37.290 --> 01:57:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Basically eight is needed to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual precursor to dna and without that</v>

2635
01:57:43.821 --> 01:57:45.980
<v Speaker 1>precursor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't make the dna right.</v>

2636
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:51.070
<v Speaker 1>And you incorporate a nucleotide from </v>
<v Speaker 1>rna into it and so you basically make a </v>

2637
01:57:51.070 --> 01:57:53.290
<v Speaker 1>break in your dna strand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2638
01:57:53.450 --> 01:57:54.710
<v Speaker 1>but dna damage is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2639
01:57:54.711 --> 01:57:59.711
<v Speaker 1>is something that happens with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with pilots and astronauts and things </v>

2640
01:57:59.711 --> 01:58:01.220
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm had been measured.</v>

2641
01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2642
01:58:02.361 --> 01:58:07.361
<v Speaker 1>it's been measured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there was a really weird study </v>

2643
01:58:07.361 --> 01:58:09.611
<v Speaker 1>that came out recently that astronauts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had like exceptionally longer </v>

2644
01:58:10.101 --> 01:58:12.650
<v Speaker 1>telomeres than.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2645
01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:17.680
<v Speaker 1>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was totally counter intuitive where </v>

2646
01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:18.620
<v Speaker 1>dna damage usually causes telomeres get </v>
<v Speaker 1>shorter.</v>

2647
01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And so like if you were to have asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2648
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I would have predicted that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>astronauts would have had shorter </v>

2649
01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:26.470
<v Speaker 1>telomeres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2650
01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:27.080
<v Speaker 1>so definitely some weird stuff going on.</v>

2651
01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:29.210
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2652
01:58:29.211 --> 01:58:30.000
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2653
01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:35.540
<v Speaker 1>and there's obviously a variety of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you can do to protect yourself </v>

2654
01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:35.600
<v Speaker 1>from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I forgot why.</v>

2655
01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:38.150
<v Speaker 1>The whole point is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>micronutrients were important.</v>

2656
01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Bruce ames is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been my mentor and friend for many </v>

2657
01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:46.230
<v Speaker 1>years and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've sort of been in this field of </v>

2658
01:58:46.230 --> 01:58:46.230
<v Speaker 1>study for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile and so it's,</v>

2659
01:58:46.230 --> 01:58:46.290
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2660
01:58:46.330 --> 01:58:49.540
<v Speaker 1>it's how I think about food and doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean it's the best way,</v>

2661
01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:54.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's the way that I've convinced </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself so far with the tools that I have</v>

2662
01:58:54.190 --> 01:58:57.160
<v Speaker 1>available to me that that's how I like </v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat.</v>

2663
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2664
01:58:58.210 --> 01:59:03.210
<v Speaker 1>anyone that's doing any sort of diet </v>
<v Speaker 1>should always measure biomarkers and </v>

2665
01:59:03.210 --> 01:59:03.370
<v Speaker 1>things like that to know if it's working</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>

2666
01:59:03.630 --> 01:59:06.700
<v Speaker 1>What's a good source of folate leafy </v>
<v Speaker 1>greens.</v>

2667
01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:08.070
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my bruce,</v>

2668
01:59:08.071 --> 01:59:10.810
<v Speaker 1>his mentor when he was a graduate </v>
<v Speaker 1>student is the guy who identified,</v>

2669
01:59:10.900 --> 01:59:13.550
<v Speaker 1>he actually discovered full life by </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifying,</v>

2670
01:59:13.810 --> 01:59:14.920
<v Speaker 1>isolating it from spinach.</v>

2671
01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:17.070
<v Speaker 1>So spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2672
01:59:17.110 --> 01:59:19.440
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leafy greens are great source of fully,</v>

2673
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:21.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the leafy greens,</v>

2674
01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:22.990
<v Speaker 1>like the other thing that gets me on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2675
01:59:22.991 --> 01:59:27.991
<v Speaker 1>and I know I talked about this last time</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like other compounds that are in </v>

2676
01:59:27.991 --> 01:59:30.601
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the plants where we're sort of just </v>

2677
01:59:30.601 --> 01:59:32.671
<v Speaker 1>scratching the surface on understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>them like what they're doing in our </v>

2678
01:59:32.671 --> 01:59:32.671
<v Speaker 1>bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one for example,</v>

2679
01:59:32.671 --> 01:59:34.960
<v Speaker 1>is looting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's president leafy greens,</v>

2680
01:59:34.961 --> 01:59:36.700
<v Speaker 1>kales are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really great source of it.</v>

2681
01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Looting is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's found in the,</v>

2682
01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:44.640
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was known that routine's important </v>

2683
01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:46.951
<v Speaker 1>for the rods and cones in your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people like they'll take supplements </v>

2684
01:59:46.951 --> 01:59:49.771
<v Speaker 1>with ludy and to help with their vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all this recent research over the </v>

2685
01:59:49.771 --> 01:59:53.690
<v Speaker 1>last few years is found is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulating in large amounts in the </v>

2686
01:59:53.690 --> 01:59:54.490
<v Speaker 1>brain or like what is lutein doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the human brain.</v>

2687
01:59:54.910 --> 01:59:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out it's like there's been </v>

2688
01:59:59.910 --> 01:59:59.910
<v Speaker 1>clinical studies now controlled trials </v>
<v Speaker 1>like giving people looting and,</v>

2689
01:59:59.910 --> 02:00:00.360
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2690
02:00:00.410 --> 02:00:02.030
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it plays a role in,</v>

2691
02:00:02.031 --> 02:00:07.031
<v Speaker 1>in cognition like people have better </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning and memory scores after taking </v>

2692
02:00:07.031 --> 02:00:07.031
<v Speaker 1>moodiness.</v>

2693
02:00:07.031 --> 02:00:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's involved in a crystallized </v>

2694
02:00:11.930 --> 02:00:11.930
<v Speaker 1>intelligence which decreases with age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2695
02:00:11.930 --> 02:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>So there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's things like that and other one </v>

2696
02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:16.350
<v Speaker 1>is this one that I'm really interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

2697
02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm actually supplementing with pqq </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that one is it's made by bacteria </v>

2698
02:00:22.090 --> 02:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>and bacteria in the soil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's made by bacteria because it's </v>

2699
02:00:27.090 --> 02:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>important for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2700
02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>it's a cofactor for enzymes for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolic enzymes to work well.</v>

2701
02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Plants take it up from soil and then we </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat the plants and get an our diet and </v>

2702
02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>it's been shown now in like in a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>

2703
02:00:39.071 --> 02:00:44.071
<v Speaker 1>lots and lots of preclinical studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been shown to regulate </v>

2704
02:00:44.071 --> 02:00:44.080
<v Speaker 1>mitochondrial function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improves mitochondrial function,</v>

2705
02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>clinical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of clinicals trials now have </v>

2706
02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>been done looking at how it affects </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>

2707
02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:50.140
<v Speaker 1>If you supplement with like 20 minutes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

2708
02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>improves cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also improves markers of </v>

2709
02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>mitochondrial function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2710
02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>lowers markers of inflammation will </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out pqq has like 20,000</v>

2711
02:01:01.571 --> 02:01:05.810
<v Speaker 1>times the catalytic activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2712
02:01:05.860 --> 02:01:09.880
<v Speaker 1>than something like ascorbic acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a really powerful antioxidant.</v>

2713
02:01:09.881 --> 02:01:14.881
<v Speaker 1>And what I mean by that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so ascorbic acid goes through cycles of </v>

2714
02:01:14.881 --> 02:01:15.530
<v Speaker 1>vitamin c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2715
02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:17.710
<v Speaker 1>it's either oxidized or reduced and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

2716
02:01:17.890 --> 02:01:18.730
<v Speaker 1>it when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2717
02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:22.030
<v Speaker 1>when it does this antioxidant thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes oxidized and they can do that</v>

2718
02:01:22.031 --> 02:01:24.010
<v Speaker 1>four times where it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it donates,</v>

2719
02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:25.240
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>donates this,</v>

2720
02:01:25.290 --> 02:01:27.070
<v Speaker 1>this hydrogen and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>

2721
02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:28.310
<v Speaker 1>It helps to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2722
02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:33.400
<v Speaker 1>basically combat the oxidative stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then it gets oxidized again and it </v>

2723
02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:36.460
<v Speaker 1>can do it again four times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pqq does it 20,000</v>

2724
02:01:36.461 --> 02:01:38.020
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2725
02:01:38.021 --> 02:01:40.430
<v Speaker 1>isn't that mindblowing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often times</v>

2726
02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:42.440
<v Speaker 3>and it's really concentrated in breast </v>
<v Speaker 3>milk.</v>

2727
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:46.760
<v Speaker 3>So I'm actually taking it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's super interesting.</v>

2728
02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:48.820
<v Speaker 3>It seems like something that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>should supplement.</v>

2729
02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:54.010
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2730
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2731
02:01:55.890 --> 02:01:56.660
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2732
02:01:56.661 --> 02:01:58.180
<v Speaker 3>you never really know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2733
02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm supplementing with it and,</v>

2734
02:02:00.770 --> 02:02:05.770
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I certainly don't notice anything </v>

2735
02:02:05.770 --> 02:02:10.061
<v Speaker 3>because like sometimes those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those sorts of changes are really hard </v>

2736
02:02:10.061 --> 02:02:10.061
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to measure.</v>

2737
02:02:10.061 --> 02:02:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially you have to wait until,</v>

2738
02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:13.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like later on in life,</v>

2739
02:02:13.521 --> 02:02:18.521
<v Speaker 3>but I think it may be something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>important that may be a,</v>

2740
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:22.310
<v Speaker 3>has beneficial effects in humans as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2741
02:02:22.311 --> 02:02:23.600
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like again,</v>

2742
02:02:23.601 --> 02:02:25.160
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get it from plants,</v>

2743
02:02:25.161 --> 02:02:30.161
<v Speaker 3>but 20 milligrams a day is when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking because that's what the two </v>

2744
02:02:30.161 --> 02:02:30.590
<v Speaker 3>different clinical trials have shown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the best plant source of it?</v>

2745
02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:34.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you could find that google,</v>

2746
02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:38.810
<v Speaker 3>but because various various plants take </v>
<v Speaker 3>it up from the soil,</v>

2747
02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:40.310
<v Speaker 3>so probably things that are growing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the soil,</v>

2748
02:02:40.311 --> 02:02:40.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2749
02:02:40.670 --> 02:02:42.890
<v Speaker 3>That would be the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2750
02:02:43.010 --> 02:02:43.660
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2751
02:02:43.670 --> 02:02:48.670
<v Speaker 3>it's found like five or six fold higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>and higher levels that it is an art </v>

2752
02:02:48.670 --> 02:02:50.330
<v Speaker 3>tissues and plants of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the plants are the source of it.</v>

2753
02:02:50.810 --> 02:02:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2754
02:02:51.470 --> 02:02:56.470
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking a supplemental form you'll be </v>

2755
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:58.121
<v Speaker 3>getting orders of magnitude more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a supplement company that </v>

2756
02:02:58.121 --> 02:03:00.050
<v Speaker 3>you rely on the most?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

2757
02:03:00.051 --> 02:03:02.510
<v Speaker 3>So the thing with supplements is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2758
02:03:02.850 --> 02:03:04.830
<v Speaker 3>there are really risky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2759
02:03:04.831 --> 02:03:09.831
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of studies that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>published showing that a lot of </v>

2760
02:03:09.831 --> 02:03:12.371
<v Speaker 3>supplements don't contain what they say </v>
<v Speaker 3>they contain or they contain a fraction </v>

2761
02:03:12.371 --> 02:03:13.340
<v Speaker 3>of it and they got a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>filler like cloverleaf and stuff.</v>

2762
02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:14.470
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2763
02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:15.810
<v Speaker 3>one of the supplement companies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2764
02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:19.250
<v Speaker 3>and there's a scientist friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his name is dr jed fay.</v>

2765
02:03:19.251 --> 02:03:20.540
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2766
02:03:20.630 --> 02:03:25.630
<v Speaker 3>he's the guy who discovered that </v>
<v Speaker 3>broccoli sprouts are the best source of </v>

2767
02:03:25.630 --> 02:03:25.630
<v Speaker 3>sulforaphane.</v>

2768
02:03:25.630 --> 02:03:26.180
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2769
02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:29.600
<v Speaker 3>he measured a variety of supplements and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he was looking specifically at,</v>

2770
02:03:29.601 --> 02:03:34.601
<v Speaker 3>like precursor to sulforaphane and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looked at a variety of different </v>

2771
02:03:34.601 --> 02:03:37.430
<v Speaker 3>companies and one of the companies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just really,</v>

2772
02:03:37.431 --> 02:03:39.890
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good and reliable was thorn.</v>

2773
02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:45.460
<v Speaker 3>Thorn t h o r n e,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's something I don't have any </v>

2774
02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:46.910
<v Speaker 3>affiliation with them or anything but </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I always there my goto brand.</v>

2775
02:03:47.330 --> 02:03:49.310
<v Speaker 3>Whenever I'm looking for a supplement </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I took,</v>

2776
02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:51.740
<v Speaker 3>I took their prenatal from throughout </v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnancy.</v>

2777
02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:57.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually I'm still taking the prenatal </v>

2778
02:03:57.160 --> 02:03:58.730
<v Speaker 3>and breastfeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take vitamin d and vitamin k two a,</v>

2779
02:03:58.731 --> 02:04:03.170
<v Speaker 3>I take pretty much a lot of my stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from them and the pqq,</v>

2780
02:04:03.171 --> 02:04:04.370
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2781
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:09.790
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only been able to find from life </v>

2782
02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:11.720
<v Speaker 3>extension and I think life extensions </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty okay so far as I can tell.</v>

2783
02:04:11.721 --> 02:04:13.220
<v Speaker 3>But thorn is like my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2784
02:04:13.250 --> 02:04:15.950
<v Speaker 3>my favorite company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2785
02:04:15.951 --> 02:04:19.710
<v Speaker 3>so far just because I've got data from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientist that I,</v>

2786
02:04:19.970 --> 02:04:24.970
<v Speaker 3>that I trust is a difficult issue and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tainted supplements a or a huge problem </v>

2787
02:04:25.971 --> 02:04:30.971
<v Speaker 3>with athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of false positives are not even </v>

2788
02:04:30.971 --> 02:04:31.730
<v Speaker 3>false positives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of athletes will take supplements,</v>

2789
02:04:31.731 --> 02:04:34.400
<v Speaker 3>like if they go to like some just </v>
<v Speaker 3>generic vitamin store,</v>

2790
02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:39.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever name the name and they pick up </v>

2791
02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:39.420
<v Speaker 3>some of a creatine</v>

2792
02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:43.700
<v Speaker 2>or muscle enhancer or this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of them are tainted with </v>

2793
02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:47.121
<v Speaker 2>steroids or they're used in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>labs or created rather than the same </v>

2794
02:04:47.121 --> 02:04:50.300
<v Speaker 2>labs and they don't clean the bins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like the vats,</v>

2795
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:55.390
<v Speaker 2>they used to mix up one supplement will </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whatever was in residual traces of </v>

2796
02:04:56.401 --> 02:04:58.920
<v Speaker 2>it will wind up in some other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real issue.</v>

2797
02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:02.010
<v Speaker 1>I think there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you were referring to there.</v>

2798
02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:05.970
<v Speaker 1>A lot of supplement companies that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a stamp on it called nsf,</v>

2799
02:05:05.971 --> 02:05:07.800
<v Speaker 1>which is the national sanitary </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation.</v>

2800
02:05:07.801 --> 02:05:12.801
<v Speaker 1>I believe they go and they investigate </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the supplements manufactured and </v>

2801
02:05:13.651 --> 02:05:17.240
<v Speaker 1>they look at the quality and they also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think even look at some,</v>

2802
02:05:17.260 --> 02:05:19.260
<v Speaker 1>some of the what's in the supplements if</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2803
02:05:19.261 --> 02:05:21.990
<v Speaker 1>if they contain what they're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>contain to some degree.</v>

2804
02:05:21.991 --> 02:05:26.991
<v Speaker 1>But I know they definitely look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing place to see if things </v>

2805
02:05:26.991 --> 02:05:27.210
<v Speaker 1>like that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2806
02:05:27.211 --> 02:05:29.310
<v Speaker 1>things aren't being cleaned right in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's contamination,</v>

2807
02:05:29.311 --> 02:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So supplements that have that stamp</v>

2808
02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>probably a little more reliable than </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones that don't.</v>

2809
02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:37.690
<v Speaker 2>But it's still not like a sure thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2810
02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:40.420
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not like it just because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has that stamp,</v>

2811
02:05:40.421 --> 02:05:41.440
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be the best,</v>

2812
02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:47.040
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people listening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and they're going to probably have </v>

2813
02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:49.501
<v Speaker 2>to listen to three or four times and </v>
<v Speaker 2>take notes and go over this and try to </v>

2814
02:05:49.501 --> 02:05:49.501
<v Speaker 2>figure out if they're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2815
02:05:49.501 --> 02:05:54.331
<v Speaker 2>how to act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have a hard time </v>

2816
02:05:54.331 --> 02:05:57.661
<v Speaker 2>digesting all of this data and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what is the best way to </v>

2817
02:05:57.661 --> 02:06:01.531
<v Speaker 2>proceed in terms of investigating their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own health and monitoring their blood </v>

2818
02:06:02.501 --> 02:06:05.680
<v Speaker 2>levels and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to find a primary care doctor</v>

2819
02:06:05.681 --> 02:06:07.330
<v Speaker 2>that will kind of understand what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to do.</v>

2820
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

2821
02:06:09.370 --> 02:06:11.620
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the primary care doctor thing,</v>

2822
02:06:11.621 --> 02:06:13.840
<v Speaker 1>finding one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly can't help with that because</v>

2823
02:06:13.870 --> 02:06:15.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the struggle that you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

2824
02:06:15.551 --> 02:06:17.890
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of taking,</v>

2825
02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:21.630
<v Speaker 1>taking your health into your own hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>and monitoring blood biomarkers.</v>

2826
02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a few that are really,</v>

2827
02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:26.950
<v Speaker 1>really key I think for anyone doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

2828
02:06:26.980 --> 02:06:29.530
<v Speaker 1>any type of experimentation that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they should do.</v>

2829
02:06:29.531 --> 02:06:31.030
<v Speaker 1>And we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about them already.</v>

2830
02:06:31.031 --> 02:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2831
02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:34.030
<v Speaker 1>the small dense ldl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the total ldl,</v>

2832
02:06:34.330 --> 02:06:37.150
<v Speaker 1>you also want to measure triglycerides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high sensitivity,</v>

2833
02:06:37.151 --> 02:06:39.580
<v Speaker 1>c reactive protein or hb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one hba,</v>

2834
02:06:39.581 --> 02:06:44.581
<v Speaker 1>one c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the marker of longterm fasting </v>

2835
02:06:44.581 --> 02:06:47.401
<v Speaker 1>blood glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also there's another test that you </v>

2836
02:06:47.401 --> 02:06:49.840
<v Speaker 1>can do that actually is a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive metabolic tests to measure</v>

2837
02:06:50.170 --> 02:06:52.540
<v Speaker 1>how your body is metabolizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates,</v>

2838
02:06:52.541 --> 02:06:57.541
<v Speaker 1>fatty acids and amino acids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the organic acid test and </v>

2839
02:06:57.541 --> 02:07:02.191
<v Speaker 1>genova diagnostics offers it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately you do have to get your </v>

2840
02:07:02.410 --> 02:07:07.410
<v Speaker 1>primary care physician to prescribe or </v>
<v Speaker 1>order that because that's not something </v>

2841
02:07:07.410 --> 02:07:07.900
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2842
02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:09.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>available to</v>

2843
02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:14.240
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it seems like there's room for a </v>

2844
02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:16.041
<v Speaker 2>company to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a one stop shop company that sort </v>

2845
02:07:16.041 --> 02:07:18.570
<v Speaker 2>of analyzes your health and prescribed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you,</v>

2846
02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:23.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explains to you what's lacking in your </v>

2847
02:07:23.630 --> 02:07:23.920
<v Speaker 2>diet and what you could benefit from and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you can.</v>

2848
02:07:23.930 --> 02:07:26.520
<v Speaker 2>And it seems like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big opening for some sort of a</v>

2849
02:07:26.521 --> 02:07:27.330
<v Speaker 2>business like that.</v>

2850
02:07:27.670 --> 02:07:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2851
02:07:28.121 --> 02:07:29.620
<v Speaker 1>I think some people are actually doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2852
02:07:29.621 --> 02:07:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Like genova diagnostics I think is one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do sort of do that.</v>

2853
02:07:32.621 --> 02:07:37.621
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you what's missing or like </v>

2854
02:07:37.621 --> 02:07:37.621
<v Speaker 1>the help interpret</v>

2855
02:07:37.621 --> 02:07:41.220
<v Speaker 4>your data and genova diagnostics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is it a nationwide company?</v>

2856
02:07:42.970 --> 02:07:43.720
<v Speaker 4>Nationwide?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2857
02:07:43.721 --> 02:07:47.170
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know about worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're in europe.</v>

2858
02:07:47.970 --> 02:07:48.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2859
02:07:48.670 --> 02:07:51.190
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think there's other companies that</v>

2860
02:07:51.191 --> 02:07:56.191
<v Speaker 4>are kind of wellness effects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of is doing that a little bit as </v>

2861
02:07:56.191 --> 02:07:59.311
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They give you a consult with someone </v>

2862
02:07:59.311 --> 02:07:59.860
<v Speaker 4>after you get a variety of blood markers</v>
<v Speaker 4>measured and you know,</v>

2863
02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:02.440
<v Speaker 4>that we try to help you figure out that </v>
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>

2864
02:08:02.441 --> 02:08:03.660
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2865
02:08:03.690 --> 02:08:04.630
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's certainly,</v>

2866
02:08:04.631 --> 02:08:09.631
<v Speaker 4>I think there's other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a matter of finding a good </v>

2867
02:08:09.631 --> 02:08:09.631
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always the,</v>

2868
02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:10.960
<v Speaker 4>the catch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2869
02:08:11.210 --> 02:08:14.650
<v Speaker 4>It seems like with this kind of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the average consumer,</v>

2870
02:08:14.651 --> 02:08:17.500
<v Speaker 4>the average person listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems very daunting.</v>

2871
02:08:17.530 --> 02:08:18.670
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>

2872
02:08:18.671 --> 02:08:20.280
<v Speaker 4>there's so much to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so.</v>

2873
02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:23.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean in a lot of times when people get</v>
<v Speaker 4>inundated with that much data,</v>

2874
02:08:23.621 --> 02:08:25.380
<v Speaker 4>they sort of shut down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let it go.</v>

2875
02:08:25.380 --> 02:08:26.860
<v Speaker 4>This is just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do this,</v>

2876
02:08:26.970 --> 02:08:31.970
<v Speaker 4>this is too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I really wish there was like a </v>

2877
02:08:31.970 --> 02:08:36.620
<v Speaker 4>nationwide network of places like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you could just go to sort of like </v>

2878
02:08:36.620 --> 02:08:37.170
<v Speaker 4>you can go to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2879
02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:42.240
<v Speaker 4>a dentist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there should be like a place where you </v>

2880
02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:44.221
<v Speaker 4>can go to to get this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>comprehensive information about your </v>

2881
02:08:44.221 --> 02:08:46.840
<v Speaker 4>diet and the effects on your body and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what genes you have.</v>

2882
02:08:46.841 --> 02:08:51.270
<v Speaker 4>And the problem is we're still figuring </v>
<v Speaker 4>out all those nuances and so,</v>

2883
02:08:51.610 --> 02:08:54.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even even getting the data,</v>

2884
02:08:54.161 --> 02:08:55.720
<v Speaker 4>having the person interpret it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2885
02:08:55.870 --> 02:09:00.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's constantly evolving and you would </v>

2886
02:09:00.870 --> 02:09:00.870
<v Speaker 4>have to have someone who's completely on</v>
<v Speaker 4>top of it all the time.</v>

2887
02:09:00.870 --> 02:09:05.671
<v Speaker 4>So we'd have to be like sending them do </v>
<v Speaker 4>literature constantly because we're </v>

2888
02:09:05.671 --> 02:09:10.110
<v Speaker 4>constantly changing the way we think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about a variety of things and seem like </v>

2889
02:09:10.110 --> 02:09:14.250
<v Speaker 4>some billionaire dude would look one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hire you up and have them like have you </v>

2890
02:09:14.471 --> 02:09:19.471
<v Speaker 4>watch over them all the time and monitor</v>
<v Speaker 4>their blood and try to figure out what </v>

2891
02:09:19.471 --> 02:09:19.840
<v Speaker 4>they're doing wrong and prescribe things</v>
<v Speaker 4>to them.</v>

2892
02:09:20.590 --> 02:09:22.230
<v Speaker 4>Monitor their blood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give them youngblood.</v>

2893
02:09:22.250 --> 02:09:23.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some george soros type of care.</v>

2894
02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:26.920
<v Speaker 4>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That young blood thing.</v>

2895
02:09:26.921 --> 02:09:28.570
<v Speaker 4>Because I know that's a real thing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>mice,</v>

2896
02:09:28.571 --> 02:09:29.890
<v Speaker 4>but are they really doing that with </v>
<v Speaker 4>people?</v>

2897
02:09:29.891 --> 02:09:31.990
<v Speaker 4>Because I had heard that peter teal had </v>
<v Speaker 4>done it,</v>

2898
02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:34.360
<v Speaker 4>but then he says it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's never done it.</v>

2899
02:09:34.690 --> 02:09:36.530
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2900
02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:38.620
<v Speaker 4>Find that jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Peter teal.</v>

2901
02:09:38.650 --> 02:09:41.190
<v Speaker 4>Denies ever get injected with young </v>
<v Speaker 4>blood.</v>

2902
02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:46.470
<v Speaker 4>Get to know they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that the clinical trials that </v>

2903
02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:50.581
<v Speaker 4>were done at stanford,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they'd been established </v>

2904
02:09:50.581 --> 02:09:50.590
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck no.</v>

2905
02:09:50.591 --> 02:09:55.591
<v Speaker 4>Peter teals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not harvesting the blood of the picture </v>

2906
02:09:55.591 --> 02:09:58.190
<v Speaker 4>of him with stories of cow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Countess is bathing and virgin blood </v>

2907
02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:07.800
<v Speaker 4>vampyr ignoble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suck the juice out of the young have </v>

2908
02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:10.051
<v Speaker 4>captured our attention for centuries </v>
<v Speaker 4>when the story's coming out of the tech </v>

2909
02:10:10.051 --> 02:10:13.261
<v Speaker 4>billionaire peter teal was interested in</v>
<v Speaker 4>transfusing the blood into his own body </v>

2910
02:10:13.261 --> 02:10:13.261
<v Speaker 4>scent.</v>

2911
02:10:13.261 --> 02:10:13.660
<v Speaker 4>Silicon valley to a fever dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2912
02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:18.840
<v Speaker 4>but there is something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a company that does this.</v>

2913
02:10:19.090 --> 02:10:19.570
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there?</v>

2914
02:10:19.571 --> 02:10:22.150
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that there was a northern </v>
<v Speaker 4>California company,</v>

2915
02:10:22.151 --> 02:10:27.151
<v Speaker 4>a startup that does this and see if he </v>
<v Speaker 4>can find that so that that is a real </v>

2916
02:10:28.810 --> 02:10:33.810
<v Speaker 4>pair of meiosis is what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's this anti aging is charging </v>

2917
02:10:34.011 --> 02:10:36.490
<v Speaker 4>thousands of dollars for teen blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this kid.</v>

2918
02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:38.180
<v Speaker 4>Kids probably high on ecstasy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2919
02:10:38.181 --> 02:10:42.920
<v Speaker 4>They're always given up his blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they take this young person's blood.</v>

2920
02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:46.070
<v Speaker 4>It says like plot points from hbo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Silicon valley.</v>

2921
02:10:46.730 --> 02:10:47.930
<v Speaker 4>Peter teal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2922
02:10:47.931 --> 02:10:49.730
<v Speaker 4>Just ask peter teal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Incredible.</v>

2923
02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:54.820
<v Speaker 4>Well it says no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He saying I'm looking into parabiosis </v>

2924
02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:54.980
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is really interesting.</v>

2925
02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:59.480
<v Speaker 4>This is where the sea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he probably is looking into it.</v>

2926
02:10:59.481 --> 02:11:04.481
<v Speaker 4>He just hasn't done it because he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably waiting to see if someone </v>

2927
02:11:04.481 --> 02:11:04.481
<v Speaker 4>starts growing a foot on her head.</v>

2928
02:11:04.570 --> 02:11:09.570
<v Speaker 4>Jesse a karmazin karmazin karmazin </v>
<v Speaker 4>agrees his startup ambrosia is charging </v>

2929
02:11:10.821 --> 02:11:11.780
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>$8,000</v>

2930
02:11:11.781 --> 02:11:16.781
<v Speaker 4>a pop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Expensive for blood transfusions from </v>

2931
02:11:16.781 --> 02:11:18.980
<v Speaker 4>people under 25.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said at code conference on wednesday.</v>

2932
02:11:18.981 --> 02:11:22.220
<v Speaker 4>Ambrosia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which buys it's blood from blood banks.</v>

2933
02:11:22.221 --> 02:11:23.390
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How's about 100?</v>

2934
02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:24.860
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buying his book.</v>

2935
02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:28.350
<v Speaker 4>So they must specify who the people are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now when you go to the blood bank,</v>

2936
02:11:28.351 --> 02:11:33.351
<v Speaker 4>how do they even know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what the fuck you've been doing </v>

2937
02:11:33.351 --> 02:11:33.351
<v Speaker 4>with your body?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm wondering.</v>

2938
02:11:33.351 --> 02:11:36.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean I know they monitor for certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease like diseases and stuff.</v>

2939
02:11:36.171 --> 02:11:36.680
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2940
02:11:36.681 --> 02:11:38.480
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like all the other nuances,</v>

2941
02:11:38.481 --> 02:11:39.710
<v Speaker 4>all the other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2942
02:11:39.770 --> 02:11:42.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sugar and candy and bullshit.</v>

2943
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:46.940
<v Speaker 4>Is that a that represented in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>blood?</v>

2944
02:11:47.370 --> 02:11:52.370
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's certain biomarkers that </v>

2945
02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:52.370
<v Speaker 4>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2946
02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:55.541
<v Speaker 4>you can absolutely measure and you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly look at telomere length or </v>

2947
02:11:55.541 --> 02:11:55.541
<v Speaker 4>length,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dna damage,</v>

2948
02:11:55.541 --> 02:11:57.410
<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just have a joke about dick cheney.</v>

2949
02:11:57.610 --> 02:12:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Dick cheney had an extra secret service </v>
<v Speaker 4>agent that they put on this,</v>

2950
02:12:00.651 --> 02:12:04.080
<v Speaker 4>like super healthy diet and he couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure it out and you know,</v>

2951
02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:06.260
<v Speaker 4>who would have to run when everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>else did everything.</v>

2952
02:12:06.261 --> 02:12:08.660
<v Speaker 4>He was just really there in case dick </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a heart attack.</v>

2953
02:12:08.661 --> 02:12:11.380
<v Speaker 4>They're going to cut this guy open like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a fish or pull his organs out,</v>

2954
02:12:12.730 --> 02:12:14.960
<v Speaker 4>give dick his heart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is,</v>

2955
02:12:15.210 --> 02:12:16.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is what you would want sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of.</v>

2956
02:12:16.761 --> 02:12:18.260
<v Speaker 4>You'd want someone like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2957
02:12:18.261 --> 02:12:20.120
<v Speaker 4>I want your blood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to pay you for your blood,</v>

2958
02:12:20.121 --> 02:12:21.860
<v Speaker 4>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't be drinking.</v>

2959
02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:23.330
<v Speaker 4>No smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no sugar,</v>

2960
02:12:23.331 --> 02:12:23.930
<v Speaker 4>no bullshit.</v>

2961
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:28.990
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to monitor them like you </v>
<v Speaker 4>would like someone like the surrogate </v>

2962
02:12:28.990 --> 02:12:29.330
<v Speaker 4>moms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly fresh,</v>

2963
02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:31.940
<v Speaker 4>but you'd have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd have to live with me,</v>

2964
02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.520
<v Speaker 4>I'd have doing them right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well this is,</v>

2965
02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:39.740
<v Speaker 4>and this will be up and coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just fresh blood.</v>

2966
02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:43.670
<v Speaker 4>So for people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't know transplanting blood from</v>

2967
02:12:43.671 --> 02:12:46.700
<v Speaker 4>young animals into old animals like </v>
<v Speaker 4>rejuvenate's their brain.</v>

2968
02:12:46.701 --> 02:12:48.540
<v Speaker 4>It makes them live longer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do rejuvenate's,</v>

2969
02:12:48.550 --> 02:12:50.180
<v Speaker 4>all their organized so like they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthier.</v>

2970
02:12:50.181 --> 02:12:52.100
<v Speaker 4>And conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and conversely,</v>

2971
02:12:52.101 --> 02:12:55.400
<v Speaker 4>putting the old blood into young animals</v>
<v Speaker 4>messes them up,</v>

2972
02:12:55.980 --> 02:13:00.980
<v Speaker 4>makes them age basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes them perform worse cognitively </v>

2973
02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:02.300
<v Speaker 4>and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got somethings gonna pull up here.</v>

2974
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:06.290
<v Speaker 4>It's saying they found it in one test </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it might have worked,</v>

2975
02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:08.750
<v Speaker 4>but it hasn't been replicated in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>two paragraphs.</v>

2976
02:13:08.751 --> 02:13:11.840
<v Speaker 4>Say that it might not even be true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which one interesting.</v>

2977
02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:17.040
<v Speaker 4>So some aspects of aging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The 2013 study found could be reversed </v>

2978
02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:19.010
<v Speaker 4>when older mice get blood from younger </v>
<v Speaker 4>ones,</v>

2979
02:13:19.011 --> 02:13:24.011
<v Speaker 4>but other researchers have haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to replicate these results and the </v>

2980
02:13:24.011 --> 02:13:24.660
<v Speaker 4>benefits of para biosis and humans </v>
<v Speaker 4>remains on.</v>

2981
02:13:25.070 --> 02:13:27.290
<v Speaker 4>I remember that what happened was they </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't,</v>

2982
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:32.350
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't replicate the mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They thought it was this growth factor </v>

2983
02:13:32.350 --> 02:13:32.350
<v Speaker 4>called bdnf</v>

2984
02:13:32.350 --> 02:13:32.880
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2985
02:13:32.910 --> 02:13:35.970
<v Speaker 3>that's not replicatable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's not what's doing it.</v>

2986
02:13:36.330 --> 02:13:41.330
<v Speaker 3>And then this other study came out </v>
<v Speaker 3>showing that you could transplant the </v>

2987
02:13:41.330 --> 02:13:41.940
<v Speaker 3>old blood into the young and it would </v>
<v Speaker 3>reverse the effects.</v>

2988
02:13:41.941 --> 02:13:44.040
<v Speaker 3>And so now scientists are going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2989
02:13:44.041 --> 02:13:48.270
<v Speaker 3>is it that the young blood is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rejuvenating or is that the old blood is</v>

2990
02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:49.980
<v Speaker 3>accelerating the aging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2991
02:13:50.210 --> 02:13:52.130
<v Speaker 3>See the difference though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's kind of like,</v>

2992
02:13:52.140 --> 02:13:54.270
<v Speaker 3>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's possibly at now,</v>

2993
02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:59.780
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was gonna just mention to you that </v>

2994
02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:02.181
<v Speaker 3>microbiome that's heading there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a preliminary study that </v>

2995
02:14:02.181 --> 02:14:06.141
<v Speaker 3>was published not long ago in kill fish </v>
<v Speaker 3>were that the microbiome from young fish</v>

2996
02:14:06.571 --> 02:14:11.571
<v Speaker 3>was transplanted in the old fish and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>extended their lifespan by like 40 </v>

2997
02:14:11.571 --> 02:14:11.571
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2998
02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:14.520
<v Speaker 3>You take the microbiome from a young </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

2999
02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:17.650
<v Speaker 3>like my son breeze it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3000
02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:18.570
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3001
02:14:18.571 --> 02:14:19.740
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3002
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:22.110
<v Speaker 3>they think the mechanism has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the immune system.</v>

3003
02:14:22.110 --> 02:14:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Remember I was telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your microbiome makes these short chain </v>

3004
02:14:27.110 --> 02:14:27.460
<v Speaker 3>fatty acids and it totally regulates </v>
<v Speaker 3>your immune system.</v>

3005
02:14:27.810 --> 02:14:28.370
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3006
02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:30.650
<v Speaker 3>it regulates the amount of um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3007
02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:33.240
<v Speaker 3>a variety of different immune cells that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're making.</v>

3008
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:38.510
<v Speaker 3>And so like hamata police,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one which is making new blood </v>

3009
02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:41.181
<v Speaker 3>cells and there's been studies that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked at the microbiome of like really </v>

3010
02:14:41.181 --> 02:14:44.580
<v Speaker 3>healthy 90 year olds and they look like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the microbiome looks like,</v>

3011
02:14:44.610 --> 02:14:47.610
<v Speaker 3>like a 30 year old even though these are</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 year old people.</v>

3012
02:14:47.611 --> 02:14:50.580
<v Speaker 3>So usually the microbiomes vastly </v>
<v Speaker 3>different in older people.</v>

3013
02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:54.350
<v Speaker 3>But these healthy 90 year olds obviously</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're healthy if they make it to 90,</v>

3014
02:14:54.351 --> 02:14:56.580
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not an average age of most people</v>

3015
02:14:56.581 --> 02:14:59.670
<v Speaker 3>make it to their microbiomes looked like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3016
02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:01.530
<v Speaker 3>like a 30 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is super interesting.</v>

3017
02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:04.020
<v Speaker 3>So it's a whole new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to start to see like</v>

3018
02:15:04.021 --> 02:15:09.021
<v Speaker 3>kind of like the of biosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the microbiome microbiome </v>

3019
02:15:09.021 --> 02:15:09.021
<v Speaker 3>transplant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

3020
02:15:09.021 --> 02:15:09.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3021
02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:17.190
<v Speaker 3>I love headlines or they break headlines</v>
<v Speaker 3>down and just get you to click on it.</v>

3022
02:15:17.220 --> 02:15:18.480
<v Speaker 3>Will pope's the easiest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3023
02:15:18.481 --> 02:15:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Because now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3024
02:15:19.921 --> 02:15:20.910
<v Speaker 3>and they're doing these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

3025
02:15:20.940 --> 02:15:23.950
<v Speaker 3>these capsules now or they're taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>poop.</v>

3026
02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:29.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like helping people with their </v>

3027
02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:30.360
<v Speaker 3>ibs and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I think the problem was like making</v>

3028
02:15:30.361 --> 02:15:35.361
<v Speaker 3>sure it doesn't taste like shit when </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going down on me because like the </v>

3029
02:15:35.361 --> 02:15:35.361
<v Speaker 3>capsule cannot pronounce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just makes it was sugar.</v>

3030
02:15:35.361 --> 02:15:36.700
<v Speaker 3>And then you've got other problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3031
02:15:37.650 --> 02:15:41.010
<v Speaker 3>A spoonful of sugar makes a poop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's,</v>

3032
02:15:41.150 --> 02:15:42.180
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

3033
02:15:42.270 --> 02:15:44.490
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about steve?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You stay like,</v>

3034
02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:46.050
<v Speaker 3>so the stevia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3035
02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:47.370
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3036
02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:49.800
<v Speaker 3>it's a non-nutritive sweetener.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like,</v>

3037
02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:54.870
<v Speaker 3>it's not like a aspartame or sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 3>or what's the other one is sucralose,</v>

3038
02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:55.830
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

3039
02:15:55.831 --> 02:15:58.230
<v Speaker 3>those have all been shown to like screw </v>
<v Speaker 3>up the microbiome.</v>

3040
02:15:58.680 --> 02:15:59.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are really bad.</v>

3041
02:15:59.910 --> 02:16:04.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like changed the scope is what the </v>

3042
02:16:04.910 --> 02:16:08.001
<v Speaker 3>president drinks 12 cans a day of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No wonder why he's making shit </v>

3043
02:16:08.001 --> 02:16:09.370
<v Speaker 3>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>12.</v>

3044
02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3045
02:16:10.681 --> 02:16:15.440
<v Speaker 3>So New York times story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said that he drinks 12 cans of diet</v>

3046
02:16:15.450 --> 02:16:19.140
<v Speaker 3>coke a day and watches as much as eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours of television a day.</v>

3047
02:16:19.710 --> 02:16:20.760
<v Speaker 3>So he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

3048
02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:24.780
<v Speaker 3>he's literally like a test monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that really true?</v>

3049
02:16:25.630 --> 02:16:27.210
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really true.</v>

3050
02:16:27.211 --> 02:16:30.270
<v Speaker 3>See if you can find that article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 cans of beer.</v>

3051
02:16:30.290 --> 02:16:35.290
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump reportedly drinks 12 cans of diet </v>

3052
02:16:35.290 --> 02:16:38.551
<v Speaker 3>coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like you're losing it using an </v>

3053
02:16:38.551 --> 02:16:38.551
<v Speaker 3>ad blocker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the main,</v>

3054
02:16:38.551 --> 02:16:40.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main sweetener in diet coke.</v>

3055
02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:41.950
<v Speaker 3>Aspartame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aspartame,</v>

3056
02:16:41.951 --> 02:16:45.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump drinks 12 diet cokes per day.</v>

3057
02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:51.060
<v Speaker 3>What can that do to a person's body?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they have a scientists thought </v>

3058
02:16:51.060 --> 02:16:55.410
<v Speaker 3>we're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what it does to the </v>

3059
02:16:55.410 --> 02:16:55.410
<v Speaker 3>microbiome changes the composition so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're like,</v>

3060
02:16:55.410 --> 02:16:56.920
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting the kind of bacteria that</v>

3061
02:16:56.921 --> 02:16:59.080
<v Speaker 3>are really good at harvesting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>glucose from,</v>

3062
02:16:59.350 --> 02:17:01.150
<v Speaker 3>from like the small intestine area.</v>

3063
02:17:01.390 --> 02:17:06.390
<v Speaker 3>And it makes people become obese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the associative studies and </v>

3064
02:17:06.390 --> 02:17:07.360
<v Speaker 3>people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've shown that in people.</v>

3065
02:17:07.361 --> 02:17:09.400
<v Speaker 3>And then of course they've done causal </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies in animals showing that.</v>

3066
02:17:09.401 --> 02:17:12.340
<v Speaker 3>But stevia is interesting because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3067
02:17:12.850 --> 02:17:17.850
<v Speaker 3>I've seen positive studies with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it seems to improve insulin </v>

3068
02:17:17.850 --> 02:17:18.070
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of weird.</v>

3069
02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:21.820
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I personally am always,</v>

3070
02:17:21.890 --> 02:17:23.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3071
02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:24.970
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll use stevia.</v>

3072
02:17:24.971 --> 02:17:29.971
<v Speaker 3>Like if I'm like gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's make some hot cocoa with 100 </v>

3073
02:17:29.971 --> 02:17:30.190
<v Speaker 3>percent cocoa and it just tastes like </v>
<v Speaker 3>ass.</v>

3074
02:17:30.191 --> 02:17:31.490
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need some stevia.</v>

3075
02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:34.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like otherwise you're just doing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot of it.</v>

3076
02:17:34.220 --> 02:17:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Like hot cocoa with no sugar is 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent cocoa or cacao.</v>

3077
02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:42.340
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of benefits with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

3078
02:17:42.341 --> 02:17:43.360
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

3079
02:17:43.361 --> 02:17:45.250
<v Speaker 3>with this I don't really use a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stevia.</v>

3080
02:17:45.251 --> 02:17:47.500
<v Speaker 3>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my inlaws they,</v>

3081
02:17:47.530 --> 02:17:52.530
<v Speaker 3>they like to put it in their smoothies </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've gotten so used to my </v>

3082
02:17:52.530 --> 02:17:53.680
<v Speaker 3>smoothies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tasting kaylee that I guess,</v>

3083
02:17:53.681 --> 02:17:54.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3084
02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:59.480
<v Speaker 3>and plus I don't eat any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything sweet so I don't really need </v>

3085
02:17:59.480 --> 02:17:59.480
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3086
02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:00.160
<v Speaker 3>But they like to put it in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoothies and you know,</v>

3087
02:18:00.970 --> 02:18:02.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it has any.</v>

3088
02:18:02.950 --> 02:18:05.800
<v Speaker 3>We haven't really seen negative health </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences with the exception.</v>

3089
02:18:05.801 --> 02:18:10.801
<v Speaker 3>I think there was one study in rats </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they gave him like exceptional </v>

3090
02:18:10.801 --> 02:18:13.570
<v Speaker 3>amounts and it like changed the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hormonal profile or something.</v>

3091
02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:17.020
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't consume any during pregnancy</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was worried about that.</v>

3092
02:18:17.070 --> 02:18:21.790
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll don't be a rat study study,</v>

3093
02:18:21.791 --> 02:18:26.791
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's probably my choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I were to sweeten something like my </v>

3094
02:18:26.791 --> 02:18:31.050
<v Speaker 3>put it in my coffee or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd put stevia with trump is grossly </v>

3095
02:18:31.050 --> 02:18:31.480
<v Speaker 3>overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the microbiome,</v>

3096
02:18:31.481 --> 02:18:35.290
<v Speaker 3>what's funny is that people are taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet coke or trying or they're trying to</v>

3097
02:18:35.291 --> 02:18:36.410
<v Speaker 3>like improve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

3098
02:18:36.430 --> 02:18:38.770
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want the refined sugar.</v>

3099
02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:43.980
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the constant insulin response and so </v>

3100
02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:44.980
<v Speaker 3>they're drinking the diet coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of ironic that it's like,</v>

3101
02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:50.370
<v Speaker 3>it's like making them more be obese by </v>
<v Speaker 3>changing the gut microbiome know is,</v>

3102
02:18:50.430 --> 02:18:54.070
<v Speaker 3>is it safe to drink just one can every </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and again or it's just something you</v>

3103
02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:56.770
<v Speaker 3>can every now and then it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3104
02:18:56.771 --> 02:19:01.771
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's not going to like </v>

3105
02:19:01.771 --> 02:19:01.771
<v Speaker 3>completely not 12 cans a day or even one</v>
<v Speaker 3>candidate.</v>

3106
02:19:01.771 --> 02:19:03.400
<v Speaker 3>You're constantly under certain your </v>
<v Speaker 3>microbiome.</v>

3107
02:19:03.401 --> 02:19:06.010
<v Speaker 3>You're constantly going to keep shifting</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in towards,</v>

3108
02:19:06.011 --> 02:19:08.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one Canada probably.</v>

3109
02:19:08.861 --> 02:19:09.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's.</v>

3110
02:19:09.940 --> 02:19:11.420
<v Speaker 3>The microbiome is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3111
02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:15.460
<v Speaker 3>Diet coke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diet coke.</v>

3112
02:19:15.550 --> 02:19:19.660
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coke was like 2006.</v>

3113
02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:22.800
<v Speaker 3>I had one yesterday and the hotel </v>
<v Speaker 3>cracked it open.</v>

3114
02:19:22.820 --> 02:19:24.100
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't,</v>

3115
02:19:24.130 --> 02:19:27.550
<v Speaker 3>I really haven't had one since 2006.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to drink,</v>

3116
02:19:27.551 --> 02:19:28.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to drink them,</v>

3117
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:30.650
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

3118
02:19:30.850 --> 02:19:35.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for lightened college and stuff to stay </v>

3119
02:19:35.850 --> 02:19:38.081
<v Speaker 3>awake and study for exams and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're taking something like </v>

3120
02:19:38.081 --> 02:19:38.081
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3121
02:19:38.081 --> 02:19:42.520
<v Speaker 3>should you take a corresponding like </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a probiotic to try to </v>

3122
02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:45.350
<v Speaker 3>combat that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the problem with that is,</v>

3123
02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:47.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the probiotics,</v>

3124
02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:50.060
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of interesting studies</v>

3125
02:19:50.061 --> 02:19:52.670
<v Speaker 3>that have shown effectiveness of certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>probiotics that are,</v>

3126
02:19:52.690 --> 02:19:55.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a lot of that or have live bacteria</v>

3127
02:19:55.431 --> 02:19:57.640
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3128
02:19:57.770 --> 02:20:02.770
<v Speaker 3>in order for the probiotics to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you either have to constantly take them </v>

3129
02:20:02.770 --> 02:20:05.690
<v Speaker 3>or there needs to be space in your gut </v>
<v Speaker 3>for them to take residence in.</v>

3130
02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:08.120
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're like filling your body with</v>

3131
02:20:08.121 --> 02:20:09.980
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of sugar or diet coke and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3132
02:20:09.981 --> 02:20:12.660
<v Speaker 3>then where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's the probiotic that you,</v>

3133
02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:14.840
<v Speaker 3>you're taking in gonna attach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3134
02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:18.080
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of flow through and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flow through that has benefits,</v>

3135
02:20:18.081 --> 02:20:19.990
<v Speaker 3>but you have to keep taking it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3136
02:20:20.030 --> 02:20:21.530
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For that to happen.</v>

3137
02:20:21.531 --> 02:20:24.110
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so really a healthy diet is the way it's</v>

3138
02:20:24.111 --> 02:20:29.111
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't just counteract with </v>

3139
02:20:29.111 --> 02:20:29.111
<v Speaker 3>supplementation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're healthy,</v>

3140
02:20:29.111 --> 02:20:29.111
<v Speaker 3>healthy diets the way meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3141
02:20:29.111 --> 02:20:29.560
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3142
02:20:29.620 --> 02:20:32.240
<v Speaker 3>the fermentable fiber which is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>helps grow,</v>

3143
02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:36.440
<v Speaker 3>helps the commensal and good bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically grow and thrive.</v>

3144
02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:38.930
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probiotics helped me a lot.</v>

3145
02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:41.310
<v Speaker 3>Like after I had some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had some gut issues from,</v>

3146
02:20:41.340 --> 02:20:44.270
<v Speaker 3>from stress with graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>graduate school.</v>

3147
02:20:44.271 --> 02:20:47.510
<v Speaker 3>And so that definitely helped me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3148
02:20:47.511 --> 02:20:48.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3149
02:20:48.490 --> 02:20:50.030
<v Speaker 3>I take them once in awhile now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3150
02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:50.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>

3151
02:20:50.930 --> 02:20:55.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't take them everyday like I did </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was like trying to like kill </v>

3152
02:20:55.930 --> 02:20:55.930
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

3153
02:20:55.930 --> 02:20:55.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3154
02:20:55.930 --> 02:21:00.560
<v Speaker 3>and the one I was taking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we've talked about this $450 </v>

3155
02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:00.860
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called vsl number three,</v>

3156
02:21:00.861 --> 02:21:05.861
<v Speaker 3>but now there's another company called </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] biome that is like the guy </v>

3157
02:21:05.861 --> 02:21:09.161
<v Speaker 3>who made [inaudible] vsl number three is</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this is by all make the same </v>

3158
02:21:09.161 --> 02:21:09.650
<v Speaker 3>formulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tried it out as well.</v>

3159
02:21:09.870 --> 02:21:14.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like a little cheaper anD I </v>

3160
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.870
<v Speaker 3>don't have any affiliation with either </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those companies,</v>

3161
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:18.791
<v Speaker 3>but theRe's been clinical clinical </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies with both of them showing </v>

3162
02:21:18.791 --> 02:21:18.791
<v Speaker 3>effectiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

3163
02:21:18.791 --> 02:21:19.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3164
02:21:19.141 --> 02:21:24.141
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly an interesting field </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing field and there happens in the </v>

3165
02:21:24.161 --> 02:21:26.390
<v Speaker 3>clinical studies in humans where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

3166
02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:29.570
<v Speaker 3>the one that's super interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain,</v>

3167
02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:34.600
<v Speaker 3>the brain stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way it's affecting the brain is </v>

3168
02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:34.600
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's clinical studies.</v>

3169
02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:37.691
<v Speaker 3>There was one recent one I thinK I </v>
<v Speaker 3>tweeted where there was like 10 </v>

3170
02:21:37.691 --> 02:21:40.811
<v Speaker 3>randomized controlled trials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't really high quality but </v>

3171
02:21:40.811 --> 02:21:42.530
<v Speaker 3>it's a start and it improved measures of</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety and people,</v>

3172
02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:48.190
<v Speaker 3>other studies have shown in randomized </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlled trials have been a couple of </v>

3173
02:21:48.190 --> 02:21:50.180
<v Speaker 3>others showing it improves depression </v>
<v Speaker 3>scores and also in cognition.</v>

3174
02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:51.220
<v Speaker 3>So tHere's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3175
02:21:51.250 --> 02:21:56.250
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>immune system modulation of the immune </v>

3176
02:21:56.250 --> 02:21:56.300
<v Speaker 3>system will affect the brain immune </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

3177
02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:58.040
<v Speaker 3>It definitely is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3178
02:21:58.041 --> 02:22:03.041
<v Speaker 3>basically inflammatory factors and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that can cross over to the </v>

3179
02:22:03.041 --> 02:22:06.370
<v Speaker 3>blood brain barrier and getting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain and disrupt neurotransmitter </v>

3180
02:22:06.370 --> 02:22:10.190
<v Speaker 3>production and all sorts of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also the gut brain access,</v>

3181
02:22:10.191 --> 02:22:14.030
<v Speaker 3>the bagel nerve where like you can make </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things that are like if you,</v>

3182
02:22:14.031 --> 02:22:16.490
<v Speaker 3>if you have certain bacteria in the gut </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are making,</v>

3183
02:22:16.491 --> 02:22:21.491
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gabba that can stimulate the nerve in </v>

3184
02:22:21.491 --> 02:22:24.100
<v Speaker 3>inhibitory way that like comes in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>does something calming to the,</v>

3185
02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:24.790
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

3186
02:22:24.990 --> 02:22:26.160
<v Speaker 3>the brain part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't really</v>

3187
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:31.160
<v Speaker 1>understand all the mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just fascinating field that I'm </v>

3188
02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:32.560
<v Speaker 1>like trying to follow and keep up on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3189
02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:33.690
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>

3190
02:22:33.691 --> 02:22:37.170
<v Speaker 1>do you do normal healthy people need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take probiotics all the time and I don't</v>

3191
02:22:37.171 --> 02:22:39.100
<v Speaker 1>know the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that we need to,</v>

3192
02:22:39.130 --> 02:22:44.130
<v Speaker 1>to eat the right foods to get our </v>
<v Speaker 1>microbiome healthy and avoid things </v>

3193
02:22:44.130 --> 02:22:44.130
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3194
02:22:44.250 --> 02:22:45.330
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aspartame.</v>

3195
02:22:45.540 --> 02:22:47.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>aspartame.</v>

3196
02:22:47.310 --> 02:22:49.860
<v Speaker 5>Nutrasweet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although that's the same stuff,</v>

3197
02:22:49.861 --> 02:22:50.840
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's nutrasweet.</v>

3198
02:22:51.480 --> 02:22:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it is the blue packet now.</v>

3199
02:22:54.810 --> 02:22:59.810
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting back to developing fetuses and </v>

3200
02:22:59.810 --> 02:23:00.660
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an infant developing in the womb.</v>

3201
02:23:00.930 --> 02:23:02.880
<v Speaker 5>When you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3202
02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:09.030
<v Speaker 5>foods that cause inflammation and </v>
<v Speaker 5>autoimmune diseases,</v>

3203
02:23:09.070 --> 02:23:10.710
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a correlation between those two.</v>

3204
02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:14.970
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when your eating inflammation causing</v>

3205
02:23:14.971 --> 02:23:16.950
<v Speaker 5>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>refined carbohydrates,</v>

3206
02:23:16.951 --> 02:23:21.900
<v Speaker 5>refined sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you have a baby and if you have this</v>

3207
02:23:21.901 --> 02:23:26.070
<v Speaker 5>inflammation in your body and you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>having autoimmune reactions,</v>

3208
02:23:26.270 --> 02:23:31.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this can trigger many autoimmune </v>

3209
02:23:31.270 --> 02:23:31.270
<v Speaker 5>diseases that people have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3210
02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:32.310
<v Speaker 5>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there.</v>

3211
02:23:32.370 --> 02:23:37.370
<v Speaker 5>Has there been studies done trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand what happens when you consume</v>

3212
02:23:38.221 --> 02:23:43.221
<v Speaker 5>a lot of pro inflammatory foods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>foods that cause inflammation and what </v>

3213
02:23:43.221 --> 02:23:45.870
<v Speaker 5>kind of a reaction that has to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>developing child?</v>

3214
02:23:45.870 --> 02:23:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies have been done,</v>

3215
02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:48.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3216
02:23:48.580 --> 02:23:53.580
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to establish causation in animals and </v>

3217
02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:56.691
<v Speaker 1>looking at correlation and there've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlated correlative studies in </v>

3218
02:23:56.691 --> 02:23:56.691
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

3219
02:23:56.691 --> 02:23:57.660
<v Speaker 1>most of the time though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3220
02:23:57.750 --> 02:24:02.750
<v Speaker 1>the correlative studies aren't looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at whether or not they're consuming the </v>

3221
02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:05.571
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote inflammatory foods that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause inflammatory types of reactions </v>

3222
02:24:05.571 --> 02:24:06.180
<v Speaker 1>like refined sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just looking at obese mothers.</v>

3223
02:24:06.570 --> 02:24:10.920
<v Speaker 1>And usually someone who's obese </v>
<v Speaker 1>typically is not eating a healthy diet.</v>

3224
02:24:11.210 --> 02:24:13.320
<v Speaker 1>So I think that more times than not can </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3225
02:24:13.321 --> 02:24:14.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're probably eating a lot of refined</v>

3226
02:24:14.941 --> 02:24:17.070
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3227
02:24:17.530 --> 02:24:18.660
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that,</v>

3228
02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:20.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the correlation between that and looking</v>

3229
02:24:20.671 --> 02:24:20.990
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3230
02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:24.690
<v Speaker 1>negative health consequences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>offspring like type one diabetes,</v>

3231
02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:30.320
<v Speaker 1>even poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing poorly on cognitive cognition </v>

3232
02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:30.990
<v Speaker 1>tests and things like that that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at.</v>

3233
02:24:31.470 --> 02:24:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Animal studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been studies that have shown </v>

3234
02:24:36.470 --> 02:24:37.800
<v Speaker 1>causally that you can do that by feeding</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mouse,</v>

3235
02:24:37.801 --> 02:24:40.020
<v Speaker 1>a high fat high sugar diet and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3236
02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:45.080
<v Speaker 1>making the female mouse obese and </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing basically the way there,</v>

3237
02:24:45.130 --> 02:24:47.880
<v Speaker 1>the offspring metabolism and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>immune cells are reacting.</v>

3238
02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:50.970
<v Speaker 1>So things like that definitely have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>shown in animal studies,</v>

3239
02:24:50.971 --> 02:24:55.971
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really almost impossible to show a </v>

3240
02:24:55.971 --> 02:24:56.280
<v Speaker 1>causal study like that in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3241
02:24:56.281 --> 02:24:57.630
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you kind of have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3242
02:24:57.631 --> 02:25:02.631
<v Speaker 1>you've got these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were showing with the </v>

3243
02:25:02.631 --> 02:25:05.450
<v Speaker 1>acetaminophen and adhd to reduce risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not going to have a </v>

3244
02:25:05.450 --> 02:25:09.051
<v Speaker 1>controlled trial where they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give women acetaminophen during </v>

3245
02:25:09.051 --> 02:25:11.100
<v Speaker 1>pregnancy and see if it causes adhd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's never gonna happen.</v>

3246
02:25:11.101 --> 02:25:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

3247
02:25:12.060 --> 02:25:12.450
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3248
02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:14.230
<v Speaker 1>it's unethical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3249
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:19.550
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the next best thing would be to </v>

3250
02:25:19.550 --> 02:25:19.550
<v Speaker 1>like then go to animal studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And show it,</v>

3251
02:25:19.550 --> 02:25:19.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem,</v>

3252
02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:21.670
<v Speaker 1>the problem with the animal studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

3253
02:25:21.750 --> 02:25:25.450
<v Speaker 1>this is always problem is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never know how much of it translates</v>

3254
02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:27.220
<v Speaker 1>into things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are different,</v>

3255
02:25:27.221 --> 02:25:29.590
<v Speaker 1>like the way they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they metabolize the livers of,</v>

3256
02:25:29.740 --> 02:25:34.740
<v Speaker 1>of mice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolize xenobiotics can be a little </v>

3257
02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:34.740
<v Speaker 1>different than humans.</v>

3258
02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:36.050
<v Speaker 1>And so things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3259
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:41.070
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these mice can be a little more </v>

3260
02:25:41.070 --> 02:25:41.070
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to things like bpa in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3261
02:25:41.070 --> 02:25:42.160
<v Speaker 1>things that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are damaging,</v>

3262
02:25:42.470 --> 02:25:43.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

3263
02:25:43.390 --> 02:25:44.290
<v Speaker 1>than humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

3264
02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:48.430
<v Speaker 1>which contain certain enzymes that some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these mice lack,</v>

3265
02:25:48.431 --> 02:25:49.110
<v Speaker 1>that can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3266
02:25:49.330 --> 02:25:52.960
<v Speaker 1>basically alter their metabolism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it not so harmful so to speak.</v>

3267
02:25:53.220 --> 02:25:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3268
02:25:54.130 --> 02:25:56.960
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good if you've,</v>

3269
02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:00.880
<v Speaker 1>if you've got like the perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies in humans that's correlating.</v>

3270
02:26:00.881 --> 02:26:02.920
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got the mechanistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies in animals,</v>

3271
02:26:03.310 --> 02:26:08.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a stronger argument than if you </v>

3272
02:26:08.310 --> 02:26:08.310
<v Speaker 1>just looked at one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3273
02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:10.830
<v Speaker 5>good studies that show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a correlation between gut,</v>

3274
02:26:10.940 --> 02:26:15.940
<v Speaker 5>my gut microbiome and children with </v>
<v Speaker 5>autism and asperger's and several other </v>

3275
02:26:16.971 --> 02:26:17.470
<v Speaker 5>diseases.</v>

3276
02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3277
02:26:18.091 --> 02:26:21.180
<v Speaker 1>There have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gut microbiome seems to play a major</v>

3278
02:26:21.181 --> 02:26:22.130
<v Speaker 1>role in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3279
02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:27.200
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely some changes with </v>
<v Speaker 1>autistic children and I'm an asperger's </v>

3280
02:26:28.441 --> 02:26:31.260
<v Speaker 1>like being on the autistic spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3281
02:26:31.261 --> 02:26:32.820
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that's like,</v>

3282
02:26:32.910 --> 02:26:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure it's entirely understood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a connection there.</v>

3283
02:26:36.241 --> 02:26:41.241
<v Speaker 1>There's a connection with the gut </v>
<v Speaker 1>microbiome and parkinson's disease with </v>

3284
02:26:41.241 --> 02:26:43.260
<v Speaker 1>multiple sclerosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are,</v>

3285
02:26:43.290 --> 02:26:48.290
<v Speaker 1>these are lots of studies are coming out</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing these connection with brain </v>

3286
02:26:48.290 --> 02:26:48.290
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

3287
02:26:48.290 --> 02:26:49.110
<v Speaker 1>not just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3288
02:26:49.130 --> 02:26:50.790
<v Speaker 1>autoimmune type of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

3289
02:26:50.791 --> 02:26:53.820
<v Speaker 1>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases like multiple sclerosis,</v>

3290
02:26:53.821 --> 02:26:57.030
<v Speaker 1>but neurodegenerative diseases and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>even behavioral diseases.</v>

3291
02:26:57.330 --> 02:26:58.590
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3292
02:26:58.591 --> 02:26:59.690
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole,</v>

3293
02:26:59.691 --> 02:27:00.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3294
02:27:00.420 --> 02:27:05.420
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of just starting to scratch </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surface of this field with the </v>

3295
02:27:05.420 --> 02:27:05.700
<v Speaker 1>microbiome and even cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>

3296
02:27:05.730 --> 02:27:06.510
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3297
02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:08.390
<v Speaker 1>it's known that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3298
02:27:08.490 --> 02:27:10.740
<v Speaker 1>some of the short chain fatty acids that</v>
<v Speaker 1>microbiome,</v>

3299
02:27:10.741 --> 02:27:12.580
<v Speaker 1>certain species make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3300
02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:16.500
<v Speaker 1>increase the production of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>called natural natural killer t cells.</v>

3301
02:27:16.890 --> 02:27:21.890
<v Speaker 1>And there's been animal studies where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you inject them with like human tumors </v>

3302
02:27:21.890 --> 02:27:25.881
<v Speaker 1>and literally it can you give these </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals a big dose of probiotics which,</v>

3303
02:27:26.420 --> 02:27:31.420
<v Speaker 1>which help create the species that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>these short chain fatty acids that make </v>

3304
02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:35.960
<v Speaker 1>t regulatory cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can kill cancer cells almost as </v>

3305
02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:36.300
<v Speaker 1>good as the chemo control that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving these animals.</v>

3306
02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:41.480
<v Speaker 1>And then if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some preliminary human trials </v>

3307
02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:43.851
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans that had colorectal cancer and </v>

3308
02:27:43.851 --> 02:27:47.541
<v Speaker 1>they're given a high dose of probiotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like close to 400 billion probiotic </v>

3309
02:27:47.541 --> 02:27:50.820
<v Speaker 1>products a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It like lowered their cancer recurrence.</v>

3310
02:27:50.910 --> 02:27:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Of course they had their colon removed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surgically removed,</v>

3311
02:27:53.910 --> 02:27:54.680
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3312
02:27:54.720 --> 02:27:56.370
<v Speaker 1>still it's lowering their cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>recurrence.</v>

3313
02:27:56.371 --> 02:28:01.371
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a interesting along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with knowing what we know about animal </v>

3314
02:28:01.371 --> 02:28:02.910
<v Speaker 1>studies and natural killer t cells and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

3315
02:28:02.911 --> 02:28:04.080
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3316
02:28:04.081 --> 02:28:07.440
<v Speaker 1>it's not just brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a lot of diseases,</v>

3317
02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:09.150
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3318
02:28:09.151 --> 02:28:10.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>autoimmune diseases,</v>

3319
02:28:10.890 --> 02:28:12.810
<v Speaker 1>lots of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And gut is so important.</v>

3320
02:28:13.050 --> 02:28:13.950
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

3321
02:28:13.951 --> 02:28:16.620
<v Speaker 1>it's the major sources of inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the body.</v>

3322
02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:21.920
<v Speaker 1>It's the major source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people are so worried about taking </v>

3323
02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:22.250
<v Speaker 1>this x thing exogenously from</v>

3324
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:23.510
<v Speaker 3>some chemical and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3325
02:28:23.511 --> 02:28:25.520
<v Speaker 3>you should be worried about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you should be worried about your gut</v>

3326
02:28:25.521 --> 02:28:26.720
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like really,</v>

3327
02:28:26.810 --> 02:28:30.560
<v Speaker 3>and probably one of the loose understood</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of like the general public.</v>

3328
02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:31.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3329
02:28:31.551 --> 02:28:35.990
<v Speaker 3>and even scientists like we're just now </v>
<v Speaker 3>really diving into that and I think that</v>

3330
02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:38.000
<v Speaker 3>I should say at least aware,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3331
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3332
02:28:38.930 --> 02:28:41.090
<v Speaker 3>Most people have no idea that it's even </v>
<v Speaker 3>an issue now.</v>

3333
02:28:41.091 --> 02:28:46.091
<v Speaker 3>When you consider the fact that the rise</v>
<v Speaker 3>in children on the spectrum or </v>

3334
02:28:46.091 --> 02:28:50.830
<v Speaker 3>corresponds with the rise of refined </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates and refined sugars in our </v>

3335
02:28:50.830 --> 02:28:54.821
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that there's some sort of </v>

3336
02:28:54.821 --> 02:28:54.821
<v Speaker 3>connection there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has a negative effect.</v>

3337
02:28:54.821 --> 02:28:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Refined sugars have a negative effect on</v>
<v Speaker 3>your microbiome is certainly.</v>

3338
02:28:57.981 --> 02:29:02.981
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's lots of contributing </v>

3339
02:29:02.981 --> 02:29:02.981
<v Speaker 3>factors to autism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3340
02:29:02.981 --> 02:29:04.190
<v Speaker 3>I published a paper on this with vitamin</v>
<v Speaker 3>d deficiency being one.</v>

3341
02:29:04.490 --> 02:29:05.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that diet,</v>

3342
02:29:06.020 --> 02:29:06.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>

3343
02:29:06.850 --> 02:29:09.650
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of other factors play a role.</v>

3344
02:29:09.770 --> 02:29:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Paternal age actually plays a role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3345
02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:17.030
<v Speaker 3>smoking is also been shown like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>maternal smoking apparently,</v>

3346
02:29:17.450 --> 02:29:19.010
<v Speaker 3>particularly for the father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the father.</v>

3347
02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:20.200
<v Speaker 3>Paternal age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3348
02:29:20.330 --> 02:29:21.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

3349
02:29:21.041 --> 02:29:26.041
<v Speaker 3>that seems to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's something that's a couple of </v>

3350
02:29:26.041 --> 02:29:28.151
<v Speaker 3>studies and publish and I think even </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently it just kind of a big one came </v>

3351
02:29:28.151 --> 02:29:29.430
<v Speaker 3>out that was confirming because most </v>
<v Speaker 3>people think it's maternal right.</v>

3352
02:29:29.450 --> 02:29:33.470
<v Speaker 3>But it's actually both maternal plays a </v>
<v Speaker 3>role in down syndrome.</v>

3353
02:29:34.100 --> 02:29:35.480
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

3354
02:29:35.481 --> 02:29:38.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm not aware of maternal age being </v>
<v Speaker 3>linked to autism,</v>

3355
02:29:38.781 --> 02:29:42.530
<v Speaker 3>although I wouldn't be surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3356
02:29:42.820 --> 02:29:46.130
<v Speaker 3>there's probably an interaction with all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things in interaction with,</v>

3357
02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:47.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3358
02:29:47.690 --> 02:29:50.930
<v Speaker 3>the quality of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the dna in a woman's egg or sperm,</v>

3359
02:29:51.330 --> 02:29:56.330
<v Speaker 3>sperm and the type of diet they have and</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they're taking acetaminophen or </v>

3360
02:29:57.021 --> 02:29:58.310
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fill in the blank.</v>

3361
02:29:58.490 --> 02:30:03.490
<v Speaker 3>Pharmaceutical or diet of the father and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the diet of the father you were talking </v>

3362
02:30:03.490 --> 02:30:04.460
<v Speaker 3>about before with obese people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3363
02:30:04.461 --> 02:30:06.980
<v Speaker 3>And what's interesting with that now in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that day,</v>

3364
02:30:06.981 --> 02:30:09.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean that study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was totally a pilot experiment,</v>

3365
02:30:09.781 --> 02:30:11.420
<v Speaker 3>just looking at how it altered gene </v>
<v Speaker 3>expression.</v>

3366
02:30:11.421 --> 02:30:14.240
<v Speaker 3>But if you look in the animal studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paternal diet,</v>

3367
02:30:14.241 --> 02:30:19.241
<v Speaker 3>so so males,</v>
<v Speaker 3>male mice that were given a high fat </v>

3368
02:30:19.241 --> 02:30:19.340
<v Speaker 3>high sugar diet most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

3369
02:30:19.341 --> 02:30:22.640
<v Speaker 3>when you see headlines and it says high </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat diet causes blank,</v>

3370
02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:26.150
<v Speaker 3>high fat diet and animal studies is </v>
<v Speaker 3>always high fat,</v>

3371
02:30:26.151 --> 02:30:27.710
<v Speaker 3>high sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they always,</v>

3372
02:30:27.770 --> 02:30:28.390
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all,</v>

3373
02:30:28.391 --> 02:30:32.540
<v Speaker 3>it's almost always almost always high </v>
<v Speaker 3>high sucrose and high high fat.</v>

3374
02:30:32.570 --> 02:30:35.180
<v Speaker 3>But why don't they say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3375
02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:39.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I guess you know,</v>

3376
02:30:39.081 --> 02:30:39.520
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3377
02:30:39.530 --> 02:30:44.530
<v Speaker 3>they're so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so drastically changing the fat </v>

3378
02:30:44.530 --> 02:30:46.901
<v Speaker 3>composition that they just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>always say the high fat and the </v>

3379
02:30:46.901 --> 02:30:50.651
<v Speaker 3>interaction between these two things </v>
<v Speaker 3>just really is now starting to be </v>

3380
02:30:50.651 --> 02:30:50.651
<v Speaker 3>understood.</v>

3381
02:30:50.651 --> 02:30:51.170
<v Speaker 3>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3382
02:30:51.240 --> 02:30:53.360
<v Speaker 3>it really is a high fat is almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>always.</v>

3383
02:30:53.570 --> 02:30:58.570
<v Speaker 3>So I always call it high inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet because it's a combination of the </v>

3384
02:30:58.570 --> 02:30:58.570
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

3385
02:30:58.570 --> 02:31:01.550
<v Speaker 3>they feel that if you feed male mice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this diet of high fat and high sucrose,</v>

3386
02:31:01.970 --> 02:31:04.910
<v Speaker 3>they become obese and then they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>offspring.</v>

3387
02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:08.480
<v Speaker 3>If you feed the feed their offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal diet.</v>

3388
02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:10.310
<v Speaker 3>So not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the high fat.</v>

3389
02:31:10.311 --> 02:31:12.350
<v Speaker 3>So they're just fed a normal child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had those offspring,</v>

3390
02:31:12.440 --> 02:31:16.220
<v Speaker 3>female offspring don't become obese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they get type one diabetes.</v>

3391
02:31:17.690 --> 02:31:19.830
<v Speaker 3>So it's because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then what and what was found is that</v>

3392
02:31:19.831 --> 02:31:19.970
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3393
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:25.040
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the obesity was changing genes that </v>

3394
02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:25.910
<v Speaker 1>regulate pancreatic beta cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3395
02:31:26.020 --> 02:31:29.930
<v Speaker 1>insulin production in their sperm dna </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was passed on to the,</v>

3396
02:31:29.970 --> 02:31:34.970
<v Speaker 1>to the offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of again looking at.</v>

3397
02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:38.430
<v Speaker 1>It's also comp works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it is,</v>

3398
02:31:38.460 --> 02:31:39.990
<v Speaker 1>it's complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

3399
02:31:39.991 --> 02:31:44.991
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly am constantly trying to </v>

3400
02:31:44.991 --> 02:31:44.991
<v Speaker 1>optimize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3401
02:31:44.991 --> 02:31:45.380
<v Speaker 1>everything I can to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3402
02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:48.660
<v Speaker 1>the best of my ability and things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>always changing,</v>

3403
02:31:48.860 --> 02:31:50.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing with science and that's</v>

3404
02:31:50.341 --> 02:31:52.140
<v Speaker 1>also the thing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3405
02:31:52.770 --> 02:31:56.490
<v Speaker 1>following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>following someone or following a certain</v>

3406
02:31:56.700 --> 02:31:57.630
<v Speaker 1>dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3407
02:31:57.631 --> 02:32:01.060
<v Speaker 1>things change and you have to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like accept that things change.</v>

3408
02:32:01.061 --> 02:32:06.061
<v Speaker 1>The more data we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more tools that we have at our </v>

3409
02:32:06.061 --> 02:32:06.061
<v Speaker 1>disposal to add our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3410
02:32:06.061 --> 02:32:10.530
<v Speaker 1>to investigate things are paradigm </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifts like saturated fat.</v>

3411
02:32:10.770 --> 02:32:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a huge paradigm shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3412
02:32:12.931 --> 02:32:15.450
<v Speaker 1>people in my parents' generation like my</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>

3413
02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:17.760
<v Speaker 1>and you just convinced that like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3414
02:32:17.850 --> 02:32:20.260
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat is going to kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3415
02:32:20.580 --> 02:32:22.630
<v Speaker 1>it's parented by people everyday.</v>

3416
02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:25.350
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about this before.</v>

3417
02:32:25.351 --> 02:32:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I believe on the poc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>josh,</v>

3418
02:32:26.520 --> 02:32:31.520
<v Speaker 1>you and I about that study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The studies were either with the </v>

3419
02:32:31.520 --> 02:32:31.620
<v Speaker 1>scientists were paid off by the sugar </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

3420
02:32:32.610 --> 02:32:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the sugar industry is </v>

3421
02:32:37.610 --> 02:32:38.580
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the worst examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not always the case,</v>

3422
02:32:38.581 --> 02:32:43.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you have someone funding your </v>

3423
02:32:43.581 --> 02:32:44.670
<v Speaker 1>research that is involved in whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're investigating,</v>

3424
02:32:45.120 --> 02:32:47.640
<v Speaker 1>the sugar industry is particularly bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not always the case.</v>

3425
02:32:47.641 --> 02:32:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Like I wAs involved in research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3426
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:55.070
<v Speaker 1>with blueberries and the research was </v>
<v Speaker 1>funded by the high bush blueberry </v>

3427
02:32:55.070 --> 02:32:59.301
<v Speaker 1>council.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we did this placebo controlled </v>

3428
02:32:59.301 --> 02:32:59.301
<v Speaker 1>trial where we are looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3429
02:32:59.301 --> 02:33:00.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole panel of scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

3430
02:33:00.661 --> 02:33:02.280
<v Speaker 1>And I was just one of the scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in.</v>

3431
02:33:02.281 --> 02:33:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I was looking specifically at dna damage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

3432
02:33:06.330 --> 02:33:11.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how blueberries modulator that dna </v>

3433
02:33:11.330 --> 02:33:11.860
<v Speaker 1>damage which can lead to aging and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer and stem cell dysfunction,</v>

3434
02:33:11.890 --> 02:33:12.570
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things.</v>

3435
02:33:13.140 --> 02:33:16.170
<v Speaker 1>And there was a placebo group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was an enormous amount of work,</v>

3436
02:33:16.171 --> 02:33:21.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had to isolate blood from patients </v>

3437
02:33:21.171 --> 02:33:21.171
<v Speaker 1>that they were given this blueberry </v>
<v Speaker 1>powder,</v>

3438
02:33:21.171 --> 02:33:23.610
<v Speaker 1>they were taking twice a day for eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks or placebo powder.</v>

3439
02:33:23.611 --> 02:33:24.390
<v Speaker 1>And then we had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3440
02:33:24.391 --> 02:33:28.030
<v Speaker 1>look at their dna damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

3441
02:33:28.080 --> 02:33:31.590
<v Speaker 1>what my work found was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my surprise,</v>

3442
02:33:31.591 --> 02:33:36.591
<v Speaker 1>so blueberries lower dna damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I thought because they </v>

3443
02:33:36.591 --> 02:33:38.670
<v Speaker 1>have a variety of compounds in them that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are known to be antioxidants.</v>

3444
02:33:39.270 --> 02:33:41.610
<v Speaker 1>But what was really surprising to me was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it,</v>

3445
02:33:41.790 --> 02:33:46.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the placebo actually lower dna damage </v>

3446
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.790
<v Speaker 1>just as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not better,</v>

3447
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:51.440
<v Speaker 1>then the blueberry powder and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>placebo powder had a little bit of </v>

3448
02:33:51.440 --> 02:33:52.680
<v Speaker 1>refined sugar in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some.</v>

3449
02:33:52.710 --> 02:33:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm like coloring food coloring and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

3450
02:33:55.021 --> 02:33:56.760
<v Speaker 1>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

3451
02:33:56.790 --> 02:34:00.360
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is the sugar lowering dna damage?</v>

3452
02:34:00.361 --> 02:34:05.361
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out I had looked at gene </v>

3453
02:34:05.361 --> 02:34:05.361
<v Speaker 1>expression data as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these genes,</v>

3454
02:34:05.361 --> 02:34:05.361
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

3455
02:34:05.361 --> 02:34:08.340
<v Speaker 1>that are involved in stress response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in hormesis,</v>

3456
02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:13.940
<v Speaker 1>the reason I was looking at that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are certain compounds in </v>

3457
02:34:13.940 --> 02:34:14.670
<v Speaker 1>the blueberries that can have a hormetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>response and I wanted to see if that was</v>

3458
02:34:14.671 --> 02:34:16.650
<v Speaker 1>being activated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3459
02:34:16.890 --> 02:34:17.710
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't really</v>

3460
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:19.840
<v Speaker 3>robustly being activated in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>blueberries,</v>

3461
02:34:19.841 --> 02:34:22.210
<v Speaker 3>but in placebo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of these pathways,</v>

3462
02:34:22.211 --> 02:34:27.211
<v Speaker 3>the same pathways that like sulforaphane</v>
<v Speaker 3>can activate really well to some degree </v>

3463
02:34:27.211 --> 02:34:28.360
<v Speaker 3>was being activated because we think it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was slightly stressful.</v>

3464
02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Of course it was a very small amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar and,</v>

3465
02:34:30.500 --> 02:34:35.500
<v Speaker 3>and also the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dyes that were used or have been </v>

3466
02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:35.590
<v Speaker 3>shown to cause a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hermetic response.</v>

3467
02:34:35.950 --> 02:34:37.220
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to publish that day.</v>

3468
02:34:37.221 --> 02:34:41.740
<v Speaker 3>It's not like because the blueberry </v>
<v Speaker 3>foundation funded this study,</v>

3469
02:34:41.780 --> 02:34:43.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3470
02:34:43.061 --> 02:34:46.150
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the data is still this data is the data.</v>

3471
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:50.380
<v Speaker 3>We didn't change anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not always the case.</v>

3472
02:34:50.381 --> 02:34:55.381
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something very interesting here </v>

3473
02:34:55.381 --> 02:34:57.691
<v Speaker 3>and like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>science always surprises you and always </v>

3474
02:34:57.691 --> 02:34:59.560
<v Speaker 3>the things that you like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something to predict.</v>

3475
02:34:59.980 --> 02:35:04.980
<v Speaker 3>So completely the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's something always </v>

3476
02:35:04.980 --> 02:35:04.980
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're always,</v>

3477
02:35:04.980 --> 02:35:05.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as humans,</v>

3478
02:35:05.201 --> 02:35:07.000
<v Speaker 3>we think we know biology and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3479
02:35:07.060 --> 02:35:12.060
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be predicted to be that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden it's complete </v>

3480
02:35:12.060 --> 02:35:12.060
<v Speaker 3>opposite and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>

3481
02:35:12.060 --> 02:35:15.130
<v Speaker 3>The time you come on the podcast though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm reminded of the fact there's so much</v>

3482
02:35:15.131 --> 02:35:20.131
<v Speaker 3>data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is impossible to keep it all in your </v>

3483
02:35:20.131 --> 02:35:23.071
<v Speaker 3>head and especially for one person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do dealing with all these different </v>

3484
02:35:23.071 --> 02:35:23.590
<v Speaker 3>fields,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different,</v>

3485
02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:29.040
<v Speaker 3>different scientists working on all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different studies and it's almost </v>

3486
02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:31.480
<v Speaker 3>impossible for one person to have all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this data in their head.</v>

3487
02:35:31.870 --> 02:35:32.770
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

3488
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:36.910
<v Speaker 3>but it's interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>

3489
02:35:36.911 --> 02:35:41.911
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievably fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's one of the reasons why boiling </v>

3490
02:35:41.911 --> 02:35:46.111
<v Speaker 3>something down to a clickbait title of </v>
<v Speaker 3>an article is so it's so enticing </v>

3491
02:35:46.111 --> 02:35:46.690
<v Speaker 3>because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3492
02:35:46.691 --> 02:35:49.420
<v Speaker 3>tell me high fat diet kills the mites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

3493
02:35:49.500 --> 02:35:50.590
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on dumb dumb.</v>

3494
02:35:50.591 --> 02:35:53.380
<v Speaker 3>Going back to low fat vitamins give you </v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer vitamins,</v>

3495
02:35:53.381 --> 02:35:55.270
<v Speaker 3>give you a cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to make a headline.</v>

3496
02:35:55.271 --> 02:35:56.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3497
02:35:56.200 --> 02:36:01.200
<v Speaker 3>When you thInk some hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to dig into them and you're </v>

3498
02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:01.200
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

3499
02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:04.690
<v Speaker 3>The sugar industry study was from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>1950 [inaudible] and 19 sixties probably</v>

3500
02:36:04.691 --> 02:36:08.590
<v Speaker 3>pretty difficult to have something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>biased and fraudulent today.</v>

3501
02:36:08.740 --> 02:36:11.650
<v Speaker 3>There was even another one that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>came out recently,</v>

3502
02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:14.440
<v Speaker 3>like we talked about one last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was another one that came out,</v>

3503
02:36:14.750 --> 02:36:17.320
<v Speaker 3>another study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was published in like plcs or</v>

3504
02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:20.440
<v Speaker 3>plus one of those two showing that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3505
02:36:20.441 --> 02:36:21.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suppress data that,</v>

3506
02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:26.320
<v Speaker 3>that refined sugar played a role in </v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer and in heart disease.</v>

3507
02:36:26.770 --> 02:36:27.600
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3508
02:36:27.820 --> 02:36:30.180
<v Speaker 3>and this was the seventies I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3509
02:36:30.190 --> 02:36:34.180
<v Speaker 3>so there's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than one study that have now linked</v>

3510
02:36:34.181 --> 02:36:39.160
<v Speaker 3>them to basically a holding back data </v>
<v Speaker 3>being published.</v>

3511
02:36:39.220 --> 02:36:40.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3512
02:36:40.450 --> 02:36:42.550
<v Speaker 3>so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're one that's definitely,</v>

3513
02:36:42.570 --> 02:36:47.570
<v Speaker 3>I would say pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had someone send me some review </v>

3514
02:36:47.570 --> 02:36:50.311
<v Speaker 3>articles that were basically stating </v>
<v Speaker 3>that refined sugar was not bad and the </v>

3515
02:36:50.311 --> 02:36:53.620
<v Speaker 3>review articles were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're funded by the sugar foundation and</v>

3516
02:36:53.621 --> 02:36:54.250
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3517
02:36:54.251 --> 02:36:55.030
<v Speaker 3>this is the one.</v>

3518
02:36:55.060 --> 02:36:57.890
<v Speaker 3>I usually don't say this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I usually don't say like,</v>

3519
02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:00.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on who funds a study like this,</v>

3520
02:37:00.460 --> 02:37:04.330
<v Speaker 3>the conflicts of interest disclosures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is one time where it's like,</v>

3521
02:37:05.230 --> 02:37:06.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sugar foundation,</v>

3522
02:37:06.221 --> 02:37:11.221
<v Speaker 3>they're just notoriously bad and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>also contrary to everything else has </v>

3523
02:37:11.221 --> 02:37:11.560
<v Speaker 3>been established right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet when you understand,</v>

3524
02:37:11.561 --> 02:37:13.500
<v Speaker 3>it's like when you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I say all those things,</v>

3525
02:37:13.501 --> 02:37:18.501
<v Speaker 3>the mechanism and you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction between foods and how the </v>

3526
02:37:18.501 --> 02:37:22.481
<v Speaker 3>body is processing these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you look at the observational data </v>

3527
02:37:22.481 --> 02:37:23.180
<v Speaker 3>and controlled trials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3528
02:37:23.570 --> 02:37:26.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many things can you say,</v>

3529
02:37:26.510 --> 02:37:28.250
<v Speaker 3>you know no to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you just,</v>

3530
02:37:28.251 --> 02:37:31.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just looking at one thing there,</v>

3531
02:37:31.340 --> 02:37:32.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not as strong.</v>

3532
02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:36.140
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at all of it is the big picture.</v>

3533
02:37:36.450 --> 02:37:40.100
<v Speaker 3>There's just so much money in sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many things have sugar in them.</v>

3534
02:37:40.430 --> 02:37:40.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3535
02:37:40.841 --> 02:37:45.841
<v Speaker 3>what we've allowed to have done in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country is literally allowed this one </v>

3536
02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:49.010
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one substance to be in.</v>

3537
02:37:49.050 --> 02:37:50.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what percentage of our food do you think</v>

3538
02:37:50.901 --> 02:37:52.810
<v Speaker 3>has sugar in it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had,</v>

3539
02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:58.440
<v Speaker 3>if you go to a restaurant or you go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get some condiments or food.</v>

3540
02:37:59.390 --> 02:38:00.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean those things.</v>

3541
02:38:00.300 --> 02:38:00.850
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3542
02:38:00.860 --> 02:38:03.490
<v Speaker 3>it's slipped in everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like thai food or you know,</v>

3543
02:38:03.491 --> 02:38:05.420
<v Speaker 3>it's like you go and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh this tastes sweet,</v>

3544
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:08.690
<v Speaker 3>like sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got sugar in it,</v>

3545
02:38:08.750 --> 02:38:10.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it certainly.</v>

3546
02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:13.660
<v Speaker 3>But that's almost acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like I get what you're doing,</v>

3547
02:38:13.940 --> 02:38:16.940
<v Speaker 5>make something taste delicious because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're an artist,</v>

3548
02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:22.160
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're cooking a meal and the meal is </v>

3549
02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:22.160
<v Speaker 5>not just nutritious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all supposed to.</v>

3550
02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:26.221
<v Speaker 5>Supposed to be a delight to the census </v>
<v Speaker 5>data kind of get,</v>

3551
02:38:27.260 --> 02:38:32.260
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what I don't get is that it's </v>

3552
02:38:32.260 --> 02:38:35.600
<v Speaker 5>permeated our entire diet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The average american diet.</v>

3553
02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:37.220
<v Speaker 5>it's at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's in everything.</v>

3554
02:38:37.221 --> 02:38:40.310
<v Speaker 5>It's in the drinks we drink,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's in the foods we eat,</v>

3555
02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:42.860
<v Speaker 5>the bread that you consume,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's in the pasta,</v>

3556
02:38:42.861 --> 02:38:45.520
<v Speaker 5>it's spaghetti sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's in me.</v>

3557
02:38:46.100 --> 02:38:51.100
<v Speaker 5>It's in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you go down the aisle at a </v>

3558
02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:53.240
<v Speaker 5>supermarket and just grab a random cam </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

3559
02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:54.890
<v Speaker 5>grab it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>turn it,</v>

3560
02:38:55.130 --> 02:38:59.360
<v Speaker 5>you're going to recheck her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna see it much more often than</v>

3561
02:38:59.361 --> 02:39:00.500
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3562
02:39:00.770 --> 02:39:01.490
<v Speaker 5>Stunning.</v>

3563
02:39:01.590 --> 02:39:03.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now that happened to me not long ago</v>

3564
02:39:03.961 --> 02:39:06.480
<v Speaker 3>when like sent dan to the store to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

3565
02:39:06.481 --> 02:39:09.120
<v Speaker 3>like some kind of like I was wanting </v>
<v Speaker 3>some wishes.</v>

3566
02:39:09.121 --> 02:39:14.121
<v Speaker 3>Her sauce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for my steak for some reason I was </v>

3567
02:39:14.121 --> 02:39:14.121
<v Speaker 3>like having a stylistic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3568
02:39:14.121 --> 02:39:17.070
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh I can't eat the sugar in it.</v>

3569
02:39:17.690 --> 02:39:19.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your sheer sauce?</v>

3570
02:39:19.021 --> 02:39:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Tastes like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does it have sugar?</v>

3571
02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:23.880
<v Speaker 3>Because it take more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tastes more like shit if it didn't,</v>

3572
02:39:23.940 --> 02:39:25.530
<v Speaker 3>it it for whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3573
02:39:25.531 --> 02:39:30.531
<v Speaker 3>It's something that I ate as like a girl</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had this craving for it and </v>

3574
02:39:30.531 --> 02:39:32.040
<v Speaker 3>received another kid to maybe it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like more common.</v>

3575
02:39:32.041 --> 02:39:34.160
<v Speaker 3>We were young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so because it's really easy.</v>

3576
02:39:34.210 --> 02:39:35.970
<v Speaker 3>It's not as common anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3577
02:39:35.971 --> 02:39:37.800
<v Speaker 3>You never even hear about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3578
02:39:37.801 --> 02:39:41.010
<v Speaker 3>my kids don't even know what my kid </v>
<v Speaker 3>loves cholula.</v>

3579
02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:42.360
<v Speaker 3>It's probably got sugar in it.</v>

3580
02:39:43.380 --> 02:39:45.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that one does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually I think about that might be one</v>

3581
02:39:45.631 --> 02:39:49.200
<v Speaker 3>of the better ones is my seven year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking love cholula.</v>

3582
02:39:49.201 --> 02:39:51.360
<v Speaker 3>She puts it in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She put it in milk.</v>

3583
02:39:51.850 --> 02:39:54.360
<v Speaker 3>We to tell her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop doing that is so gross.</v>

3584
02:39:55.950 --> 02:39:58.500
<v Speaker 3>She thinks it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'll squared it right at our tongue,</v>

3585
02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:00.780
<v Speaker 3>so let's shake it right or wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She loves it.</v>

3586
02:40:00.810 --> 02:40:02.400
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't no sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3588
02:40:03.330 --> 02:40:06.030
<v Speaker 3>That's got something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll probably get some weird red dye.</v>

3589
02:40:06.060 --> 02:40:08.010
<v Speaker 3>It's probably not even really read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably brown.</v>

3590
02:40:08.370 --> 02:40:10.920
<v Speaker 3>I think if people are going to eat sugar</v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

3591
02:40:11.220 --> 02:40:14.130
<v Speaker 3>the one thing they should do is eat it </v>
<v Speaker 3>within a time window.</v>

3592
02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:15.570
<v Speaker 4>What's in there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

3593
02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:16.840

<v Speaker 4>gold,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Xantham gum.</v>

3597
02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:24.540

<v Speaker 4>Susan seem that bad,</v>

3598
02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:30.560
<v Speaker 4>but xantham gum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But some of the other emulsifiers have </v>

3599
02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:35.050
<v Speaker 4>been shown to also disrupt the </v>
<v Speaker 4>microbiome of course by.</v>

3604
02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:46.170
<v Speaker 4>drink sugar probably.</v>

<v Speaker 4>like different things to see what they </v>

3657
02:43:06.190 --> 02:43:06.190
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3658
02:43:06.190 --> 02:43:10.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it seems like gymnastics is her </v>

3659
02:43:10.250 --> 02:43:10.250
<v Speaker 4>big one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kids,</v>

3660
02:43:10.250 --> 02:43:12.160
<v Speaker 4>little girls love other things where </v>
<v Speaker 4>other little girls are also</v>

3661
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:13.310
<v Speaker 2>being active,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3662
02:43:13.330 --> 02:43:15.250
<v Speaker 2>so gymnastics is a good one because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3663
02:43:15.251 --> 02:43:17.860
<v Speaker 2>they're all doing their tumbling and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there I did that one.</v>

3664
02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:20.890
<v Speaker 2>I think it'S really good for body </v>
<v Speaker 2>control too,</v>

3665
02:43:20.891 --> 02:43:25.891
<v Speaker 2>and I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was talking to her like she likes </v>

3666
02:43:25.891 --> 02:43:27.010
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu and she likes gymnastics too and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3667
02:43:27.011 --> 02:43:32.011
<v Speaker 2>well they really help each other because</v>
<v Speaker 2>your jujitsu will benefit greatly from </v>

3668
02:43:32.011 --> 02:43:35.260
<v Speaker 2>your body control that you get from like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to move your body,</v>

3669
02:43:35.261 --> 02:43:39.410
<v Speaker 2>like do backflips and stands and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just also just the,</v>

3670
02:43:39.430 --> 02:43:43.810
<v Speaker 2>the balance and the ability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the dexterity that you get.</v>

3671
02:43:44.180 --> 02:43:45.440
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3672
02:43:45.560 --> 02:43:47.900
<v Speaker 3>I started ice skating when I was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>young too,</v>

3673
02:43:47.901 --> 02:43:52.901
<v Speaker 3>and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom started when I was two and a </v>

3674
02:43:52.901 --> 02:43:52.901
<v Speaker 3>half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3675
02:43:52.901 --> 02:43:56.020
<v Speaker 3>So I started asking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was two and a half and that also is </v>

3676
02:43:56.020 --> 02:43:58.391
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of balance and more very </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar to like ballet too or just </v>

3677
02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:00.500
<v Speaker 3>graceful sort of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3678
02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:05.950
<v Speaker 3>it really I think helped me with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>variety of other sports I did later </v>

3679
02:44:05.950 --> 02:44:06.950
<v Speaker 3>surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Surfing was,</v>

3680
02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:10.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot more graceful dance like you still</v>

3681
02:44:10.731 --> 02:44:12.480
<v Speaker 3>serve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

3682
02:44:12.610 --> 02:44:15.560
<v Speaker 3>haven't served since prepregnancy yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would worry about sharks.</v>

3683
02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:21.040
<v Speaker 3>You're a mommy now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't eaten getting more concerned </v>

3684
02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:21.380
<v Speaker 3>about sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot what those things.</v>

3685
02:44:21.410 --> 02:44:23.120
<v Speaker 3>The last thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is something.</v>

3686
02:44:23.121 --> 02:44:24.110
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3687
02:44:24.111 --> 02:44:25.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting a lot more worried about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

3688
02:44:26.110 --> 02:44:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that video of the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was swimming?</v>

3689
02:44:28.271 --> 02:44:33.271
<v Speaker 2>He was underwater scuba diving and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shark came from behind him and bumped </v>

3690
02:44:33.271 --> 02:44:33.271
<v Speaker 2>him in the head.</v>

3691
02:44:33.510 --> 02:44:35.520
<v Speaker 3>But you showed me the start for one on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that freaked me out.</v>

3692
02:44:35.730 --> 02:44:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Or the woman goes surfing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shop is right next to them.</v>

3693
02:44:38.490 --> 02:44:43.490
<v Speaker 3>There's so big and all it takes us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're eating machines that </v>

3694
02:44:43.490 --> 02:44:43.490
<v Speaker 3>takes us.</v>

3695
02:44:43.490 --> 02:44:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Look at this sky is underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Check this out.</v>

3696
02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put that again because it didn't.</v>

3697
02:44:47.570 --> 02:44:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Is that a great white?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing's is huge.</v>

3698
02:44:49.341 --> 02:44:49.900
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>look.</v>

3699
02:44:50.630 --> 02:44:51.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>

3700
02:44:51.590 --> 02:44:54.020
<v Speaker 2>He opens his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hit him in the head.</v>

3701
02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:59.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean that thing easily could have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where is this somewhere you shouldn't </v>

3702
02:44:59.680 --> 02:44:59.680
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

3703
02:45:00.510 --> 02:45:02.400
<v Speaker 3>That's the carry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

3704
02:45:02.401 --> 02:45:04.050
<v Speaker 3>So do you do like snorkeling or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything?</v>

3705
02:45:04.660 --> 02:45:07.170
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was terrified.</v>

3706
02:45:07.660 --> 02:45:08.140
<v Speaker 3>This one</v>

3707
02:45:08.140 --> 02:45:13.140
<v Speaker 2>cool thing where we were on the Big </v>
<v Speaker 2>island last year and they take you out </v>

3708
02:45:13.630 --> 02:45:18.630
<v Speaker 2>to where the dolphIns are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like fine schools of dolphins </v>

3709
02:45:18.630 --> 02:45:18.640
<v Speaker 2>and they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the dolphins are in the area,</v>

3710
02:45:18.700 --> 02:45:21.100
<v Speaker 2>they'll take you out on the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find out where the dolphins are,</v>

3711
02:45:21.101 --> 02:45:26.101
<v Speaker 2>they spot them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you jump in the water and you </v>

3712
02:45:26.101 --> 02:45:26.101
<v Speaker 2>snorkel with the dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3713
02:45:26.101 --> 02:45:27.850
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were they friendly?</v>

3714
02:45:27.860 --> 02:45:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Did they come up to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't give a fuck about you.</v>

3715
02:45:30.310 --> 02:45:32.680
<v Speaker 2>That's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dolphins are really smart.</v>

3716
02:45:32.860 --> 02:45:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they're.</v>

3717
02:45:33.581 --> 02:45:35.830
<v Speaker 2>They're wild dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not like,</v>

3718
02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.220
<v Speaker 2>why do I care about you man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what you're saying.</v>

3719
02:45:39.250 --> 02:45:40.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3720
02:45:40.410 --> 02:45:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Why are you wearing a watch like this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't want to have anything to do with </v>

3721
02:45:45.410 --> 02:45:45.880
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you monitoring your heart rate?</v>

3722
02:45:46.210 --> 02:45:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Just avoid you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just.</v>

3723
02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:51.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy feeling just to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally the middle of the ocean,</v>

3724
02:45:51.641 --> 02:45:54.430
<v Speaker 2>miles from the water or miles from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shore rather,</v>

3725
02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:57.850
<v Speaker 2>and you're just looking down and you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vastness of it all.</v>

3726
02:45:58.060 --> 02:46:03.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why beach communities </v>

3727
02:46:03.060 --> 02:46:05.800
<v Speaker 2>are kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like peaceful.</v>

3728
02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:10.920
<v Speaker 2>They're very mellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it is because you're </v>

3729
02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:12.710
<v Speaker 2>humbled by this gigantic body of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's in your face every day.</v>

3730
02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:16.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's akin to staring up at the stars.</v>

3731
02:46:17.210 --> 02:46:22.210
<v Speaker 2>There's just something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something about the vastness of the </v>

3732
02:46:22.210 --> 02:46:22.210
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so undeniable.</v>

3733
02:46:22.210 --> 02:46:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3734
02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:27.170
<v Speaker 2>your insignificance in the greater </v>
<v Speaker 2>scheme of things is so undeniable that I</v>

3735
02:46:27.171 --> 02:46:32.171
<v Speaker 2>think it chills people out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I think cities make people like </v>

3736
02:46:32.171 --> 02:46:34.360
<v Speaker 2>more like to fucking get over their cars</v>
<v Speaker 2>are in my way,</v>

3737
02:46:34.370 --> 02:46:35.300
<v Speaker 2>get out of my way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitch.</v>

3738
02:46:35.540 --> 02:46:40.540
<v Speaker 2>It's like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your too much of an important factor in </v>

3739
02:46:41.121 --> 02:46:42.320
<v Speaker 2>your immediate world.</v>

3740
02:46:42.410 --> 02:46:45.620
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why I was really drawn to</v>
<v Speaker 1>surfing in the first place.</v>

3741
02:46:45.621 --> 02:46:49.880
<v Speaker 1>It's because I'm a really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gogo gogo kind of go get her constantly,</v>

3742
02:46:49.881 --> 02:46:50.540
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next.</v>

3743
02:46:50.541 --> 02:46:54.200
<v Speaker 1>What's next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing and being out in the water was</v>

3744
02:46:54.201 --> 02:46:59.201
<v Speaker 1>the one place that I would put all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind and I would chill,</v>

3745
02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:04.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I felt really good just sitting on </v>

3746
02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:06.941
<v Speaker 1>my board and having the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I wasn't thinking about the </v>

3747
02:47:06.941 --> 02:47:08.300
<v Speaker 1>sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just having the water on me and just</v>

3748
02:47:08.301 --> 02:47:10.510
<v Speaker 1>sitting out there and watching the waves</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3749
02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:11.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly,</v>

3750
02:47:11.570 --> 02:47:16.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is definitely a very chilling </v>

3751
02:47:16.570 --> 02:47:16.570
<v Speaker 1>factor to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for sure,</v>

3752
02:47:16.570 --> 02:47:17.840
<v Speaker 1>humbling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my goodness.</v>

3753
02:47:17.841 --> 02:47:22.841
<v Speaker 1>Like I still am like terrified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on a big day going out because the </v>

3754
02:47:22.841 --> 02:47:23.630
<v Speaker 1>oceans is really scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3755
02:47:23.631 --> 02:47:26.060
<v Speaker 1>aside from the sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like waves are freaking scary.</v>

3756
02:47:26.061 --> 02:47:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Just the power of them around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3757
02:47:28.791 --> 02:47:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I've had um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've had some scary.</v>

3758
02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:34.370
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get back in after that but,</v>

3759
02:47:34.810 --> 02:47:38.450
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's so powerful,</v>

3760
02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:39.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3761
02:47:39.650 --> 02:47:41.240
<v Speaker 1>where it's just slamming you down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing</v>

3762
02:47:41.340 --> 02:47:43.290
<v Speaker 4>donuts and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>

3763
02:47:43.310 --> 02:47:46.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even imagine.</v>

3764
02:47:46.370 --> 02:47:47.930
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of those crazy people that get,</v>

3765
02:47:48.710 --> 02:47:51.800
<v Speaker 2>they get dragged out on a boat all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way out</v>

3766
02:47:51.890 --> 02:47:53.840
<v Speaker 4>to your max towing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3767
02:47:53.841 --> 02:47:58.841
<v Speaker 4>They get towed in and then they just </v>
<v Speaker 4>jump on those waves that are 100 feet </v>

3768
02:47:58.841 --> 02:47:58.841
<v Speaker 4>high.</v>

3769
02:47:58.841 --> 02:48:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get sweaty hands when I watch videos </v>

<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

3829
02:50:32.611 --> 02:50:33.780
<v Speaker 3>it's not like your dance you spend.</v>

3830
02:50:33.780 --> 02:50:34.860
<v Speaker 3>I tried that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like that.</v>

3831
02:50:35.220 --> 02:50:40.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do a lot of weight lifting type </v>

3832
02:50:40.220 --> 02:50:40.350
<v Speaker 3>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to do more.</v>

3833
02:50:40.351 --> 02:50:41.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have like,</v>

3834
02:50:41.130 --> 02:50:43.740
<v Speaker 3>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a gym membership anymore.</v>

3835
02:50:43.790 --> 02:50:48.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I have like weights and I'll do it </v>

3836
02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:48.790
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3837
02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:51.171
<v Speaker 3>at my place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I haven't been doing as much of the </v>

3838
02:50:51.171 --> 02:50:54.510
<v Speaker 3>strength training as I should because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's also extremely beneficial.</v>

3839
02:50:54.570 --> 02:50:56.550
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bone density,</v>

3840
02:50:56.551 --> 02:50:59.370
<v Speaker 3>it's big one density,</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle mass.</v>

3841
02:50:59.371 --> 02:51:02.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean like there's been studies showing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people that do strength training,</v>

3842
02:51:02.780 --> 02:51:07.780
<v Speaker 3>like they have a 23 percent lower all </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause mortality and like a 30 percent </v>

3843
02:51:07.780 --> 02:51:11.721
<v Speaker 3>lower cancer related mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>independent of any other health factors </v>

3844
02:51:11.721 --> 02:51:14.350
<v Speaker 3>like obesity and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So um,</v>

3845
02:51:14.370 --> 02:51:19.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the muscle mass is another thing that's </v>

3846
02:51:19.370 --> 02:51:21.831
<v Speaker 3>really important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact there was also another </v>

3847
02:51:21.831 --> 02:51:23.010
<v Speaker 3>interesting study showing that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that had lake strength,</v>

3848
02:51:23.011 --> 02:51:28.011
<v Speaker 3>like their leg strength was correlated </v>
<v Speaker 3>to like massive improvements in </v>

3849
02:51:28.011 --> 02:51:28.011
<v Speaker 3>cognitive function.</v>

3850
02:51:29.100 --> 02:51:31.610
<v Speaker 3>Legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not arms but only the legs.</v>

3851
02:51:31.611 --> 02:51:35.370
<v Speaker 3>So there are various,</v>
<v Speaker 3>various different exercises we're done,</v>

3852
02:51:35.371 --> 02:51:38.280
<v Speaker 3>like hand grip strength and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was leg strength specifically.</v>

3853
02:51:38.580 --> 02:51:41.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's like something </v>
<v Speaker 3>bloodflow something about your,</v>

3854
02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:47.360
<v Speaker 3>how strong your legs are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is somehow somehow indicative of blood </v>

3855
02:51:47.360 --> 02:51:49.860
<v Speaker 3>flow to the brain are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So dudes who do squats are jesus.</v>

3856
02:51:50.070 --> 02:51:52.110
<v Speaker 3>If you know anybody who does a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>squads go to them.</v>

3857
02:51:52.230 --> 02:51:53.550
<v Speaker 3>So I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do air squats,</v>

3858
02:51:54.270 --> 02:51:55.590
<v Speaker 3>body weight squats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3859
02:51:55.620 --> 02:51:56.730
<v Speaker 3>I do those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

3860
02:51:56.770 --> 02:52:01.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do the hindi are ones where you come up </v>

3861
02:52:01.770 --> 02:52:04.100
<v Speaker 3>on the ball of your foot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you kind of jump as well?</v>

3862
02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:06.050
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do</v>

3863
02:52:06.120 --> 02:52:07.150
<v Speaker 4>squats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

3864
02:52:07.180 --> 02:52:08.180
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3865
02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:13.870
<v Speaker 4>I could do it for you real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Essentially you start off like this and </v>

3866
02:52:13.961 --> 02:52:18.961
<v Speaker 4>then as you go down your heels come up </v>
<v Speaker 4>off the ground like this and then your </v>

3867
02:52:19.391 --> 02:52:21.940
<v Speaker 4>hand touches the floor and then you come</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

3868
02:52:22.300 --> 02:52:27.300
<v Speaker 4>And what it really does is it works the </v>
<v Speaker 4>quadriceps really well around the knees </v>

3869
02:52:27.300 --> 02:52:31.110
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of people find it to be an </v>
<v Speaker 4>excellent stability exercise called.</v>

3870
02:52:31.330 --> 02:52:32.880
<v Speaker 4>What do they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hindu squeegees.</v>

3871
02:52:33.010 --> 02:52:33.970
<v Speaker 4>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's going to do it.</v>

3872
02:52:34.010 --> 02:52:36.880
<v Speaker 4>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see how's he's going up on his heels.</v>

3873
02:52:36.940 --> 02:52:39.070
<v Speaker 4>This is like part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He dropped down.</v>

3874
02:52:39.071 --> 02:52:42.550
<v Speaker 4>Your heels come up and then as you press</v>
<v Speaker 4>up when he's not,</v>

3875
02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:44.500
<v Speaker 4>he's not dropping his heels as he comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

3876
02:52:44.501 --> 02:52:46.300
<v Speaker 4>which I think is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

3877
02:52:46.301 --> 02:52:51.301
<v Speaker 4>I think he's doing a kind of a Variation</v>
<v Speaker 4>on hindu squats because his heels are </v>

3878
02:52:51.301 --> 02:52:51.301
<v Speaker 4>never coming down.</v>

3879
02:52:51.301 --> 02:52:53.860
<v Speaker 4>He's also wearing raised heel shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I don't agree with.</v>

3880
02:52:53.910 --> 02:52:55.390
<v Speaker 4>Your heels come all the way down when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you come up.</v>

3881
02:52:55.720 --> 02:52:57.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3882
02:52:57.280 --> 02:52:58.900
<v Speaker 4>Once you go heels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go all the way down.</v>

3883
02:52:59.080 --> 02:53:01.330
<v Speaker 4>See if you can find someone who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't.</v>

3884
02:53:01.430 --> 02:53:03.910
<v Speaker 4>Those shoes are not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those aren't wise.</v>

3885
02:53:04.150 --> 02:53:06.460
<v Speaker 4>Those shoes were invented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those kind of shoes are.</v>

3886
02:53:06.461 --> 02:53:11.461
<v Speaker 4>Those are running shoes that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>invented back when nike came up with </v>

3887
02:53:11.461 --> 02:53:13.210
<v Speaker 4>them where you land on the heel instead </v>
<v Speaker 4>of landing on the ball of the foot,</v>

3888
02:53:13.211 --> 02:53:16.120
<v Speaker 4>which the way your foot is naturally </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to absorb shock,</v>

3889
02:53:16.680 --> 02:53:17.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

3890
02:53:17.190 --> 02:53:18.580
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you know about all that.</v>

3891
02:53:18.610 --> 02:53:20.710
<v Speaker 4>We're nike sort of changed the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3892
02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:25.760
<v Speaker 4>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nike literally changed the way people </v>

3893
02:53:25.760 --> 02:53:27.991
<v Speaker 4>run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put this big fat heel and the back </v>

3894
02:53:27.991 --> 02:53:28.540
<v Speaker 4>of your sneaker and people started </v>
<v Speaker 4>running on the heel.</v>

3895
02:53:28.541 --> 02:53:29.800
<v Speaker 4>Instead of running on the ball of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>foot.</v>

3896
02:53:30.010 --> 02:53:33.040
<v Speaker 4>When you land on the ball of your foot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your foot is a natural shock absorber,</v>

3897
02:53:33.610 --> 02:53:38.610
<v Speaker 4>and what they did was made people run </v>
<v Speaker 4>with their heel first lifted fight.</v>

3898
02:53:39.250 --> 02:53:41.380
<v Speaker 4>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's terrible for your knees.</v>

3899
02:53:41.381 --> 02:53:45.190
<v Speaker 4>It's terrible for a lot of things and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people develop all sorts of issues.</v>

3900
02:53:45.610 --> 02:53:50.610
<v Speaker 4>You run into that with running long </v>
<v Speaker 4>distances and knee problems because I'm </v>

3901
02:53:50.610 --> 02:53:53.200
<v Speaker 4>sure I used to be a jump rope or I was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>professional drunk.</v>

3902
02:53:53.201 --> 02:53:55.260
<v Speaker 4>Proper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you professional jump roper,</v>

3903
02:53:55.280 --> 02:53:57.330
<v Speaker 4>I want to get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well we,</v>

3904
02:53:57.350 --> 02:54:02.350
<v Speaker 4>we got um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were sponsored by like the american </v>

3905
02:54:02.350 --> 02:54:02.350
<v Speaker 4>heart association really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had like,</v>

3906
02:54:02.350 --> 02:54:03.760
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>donations and stuff.</v>

3907
02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:04.770
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3908
02:54:04.850 --> 02:54:09.850
<v Speaker 4>so I started jumping rope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called the international rope </v>

3909
02:54:09.850 --> 02:54:09.850
<v Speaker 4>skipping organization at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

3910
02:54:09.850 --> 02:54:14.640
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called like the universal </v>
<v Speaker 4>universal rope skipping organization </v>

3911
02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:14.640
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was,</v>

3912
02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:18.600
<v Speaker 4>I would compete so we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd go every year and compete with </v>

3913
02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:18.600
<v Speaker 4>other teams from around the world.</v>

3914
02:54:18.970 --> 02:54:21.810
<v Speaker 4>I would travel to other places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other parts of the u,</v>

3915
02:54:21.811 --> 02:54:26.811
<v Speaker 4>s and setup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do demonstrations in schools inside of </v>

3916
02:54:26.811 --> 02:54:26.811
<v Speaker 4>teams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

3917
02:54:26.811 --> 02:54:29.190
<v Speaker 4>I was really good and I can still jump </v>
<v Speaker 4>rope like I could do next.</v>

3918
02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:33.120
<v Speaker 4>Like next time I see you like jump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you have a jump rope or if I can</v>

3919
02:54:33.130 --> 02:54:35.470
<v Speaker 4>remember to bring one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'll bring one for you next time.</v>

3920
02:54:35.500 --> 02:54:37.810
<v Speaker 4>Next time you get to do two things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to try out the tank.</v>

3921
02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:42.840
<v Speaker 4>Coming here early.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll set you up with the isolation </v>

3922
02:54:42.840 --> 02:54:42.840
<v Speaker 4>tank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll do a sauna.</v>

3923
02:54:42.840 --> 02:54:44.830
<v Speaker 4>We should do a podcast on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be awesome.</v>

3924
02:54:44.831 --> 02:54:46.660
<v Speaker 4>We're going to start doing that because </v>
<v Speaker 4>we have the sauna here.</v>

3925
02:54:46.661 --> 02:54:49.310
<v Speaker 4>We're going to do a little podcast last </v>
<v Speaker 4>long.</v>

3926
02:54:49.370 --> 02:54:54.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the heat with the recording equipment </v>

3927
02:54:54.370 --> 02:54:54.370
<v Speaker 4>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it breaks it breaks.</v>

3928
02:54:54.370 --> 02:54:58.280
<v Speaker 4>I just like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's more new interesting stuff on </v>

3929
02:54:58.280 --> 02:55:01.141
<v Speaker 4>the sauna like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love to talk to you about like </v>

3930
02:55:01.141 --> 02:55:01.930
<v Speaker 4>new studies coming out and so next one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Next one.</v>

3931
02:55:02.350 --> 02:55:04.070
<v Speaker 4>Scheduled a couple of from now and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>the jump rope.</v>

3932
02:55:04.610 --> 02:55:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Jump rope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jumping on the balls of your feet.</v>

3933
02:55:06.351 --> 02:55:07.580
<v Speaker 2>That was the point as I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3934
02:55:07.581 --> 02:55:10.220
<v Speaker 2>if you jumped on the heels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was awful.</v>

3935
02:55:10.221 --> 02:55:12.410
<v Speaker 2>It was like sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would imagine it'd be teRrible,</v>

3936
02:55:12.590 --> 02:55:15.620
<v Speaker 2>but when you look at a running shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think of an average running shoe.</v>

3937
02:55:15.621 --> 02:55:17.960
<v Speaker 2>The average running shoe has a lifted </v>
<v Speaker 2>heel.</v>

3938
02:55:18.170 --> 02:55:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Now people are understanding that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is negative and this is bad for you,</v>

3939
02:55:21.951 --> 02:55:24.680
<v Speaker 2>so you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see what are called zero drop shoes,</v>

3940
02:55:24.730 --> 02:55:28.790
<v Speaker 2>like the vibrams or minimal issues as </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I run in.</v>

3941
02:55:28.791 --> 02:55:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I run in either a vibrams or running </v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

3942
02:55:31.660 --> 02:55:35.060
<v Speaker 2>I have some murals that are running into</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what they're essentially they have a</v>

3943
02:55:35.061 --> 02:55:36.400
<v Speaker 2>wide toe box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're,</v>

3944
02:55:36.460 --> 02:55:39.650
<v Speaker 2>you're toast splay out and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost no padding.</v>

3945
02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:44.680
<v Speaker 2>There's is very little bad before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just enough of a hard cover to keep</v>

3946
02:55:46.161 --> 02:55:49.670
<v Speaker 2>you from getting cut from like rocks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

3947
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:53.470
<v Speaker 2>So that for me is when I tried them out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was running on hard concrete who um,</v>

3948
02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:58.600
<v Speaker 2>it was like I was running around this </v>
<v Speaker 2>lake because I lived in oakland at the </v>

3949
02:55:58.600 --> 02:55:59.300
<v Speaker 2>time and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I didn't really like it.</v>

3950
02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Were you running on the heels of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>feet out all your calls?</v>

3951
02:56:01.830 --> 02:56:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too much.</v>

3952
02:56:03.510 --> 02:56:08.510
<v Speaker 2>It's too much because of the concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think even that is okay if you </v>

3953
02:56:08.510 --> 02:56:09.840
<v Speaker 2>build up to build up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

3954
02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:13.490
<v Speaker 2>but you develop your foot strength </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes radically.</v>

3955
02:56:13.580 --> 02:56:18.580
<v Speaker 2>So maybe I'll get some again and try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to go slow because we'll be </v>

3956
02:56:18.580 --> 02:56:18.580
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a lot easier to.</v>

3957
02:56:18.580 --> 02:56:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I run the beach and those when I'm on </v>

3958
02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:23.560
<v Speaker 2>vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll run with a minimal shoes,</v>

3959
02:56:23.570 --> 02:56:28.570
<v Speaker 2>but when you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to build up to it because you </v>

3960
02:56:28.570 --> 02:56:32.021
<v Speaker 2>can get plantar fasciitis where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>start really destroying the bottom of </v>

3961
02:56:32.021 --> 02:56:32.780
<v Speaker 2>your feet are very common.</v>

3962
02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:37.840
<v Speaker 2>So what do you mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just don't run as long distance or </v>

3963
02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:37.840
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take your time.</v>

3964
02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like the vibrams.</v>

3965
02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:43.440
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got in trouble because they were </v>

3966
02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:45.410
<v Speaker 2>telling people that their shoes can </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevent injury and strengthen your feet,</v>

3967
02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:47.780
<v Speaker 2>which they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it takes a long time.</v>

3968
02:56:47.960 --> 02:56:50.420
<v Speaker 2>So what would happen is people would </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3969
02:56:50.421 --> 02:56:50.800
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

3970
02:56:50.820 --> 02:56:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Use these shoes going to prevent injury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

3971
02:56:52.581 --> 02:56:55.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm injured because they would feed a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

3972
02:56:55.880 --> 02:57:00.230
<v Speaker 2>The idea is that your feet in regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoes are essentially like in a cast.</v>

3973
02:57:00.700 --> 02:57:02.030
<v Speaker 2>This is what your feet are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3974
02:57:02.031 --> 02:57:04.280
<v Speaker 2>you're relying on the structure of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoe.</v>

3975
02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:09.520
<v Speaker 2>It's tightening up around your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a nice fat cushion to the </v>

3976
02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:13.151
<v Speaker 2>bottom of it and you're using minimal </v>
<v Speaker 2>musculature of your toes and all of the </v>

3977
02:57:13.401 --> 02:57:18.401
<v Speaker 2>different fee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not articulating everything is </v>

3978
02:57:18.401 --> 02:57:21.791
<v Speaker 2>individual joints and pushing with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the muscles and so when you switched </v>

3979
02:57:22.371 --> 02:57:24.190
<v Speaker 2>from a thick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat running shoe,</v>

3980
02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:29.200
<v Speaker 2>like a vibrams five finger this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely a adoptation curve </v>

3981
02:57:29.890 --> 02:57:31.200
<v Speaker 2>and you have to be careful with that.</v>

3982
02:57:31.420 --> 02:57:36.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly think because when I was </v>

3983
02:57:36.420 --> 02:57:36.420
<v Speaker 2>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was running long distances.</v>

3984
02:57:36.420 --> 02:57:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't ease into it at all either and </v>

3985
02:57:40.240 --> 02:57:43.211
<v Speaker 2>I was doing it on concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend neil brennan got plantar </v>

3986
02:57:43.211 --> 02:57:45.020
<v Speaker 2>fasciitis from running on a treadmill in</v>
<v Speaker 2>with vibrams.</v>

3987
02:57:45.021 --> 02:57:47.960
<v Speaker 2>YeAh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's running on treadmills as well.</v>

3988
02:57:48.800 --> 02:57:50.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3989
02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:51.580
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3990
02:57:51.710 --> 02:57:52.500
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3991
02:57:52.520 --> 02:57:54.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just got too crazy with it.</v>

3992
02:57:54.100 --> 02:57:55.730
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of obsessive person.</v>

3993
02:57:55.731 --> 02:57:57.050
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got into it and he's like,</v>

3994
02:57:57.051 --> 02:57:58.040
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing.</v>

3995
02:57:58.050 --> 02:58:00.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do this now in Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few mIles.</v>

3996
02:58:00.051 --> 02:58:02.070
<v Speaker 2>And he blew himself out like right</v>

3997
02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:03.430
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He fucked up his feet.</v>

3998
02:58:03.840 --> 02:58:05.190
<v Speaker 5>You reverse that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3999
02:58:05.191 --> 02:58:06.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It takes a while to heal though.</v>

4000
02:58:06.601 --> 02:58:11.601
<v Speaker 5>It's a very painful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know quite a few people that have </v>

4001
02:58:11.601 --> 02:58:11.601
<v Speaker 5>gotten plantar fasciitis and you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4002
02:58:11.601 --> 02:58:12.390
<v Speaker 5>you get out of bed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he could barely walk.</v>

4003
02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:13.860
<v Speaker 5>I think my mother in law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How to.</v>

4004
02:58:13.960 --> 02:58:14.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's rough.</v>

4005
02:58:15.030 --> 02:58:16.230
<v Speaker 5>It's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

4006
02:58:16.231 --> 02:58:16.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't.</v>

4007
02:58:17.280 --> 02:58:19.920
<v Speaker 5>Luckily I've done martial arts my whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

4008
02:58:19.930 --> 02:58:20.430
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my feet.</v>

4009
02:58:20.460 --> 02:58:25.460
<v Speaker 5>My feet are pretty strong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I noticed a big difference between </v>

4010
02:58:25.460 --> 02:58:30.350
<v Speaker 5>running with minimal minimalistic shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean just my feet just feel stronger </v>

4011
02:58:30.350 --> 02:58:31.290
<v Speaker 5>or they just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they feel different.</v>

4012
02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:32.880
<v Speaker 5>They feel different when I'm walking </v>
<v Speaker 5>around.</v>

4013
02:58:32.881 --> 02:58:35.610
<v Speaker 5>My archers raised up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always had flat feet.</v>

4014
02:58:35.940 --> 02:58:39.420
<v Speaker 5>My arches have actually gotten higher </v>
<v Speaker 5>and like my,</v>

4015
02:58:39.421 --> 02:58:44.421
<v Speaker 5>just the overall dexterity in my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One place where I really feel it is in </v>

4016
02:58:44.421 --> 02:58:45.630
<v Speaker 5>yoga and notice a big difference in </v>
<v Speaker 5>yoga.</v>

4017
02:58:45.631 --> 02:58:47.250
<v Speaker 5>I have just more foot strength.</v>

4018
02:58:47.900 --> 02:58:52.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rebrand was again throughout my </v>

4019
02:58:52.900 --> 02:58:54.761
<v Speaker 3>other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my feet are like bigger now after </v>

4020
02:58:54.761 --> 02:58:54.761
<v Speaker 3>pregnancy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's funny.</v>

4021
02:58:54.761 --> 02:58:57.310
<v Speaker 3>Like it stretches your feet out abbott,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's like,</v>

4022
02:58:57.520 --> 02:58:58.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's a cannon</v>

4023
02:58:58.940 --> 02:59:00.320
<v Speaker 5>to a weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4024
02:59:00.520 --> 02:59:05.520
<v Speaker 5>Because you think it about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have all this extra weight in your </v>

4025
02:59:05.520 --> 02:59:07.721
<v Speaker 5>body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're carrying around your feet and </v>

4026
02:59:07.721 --> 02:59:07.721
<v Speaker 5>your hips and.</v>

4027
02:59:07.721 --> 02:59:07.721
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4028
02:59:07.721 --> 02:59:12.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You definitely have a lot of extra </v>

4029
02:59:12.090 --> 02:59:12.090
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4030
02:59:12.090 --> 02:59:12.090
<v Speaker 3>it seems like it like</v>

4031
02:59:12.090 --> 02:59:14.770
<v Speaker 5>pound vest on your back and you did a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of exercises with a 40 pound best.</v>

4032
02:59:15.090 --> 02:59:16.950
<v Speaker 5>Your bones are going to get more dense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4033
02:59:17.570 --> 02:59:19.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to know.</v>

4034
02:59:19.401 --> 02:59:19.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

4035
02:59:19.941 --> 02:59:23.030
<v Speaker 3>I know certainly my feet were bigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>during pregnancy because of the swelling</v>

4036
02:59:23.031 --> 02:59:23.530
<v Speaker 3>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

4037
02:59:23.710 --> 02:59:26.900
<v Speaker 3>but I'm four months out and my feet are </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely bigger.</v>

4038
02:59:26.990 --> 02:59:30.780
<v Speaker 3>Are they longer and wider?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wider there?</v>

4039
02:59:30.810 --> 02:59:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Probably you have more meat in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>foot.</v>

4040
02:59:33.670 --> 02:59:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Wider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was shocked.</v>

4041
02:59:35.300 --> 02:59:40.300
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pair of shoes that I'm supposed to </v>

4042
02:59:40.300 --> 02:59:40.490
<v Speaker 3>fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't fit and it was,</v>

4043
02:59:40.580 --> 02:59:41.750
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4044
02:59:41.780 --> 02:59:44.210
<v Speaker 3>it was too narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet that totally makes sense.</v>

4045
02:59:44.510 --> 02:59:46.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about how much weight did you gain</v>

4046
02:59:46.460 --> 02:59:47.860
<v Speaker 3>you allowed to ask gals that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4047
02:59:47.900 --> 02:59:50.150
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I actually lost all the weight,</v>

4048
02:59:50.151 --> 02:59:51.970
<v Speaker 3>so I'm allowed to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

4049
02:59:51.971 --> 02:59:53.330
<v Speaker 3>I've lost a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of it,</v>

4050
02:59:53.331 --> 02:59:54.620
<v Speaker 3>but I still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4051
02:59:54.621 --> 02:59:56.240
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this a little more to me,</v>

4052
02:59:56.241 --> 02:59:59.030
<v Speaker 3>but my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

4053
02:59:59.120 --> 03:00:00.500
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing that we bounced back.</v>

4054
03:00:01.010 --> 03:00:05.150
<v Speaker 3>I gained probably more I would get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say like 30 pounds.</v>

4055
03:00:05.151 --> 03:00:07.880
<v Speaker 3>I gained the close to 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know women to gain 80,</v>

4056
03:00:08.330 --> 03:00:12.880
<v Speaker 3>but I was eating all healthy foods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started out very thin maybe and that,</v>

4057
03:00:12.950 --> 03:00:15.930
<v Speaker 3>so I was talking to my ob gyn about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

4058
03:00:16.190 --> 03:00:20.080
<v Speaker 3>he was telling me that really because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't like look obese or anything.</v>

4059
03:00:20.081 --> 03:00:21.210
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't ambitious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I start,</v>

4060
03:00:21.230 --> 03:00:22.700
<v Speaker 3>when you start off with a starting </v>
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

4061
03:00:22.820 --> 03:00:24.680
<v Speaker 3>your body wants you to gain a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of weight.</v>

4062
03:00:24.740 --> 03:00:29.740
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so my body wanted me to gaIn 50 </v>

4063
03:00:29.740 --> 03:00:32.180
<v Speaker 3>pounds and I had an eight pound 10 ounce</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy and just think about 50 years</v>

4064
03:00:32.190 --> 03:00:37.190
<v Speaker 5>pounds on your back for nine months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course your feet are going to get </v>

4065
03:00:37.190 --> 03:00:37.190
<v Speaker 5>bigger.</v>

4066
03:00:37.190 --> 03:00:38.630
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4067
03:00:38.690 --> 03:00:43.690
<v Speaker 3>It was an interesting study showing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>v max actually improve vo two max </v>

4068
03:00:43.690 --> 03:00:45.230
<v Speaker 3>improves after pregnancy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

4069
03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:50.400
<v Speaker 3>Makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like training in I have a </v>

4070
03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:50.630
<v Speaker 3>bath or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4071
03:00:50.890 --> 03:00:55.890
<v Speaker 5>I have this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called a company called </v>

4072
03:00:55.890 --> 03:00:57.781
<v Speaker 5>outdoorsmen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make a pack that's designed to </v>

4073
03:00:57.781 --> 03:00:58.430
<v Speaker 5>condition people for backpack hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4074
03:00:58.440 --> 03:00:59.530
<v Speaker 5>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go,</v>

4075
03:00:59.531 --> 03:00:59.980
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you</v>

4076
03:01:00.010 --> 03:01:02.950
<v Speaker 2>carry everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He carry your entire camp on your back,</v>

4077
03:01:02.951 --> 03:01:07.330
<v Speaker 2>so you carry your sleeping bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a jet boil.</v>

4078
03:01:07.331 --> 03:01:11.620
<v Speaker 2>One of those tanks that you cook on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you carry all of your equipment,</v>

4079
03:01:11.650 --> 03:01:13.720
<v Speaker 2>you carry everything that you ate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all your food.</v>

4080
03:01:14.140 --> 03:01:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4081
03:01:14.531 --> 03:01:17.560
<v Speaker 2>you could carry as much when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're wearing a backpack,</v>

4082
03:01:17.561 --> 03:01:20.650
<v Speaker 2>when you're going into camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could carry as much as 70,</v>

4083
03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:25.800
<v Speaker 2>80 pounds on your back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they do this company called </v>

4084
03:01:25.800 --> 03:01:26.950
<v Speaker 2>outdoorsmen is they make a pack frame </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has a,</v>

4085
03:01:26.980 --> 03:01:31.980
<v Speaker 2>an olympic plate bolt on the back of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We slide olympic plates on it and you </v>

4086
03:01:31.980 --> 03:01:33.870
<v Speaker 2>clamp them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have like a,</v>

4087
03:01:33.910 --> 03:01:36.250
<v Speaker 2>like literally an olympic weight on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

4088
03:01:36.251 --> 03:01:41.251
<v Speaker 2>You could put a 45 pound plate or a 90 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pound plate and you do hike to condition</v>

4089
03:01:41.351 --> 03:01:46.351
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have the right posture and </v>

4090
03:01:46.351 --> 03:01:46.351
<v Speaker 2>you're building that.</v>

4091
03:01:46.351 --> 03:01:46.351
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4092
03:01:46.351 --> 03:01:48.790
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the best ways,</v>

4093
03:01:48.990 --> 03:01:53.990
<v Speaker 2>like weighted pack exercises is one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best ways to prepare yourself for </v>

4094
03:01:53.990 --> 03:01:58.261
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really one of the only ways </v>

4095
03:01:58.261 --> 03:01:58.261
<v Speaker 2>because you're dealing with many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many miles of hiking.</v>

4096
03:01:58.261 --> 03:01:59.590
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of cool because I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've often,</v>

4097
03:01:59.591 --> 03:02:04.591
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really ever done any like big </v>

4098
03:02:04.591 --> 03:02:04.591
<v Speaker 2>camping like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4099
03:02:04.591 --> 03:02:08.011
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always like go for a hike of the </v>

4100
03:02:08.011 --> 03:02:08.011
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back,</v>

4101
03:02:08.011 --> 03:02:08.011
<v Speaker 2>go to the cabin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4102
03:02:08.011 --> 03:02:11.820
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of fun to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where you hike many miles in and </v>

4103
03:02:11.820 --> 03:02:14.550
<v Speaker 2>take up a camp and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so um,</v>

4104
03:02:14.590 --> 03:02:17.080
<v Speaker 2>but I thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to carry all that stuff?</v>

4105
03:02:17.140 --> 03:02:18.370
<v Speaker 2>It's grueling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4106
03:02:18.371 --> 03:02:20.260
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine like there's no way I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do that much,</v>

4107
03:02:20.261 --> 03:02:25.261
<v Speaker 2>but when some people do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're only going to go for a few </v>

4108
03:02:25.261 --> 03:02:28.590
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can get it down to as little as 40 </v>

4109
03:02:28.590 --> 03:02:28.590
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>

4110
03:02:28.590 --> 03:02:28.590
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people are super minimalist,</v>

4111
03:02:28.590 --> 03:02:33.511
<v Speaker 2>like my friend adam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does it for many stretches at a time </v>

4112
03:02:33.511 --> 03:02:34.030
<v Speaker 2>and he'll do like 28 days in the bush by</v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

4113
03:02:34.110 --> 03:02:36.970
<v Speaker 2>He lives in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's done it in Montana to one.</v>

4114
03:02:36.971 --> 03:02:41.971
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did it and documented it all on his </v>

4115
03:02:41.971 --> 03:02:41.971
<v Speaker 2>instagram story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's so extreme.</v>

4116
03:02:41.971 --> 03:02:45.070
<v Speaker 2>He cuts hIs toothbrush and half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he only has the,</v>

4117
03:02:45.150 --> 03:02:50.150
<v Speaker 2>he cuts weight in so many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>places that the handle of his </v>

4118
03:02:50.150 --> 03:02:50.470
<v Speaker 2>toothbrush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it cuts off.</v>

4119
03:02:50.530 --> 03:02:54.430
<v Speaker 2>So he's brushIng his teeth with like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>little end part of it toothbrush,</v>

4120
03:02:54.640 --> 03:02:57.530
<v Speaker 2>which I think is just stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how much weight are you saving?</v>

4121
03:02:57.531 --> 03:02:58.690
<v Speaker 2>C'mon man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

4122
03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Give yourself a real toothbrushes </v>
<v Speaker 2>psycho.</v>

4123
03:03:01.930 --> 03:03:06.930
<v Speaker 2>But these people I'm really concentrated</v>
<v Speaker 2>on making things as minimal as possible.</v>

4124
03:03:07.421 --> 03:03:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Bringing as little gear as possible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just gettIng all dialed in.</v>

4125
03:03:11.020 --> 03:03:13.510
<v Speaker 2>You have to kind of figure out how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>water you need,</v>

4126
03:03:13.511 --> 03:03:14.290
<v Speaker 2>how much food you need.</v>

4127
03:03:14.680 --> 03:03:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time they map out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll use like I'm a google earth and </v>

4128
03:03:19.680 --> 03:03:22.400
<v Speaker 2>map out where the natural springs are </v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to figure out uh,</v>

4129
03:03:22.420 --> 03:03:27.420
<v Speaker 2>how much water they have to bring with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and how much they can get from </v>

4130
03:03:27.420 --> 03:03:31.081
<v Speaker 2>these sources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then they have to have either a </v>

4131
03:03:31.081 --> 03:03:32.971
<v Speaker 2>steri pim or some sort of filtration </v>
<v Speaker 2>system to clean out the water to make </v>

4132
03:03:32.971 --> 03:03:35.950
<v Speaker 2>sure that they don't get to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

4133
03:03:36.220 --> 03:03:39.250
<v Speaker 2>what's the longest amount of tIme that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done?</v>

4134
03:03:39.251 --> 03:03:44.251
<v Speaker 2>Like one of these campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never done it where they did it </v>

4135
03:03:44.251 --> 03:03:46.290
<v Speaker 2>like that where I carried my camp on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and I lived out there for.</v>

4136
03:03:46.390 --> 03:03:51.390
<v Speaker 2>The only time I've ever done it is with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a group of guys and we've camped for a </v>

4137
03:03:51.390 --> 03:03:53.620
<v Speaker 2>week in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we brought everything in on canoes.</v>

4138
03:03:53.730 --> 03:03:56.560
<v Speaker 2>So we had all these supplies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We brought them in on boats.</v>

4139
03:03:56.770 --> 03:03:58.460
<v Speaker 2>We got out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we staked our tents</v>

4140
03:03:58.460 --> 03:04:00.710
<v Speaker 4>and we had food with us just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

4141
03:04:01.250 --> 03:04:04.220
<v Speaker 4>But I know a lot of guys do it and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't bring much food.</v>

4142
03:04:04.221 --> 03:04:09.221
<v Speaker 4>They just try to live off the land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just try to get successful quick </v>

4143
03:04:09.221 --> 03:04:09.221
<v Speaker 4>with the hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then theory.</v>

4144
03:04:09.840 --> 03:04:13.310
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the added challenge of it,</v>

4145
03:04:13.860 --> 03:04:15.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the weight.</v>

4146
03:04:15.710 --> 03:04:20.390
<v Speaker 4>But the point being that weighted </v>
<v Speaker 4>backpacks or an excellent cardiovascular</v>

4147
03:04:20.391 --> 03:04:25.391
<v Speaker 4>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to me just make sense of being </v>

4148
03:04:25.391 --> 03:04:28.420
<v Speaker 4>pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would make your feet stronger and </v>

4149
03:04:28.420 --> 03:04:28.490
<v Speaker 4>increase your vo two max and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>walking four miles a day.</v>

4150
03:04:28.880 --> 03:04:32.180
<v Speaker 4>I know what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A great thing that there's this girl,</v>

4151
03:04:32.270 --> 03:04:34.940
<v Speaker 4>this woman in my spin class and she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4152
03:04:34.941 --> 03:04:39.941
<v Speaker 4>you can ask them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's about to have this baby like any </v>

4153
03:04:39.941 --> 03:04:39.941
<v Speaker 4>day and she's their bike and away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

4154
03:04:39.941 --> 03:04:40.480
<v Speaker 4>geez.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4155
03:04:40.481 --> 03:04:41.720
<v Speaker 4>So she used to get crazy with it.</v>

4156
03:04:41.720 --> 03:04:43.070
<v Speaker 4>She's real tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4157
03:04:43.071 --> 03:04:45.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean I look back at pictures of me and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4158
03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:51.100
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I like bounce back from </v>
<v Speaker 4>that because it's just like I'm just so </v>

4159
03:04:51.100 --> 03:04:51.850
<v Speaker 4>enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4160
03:04:51.870 --> 03:04:52.760
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

4161
03:04:52.890 --> 03:04:54.500
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing is incredible.</v>

4162
03:04:54.530 --> 03:04:56.720
<v Speaker 4>Do you think you're going to do it again</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you want it done?</v>

4163
03:04:56.990 --> 03:05:01.130
<v Speaker 4>I think I might be one and done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know for sure,</v>

4164
03:05:01.131 --> 03:05:06.131
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spent some time to think you only got </v>

4165
03:05:06.131 --> 03:05:06.131
<v Speaker 4>four months old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a little bit of time to think,</v>

4166
03:05:06.131 --> 03:05:10.990
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like I've got pressure like my </v>

4167
03:05:10.990 --> 03:05:10.990
<v Speaker 4>half sister and like other people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4168
03:05:10.990 --> 03:05:11.060
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to wait a year.</v>

4169
03:05:11.150 --> 03:05:12.290
<v Speaker 4>You got to get pregnant again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4170
03:05:12.291 --> 03:05:13.960
<v Speaker 4>oh gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4171
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:15.980

<v Speaker 4>It's so good.</v>

4172
03:05:15.981 --> 03:05:17.420
<v Speaker 4>I have one kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of,</v>

4173
03:05:17.600 --> 03:05:19.910
<v Speaker 4>I've kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of just so in love with him.</v>

4174
03:05:19.910 --> 03:05:21.650
<v Speaker 4>Then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to share my love,</v>

4175
03:05:21.651 --> 03:05:24.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having kids,</v>

4176
03:05:24.021 --> 03:05:25.780
<v Speaker 4>like my kids are two years apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4177
03:05:25.940 --> 03:05:29.120
<v Speaker 4>the youngest ones and when they hang out</v>
<v Speaker 4>together it's just amazing.</v>

4178
03:05:29.121 --> 03:05:33.430
<v Speaker 4>You watched them hug each other and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>play games together and you know,</v>

4179
03:05:33.500 --> 03:05:35.320
<v Speaker 4>there's still like little sibling </v>
<v Speaker 4>rivalries.</v>

4180
03:05:35.330 --> 03:05:36.340
<v Speaker 4>There's always going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

4181
03:05:36.580 --> 03:05:39.530
<v Speaker 4>but there's something magical about </v>
<v Speaker 4>having a sibling,</v>

4182
03:05:39.590 --> 03:05:40.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up,</v>

4183
03:05:40.530 --> 03:05:44.780
<v Speaker 4>the sister is one year younger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My brother who's four years younger than</v>

4184
03:05:44.781 --> 03:05:45.220
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4185
03:05:45.680 --> 03:05:47.120

<v Speaker 4>just something to it,</v>

4186
03:05:47.480 --> 03:05:52.480
<v Speaker 4>but it's also something to have in one </v>
<v Speaker 4>kid and given them a lot of attention </v>

4187
03:05:52.480 --> 03:05:54.860
<v Speaker 4>and being able to do other things too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like science.</v>

4188
03:05:55.820 --> 03:06:00.820
<v Speaker 4>So speaking to science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell people where they can listen to </v>
