<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

51
00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:32.551
<v Speaker 2>is just perpetuating these gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>stereotypes that have been essentially </v>

52
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:34.600
<v Speaker 2>boxing people into these behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns for years.</v>

53
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not that they're natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's totally cultural.</v>

54
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:40.840
<v Speaker 2>It's totally something that our society </v>
<v Speaker 2>has constructed.</v>

55
00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:44.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a cultural context or construct or </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

56
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Sorry for being a provider.</v>

62
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.220

<v Speaker 1>terrible magazine and she's in a leather</v>
<v Speaker 1>jacket.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

65
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.410
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting how when you want to </v>

<v Speaker 1>your dress pants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she had gloves with the fingers </v>

67
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.630

<v Speaker 1>Maybe she didn't,</v>

68
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 1>but in my mind she did and she's hanging</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto some.</v>

69
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>She's hanging.</v>

117
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time you can't even look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

118
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Then when you want to get to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just want to say anything.</v>

119
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Just so she looks at you and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>clumsy.</v>

120
00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that's you,</v>

121
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of Dick wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not clumsy women.</v>

122
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:30.730
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh hey,</v>

123
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:32.570
<v Speaker 1>why don't you smile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look better if you're smaller,</v>

124
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 1>but it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

125
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's super common.</v>

126
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 1>I consider it the same thing as a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who has a bad sense of humor,</v>

127
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

128
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have friends that,</v>

129
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.990
<v Speaker 1>you know that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're a woman in a guy's doing</v>

130
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:48.991
<v Speaker 1>it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has the feeling of danger touch to </v>

131
00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:48.991
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

132
00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:53.070
<v Speaker 1>I understand when a guy's pursuing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman and he's saying things like that </v>

133
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.580
<v Speaker 1>and he's kind of gross and clumsy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think of it as like a dude being </v>

134
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.871
<v Speaker 1>gross and clumsy to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a guy being gross and clumsy to you </v>

135
00:06:00.871 --> 00:06:00.871
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

136
00:06:00.871 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel like you might get raped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

137
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like you'll feel a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

138
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like girls' a different world.</v>

139
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.270
<v Speaker 1>They're physically vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

140
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 1>That's never been any different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

141
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never been any different,</v>

142
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:22.661
<v Speaker 1>but they never had the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>express themselves like there's never </v>

143
00:06:22.661 --> 00:06:23.150
<v Speaker 1>been any opportunity to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 1>put up a post on facebook about the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel about something and have people</v>

145
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:28.750
<v Speaker 1>react to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

147
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I also think that there are some women </v>
<v Speaker 1>that embrace it and turn it into an </v>

148
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people get into anything,</v>

149
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get into anything and everything.</v>

150
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.860
<v Speaker 1>They get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

151
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a bit defines it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defines them.</v>

152
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm into playing water polo hockey or </v>
<v Speaker 1>just water hockey fight.</v>

153
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

154
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna say water polo and I'm like,</v>

155
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 1>that's just too ridiculous.</v>

156
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Pocket water on it's hockey underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I blamed the weed.</v>

157
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

158
00:06:56.541 --> 00:07:01.541
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get into things and they might </v>

159
00:07:01.541 --> 00:07:03.131
<v Speaker 1>get into activism and they might get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the response they get from other </v>

160
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>people because they embrace activism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They that that's as much of an addiction</v>

161
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:10.751
<v Speaker 1>as anything else and sometimes those </v>
<v Speaker 1>addictions lead to really great work </v>

162
00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:14.770
<v Speaker 1>because people do get addicted to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>adulation that they get from doing good </v>

163
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.331
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they continue to do good things and </v>

164
00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>it becomes their thing and letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone know about how much good things</v>

165
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:21.980
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so amazing when you find</v>

166
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 1>out about someone who does things </v>
<v Speaker 1>quietly,</v>

167
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:29.170
<v Speaker 1>like someone would donate some money </v>
<v Speaker 1>quietly or helps people quietly and not </v>

168
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>trying to get any attention whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

169
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:29.630
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

170
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:32.070
<v Speaker 1>well that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is real altruism.</v>

171
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.080
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Truman said that Truman said something </v>

172
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a quote,</v>

173
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.971
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be amazed at how much you can get </v>

174
00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:42.820
<v Speaker 1>accomplished if you're not worried about</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gets the credit for it like that.</v>

175
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 1>That's an important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how charity should be </v>

176
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 1>given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

177
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 1>if you put your name on the territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the building,</v>

178
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

179
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess it's as long as good </v>

180
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.301
<v Speaker 1>charity gets done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charity to me has always been a very </v>

181
00:07:58.301 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 1>strange thing because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is super important.</v>

182
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:04.790
<v Speaker 1>You know that people help people out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you find out how much of these </v>

183
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 1>organizations actually spend the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the charity itself and how much of it</v>

184
00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 1>goes to the structure of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

185
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like what?</v>

186
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:17.550
<v Speaker 1>And nuts and they all lie about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all lie about how much money it </v>

187
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.410
<v Speaker 1>actually because they just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do fancy accounting right?</v>

188
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.680
<v Speaker 1>To the Clinton Foundation is a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

189
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Bad something they don't know yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was pretty astonishing at how </v>

190
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.461
<v Speaker 1>much went to running the corporation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much it's going to be really </v>

191
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:31.430
<v Speaker 1>interesting to see.</v>

192
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.580
<v Speaker 1>How much the Clinton Foundation can </v>
<v Speaker 1>raise now that both of them have no </v>

193
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 1>political influence anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

194
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.050
<v Speaker 1>they still have influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

195
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:44.051
<v Speaker 1>but they just don't mention she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no influence in how to move </v>

196
00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:48.821
<v Speaker 1>American policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When she was secretary of state and her </v>

197
00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:51.341
<v Speaker 1>husband was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think she'll do something like </v>

198
00:08:51.341 --> 00:08:51.341
<v Speaker 1>run for senator again now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she'll ever run for office</v>

199
00:08:51.341 --> 00:08:51.540
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

200
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.020
<v Speaker 1>that's what I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what her closest advisors say.</v>

201
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just wore out.</v>

202
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

203
00:08:56.941 --> 00:09:01.941
<v Speaker 1>It had to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she didn't even want to go to </v>

204
00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 1>these places to be 70 and she's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy 70 either.</v>

205
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.840
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the other super annoying</v>
<v Speaker 1>things about this election is that if </v>

206
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 1>you brought up her health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are sexist.</v>

207
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I experienced that a couple of times.</v>

208
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:17.570
<v Speaker 1>People reacting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like would you have brought up the fact </v>

209
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 1>that she was fainting if she was a man </v>
<v Speaker 1>like fucking.</v>

210
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Of course whenever a 70 year old person </v>
<v Speaker 1>has just fainting,</v>

211
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.300
<v Speaker 1>fainting is really fucking bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People die from faint.</v>

212
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She almost died from fainting.</v>

213
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.480
<v Speaker 1>She banged her fucking head off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground in 2012 and Bill Clinton didn't </v>

214
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.030
<v Speaker 1>an interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said she was fucked up for six months.</v>

215
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

216
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I paraphrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say it.</v>

217
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 1>He said it that way though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was fucked up.</v>

218
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bitch fell back out.</v>

219
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:46.521
<v Speaker 1>Cold cracks or head off the curb out my </v>
<v Speaker 1>dick,</v>

220
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.930
<v Speaker 1>out her mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cried on Monica tests for awhile.</v>

221
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Poor Monica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's she doing now?</v>

222
00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Scraping shame off of her forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She did a round table,</v>

223
00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Speaker 1>our discussion and it was always </v>
<v Speaker 1>supportive of college students.</v>

224
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:09.230
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's talking and she's kind of talking </v>

225
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.230
<v Speaker 1>about her experience and some dude gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and goes,</v>

226
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it like to be an attention whore </v>

227
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:14.610
<v Speaker 1>and have sex for money if something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

228
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:16.210
<v Speaker 1>like really hard and it was just this.</v>

229
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.050
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

230
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.970
<v Speaker 1>I guess I helped myself up for this kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

231
00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:23.670
<v Speaker 1>And she handled it well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that the HBO one.</v>

232
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I think so I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

233
00:10:26.431 --> 00:10:28.620
<v Speaker 1>why is this on Hbo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>

234
00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

235
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:34.370
<v Speaker 1>She strikes me as a pretty cool person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know for sure and I think she's </v>

236
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 1>attracted people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

237
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a bummer that people made</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>

238
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Monomer dare bowl to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind a little.</v>

239
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

240
00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:46.380
<v Speaker 1>It's just wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anti-Bullying has her first thing on her</v>

241
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 1>twitter profile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

242
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bullies in school,</v>

243
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:54.990
<v Speaker 1>bullied across the social scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

244
00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Speaker 1>So they don't believe the nerds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bully each other.</v>

245
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.590
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

246
00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:02.940
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a cool kid circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently the bullies only bully.</v>

247
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.690
<v Speaker 1>That's what I read.</v>

248
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.320
<v Speaker 1>They bully each other because they know </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

249
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Truly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely blue people in other social </v>

250
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.461
<v Speaker 1>circles to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although we're nerds bullying each </v>

251
00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:13.461
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

252
00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:15.090
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bullying among groups,</v>

253
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:20.091
<v Speaker 1>but they don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a whole lot of cross </v>

254
00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:20.091
<v Speaker 1>pollination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

255
00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:24.021
<v Speaker 1>that's a dumb fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read an article and I don't go to </v>

256
00:11:24.021 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 1>schools and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw lines on that.</v>

257
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.660
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot of things that are hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out right there.</v>

258
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:32.670
<v Speaker 1>A lot of things were here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can draw these broad based </v>

259
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:32.670
<v Speaker 1>conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I went,</v>

260
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I read one article in New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how doctors are in the pockets of </v>

261
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.611
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies and the reps </v>
<v Speaker 1>are cheerleaders and I got a fucking </v>

262
00:11:40.611 --> 00:11:44.721
<v Speaker 1>email from this guy who was a former </v>
<v Speaker 1>green beret friend of Tim Kennedy's and </v>

263
00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:44.721
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey dude,</v>

264
00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:44.721
<v Speaker 1>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

265
00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I sell drugs to doctors.</v>

266
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not fucking true.</v>

267
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm just telling you like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality on the ground versus what you're</v>

268
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:55.030
<v Speaker 1>reading from the New York Times is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>diametrically opposed.</v>

269
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.220
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

270
00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:01.230
<v Speaker 1>in his circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's one guy working for one </v>

271
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.110
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Industry is gigantic.</v>

272
00:12:02.111 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 1>It's huge and it's practices vary </v>
<v Speaker 1>widely,</v>

273
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:07.270
<v Speaker 1>especially depending upon what drugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're selling.</v>

274
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 1>My wife's mom is a nurse and she used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work with pharmaceutical companies.</v>

275
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:17.341
<v Speaker 1>They would take them out to a steak </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner with them and they would </v>

276
00:12:17.341 --> 00:12:20.700
<v Speaker 1>literally do everything they could to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get you to be like super high on that </v>

277
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.541
<v Speaker 1>company and it's what they do to gain </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence without actually paying you to</v>

278
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:26.770
<v Speaker 1>say shit to the patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

279
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:28.180
<v Speaker 1>like say if there's a company that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

280
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.570
<v Speaker 1>like this hat I'm wearing vortex optics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice people.</v>

281
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:32.880
<v Speaker 1>They make good binoculars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

282
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:38.250
<v Speaker 1>So if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I meet them and I know them and I talk </v>

283
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 1>about them and I talk about them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

284
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 1>people perhaps we'll buy their stuff.</v>

285
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of shit happens in,</v>

286
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.450
<v Speaker 1>in the pharmaceutical world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use influence.</v>

287
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:50.140
<v Speaker 1>They become friends with these nurses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They buy them nice dinners.</v>

288
00:12:50.141 --> 00:12:52.540
<v Speaker 1>They take them out for drinks to pick up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tab.</v>

289
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.130
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a nice dinner.</v>

290
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:56.200
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to pay anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all against the law now,</v>

291
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

292
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I think that there are a lot of </v>

293
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:02.490
<v Speaker 1>strident laws are stringent laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

294
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:07.471
<v Speaker 1>against sort of influence peddling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting gifts even in the form of any </v>

295
00:13:08.231 --> 00:13:09.670
<v Speaker 1>kind of a trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of a dinner.</v>

296
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.520
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that stuff is there's a wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>now beings.</v>

297
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:17.550
<v Speaker 1>What's the super good idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people are so open to suggestion </v>

298
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.020
<v Speaker 1>that it should be absolutely illegal to </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertise drugs.</v>

299
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about the fact that pharmaceutical </v>

300
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:25.200
<v Speaker 1>companies are bankrolling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.020
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food companies,</v>

302
00:13:26.021 --> 00:13:28.690
<v Speaker 1>bankroll scientists to do research on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

303
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:33.550
<v Speaker 1>on simple sugars and how your diet can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be made if 25 percent simple sugars,</v>

304
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:38.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to our side is that I happen </v>

305
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:38.900
<v Speaker 1>to also be on the Coca Cola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nestle,</v>

306
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:38.900
<v Speaker 1>kraft payroll.</v>

307
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking about the 1950 studies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm talking about now?</v>

308
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:46.831
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about recently I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the fact that the food and board </v>

309
00:13:46.831 --> 00:13:47.670
<v Speaker 1>nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the food and nutrition board or whatever</v>

310
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bodies of government that set the </v>

311
00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.030
<v Speaker 1>nutritional standards for what mothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>with dependent children eat,</v>

312
00:13:55.031 --> 00:13:57.700
<v Speaker 1>what the military is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what our school programs are.</v>

313
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at what their nutritional </v>
<v Speaker 1>guidelines are and take a look at the </v>

314
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.711
<v Speaker 1>corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that are actually providing </v>

315
00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:07.960
<v Speaker 1>the food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who has a huge interest in that?</v>

316
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Nestle kraft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these companies that make billions,</v>

317
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:18.420
<v Speaker 1>millions of billions of dollars on </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeding our school children in public </v>

318
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:18.420
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

319
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Is there really a statement that says 25</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent simple sugars.</v>

320
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.450
<v Speaker 1>If you read forks over knives by t dot </v>
<v Speaker 1>Colin Campbell,</v>

321
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.780
<v Speaker 1>he talks about the food and board </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition and he's a scientist.</v>

322
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.900
<v Speaker 1>He's a Vegan and board nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the food and nutrition board.</v>

323
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what called food </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition board,</v>

324
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.870
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember,</v>

325
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.360
<v Speaker 1>don't quote me exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

326
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.000
<v Speaker 1>he does a very good job of tracing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>genealogy here.</v>

327
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:38.710
<v Speaker 1>He's a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't really agree with him,</v>

328
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:43.711
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does an amazing job of kind of </v>

329
00:14:43.711 --> 00:14:45.850
<v Speaker 1>showing you just exactly how the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>food companies are very influential.</v>

330
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how much their products into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mouths and Belize of people who are </v>

331
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.700
<v Speaker 1>relying on the government to feed them </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much?</v>

332
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:54.350
<v Speaker 1>That infuriates vegans and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

333
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:56.170
<v Speaker 1>he's a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't really agree with them.</v>

334
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

335
00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

336
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.080
<v Speaker 1>he's at scientology does an amazing job </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

337
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that book of making the argument </v>

338
00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.961
<v Speaker 1>for being healthier as a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talks about the China study where </v>

339
00:15:10.961 --> 00:15:12.330
<v Speaker 1>study has been widely debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

340
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the China study,</v>

341
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:18.521
<v Speaker 1>apparently they didn't do a good job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull up China study debunk so we can get</v>

342
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:23.891
<v Speaker 1>this totally accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think essentially big part of his </v>

343
00:15:23.891 --> 00:15:23.891
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

344
00:15:23.891 --> 00:15:23.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

345
00:15:23.891 --> 00:15:27.740
<v Speaker 1>so it was a lot of parts of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the ways people were a managing</v>

346
00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:28.700
<v Speaker 1>the nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

347
00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:33.701
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never talked about things like </v>

348
00:15:33.701 --> 00:15:35.560
<v Speaker 1>insulin and he doesn't come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that scientific because you </v>

349
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.410
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insulin is a big thing to talk about,</v>

350
00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:39.740
<v Speaker 1>like how food reacts to kind of hormonal</v>
<v Speaker 1>response food has on your body.</v>

351
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.840
<v Speaker 1>What dietary cholesterol really does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

352
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the combination,</v>

353
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.380
<v Speaker 1>the correct combination should be all </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy thing,</v>

354
00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.330
<v Speaker 1>breast and piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to study.</v>

355
00:15:50.331 --> 00:15:55.331
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Chris Kresser who's actually </v>

356
00:15:55.331 --> 00:15:55.331
<v Speaker 1>been on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

357
00:15:55.331 --> 00:15:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm Bubba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bubba bomb.</v>

358
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.530
<v Speaker 1>The China study should be put the issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>to rest.</v>

359
00:16:00.531 --> 00:16:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Please consider the information </v>
<v Speaker 1>presented here.</v>

360
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:03.920
<v Speaker 1>The methodologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Impressive.</v>

361
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scroll down.</v>

362
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Papa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Papa Campbell recommends a Vegan Diet.</v>

363
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.720
<v Speaker 1>No animal based food at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He claimed that population studies </v>

364
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.171
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate that Vegan populations do </v>
<v Speaker 1>not suffer from the high incidence of </v>

365
00:16:17.171 --> 00:16:20.591
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular disease and cancer that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we in the West do with our diets heavy </v>

366
00:16:20.591 --> 00:16:21.230
<v Speaker 1>on animal protein.</v>

367
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.190
<v Speaker 1>He also draws a correlation between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

368
00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:28.310
<v Speaker 1>milk and juvenile diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

369
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:33.311
<v Speaker 1>he draws all these correlations to even </v>
<v Speaker 1>chronic illnesses that manifest </v>

370
00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:37.190
<v Speaker 1>themselves in children with meat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dairy.</v>

371
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.330
<v Speaker 1>This is Chris' master John's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

372
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:45.580
<v Speaker 1>take on a says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I first started analyzing the </v>

373
00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.071
<v Speaker 1>original China study data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no intention of writing up an </v>

374
00:16:48.071 --> 00:16:49.400
<v Speaker 1>actual critique of Campbell's much </v>
<v Speaker 1>lauded book.</v>

375
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a data junkie numbers along with </v>

376
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:54.840
<v Speaker 1>the strawberries and Aubrey Hepburn </v>
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>

377
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Gay make me very happy girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's girl.</v>

378
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

379
00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Mainly wanting to see myself a see for </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself how closely Campbell's claims </v>

380
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.210
<v Speaker 1>aligned with the data's he drew from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if only to satisfy my own curiosity,</v>

381
00:17:05.211 --> 00:17:07.160
<v Speaker 1>but after spending a solid month and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half of reading,</v>

382
00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:10.580
<v Speaker 1>graphing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sticky noting and passing out a 3:00</v>

383
00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:15.580
<v Speaker 1>AM from studious exhaustion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And upon my copy of the Raw China state </v>

384
00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.870
<v Speaker 1>study data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've decided that it's time to voice all</v>

385
00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:20.950
<v Speaker 1>my criticisms and there are many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

386
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.040
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bup,</v>

387
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:22.430
<v Speaker 1>bup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bup,</v>

388
00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:23.030
<v Speaker 1>bup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bup,</v>

389
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Campbell.</v>

390
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Conveniently fist to mention the county </v>
<v Speaker 1>of tool toil in China.</v>

391
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.890
<v Speaker 1>The folks in two D,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two l,</v>

392
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.280
<v Speaker 1>I 45 percent of their diet is fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>134 grams of animal protein each day,</v>

393
00:17:37.281 --> 00:17:42.281
<v Speaker 1>twice as much as the average American </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rarely ate vegetables or other </v>

394
00:17:42.281 --> 00:17:42.281
<v Speaker 1>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plant foods,</v>

395
00:17:42.281 --> 00:17:45.170
<v Speaker 1>yet according to the and study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were extremely healthy with low</v>

396
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:46.700
<v Speaker 1>rates of cancer and heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

397
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.840
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

398
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:51.600
<v Speaker 1>this is the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the China study is that they only put in</v>

399
00:17:51.601 --> 00:17:53.680
<v Speaker 1>stuff that backs up what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

400
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.010
<v Speaker 1>And they'd confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

401
00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 1>So they didn't put in anything that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>contrary to that data.</v>

402
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.750
<v Speaker 1>And there's plenty of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of that out there.</v>

403
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.570
<v Speaker 1>I really honestly believe that the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>co,</v>

404
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.980
<v Speaker 1>the real problem is the ideology because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vegans are absolutely not able to </v>

405
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:16.740
<v Speaker 1>get over the idea that you should ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat or kill an animal should do no harm.</v>

406
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well one day we're going to have this </v>

407
00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.170
<v Speaker 1>factory made meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on the way.</v>

408
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're really close to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to do that in mass and when they do</v>

409
00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:31.371
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they can get factory made meat and </v>

410
00:18:31.371 --> 00:18:33.921
<v Speaker 1>factory made fat and if it turns out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any way to actually be like the same </v>

411
00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:36.000
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can eat it and it's healthy.</v>

412
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Vegans should eat it because it's better</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

413
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more nutrition.</v>

414
00:18:40.501 --> 00:18:45.501
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you would think that you can get all </v>

415
00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:45.501
<v Speaker 1>of your food from plants and you kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

416
00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:50.330
<v Speaker 1>you kind of can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's been some real good </v>

417
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:50.520
<v Speaker 1>scientific critiques of the problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan diets.</v>

418
00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

419
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:52.380
<v Speaker 1>That happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

420
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:57.381
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Charles pollock said he's been a </v>

421
00:18:57.381 --> 00:19:00.531
<v Speaker 1>strength coach forever and he was on Tim</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferriss' podcast and he said that they </v>

422
00:19:00.531 --> 00:19:00.960
<v Speaker 1>said if you ever look what about Vegan </v>
<v Speaker 1>diets?</v>

423
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.980
<v Speaker 1>You've been strength training for 37 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and you know,</v>

424
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.660
<v Speaker 1>high level has got more gold medalists </v>
<v Speaker 1>under his,</v>

425
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toodle edge or whatever that he,</v>

426
00:19:09.621 --> 00:19:12.230
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's results driven guy.</v>

427
00:19:12.231 --> 00:19:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

428
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.760
<v Speaker 1>And that is so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

429
00:19:14.761 --> 00:19:16.520
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of Vegan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he gained me.</v>

430
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:20.980
<v Speaker 1>He basically gave me nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>berries and some vegetables and he said,</v>

431
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.770
<v Speaker 1>after 37 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

432
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.410
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen it.</v>

433
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:30.470
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anybody on a vegetable </v>
<v Speaker 1>based diet actually be able to compete </v>

434
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.110
<v Speaker 1>in strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosion,</v>

435
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.160
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of things to the level that </v>
<v Speaker 1>others have.</v>

436
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Vegan power lifter in the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that doesn't make any sense.</v>

437
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.200
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

438
00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.030
<v Speaker 1>there's other vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong men.</v>

439
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.580
<v Speaker 1>I know there's some guy who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

440
00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:42.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there are.</v>

441
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

442
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.570
<v Speaker 1>according to polyclinic for the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

443
00:19:45.571 --> 00:19:50.571
<v Speaker 1>his athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks have to eat meat because it </v>

444
00:19:50.571 --> 00:19:50.820
<v Speaker 1>creates a more better for recovery </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits,</v>

445
00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.320
<v Speaker 1>strength better for all that stuff.</v>

446
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that is dependent entirely on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the athlete because I think there's some</v>

447
00:19:56.941 --> 00:19:59.610
<v Speaker 1>vegans that will tell you that they do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan diet and they feel better.</v>

448
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I know John Fitch did a Vegan diet for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while,</v>

449
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.330
<v Speaker 1>but then he felt weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just got to a point where you see,</v>

450
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:11.360
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things that Chris </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kresser talked about on the podcast as </v>

451
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.211
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's some initial positive </v>

452
00:20:14.211 --> 00:20:14.211
<v Speaker 1>benefits from changing your diet to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrient rich,</v>

453
00:20:14.211 --> 00:20:14.910
<v Speaker 1>rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dense,</v>

454
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:19.080
<v Speaker 1>nutrient dense diet like a vegan diet as</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to the standard American diet.</v>

455
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.440
<v Speaker 1>The problem arises after years of living</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this where your body is just </v>

456
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.730
<v Speaker 1>depleted itself of the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>lacking in the Diet.</v>

457
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Now a smart vegan would tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

458
00:20:29.371 --> 00:20:34.371
<v Speaker 1>that could be mitigated by better </v>
<v Speaker 1>planning of your meals and making sure </v>

459
00:20:34.371 --> 00:20:35.610
<v Speaker 1>that you get all these healthy things.</v>

460
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.010
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely true.</v>

461
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:43.160
<v Speaker 1>And adding things like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that stuff from the green stuff </v>

462
00:20:44.281 --> 00:20:46.110
<v Speaker 1>from the ocean allergy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

463
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Allergy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which you can get [inaudible] from </v>

464
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.350
<v Speaker 1>allergy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially sort of.</v>

465
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all life,</v>

466
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just we're deciding what's stupid.</v>

467
00:20:53.321 --> 00:20:55.420
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should eat clams.</v>

468
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Clams are dumb as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

469
00:20:57.341 --> 00:20:59.240
<v Speaker 1>those stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>central nervous,</v>

470
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:04.620
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might as well be eating </v>

471
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:04.620
<v Speaker 1>carrot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you could eat things.</v>

472
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:09.140
<v Speaker 1>We have this weird thing about stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that moves where you eat a venus fly </v>

473
00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:09.730
<v Speaker 1>trap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you draw the line that I will also</v>

474
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Speaker 1>donate animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to.</v>

475
00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plants talk to each other.</v>

476
00:21:11.651 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Don't trees have conversations with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

477
00:21:14.081 --> 00:21:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I would love to have a Venus fly trap </v>
<v Speaker 1>salad.</v>

478
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Now that I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

479
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

480
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I went to there.</v>

481
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.420
<v Speaker 1>It's funny how some plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

482
00:21:25.421 --> 00:21:30.421
<v Speaker 1>where there's shit in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say you can almost eat anything in </v>

483
00:21:30.421 --> 00:21:30.421
<v Speaker 1>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

484
00:21:30.421 --> 00:21:31.990
<v Speaker 1>with scales and fins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whatever it is.</v>

485
00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:36.991
<v Speaker 1>You can eat shrimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can eat almost anything with their </v>

486
00:21:36.991 --> 00:21:36.991
<v Speaker 1>certain like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

487
00:21:36.991 --> 00:21:39.670
<v Speaker 1>but when you go down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Tahiti,</v>

488
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:42.030
<v Speaker 1>which is considered the safest ocean to </v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming.</v>

489
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

490
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.470
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing really poisons to have a</v>

491
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:46.930
<v Speaker 1>rockfish and there aren't even a sea </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>

492
00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:49.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe there aren't big sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like really,</v>

493
00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:54.361
<v Speaker 1>really safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are always these poisonous </v>

494
00:21:54.361 --> 00:21:55.870
<v Speaker 1>corals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these little things.</v>

495
00:21:55.871 --> 00:21:58.540
<v Speaker 1>I went scuba diving and the woman with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

496
00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:00.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just nicked her arm,</v>

497
00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:05.971
<v Speaker 1>like the back of her arm on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a piece of coral and man did that </v>

498
00:22:05.971 --> 00:22:05.971
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

499
00:22:05.971 --> 00:22:07.380
<v Speaker 1>it didn't swell up like big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if she was just like,</v>

500
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:10.150
<v Speaker 1>this really hurts and all she did was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just kind of brushed by.</v>

501
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.920
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing the guy told me he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

502
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.410
<v Speaker 1>from dad goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one rule,</v>

503
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.630
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look with your,</v>

504
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:21.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you touch with your eyes and you look </v>

505
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:21.870
<v Speaker 1>with your fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that sound?</v>

506
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:25.930
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't touch anything if I let you touch </v>

507
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:25.930
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my.</v>

508
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.360
<v Speaker 1>But otherwise please stay away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at one point were down there,</v>

509
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.540
<v Speaker 1>went down there and he starts clicking </v>
<v Speaker 1>his fingers under water.</v>

510
00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:33.310
<v Speaker 1>This is like 80 feet under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going like this.</v>

511
00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:33.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

512
00:22:33.821 --> 00:22:38.821
<v Speaker 1>He's done and then nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like doing it toward this </v>

513
00:22:38.821 --> 00:22:42.121
<v Speaker 1>choral thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think something's going to jump </v>

514
00:22:42.121 --> 00:22:42.121
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he takes a piece of coral,</v>

515
00:22:42.121 --> 00:22:45.991
<v Speaker 1>picks it up and he digs into the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>and out comes a what I thought was a </v>

516
00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:47.920
<v Speaker 1>piece of rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a rockfish.</v>

517
00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which good luck.</v>

518
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Step on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See what happens.</v>

519
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Tell me how things work out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stick ahead.</v>

520
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Step out at rockfish and cover with </v>
<v Speaker 1>quills and shit.</v>

521
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Try not to go into shock by the way.</v>

522
00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Especially 80 feet under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good time.</v>

523
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is that you walk and it </v>

524
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.690
<v Speaker 1>looks exactly like a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're walking around in like a,</v>

525
00:23:07.691 --> 00:23:12.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of you down there in the ocean or </v>

526
00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:12.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you walk on that,</v>

527
00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:15.060
<v Speaker 1>you can get one of those foot and phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>call dot.</v>

528
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they don't really have an antivenom </v>

529
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.330
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotTa,</v>

530
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.830
<v Speaker 1>you gotTa let it work through your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucker.</v>

531
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.180
<v Speaker 1>They met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

532
00:23:22.181 --> 00:23:25.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's a rockfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will back rockfish.</v>

533
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Show him the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one that looks like exactly like</v>

534
00:23:28.571 --> 00:23:33.571
<v Speaker 1>a stone that was not the one was one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that literally looks like that right </v>

535
00:23:33.571 --> 00:23:34.750
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That bad.</v>

536
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I say.</v>

537
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does look like a rock when his eyes</v>

538
00:23:38.831 --> 00:23:40.510
<v Speaker 1>are closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the weird thing,</v>

539
00:23:40.511 --> 00:23:41.210
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

540
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:46.950
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck information is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed from animal to animal and from </v>

541
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:51.821
<v Speaker 1>nature to animal that allows these </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple animals like a fish to just </v>

542
00:23:51.821 --> 00:23:56.540
<v Speaker 1>change its body shape over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's evolution.</v>

543
00:23:56.541 --> 00:23:58.970
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

544
00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:02.180
<v Speaker 1>when you train a united a whale or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>train a bear.</v>

545
00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.700
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to bear to get up on its </v>
<v Speaker 1>hind legs.</v>

546
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.280
<v Speaker 1>So what are they driven by?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're driven by food,</v>

547
00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:09.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every time a bear sits up,</v>

548
00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:10.430
<v Speaker 1>you give them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you click,</v>

549
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.040
<v Speaker 1>you click a thing and you give them a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a bear trainer,</v>

550
00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:14.570
<v Speaker 1>but you pick her train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

551
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secretly,</v>

552
00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.350
<v Speaker 1>apparently got some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got some hidden skills,</v>

553
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

554
00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 1>You go and you give it to him and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he gets up on his hind legs,</v>

555
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:28.511
<v Speaker 1>maybe you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you click the thing and you give them a </v>

556
00:24:28.511 --> 00:24:28.511
<v Speaker 1>treat and then that's.</v>

557
00:24:28.511 --> 00:24:31.900
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you give them a signal for when you </v>

558
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.641
<v Speaker 1>want that to happen and pretty soon you </v>
<v Speaker 1>will allow him to kind of make the </v>

559
00:24:33.641 --> 00:24:36.581
<v Speaker 1>choice to go up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he knows that when I go up and my </v>

560
00:24:36.581 --> 00:24:36.581
<v Speaker 1>hindquarters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good things happen.</v>

561
00:24:36.581 --> 00:24:36.860
<v Speaker 1>I get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a little treat,</v>

562
00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:41.861
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say trend you don't train to bear by </v>

563
00:24:41.861 --> 00:24:41.861
<v Speaker 1>going bad bear and hitting him on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nose.</v>

564
00:24:41.861 --> 00:24:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See what happens to your fucking face.</v>

565
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do it,</v>

566
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you work with the animals and nature.</v>

567
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.080
<v Speaker 1>And I think evolution probably was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>

568
00:24:48.081 --> 00:24:50.840
<v Speaker 1>The fish that looked a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a rock,</v>

569
00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of those survived,</v>

570
00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:53.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

571
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in this uh,</v>

572
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.010
<v Speaker 1>because survival is a motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

573
00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I listened to Ed and they had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible,</v>

574
00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's where all the sea turtles would lay</v>

575
00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:05.030
<v Speaker 1>their eggs and we would watch them </v>
<v Speaker 1>hatch.</v>

576
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:10.240
<v Speaker 1>And all these adorable little babies </v>
<v Speaker 1>would run down to the ocean everyday </v>

577
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.620
<v Speaker 1>like woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of us would be sitting there </v>

578
00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:14.620
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

579
00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:14.620
<v Speaker 1>And the kids were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how cute they are.</v>

580
00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.820
<v Speaker 1>And stuff like that and as I'm watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and there's so many of them,</v>

581
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many.</v>

582
00:25:17.901 --> 00:25:19.310
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are and,</v>

583
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:24.510
<v Speaker 1>and my daughter's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so cute and so because you've got </v>

584
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.060
<v Speaker 1>to hold one before it went down there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he looks at me and he goes,</v>

585
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.240
<v Speaker 1>1000 Sarah by one in 1000 that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheese,</v>

586
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.820
<v Speaker 1>that's just food for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the bay right now.</v>

587
00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.000
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

588
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:36.590
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

589
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.800
<v Speaker 1>they're just nothing but baby sharks </v>
<v Speaker 1>groupers and even big crabs waiting for </v>

590
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.690
<v Speaker 1>every single one of them and one in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand turtles I going to live.</v>

591
00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.600
<v Speaker 1>And then I whispered that to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter.</v>

592
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.600
<v Speaker 1>So she understands what fucking life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really about while you whispered in a </v>

593
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.890
<v Speaker 1>creepy way or real quick to assume that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you think they're cute.</v>

594
00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.280
<v Speaker 1>It's got about 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes to look to is that water is </v>

595
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:00.440
<v Speaker 1>kind of fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they make food.</v>

596
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Hey my little food factories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they would make a thousand of them,</v>

597
00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many do they make?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many?</v>

598
00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Probably 100 eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then there's like 100 of them in any </v>

599
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:16.940
<v Speaker 1>10 x 10 nests and that's one survives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you see a big turtle,</v>

600
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you eat turtle soup,</v>

601
00:26:19.791 --> 00:26:21.690
<v Speaker 1>remember that I don't eat turtle soup </v>
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>

602
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Well they do in Japan was in Hawaii and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

603
00:26:24.081 --> 00:26:24.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

604
00:26:24.771 --> 00:26:25.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big island,</v>

605
00:26:25.671 --> 00:26:30.671
<v Speaker 1>the turtles just chill on the shore and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just hanging out there and signs saying </v>

606
00:26:30.671 --> 00:26:31.790
<v Speaker 1>don't starve them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>

607
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:36.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was at a resort and people just walk </v>

608
00:26:36.791 --> 00:26:36.791
<v Speaker 1>by them.</v>

609
00:26:36.791 --> 00:26:36.791
<v Speaker 1>It really was to be included,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the turtles,</v>

610
00:26:36.791 --> 00:26:39.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at this crazy life form.</v>

611
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:43.350
<v Speaker 1>You're so used to it that it just seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>

612
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a turtle.</v>

613
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a turtle.</v>

614
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:50.220
<v Speaker 1>But then if you take yourself out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that context of familiarity and you,</v>

615
00:26:50.221 --> 00:26:51.040
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

616
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.680
<v Speaker 1>just get a look at what that life form </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like.</v>

617
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:58.500
<v Speaker 1>That thing is a shield on its back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it sucks.</v>

618
00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:03.510
<v Speaker 1>It's grotty into this hard case and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming around in the ocean.</v>

619
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:07.620
<v Speaker 1>It's living out there going under and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it comes up on the beach too.</v>

620
00:27:07.621 --> 00:27:10.140
<v Speaker 1>It does whatever the fuck it was when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were done scuba diving,</v>

621
00:27:10.141 --> 00:27:12.750
<v Speaker 1>we saw this pot of beautiful little </v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins,</v>

622
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.030
<v Speaker 1>bottlenose porpoises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the kind of dolphins,</v>

623
00:27:15.031 --> 00:27:20.031
<v Speaker 1>a little gray ones you see that jump out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the that you swim with and it was a </v>

624
00:27:20.031 --> 00:27:20.910
<v Speaker 1>group of them and they swim with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>boat.</v>

625
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:25.970
<v Speaker 1>They live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know you're there and they'll swim </v>

626
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.771
<v Speaker 1>with you and they swim at the boat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they jump out of the air and they flip </v>

627
00:27:27.771 --> 00:27:28.620
<v Speaker 1>and they're literally showing off here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no question about it.</v>

628
00:27:28.621 --> 00:27:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said to the guy,</v>

629
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I wish we'd seen them when we're scuba </v>
<v Speaker 1>diving.</v>

630
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:37.250
<v Speaker 1>I could've played with one and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would never see them when you're </v>

631
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.250
<v Speaker 1>scuba diving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

632
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.380
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're right there.</v>

633
00:27:37.381 --> 00:27:39.420
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't like the bubbles.</v>

634
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.960
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't come near you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it freaked me out.</v>

635
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:43.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went,</v>

636
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.810
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was French and he said it in French,</v>

637
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:51.050
<v Speaker 1>but I like being theatrical because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was really creepy and on the back of my </v>

638
00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:51.110
<v Speaker 1>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

639
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.400
<v Speaker 1>it was breathing and he was wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was he doing behind me?</v>

640
00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:53.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

641
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.370
<v Speaker 1>I was drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drank too much.</v>

642
00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:01.490
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No was to hate him and I just wanted to </v>

695
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.580
<v Speaker 1>not a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he reached behind the clock.</v>

696
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:19.590
<v Speaker 1>I stuck his hand up the things ass and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled whatever he could out and the </v>

697
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:21.530
<v Speaker 1>crocodile let go of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

698
00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He reached into his ass.</v>

699
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.560
<v Speaker 1>He reached into a task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know if that's possible.</v>

700
00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Let's just map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the world where it crushes the </v>

701
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.570
<v Speaker 1>shells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

702
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:36.570
<v Speaker 1>is that an alligator?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it looks like an </v>

703
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:36.570
<v Speaker 1>alligator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That looks like a crock.</v>

704
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one.</v>

705
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:42.540
<v Speaker 1>I believe they have the strongest bite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The American alligator to smashing right</v>

706
00:30:42.701 --> 00:30:43.150
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

707
00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I hope that's not the turtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

708
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Make that noise before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

709
00:30:50.501 --> 00:30:52.300
<v Speaker 1>but look at the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the noise.</v>

710
00:30:52.301 --> 00:30:53.950
<v Speaker 1>The turtles making that noise because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's killing it.</v>

711
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly.</v>

712
00:30:56.921 --> 00:31:01.921
<v Speaker 1>The video is talking about looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to eat the shell and </v>

713
00:31:01.921 --> 00:31:04.420
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at it just keeps crushing.</v>

714
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.720
<v Speaker 1>What a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing is.</v>

715
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Come on Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie fucked up.</v>

716
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hear sounds of turtles </v>
<v Speaker 1>being tortured,</v>

717
00:31:17.321 --> 00:31:18.010
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

718
00:31:18.011 --> 00:31:23.011
<v Speaker 1>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at how it just crushing it's body </v>

719
00:31:23.011 --> 00:31:25.420
<v Speaker 1>sane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That didn't look at his eyes.</v>

720
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Just stupid fucking eating machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

721
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:32.040
<v Speaker 1>A dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a straight up dinosaur,</v>

722
00:31:32.041 --> 00:31:33.850
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we'd say stupid,</v>

723
00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:38.880
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously the capacity for being</v>

724
00:31:38.891 --> 00:31:43.630
<v Speaker 1>even interested in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The giant Crocs I guess lose their teeth</v>

725
00:31:43.631 --> 00:31:48.631
<v Speaker 1>by the time they're like 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure and I'm sure that things are </v>

726
00:31:48.631 --> 00:31:49.420
<v Speaker 1>going to lose his teeth to title they </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

727
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Other crux,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a giant mouth fights.</v>

728
00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:55.210
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We mean the thing serves its purpose.</v>

729
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean there really is no need for books</v>
<v Speaker 1>really is.</v>

730
00:31:57.841 --> 00:32:02.841
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not excited by intellectual </v>

731
00:32:02.841 --> 00:32:03.590
<v Speaker 1>discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not here to diffusion of innovation</v>

732
00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.200
<v Speaker 1>as a hunter would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

733
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a movement of ideas here for any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

734
00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:10.420
<v Speaker 1>It's here for fucking up everything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can eat.</v>

735
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's there for.</v>

736
00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.420
<v Speaker 1>It's because people and things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>turtles like to fuck.</v>

737
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:18.790
<v Speaker 1>And if they like to fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make too many of them.</v>

738
00:32:18.791 --> 00:32:21.550
<v Speaker 1>So we have to have around crocodiles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>alligators.</v>

739
00:32:21.551 --> 00:32:26.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Lions and everything else that eats </v>

740
00:32:26.551 --> 00:32:26.620
<v Speaker 1>shit driven by one driven by certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

741
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:31.660
<v Speaker 1>We're so we're so detached from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>world I think.</v>

742
00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:36.370
<v Speaker 1>I think that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the function and the sort of,</v>

743
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.010
<v Speaker 1>the biggest difference between what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to be human.</v>

744
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.180
<v Speaker 1>There's a fundamental difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

745
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:46.280
<v Speaker 1>human beings who was thinking about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>we create beauty for its own sake,</v>

746
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.780
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

747
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:53.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times even at our own expense </v>

748
00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:53.230
<v Speaker 1>at that famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's true or not,</v>

749
00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:56.741
<v Speaker 1>the legend of Michelangelo Painting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sistine Chapel and going blind because </v>

750
00:32:56.741 --> 00:32:59.720
<v Speaker 1>the paint was in his eyes inspired by </v>
<v Speaker 1>something bigger than himself.</v>

751
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Paint above them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He definitely,</v>

752
00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the historical record is now</v>

753
00:33:03.981 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 1>part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

754
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just went blind,</v>

755
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.000
<v Speaker 1>blamed it on the paint when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

756
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:10.130
<v Speaker 1>he was on his back for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they said,</v>

757
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:11.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

758
00:33:11.181 --> 00:33:16.181
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings have this need to be </v>

759
00:33:16.181 --> 00:33:16.181
<v Speaker 1>immortal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

760
00:33:16.181 --> 00:33:18.371
<v Speaker 1>We want to leave a mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's to our children or through </v>

761
00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:18.371
<v Speaker 1>our work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very deep,</v>

762
00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:22.190
<v Speaker 1>deep drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't like as I get older,</v>

763
00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:23.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't like just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

764
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.780
<v Speaker 1>breaking it down to simple constructs </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

765
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because I'm a romantic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather believe that we have </v>

766
00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Speaker 1>something inherent in us that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just,</v>

767
00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:37.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe an inherent inspiration,</v>

768
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.450
<v Speaker 1>a nostalgia to create something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>much bigger than ourselves.</v>

769
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:42.330
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

770
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:45.890
<v Speaker 1>that moves people to tears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brings them to their knees,</v>

771
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drops their jaw and all that stuff.</v>

772
00:33:49.191 --> 00:33:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think is fascinating.</v>

773
00:33:51.051 --> 00:33:56.051
<v Speaker 1>Like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing then back then it was the </v>

774
00:33:56.051 --> 00:33:59.231
<v Speaker 1>only way to leave that mark to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand the context of </v>

775
00:33:59.231 --> 00:33:59.231
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

776
00:33:59.231 --> 00:34:00.170
<v Speaker 1>If you think about today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could write a book,</v>

777
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.900
<v Speaker 1>you could make a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could fucking do a comedy show,</v>

778
00:34:02.901 --> 00:34:04.640
<v Speaker 1>you could do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do with that.</v>

779
00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.040
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different avenues,</v>

780
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.740
<v Speaker 1>but I'm talking also about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if animals feel like,</v>

781
00:34:09.741 --> 00:34:14.741
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you listen to a beautiful piece of </v>

782
00:34:14.741 --> 00:34:14.741
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

783
00:34:14.741 --> 00:34:16.070
<v Speaker 1>and you're driving down the road and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

784
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had that feeling where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you go.</v>

785
00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a feeling of inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

786
00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:23.510
<v Speaker 1>So you kind of feel really sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really happy.</v>

787
00:34:23.511 --> 00:34:24.740
<v Speaker 1>You want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love everybody.</v>

788
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:26.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feeling of wonder.</v>

789
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:29.390
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if animals have anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

790
00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.520
<v Speaker 1>There's no need for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have communication,</v>

791
00:34:31.521 --> 00:34:36.521
<v Speaker 1>so if you don't have communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably don't have these crazy </v>

792
00:34:36.521 --> 00:34:37.630
<v Speaker 1>weird fluctuations of their intent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

793
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.940
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lusts and desires and their,</v>

794
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.800
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their path is probably much,</v>

795
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:44.570
<v Speaker 1>much straighter and trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

796
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:46.370
<v Speaker 1>It a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

797
00:34:46.371 --> 00:34:48.590
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of intellectual masturbation,</v>

798
00:34:48.591 --> 00:34:53.591
<v Speaker 1>I guess the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just seems like I'm the only </v>

799
00:34:53.601 --> 00:34:58.601
<v Speaker 1>things that have that capacity are </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans and maybe dolphins and orcas and </v>

800
00:34:58.601 --> 00:35:00.850
<v Speaker 1>whales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whales,</v>

801
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:06.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem to have really strong bonds </v>

802
00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.520
<v Speaker 1>with their family and they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate that.</v>

803
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Telecom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that how you say his name,</v>

804
00:35:09.411 --> 00:35:12.050
<v Speaker 1>the one that died in San Diego?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it a guy or girl?</v>

805
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Good girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

806
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:14.870
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy who was the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

807
00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will from black fish is dead now.</v>

808
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Thirty five years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lived to be 80 plus and the wild </v>

809
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:23.060
<v Speaker 1>folks find that acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>

810
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:28.061
<v Speaker 1>that's a living thing that is probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>as smart as your fucking neighbor and </v>

811
00:35:28.061 --> 00:35:32.341
<v Speaker 1>it's locked in a swimming tank in San </v>
<v Speaker 1>Diego and it's fucked and now it's dead </v>

812
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.230
<v Speaker 1>and that thing bread in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made.</v>

813
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember many slave</v>

814
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:41.520
<v Speaker 2>babies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's essentially what it made.</v>

815
00:35:41.521 --> 00:35:43.620
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked.</v>

816
00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.230
<v Speaker 2>It's seaworld.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No longer doing that.</v>

817
00:35:46.231 --> 00:35:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should be in jail.</v>

818
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.670
<v Speaker 2>They should be arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

819
00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.870
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're slaving intelligent beings.</v>

820
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.640
<v Speaker 2>They just can't talk to you in a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you should understand.</v>

821
00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:57.670
<v Speaker 2>You can understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

822
00:35:57.671 --> 00:36:02.671
<v Speaker 2>So you're profiting off of enslaving </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent beings and making them do </v>

823
00:36:02.671 --> 00:36:04.320
<v Speaker 2>flips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a 1950.</v>

824
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.740
<v Speaker 2>We know what the fuck a dolphin is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know what an Orca.</v>

825
00:36:07.741 --> 00:36:09.090
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

826
00:36:09.091 --> 00:36:14.091
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are a person that is breeding </v>

827
00:36:14.091 --> 00:36:15.090
<v Speaker 2>those things in captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping them in swimming pools.</v>

828
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:19.200
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that it's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's funny is I didn't know anything I</v>

829
00:36:19.201 --> 00:36:21.330
<v Speaker 2>never thought about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know that,</v>

830
00:36:21.331 --> 00:36:26.331
<v Speaker 2>didn't think that would have told you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were probably very happy until </v>

831
00:36:26.331 --> 00:36:27.780
<v Speaker 2>blackfish came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I didn't even see because I didn't</v>

832
00:36:27.781 --> 00:36:28.320
<v Speaker 2>want to say it.</v>

833
00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:32.190
<v Speaker 2>I've had this kid filled demars on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast a couple times now and he's from</v>

834
00:36:32.191 --> 00:36:33.190
<v Speaker 2>marine land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>

835
00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:37.920
<v Speaker 2>He got fired from Greenland and he has </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone like way of his way to expo.</v>

836
00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:42.921
<v Speaker 2>It's in Canada to expose all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>violations of animal welfare and animal </v>

837
00:36:46.321 --> 00:36:51.321
<v Speaker 2>safety and all the fucking horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>practices that this place now they're </v>

838
00:36:51.321 --> 00:36:56.091
<v Speaker 2>being brought up on charges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just recently brought up on </v>

839
00:36:56.091 --> 00:36:56.091
<v Speaker 2>more charges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like He.</v>

840
00:36:56.091 --> 00:36:58.290
<v Speaker 2>He tweeted something about it just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of days ago,</v>

841
00:36:58.291 --> 00:37:01.630
<v Speaker 2>marine brought up on charges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was a walrus trainer there,</v>

842
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:06.830
<v Speaker 2>this named smooshy and he developed this</v>
<v Speaker 2>really close bond with this walrus that </v>

843
00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:07.260
<v Speaker 2>he was training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was like,</v>

844
00:37:07.261 --> 00:37:12.261
<v Speaker 2>this place is fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't give a shit about these </v>

845
00:37:12.261 --> 00:37:15.261
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't give a shit about these </v>

846
00:37:15.261 --> 00:37:15.261
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

847
00:37:15.261 --> 00:37:15.261
<v Speaker 2>and they were getting their dolphins and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their orchestra.</v>

848
00:37:15.261 --> 00:37:19.560
<v Speaker 2>They're getting them from these Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>ships that brokers get them from China.</v>

849
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're inland faces.</v>

850
00:37:21.571 --> 00:37:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Six new animal cruelty charges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

851
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Fuck up close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

852
00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:30.050
<v Speaker 2>the one for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing how small the tank was for killer</v>

853
00:37:30.051 --> 00:37:32.880
<v Speaker 2>whale to swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the charges are related to the treatment</v>

854
00:37:32.881 --> 00:37:36.180
<v Speaker 2>of an elk or red deer in a fallow deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

855
00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.280
<v Speaker 2>They have tears roaming around there.</v>

856
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Whatever your theme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less sympathetic to make smart.</v>

857
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing is just.</v>

858
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:50.420
<v Speaker 2>It's insane that it is legal to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphins and orcas captive is insane and</v>

859
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:53.700
<v Speaker 2>whales too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but obviously we are the two big.</v>

860
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:55.980
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

861
00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.170
<v Speaker 2>They're so fucking smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

862
00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:02.220
<v Speaker 2>If you've seen the image of a Dolphin's </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain right next to a human's brain,</v>

863
00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:05.670
<v Speaker 2>their brains are bigger than ours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we don't know.</v>

864
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:10.710
<v Speaker 2>We have such a clearly defined standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>for what we accept as intelligence.</v>

865
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Send me an email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's your house?</v>

866
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

867
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.750
<v Speaker 2>how much do you make a year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do for a living?</v>

868
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.430
<v Speaker 2>If you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have any of those things,</v>

869
00:38:17.431 --> 00:38:19.430
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking barbarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

870
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.240
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not really a person.</v>

871
00:38:21.241 --> 00:38:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that dolphin brain.</v>

872
00:38:22.291 --> 00:38:24.990
<v Speaker 2>So he went to look at the 10 til is </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

873
00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:25.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

874
00:38:25.321 --> 00:38:26.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

875
00:38:26.401 --> 00:38:30.690
<v Speaker 2>It's all within the confines of what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of a civilization will.</v>

876
00:38:30.691 --> 00:38:32.430
<v Speaker 2>All those things are meaningless to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphin.</v>

877
00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:34.320
<v Speaker 2>They don't have fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't need them.</v>

878
00:38:34.321 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 2>They don't pick things there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moved to three</v>

879
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:40.180
<v Speaker 1>d space in this warm water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have free food everywhere.</v>

880
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:43.060
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any need for money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no need for clothes.</v>

881
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.130
<v Speaker 1>So where does the mind go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then?</v>

882
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:49.180
<v Speaker 1>We'll see as the mind goes to comradery </v>
<v Speaker 1>or culture or songs,</v>

883
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.220
<v Speaker 1>those dolphin songs that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

884
00:38:51.221 --> 00:38:52.630
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

885
00:38:52.631 --> 00:38:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's where their thought goes,</v>

886
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.570
<v Speaker 1>but what we do know is there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking going on.</v>

887
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.550
<v Speaker 1>This is not a piece of salary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

888
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:05.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not an animal that should be </v>

889
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.670
<v Speaker 1>kept in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a pool.</v>

890
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:09.431
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even like animals that we </v>

891
00:39:09.431 --> 00:39:10.660
<v Speaker 1>really like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dog.</v>

892
00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:16.020
<v Speaker 1>This is way smarter than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an animal that is used to jump </v>

893
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:21.001
<v Speaker 1>through hoops literally and for fish and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do twirls and stuff and to pull you </v>

894
00:39:22.391 --> 00:39:23.920
<v Speaker 1>along as you ride them.</v>

895
00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or want to scan them.</v>

896
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:28.030
<v Speaker 1>And if you take that out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equation,</v>

897
00:39:28.031 --> 00:39:31.000
<v Speaker 1>that seems to me to be where seaworld </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes a lot of their money.</v>

898
00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:32.830
<v Speaker 1>I've been to that show you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

899
00:39:32.831 --> 00:39:34.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

900
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.760
<v Speaker 1>and when I was watching that show and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids were all excited,</v>

901
00:39:36.761 --> 00:39:39.430
<v Speaker 1>I never thought in any way it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>cruelty to the animal.</v>

902
00:39:39.431 --> 00:39:41.710
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like it.</v>

903
00:39:41.711 --> 00:39:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

904
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.450
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

905
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:45.340
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we could do without.</v>

906
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.760
<v Speaker 1>We could probably do without though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say it raises awareness and stuff </v>

907
00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.431
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd probably do without bullshit </v>

908
00:39:53.431 --> 00:39:53.431
<v Speaker 1>documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise awareness,</v>

909
00:39:53.431 --> 00:39:54.220
<v Speaker 1>and that's why their business is down by</v>
<v Speaker 1>a massive,</v>

910
00:39:54.221 --> 00:39:56.290
<v Speaker 1>massive amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're hurting.</v>

911
00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah.</v>

912
00:39:57.251 --> 00:39:59.410
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stock didn't really suffer at first.</v>

913
00:39:59.411 --> 00:40:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that after black fish stocks</v>
<v Speaker 1>stayed pretty strong for how long?</v>

914
00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Up?</v>

915
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:06.580
<v Speaker 1>For about a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe more.</v>

916
00:40:06.581 --> 00:40:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Their stock was not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't take a hit,</v>

917
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.920
<v Speaker 1>and then I guess as time went on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

918
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.950
<v Speaker 1>people hear about it on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start exchanging information,</v>

919
00:40:14.951 --> 00:40:16.990
<v Speaker 1>start reading about things that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing there.</v>

920
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Start reading about how long the animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in the wild versus how long they </v>

921
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:26.071
<v Speaker 1>live in captivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the dorsal fin that flops over </v>

922
00:40:26.071 --> 00:40:27.070
<v Speaker 1>because they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never have to deal with wave,</v>

923
00:40:27.071 --> 00:40:32.071
<v Speaker 1>so it atrophies really ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other dorsal fin becomes like a limp </v>

924
00:40:32.071 --> 00:40:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This flood is for.</v>

925
00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:36.150
<v Speaker 1>It's for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for steering through the water,</v>

926
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:39.580
<v Speaker 1>for handling waves and correcting your </v>
<v Speaker 1>path,</v>

927
00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:43.360
<v Speaker 1>your path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for them outside in the wild,</v>

928
00:40:43.361 --> 00:40:47.470
<v Speaker 1>it's rigid and powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in this pool where there's no waves,</v>

929
00:40:47.471 --> 00:40:49.690
<v Speaker 1>it never gets used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it flops over.</v>

930
00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

931
00:40:50.711 --> 00:40:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that show showing an </v>
<v Speaker 1>image of it?</v>

932
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.400
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that.</v>

933
00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't watch the documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was afraid it would make me.</v>

934
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like a guy doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not allowed to use his arm,</v>

935
00:40:59.651 --> 00:41:02.530
<v Speaker 1>so his one arm that just withers and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other arm is big.</v>

936
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any more to allow them.</v>

937
00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sales doorbells just flops over.</v>

938
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:14.350
<v Speaker 1>See how one in the wild as like this big</v>
<v Speaker 1>size of that rudder.</v>

939
00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they need it.</v>

940
00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.440
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dealing with waves.</v>

941
00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:22.840
<v Speaker 1>You imagine it's ugly man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an ugly practice and as much as </v>

942
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.270
<v Speaker 1>those things do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump up on that platform and do get that</v>

943
00:41:25.271 --> 00:41:27.910
<v Speaker 1>fish and do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the flips and make everybody happy.</v>

944
00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:33.420
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also I feel like if they really to </v>

945
00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:38.351
<v Speaker 1>have a relationship with these orcas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the correct way to do it would be to </v>

946
00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:43.780
<v Speaker 1>have some sort of a meeting ground where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they meet these orchids and they get </v>

947
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:45.440
<v Speaker 1>them to do things for fish.</v>

948
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.280
<v Speaker 1>They get them to do tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll start.</v>

949
00:41:47.281 --> 00:41:50.870
<v Speaker 1>So like an open area of the ocean can go</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever the fuck they want,</v>

950
00:41:50.871 --> 00:41:53.150
<v Speaker 1>but if they want to come back around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang out,</v>

951
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.410
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

952
00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:56.720
<v Speaker 1>like maybe we'll get to do an orchid </v>
<v Speaker 1>show today,</v>

953
00:41:56.721 --> 00:42:01.721
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know that having them in </v>

954
00:42:01.721 --> 00:42:02.270
<v Speaker 1>captivity and lifting up a cage and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>swim through and all that horseshit.</v>

955
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's fucked.</v>

956
00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything in the ocean fear the Orca.</v>

957
00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:08.790
<v Speaker 1>I think pretty much they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even whites,</v>

958
00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

959
00:42:09.501 --> 00:42:14.501
<v Speaker 1>They fuck great whites up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eat them because they said that </v>

960
00:42:14.501 --> 00:42:17.441
<v Speaker 1>they played,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Paul de Gelder who lost his arm </v>

961
00:42:17.441 --> 00:42:20.171
<v Speaker 1>and his hand in his leg to a bull shark </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Sydney Bay City Bay doing routine </v>

962
00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:21.380
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

963
00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.840
<v Speaker 1>is he the guy that has a carbon fiber </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

964
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>

965
00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:27.590
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's pretty cool.</v>

966
00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:30.360
<v Speaker 1>He squeezed my hand hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't really squeeze.</v>

967
00:42:30.361 --> 00:42:32.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a $90,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake hand.</v>

968
00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

969
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:38.650
<v Speaker 1>And he squeezed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was an Australian navy seal and it </v>

970
00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:41.690
<v Speaker 1>feels good to finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody can't write.</v>

971
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that guy who was my scuba </v>

972
00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:47.080
<v Speaker 1>instructor will tell you.</v>

974
00:42:49.731 --> 00:42:51.680

<v Speaker 1>I think at one point.</v>

975
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

976

<v Speaker 1>He's a good looking guy and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously girls are like,</v>

977
00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's give it a shot.</v>

978
00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

<v Speaker 1>All I know is I've always been self </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious of my left arm.</v>

984
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I feel it's a little skinny.</v>

985
00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Especially in using your right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My right is fucking ridiculous.</v>

986
00:43:15.381 --> 00:43:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Look at that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why is it different in my mind today</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

993
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.590

00:45:30.471 --> 00:45:30.471
<v Speaker 1>pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1041
00:45:30.471 --> 00:45:33.711
<v Speaker 1>A Guy I'll carry around just like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a flashlight or a gel pussy and </v>

1042
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:37.770
<v Speaker 1>bang it and in the bathroom and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>office break right while he watches porn</v>

1043
00:45:37.771 --> 00:45:38.850
<v Speaker 1>on his phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it might be,</v>

1044
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:43.950
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about a robot when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to get it really human.</v>

1045
00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:48.560
<v Speaker 1>He apparently from their research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>

1046
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying this guy comes up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's working on sexual robots,</v>

1047
00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:56.331
<v Speaker 1>but like he said that you see there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about creating a robot that's </v>

1048
00:45:56.331 --> 00:46:01.071
<v Speaker 1>so human like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's just something missing like </v>

1049
00:46:01.071 --> 00:46:03.900
<v Speaker 1>the expression in the eyes or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it gets to a point where you get it.</v>

1050
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:06.140
<v Speaker 1>When you get it as real as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1051
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:07.620
<v Speaker 1>as real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as real as possible.</v>

1052
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.230
<v Speaker 1>It people will fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1053
00:46:10.231 --> 00:46:12.060
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when it gets so real,</v>

1054
00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:17.061
<v Speaker 1>they'll go up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not know you're trying to be too </v>

1055
00:46:17.061 --> 00:46:17.061
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1056
00:46:17.061 --> 00:46:18.030
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to make eyes that don't.</v>

1057
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.230
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's missing.</v>

1058
00:46:19.231 --> 00:46:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Something's weird here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something and,</v>

1059
00:46:20.571 --> 00:46:23.070
<v Speaker 1>and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it apparently shuts people off right</v>

1060
00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:24.600
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

1061
00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.090
<v Speaker 1>It just would freak you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1062
00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1063
00:46:28.471 --> 00:46:30.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so close.</v>

1064
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:31.650
<v Speaker 1>It's so close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1065
00:46:31.651 --> 00:46:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you get hard for that?</v>

1066
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.670
<v Speaker 1>That would be too weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1067
00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.190
<v Speaker 1>you would feel so strange if you fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>a robot for.</v>

1068
00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.290
<v Speaker 1>You'd feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any moment.</v>

1069
00:46:40.291 --> 00:46:42.080
<v Speaker 1>That thing could kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever.</v>

1070
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Exactly clear them and more importantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>for choking you.</v>

1071
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.500
<v Speaker 1>But way more importantly is that more </v>
<v Speaker 1>importantly,</v>

1072
00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:54.580
<v Speaker 1>if you got lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got the lady thinking about fighting</v>

1073
00:46:55.591 --> 00:46:57.300
<v Speaker 1>for my life against this robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to fuck.</v>

1074
00:46:57.301 --> 00:46:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we get low when we start </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about dirty shit.</v>

1075
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:02.970
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno why to talk like that when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be sexy.</v>

1076
00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like things that don't work,</v>

1077
00:47:04.921 --> 00:47:08.430
<v Speaker 1>but people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you talk like this,</v>

1078
00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:09.890
<v Speaker 1>it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1079
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:14.430
<v Speaker 1>it's not because that's not scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we've got it in our head.</v>

1080
00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.870
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he boys looking for company.</v>

1081
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1082
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I just liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You immediately,</v>

1083
00:47:24.211 --> 00:47:29.211
<v Speaker 1>before we got to the factor that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl when I like strawberries and what </v>

1084
00:47:29.211 --> 00:47:29.440
<v Speaker 1>was the other thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1085
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.990
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First thing I did,</v>

1086
00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:33.400
<v Speaker 1>I immediately.</v>

1087
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like certain signals that gay </v>

1088
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.870
<v Speaker 1>guys will just throw up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll know.</v>

1089
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge share fan.</v>

1090
00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Koto a Barbara streisand concert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gay is everywhere.</v>

1091
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they have,</v>

1092
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:50.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the fun things I guess about</v>

1093
00:47:50.081 --> 00:47:52.210
<v Speaker 1>being gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have these uh,</v>

1094
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:56.860
<v Speaker 1>female diva like idols that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>worship,</v>

1095
00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:01.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like shares a giant one in a billion </v>

1096
00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:01.950
<v Speaker 1>wicked thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1097
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:07.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really great book written by two </v>

1098
00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:07.170
<v Speaker 1>neuroscientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1099
00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:07.170
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1100
00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:08.770
<v Speaker 1>and the average gay penis is a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>inch,</v>

1101
00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:13.980
<v Speaker 1>half inch longer than the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight pick penis and also the gay </v>

1102
00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:14.260
<v Speaker 1>brain apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1103
00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:17.490
<v Speaker 1>so the gay brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1104
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1105
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:21.360
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not affects at this time on the real</v>

1106
00:48:21.361 --> 00:48:26.361
<v Speaker 1>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fixed that you can take </v>

1107
00:48:26.361 --> 00:48:26.361
<v Speaker 1>scientist out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that phrase,</v>

1108
00:48:26.361 --> 00:48:27.490
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they found is that.</v>

1109
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.510
<v Speaker 1>So why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

1110
00:48:28.511 --> 00:48:33.511
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why all these men who love Barbra </v>

1111
00:48:33.511 --> 00:48:33.511
<v Speaker 1>streisand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they mostly gay?</v>

1112
00:48:33.511 --> 00:48:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1113
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are,</v>

1114
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.940
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the research that I've done</v>

1115
00:48:39.941 --> 00:48:42.940
<v Speaker 1>in my backyard and on this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a great book,</v>

1116
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:43.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1117
00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:48.860
<v Speaker 1>and I got it from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was gad sad maybe who was </v>

1118
00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:48.860
<v Speaker 1>recommending or talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

1119
00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:49.930
<v Speaker 1>it was Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I read it,</v>

1120
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

1121
00:48:51.851 --> 00:48:54.970
<v Speaker 1>there are fundamental differences with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the,</v>

1122
00:48:55.090 --> 00:49:00.090
<v Speaker 1>the man whose gaze brain reacts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things in relation to how the </v>

1123
00:49:01.391 --> 00:49:04.330
<v Speaker 1>average straight brain works reacts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>

1124
00:49:04.331 --> 00:49:09.331
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of dicey situation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory because we don't know all the </v>

1125
00:49:09.331 --> 00:49:10.780
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but according to all the other research,</v>

1126
00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:15.900
<v Speaker 1>why is the gay penis a half inch longer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it may have to do with the </v>

1127
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Androgens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the presence of more androgens I guess,</v>

1128
00:49:20.591 --> 00:49:25.591
<v Speaker 1>or a type more testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is in the uterus at a </v>

1129
00:49:25.591 --> 00:49:29.011
<v Speaker 1>certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which may be why some people are born </v>

1130
00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:34.620
<v Speaker 1>gay and other people because it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you're born with and some </v>

1131
00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.130
<v Speaker 1>people are born straight and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing.</v>

1132
00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm being very binary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think though that it is possible </v>

1133
00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:43.960
<v Speaker 1>to be born straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somewhere along your,</v>

1134
00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:48.000
<v Speaker 1>along the lines of your life become </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to this,</v>

1135
00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:50.230
<v Speaker 1>to the same sex and be gay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1136
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to pretend he doesn't.</v>

1137
00:49:53.111 --> 00:49:54.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1138
00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to say I don't know a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot more ever since trump won because I </v>

1139
00:49:59.220 --> 00:49:59.350
<v Speaker 1>was very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1140
00:49:59.351 --> 00:50:01.600
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you another reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to win guys,</v>

1141
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:04.210
<v Speaker 1>because some people think that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn gay behavior,</v>

1142
00:50:04.211 --> 00:50:09.211
<v Speaker 1>which is why it was so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are really terrified of of </v>

1143
00:50:09.211 --> 00:50:10.000
<v Speaker 1>gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to get turned gay.</v>

1144
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Those people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be.</v>

1145
00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:17.940
<v Speaker 1>They might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can be around guys fucking all the </v>

1146
00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:17.940
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You yes you,</v>

1147
00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.540
<v Speaker 1>but you're not an easily influenced guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that regard.</v>

1148
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Like there was some fucking people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that you just know you could talk </v>

1149
00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.800
<v Speaker 1>into sucking your Dick if you were gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just know that it might not be gay.</v>

1150
00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Like shop for example.</v>

1151
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how dare.</v>

1152
00:50:29.971 --> 00:50:31.200
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not here to defend it.</v>

1153
00:50:31.201 --> 00:50:36.201
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain percentage of the </v>

1154
00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:37.730
<v Speaker 2>population that could be shifted around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could.</v>

1155
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.760
<v Speaker 2>They'll dell adopt an English accent if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they live in England for a week.</v>

1156
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:43.190
<v Speaker 2>You're sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a certain percentage.</v>

1157
00:50:43.191 --> 00:50:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Peer pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1158
00:50:44.691 --> 00:50:48.080
<v Speaker 2>they'll suck a dick for peer to turn gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have better friends.</v>

1159
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:52.910
<v Speaker 2>So let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that you can't say that better</v>

1160
00:50:52.911 --> 00:50:55.160
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that's true and I don't</v>

1161
00:50:55.161 --> 00:51:00.161
<v Speaker 2>think there's anything wrong with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily because why is that any </v>

1162
00:51:00.161 --> 00:51:02.861
<v Speaker 2>better than being or worse rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>being indoctrinated into a certain </v>

1163
00:51:02.861 --> 00:51:06.500
<v Speaker 2>school of music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like will you all listening to tribe,</v>

1164
00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:07.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1165
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:12.100
<v Speaker 2>Why is it any different than a religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>or anything else that people get super </v>

1166
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:12.920
<v Speaker 2>sucked into and they altered their </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior?</v>

1167
00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:18.100
<v Speaker 2>I had one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one gay feeling like feeling a </v>

1168
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.900
<v Speaker 2>feeling if I'm really honest with </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>

1169
00:51:19.901 --> 00:51:22.130
<v Speaker 2>like flashdance what a feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it was when I.</v>

1170
00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.890
<v Speaker 2>When I believed in my heart that me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Cruise were friends.</v>

1171
00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:30.220
<v Speaker 2>When I got to talk to him for about an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour and a half and we're having a deep </v>

1172
00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:33.701
<v Speaker 2>discussion and of course met him before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because I did a reading with him </v>

1173
00:51:33.701 --> 00:51:36.260
<v Speaker 2>and we were having this great talk and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was even like teasing them going,</v>

1174
00:51:36.261 --> 00:51:37.690
<v Speaker 2>what's it like to be the king?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did just.</v>

1175
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you have certain shows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1176
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:41.530
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a good conversation with her,</v>

1177
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.880
<v Speaker 2>but I remember thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this guy's gay,</v>

1178
00:51:43.881 --> 00:51:48.881
<v Speaker 2>he's very cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a little face and I thought to </v>

1179
00:51:48.881 --> 00:51:51.401
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's gay and he really wanted to </v>

1180
00:51:51.401 --> 00:51:51.401
<v Speaker 2>be my friend and I can hang out with him</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was drunk enough.</v>

1181
00:51:51.401 --> 00:51:53.150
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you can take your whole hog</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's my self.</v>

1182
00:51:53.151 --> 00:51:54.320
<v Speaker 2>It's got a little face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1183
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.840
<v Speaker 2>don't talk about my Dick here.</v>

1184
00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about my mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1185
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:59.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't need you to talk about the Dick </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sucking.</v>

1186
00:51:59.571 --> 00:52:00.830
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His face.</v>

1187
00:52:00.831 --> 00:52:03.530
<v Speaker 2>If it's a small face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to pick a guy to fuck.</v>

1188
00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:05.420
<v Speaker 2>You definitely want one that can blow </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1189
00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1191
00:52:07.761 --> 00:52:12.761
<v Speaker 2>not heads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it's a big head than you can get </v>

1192
00:52:12.761 --> 00:52:12.761

<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1196
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:22.070
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be comfortable around </v>
<v Speaker 2>ratchet and hard surfaces.</v>

1197
00:52:22.071 --> 00:52:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want more soft surfaces?</v>

1198
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Shoe it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get some butterflies or sticking </v>

1199
00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:29.060
<v Speaker 2>stuff into their lips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what are they doing?</v>

1200
00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.510
<v Speaker 2>They're accentuating soft surface area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1201
00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:32.300
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to get you more excited </v>
<v Speaker 2>about them.</v>

1202
00:52:32.301 --> 00:52:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Put Your Dick in her mouth.</v>

1203
00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:35.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm also a fan of that and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd make Tom too.</v>

1204
00:52:35.311 --> 00:52:37.160
<v Speaker 2>If we were dating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met fast by the way.</v>

1205
00:52:37.161 --> 00:52:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Women are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're shooting their lips up again.</v>

1206
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:41.960
<v Speaker 2>It's getting more prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See it all the time.</v>

1207
00:52:41.961 --> 00:52:43.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

1208
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:44.260
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1209
00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.710
<v Speaker 2>I'll get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently now they can do it where it's</v>

1210
00:52:45.711 --> 00:52:47.180
<v Speaker 2>not so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1211
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Or before they were doing it and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lips would be hard and that kind of </v>

1212
00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:53.840
<v Speaker 2>freaked people out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a problem with the hard lips,</v>

1213
00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:56.360
<v Speaker 2>five years I've kissed hard lips before </v>
<v Speaker 2>if kiss fake lips.</v>

1214
00:52:56.570 --> 00:53:01.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't like what's just a bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 2>compromise because the one of the </v>

1215
00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:05.621
<v Speaker 2>sexiest things about kissing is like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling of someone's lips moving with </v>

1216
00:53:05.621 --> 00:53:08.510
<v Speaker 2>your lips and their tongue moving with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your tongue and then all of a sudden you</v>

1217
00:53:08.511 --> 00:53:13.511
<v Speaker 2>have this like third partner there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>implant and you feel it and you're </v>

1218
00:53:13.511 --> 00:53:18.101
<v Speaker 2>rubbing it around and each other's </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouths and it's like what is in your </v>

1219
00:53:18.101 --> 00:53:21.611
<v Speaker 2>lip?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what lip and then there's </v>

1220
00:53:21.611 --> 00:53:22.940
<v Speaker 2>like you got an Oreo lip cream filling </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this lip.</v>

1221
00:53:22.941 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 2>There's some shit going on in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they've said that some people</v>

1222
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.500
<v Speaker 1>are driven by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you and I look at a woman,</v>

1223
00:53:28.501 --> 00:53:30.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We look at her lips big,</v>

1224
00:53:30.001 --> 00:53:31.500
<v Speaker 1>so I love big lips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red lips,</v>

1225
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:33.420
<v Speaker 1>soft lips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at her breasts,</v>

1226
00:53:33.421 --> 00:53:36.330
<v Speaker 1>she looked and I think to myself what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would feel like,</v>

1227
00:53:36.331 --> 00:53:37.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The what?</v>

1228
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:42.710
<v Speaker 1>I guess what triggers me is the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what those lips would feel like to kiss </v>

1229
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:46.491
<v Speaker 1>or grab and becomes this primal thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they say some people are more drawn </v>

1230
00:53:46.491 --> 00:53:51.380
<v Speaker 1>driven by like the visual stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some guys prefer fake tits.</v>

1231
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:53.760
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they even liked them to look fake.</v>

1232
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:58.940
<v Speaker 1>They like big lips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guys will tell their girls to get </v>

1233
00:53:58.940 --> 00:53:59.070
<v Speaker 1>big lips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll tell their girls to get,</v>

1234
00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big fake tits because they'd rather that</v>

1235
00:54:01.051 --> 00:54:06.051
<v Speaker 1>even though they're hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're willing to compromise the feel </v>

1236
00:54:06.051 --> 00:54:09.830
<v Speaker 1>for the visual and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so depending on what you're driven </v>

1237
00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:10.590
<v Speaker 1>by that is.</v>

1238
00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:12.930
<v Speaker 1>There's a book written about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't remember the book,</v>

1239
00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:17.520
<v Speaker 1>but I'm in a very small portion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are driven by auditory stimulus.</v>

1240
00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.430
<v Speaker 1>So your voice might be enough to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl going.</v>

1241
00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:21.760
<v Speaker 1>You could look like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1242
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:23.970
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's not attractive,</v>

1243
00:54:23.971 --> 00:54:28.971
<v Speaker 1>but your voice is what gets her going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it all depends on what triggers </v>

1244
00:54:29.071 --> 00:54:30.840
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're overwhelming,</v>

1245
00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:34.740
<v Speaker 1>sort of what the connection is to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>senses.</v>

1246
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:37.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probably the biggest one,</v>

1247
00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:42.350
<v Speaker 1>the biggest difference from men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women is the desire for successful </v>

1248
00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:45.000
<v Speaker 1>companion and men don't give a fuck if a</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman's successful.</v>

1249
00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:46.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't at all.</v>

1250
00:54:46.711 --> 00:54:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I was going to ask you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it is?</v>

1251
00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Because it's not just about beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going back to that robot thing,</v>

1252
00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:52.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've dated,</v>

1253
00:54:52.291 --> 00:54:54.180
<v Speaker 1>we've always had beautiful women in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1254
00:54:54.181 --> 00:54:54.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1255
00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's always one you,</v>

1256
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:59.730
<v Speaker 1>you fall on who you're compatible with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of women,</v>

1257
00:54:59.731 --> 00:55:00.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1258
00:55:00.061 --> 00:55:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I've loved many women in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

1259
00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:05.490
<v Speaker 1>there's something about some women that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets you to shack up with them.</v>

1260
00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing with friends too.</v>

1261
00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:08.550

<v Speaker 1>Why do you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

1263
00:55:10.801 --> 00:55:11.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like right away,</v>

1264
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.590
<v Speaker 1>like I met you when we're on a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mad TV and like</v>

1265
00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:15.800
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 20 minutes,</v>

1266
00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.920
<v Speaker 2>like make me stick together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick together.</v>

1267
00:55:18.921 --> 00:55:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be okay.</v>

1268
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:23.240
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found what I mean,</v>

1269
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:25.340
<v Speaker 2>we've been best friends from that moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1270
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:28.130
<v Speaker 2>like literally we were close </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately,</v>

1271
00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:29.990
<v Speaker 2>but there's other people that you meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

1272
00:55:29.991 --> 00:55:32.930
<v Speaker 2>fuck right and get outta here and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be fine.</v>

1273
00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:34.700
<v Speaker 2>And then someone might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1274
00:55:34.701 --> 00:55:36.200
<v Speaker 2>have you met Mike?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's amazing.</v>

1275
00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.220
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1276
00:55:37.221 --> 00:55:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Mike's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1277
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:39.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm bored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1278
00:55:39.291 --> 00:55:40.290
<v Speaker 2>you're bored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bored.</v>

1279
00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:41.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

1280
00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that just personalities who don't </v>

1281
00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:46.370
<v Speaker 2>resonate with drive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people fucking crazy.</v>

1282
00:55:46.371 --> 00:55:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Your wife loves it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1283
00:55:47.721 --> 00:55:50.840
<v Speaker 2>it's like who you are versus who they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

1284
00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:53.540
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes it goes like this shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1285
00:55:53.541 --> 00:55:58.541
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fingers of the hand fit into the </v>

1286
00:55:58.541 --> 00:56:00.461
<v Speaker 2>fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other hand and everything's great </v>

1287
00:56:00.461 --> 00:56:00.660
<v Speaker 2>chemical and other times it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're clashing teeth and you know,</v>

1288
00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:02.330
<v Speaker 2>you ever kissed somebody in clash teeth.</v>

1289
00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:04.070
<v Speaker 2>You know what in the fuck are we doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

1290
00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:09.090
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neither one of us know what the hell </v>

1291
00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:09.090
<v Speaker 2>we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinic.</v>

1292
00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:10.560
<v Speaker 2>It's just perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1293
00:56:10.850 --> 00:56:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sex is like that too.</v>

1294
00:56:13.251 --> 00:56:15.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's rhythmic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It moves,</v>

1295
00:56:15.321 --> 00:56:20.321
<v Speaker 2>it flows and other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just clunky and it's the same </v>

1296
00:56:20.321 --> 00:56:24.131
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the same person and for whatever </v>

1297
00:56:24.131 --> 00:56:24.930
<v Speaker 2>reason it might not them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be you.</v>

1298
00:56:24.931 --> 00:56:27.590
<v Speaker 2>It might be the two of you together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just fucking and that.</v>

1299
00:56:27.591 --> 00:56:32.591
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism that makes this weird world </v>

1300
00:56:32.591 --> 00:56:33.490
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human beings,</v>

1301
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:37.810
<v Speaker 2>the way I view them are a gigantic super</v>
<v Speaker 2>organism working towards some sort of an</v>

1302
00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:42.811
<v Speaker 2>unknown technological goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like if I had to do a one </v>

1303
00:56:42.811 --> 00:56:44.890
<v Speaker 2>sentence overview of the human race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I would say and I think that</v>

1304
00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:50.070
<v Speaker 2>somewhere along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our individual personalities and our </v>

1305
00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:51.820
<v Speaker 2>individual hobbies and obsessions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>desires,</v>

1306
00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:57.210
<v Speaker 2>all of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although they appear to be coming from </v>

1307
00:56:57.210 --> 00:57:00.180
<v Speaker 2>us uniquely and us as an individual and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even though we relate to tribes who are </v>

1308
00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:00.520
<v Speaker 2>also into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1309
00:57:00.521 --> 00:57:05.110
<v Speaker 2>whatever Jujitsu or kettle bells or </v>
<v Speaker 2>ballet or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1310
00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately all these pieces fit into </v>
<v Speaker 2>place as these portions of this super </v>

1311
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:17.400
<v Speaker 2>organism that make things flow in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward direction and whether you're </v>

1312
00:57:17.411 --> 00:57:22.411
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with architecture or whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're obsessed with achieving peak </v>

1313
00:57:22.411 --> 00:57:24.430
<v Speaker 2>fitness or running a thousand miles in </v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour,</v>

1314
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:30.150
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those things are working together</v>

1315
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:35.610
<v Speaker 2>collectively in the entire super </v>
<v Speaker 2>organism of the human race and they're </v>

1316
00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:40.411
<v Speaker 2>working towards some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological goal because that's the </v>

1317
00:57:40.411 --> 00:57:41.680
<v Speaker 2>technological world and the world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological innovation.</v>

1318
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:45.760
<v Speaker 2>It's slowly but surely integrating </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself into our lives.</v>

1319
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.740
<v Speaker 2>If we looked at it objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd be like,</v>

1320
00:57:47.741 --> 00:57:52.741
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like a life form that's asking </v>

1321
00:57:52.741 --> 00:57:55.411
<v Speaker 2>to be born from the husks of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization like it's gonna go inside </v>

1322
00:57:55.481 --> 00:58:00.481
<v Speaker 2>of us and it's going to give birth like </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of aquatic worm that comes out</v>

1323
00:58:00.701 --> 00:58:03.310
<v Speaker 2>of a fucking grasshopper talks into </v>
<v Speaker 2>jumping into a pond.</v>

1324
00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:07.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it's interesting that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings are spending enough time creating</v>

1325
00:58:07.641 --> 00:58:12.641
<v Speaker 1>virtual experiences so that eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the trajectory of this </v>

1326
00:58:12.641 --> 00:58:17.471
<v Speaker 1>and the technology under a play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be able to have </v>

1327
00:58:17.471 --> 00:58:20.090
<v Speaker 1>experiences of what it's like to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else.</v>

1328
00:58:20.091 --> 00:58:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1329
00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:23.240
<v Speaker 1>So if you can download it into their </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain or whatever,</v>

1330
00:58:23.241 --> 00:58:28.241
<v Speaker 1>we're already there already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this thing called the empathy </v>

1331
00:58:28.241 --> 00:58:30.971
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the same where you go to a room </v>

1332
00:58:30.971 --> 00:58:32.450
<v Speaker 1>and they bring the Syrian refugee crisis</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

1333
00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:37.530
<v Speaker 1>They put you put on a virtual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these virtual goggles and you're inside </v>

1334
00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:40.040
<v Speaker 1>the tent of a rush refugee family in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>refugee camp.</v>

1335
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Kids are playing the mom and dad or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're cooking food and you can see it.</v>

1336
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:46.670
<v Speaker 1>You can hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can feel it,</v>

1337
00:58:46.671 --> 00:58:51.671
<v Speaker 1>and they're all around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's three dimensional and it gives you </v>

1338
00:58:51.671 --> 00:58:53.090
<v Speaker 1>a sense of what programs is for programs</v>
<v Speaker 1>to museum.</v>

1339
00:58:53.090 --> 00:58:54.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a museum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1340
00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:56.300
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the collection of virtual reality</v>

1341
00:58:56.301 --> 00:58:58.880
<v Speaker 1>experiences to help us see the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the eyes of another.</v>

1342
00:58:58.881 --> 00:59:01.910
<v Speaker 1>This is a beautiful idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What an amazing idea.</v>

1343
00:59:01.911 --> 00:59:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happened on the back that up,</v>

1344
00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:05.960
<v Speaker 1>back up so I could read it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so back it up.</v>

1345
00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could back up the video.</v>

1346
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:09.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't rewind it.</v>

1347
00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1348
00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the video on their website.</v>

1349
00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:13.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1350
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.280
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't that amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you can experience what it's like</v>

1351
00:59:16.281 --> 00:59:21.281
<v Speaker 1>to be someone else who's been through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard time and realize in many ways that </v>

1352
00:59:21.501 --> 00:59:26.501
<v Speaker 1>they're very human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why have all these emotional triggers </v>

1353
00:59:26.501 --> 00:59:28.721
<v Speaker 1>around Arabs and stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I grew up in the Arab world and </v>

1354
00:59:28.721 --> 00:59:28.721
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very much people to me,</v>

1355
00:59:28.721 --> 00:59:29.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Middle East,</v>

1356
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:34.930
<v Speaker 1>that this system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this strange place with all those </v>

1357
00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:34.940
<v Speaker 1>fanatics that when you grow up there the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way I did,</v>

1358
00:59:34.941 --> 00:59:36.350
<v Speaker 1>you lived there for eight years of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1359
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.050
<v Speaker 1>You have a very different point of view </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Middle East and the Arabs.</v>

1360
00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:44.100
<v Speaker 1>What I think of when I think of Arabs is</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a smiling face and a welcoming </v>

1361
00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:48.520
<v Speaker 1>mat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see somebody who is making me tea and </v>

1362
00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:49.070
<v Speaker 1>bringing me into their house and given </v>
<v Speaker 1>me food.</v>

1363
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I see a group of them who are laughing </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ass off and having a blast and I </v>

1364
00:59:54.370 --> 00:59:57.950
<v Speaker 1>see people hugging and holding hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just how I grew up.</v>

1365
00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:03.160
<v Speaker 1>So I have an emotional trigger when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear people stereotype Arabs in a </v>

1366
01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:03.160
<v Speaker 1>certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1367
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.440
<v Speaker 1>It's just an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's because I had that </v>

1368
01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.501
<v Speaker 1>virtual experience and I love this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>because as we are able to experience </v>

1369
01:00:11.511 --> 01:00:15.200
<v Speaker 1>what it's like to be someone else and </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize how similar they are to us,</v>

1370
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:20.530
<v Speaker 1>despite all the cultural differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully it'll make for at least a </v>

1371
01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:20.530
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1372
01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:21.740
<v Speaker 1>you know what the problem is all is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1373
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll make for a more understanding </v>

1374
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:27.410
<v Speaker 1>world until I got to compete for fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>water and my daughter's thirsty.</v>

1375
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to have to off you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>see much seems like there's plenty of </v>

1376
01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:36.251
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest problem that we've </v>

1377
01:00:36.251 --> 01:00:38.621
<v Speaker 1>got right now is that we've been going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a war with the Middle East for </v>

1378
01:00:38.621 --> 01:00:41.990
<v Speaker 1>13 years and when you go through a war </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 13 years,</v>

1379
01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.250
<v Speaker 1>what is the Ta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1380
01:00:43.251 --> 01:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>like say if you do something like if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on heroin for six years,</v>

1381
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:52.870
<v Speaker 1>how long does it take for that to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects of your body to bounce back from</v>

1382
01:00:52.911 --> 01:00:55.130
<v Speaker 1>being on heroin for six years because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be a week,</v>

1383
01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to be a year?</v>

1384
01:00:57.261 --> 01:01:00.080
<v Speaker 1>A couple of years is going to be half </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time I was going to be three years.</v>

1385
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is.</v>

1386
01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:06.940
<v Speaker 1>You've got to think of a war as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like some sort of horrible </v>

1387
01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>trauma to an organism takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally it takes a generation.</v>

1388
01:01:09.891 --> 01:01:14.891
<v Speaker 1>At least it's like a scar that has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>heal over and it has to be worked on.</v>

1389
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have many generations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're gonna.</v>

1390
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Remember grandpa getting blown up when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in a wedding party because they </v>

1391
01:01:23.170 --> 01:01:27.341
<v Speaker 1>thought that he was with talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews about the genesis on the mall and </v>

1392
01:01:27.341 --> 01:01:29.740
<v Speaker 1>costs to the Armenians about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>genocide and you know,</v>

1393
01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>in 1914 or 18 whenever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1394
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:35.480
<v Speaker 1>they're still out in the street of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

1395
01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the.</v>

1396
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Dan Carlin talks about how there's such </v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh memories,</v>

1397
01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:46.931
<v Speaker 1>even if you say to a Chinese person that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a point of view on sort of the </v>

1398
01:01:46.931 --> 01:01:51.041
<v Speaker 1>benefits of Mongol expansion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though that was how many years it </v>

1399
01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:51.190
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

1400
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.610
<v Speaker 1>12 slash 60 or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get a lot of Chinese either.</v>

1401
01:01:55.730 --> 01:02:00.730
<v Speaker 1>You'll get a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still somehow fresh trauma lasts </v>

1402
01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:03.140
<v Speaker 1>and is passed down through generation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

1403
01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.940
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever been to Japan,</v>

1404
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that people always </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about is how the older Japanese </v>

1405
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>people do not like Americans and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking day.</v>

1406
01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:17.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we dropped two nuclear bombs on their </v>

1407
01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:17.680
<v Speaker 1>little tiny ass country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1408
01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's super hard to erase </v>

1409
01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>the memory of horrific events and the 13</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of war,</v>

1410
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>no matter whose side you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a horrific event.</v>

1411
01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>It's all in this one area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's that.</v>

1412
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:37.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of take a long time before </v>

1413
01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.720
<v Speaker 1>we can look at Arabs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you look at Arabs being there.</v>

1414
01:02:39.721 --> 01:02:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's unfortunate man.</v>

1415
01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:46.780
<v Speaker 1>It's unfortunate because it's one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those self perpetuating things like if </v>

1416
01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think people are out to get you,</v>

1417
01:02:49.381 --> 01:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>then they become out to get you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1418
01:02:51.151 --> 01:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1419
01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>you realize that you're taking these big</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant steps to keep them away from you.</v>

1420
01:02:55.510 --> 01:03:00.510
<v Speaker 1>You're prejudice against them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be upset that you're </v>

1421
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.510
<v Speaker 1>prejudiced against them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

1422
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.580
<v Speaker 1>But I love Americans because Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>always go out of their way.</v>

1423
01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Like all Americans go out of their way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like,</v>

1424
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:09.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this idea that all the trump </v>

1425
01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:09.860
<v Speaker 1>supporters are these fanatics and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're anti this net.</v>

1426
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:15.470
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee that the majority of people </v>

1427
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:18.771
<v Speaker 1>in all the states that red states would </v>
<v Speaker 1>give any Syrian or Arabic guys,</v>

1428
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I guarantee the creative would be,</v>

1429
01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:23.550
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're human beings.</v>

1430
01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to give them a chance if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're good people,</v>

1431
01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:27.030
<v Speaker 1>they're good people.</v>

1432
01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>This idea that they're terrorists eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother bugs and now I'm just niggling </v>

1433
01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>guy with a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that.</v>

1434
01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think definitely a lot of people,</v>

1435
01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:36.900
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on an individual basis,</v>

1436
01:03:36.901 --> 01:03:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee most people are intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to go.</v>

1437
01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:44.340
<v Speaker 1>I'll take him as it comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I treat individuals the way they are.</v>

1438
01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:45.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1439
01:03:45.881 --> 01:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I think we are tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're.</v>

1440
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has their own racial </v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudices and things like that,</v>

1441
01:03:50.731 --> 01:03:54.090
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's way more layered and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuanced and a lot of people,</v>

1442
01:03:54.091 --> 01:03:59.091
<v Speaker 1>but for a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people really fucking simple and their </v>

1443
01:03:59.091 --> 01:03:59.091
<v Speaker 1>ideology says that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1444
01:03:59.091 --> 01:04:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Christianity is the only way and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology of the Muslims is dangerous.</v>

1445
01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:05.820
<v Speaker 1>The Prophet Mohammed was a dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1446
01:04:05.821 --> 01:04:07.920
<v Speaker 1>These are dangerous people and we let </v>
<v Speaker 1>them over here.</v>

1447
01:04:07.921 --> 01:04:11.280
<v Speaker 1>We're taking a big chance America land </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the free home of the brave for you.</v>

1448
01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:15.570
<v Speaker 1>That may be the collective dialog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the individual.</v>

1449
01:04:15.571 --> 01:04:16.890
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most of them,</v>

1450
01:04:16.891 --> 01:04:21.891
<v Speaker 1>if somebody was Arabic and they had an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to leave their alleviate </v>

1451
01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:23.430
<v Speaker 1>their suffering by bringing them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>their house and giving them a meal.</v>

1452
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:25.130
<v Speaker 1>I think you watched so many Bruce Willis</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

1453
01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:26.640
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the.</v>

1454
01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:28.860
<v Speaker 1>The most of them would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

1455
01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most of them,</v>

1456
01:04:29.911 --> 01:04:34.911
<v Speaker 1>if they knew the people for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think overcoming prejudices against </v>

1457
01:04:34.911 --> 01:04:39.261
<v Speaker 1>cultures or religions or anything or </v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to do because once those </v>

1458
01:04:39.261 --> 01:04:42.060
<v Speaker 1>things are set in stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like your body as a warning pattern</v>

1459
01:04:42.061 --> 01:04:45.300
<v Speaker 1>that it's looking for like up these </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns repeating itself.</v>

1460
01:04:45.301 --> 01:04:47.460
<v Speaker 1>We've seen this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is religious fundamentalism.</v>

1461
01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:52.730
<v Speaker 1>This is a people that are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to blow themselves up and </v>

1462
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:55.320
<v Speaker 1>to an extent you know that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not misplaced.</v>

1463
01:04:55.321 --> 01:05:00.321
<v Speaker 1>So when I hear of a bomb going off or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy driving a truck and running over 80,</v>

1464
01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:03.360
<v Speaker 1>80 people in France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first,</v>

1465
01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:05.700
<v Speaker 1>my first guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm always right,</v>

1466
01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:10.730
<v Speaker 1>is that he's probably a young Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 1>male that doesn't make me anti Muslim.</v>

1467
01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:15.860
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make me anti Arab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just means I'm pretty good or not </v>

1468
01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:16.650
<v Speaker 1>even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to be that good at pattern.</v>

1469
01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we</v>

1470
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.790
<v Speaker 2>also have to really take into </v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration the sheer numbers of human</v>

1471
01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:26.791
<v Speaker 2>beings that we're dealing with on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>daily basis where you're getting the </v>

1472
01:05:26.791 --> 01:05:28.300
<v Speaker 2>news from getting the news from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>events that happened to 7 billion people</v>

1473
01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:33.400
<v Speaker 2>and that's just way too many for us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make rational discussions about it.</v>

1474
01:05:33.401 --> 01:05:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Because rationally you should know about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is happening in France.</v>

1475
01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.440
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't know that some Muslim guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>drove a truck over all these people.</v>

1476
01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:43.180
<v Speaker 2>You're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1477
01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:48.360
<v Speaker 2>And there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how many other Muslim men </v>

1478
01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.240
<v Speaker 2>didn't run over somebody with a truck </v>
<v Speaker 2>that day.</v>

1479
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.310
<v Speaker 2>So that's where it gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1480
01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:56.340
<v Speaker 2>because you don't even take those people</v>
<v Speaker 2>into consideration when you're talking </v>

1481
01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:59.071
<v Speaker 2>about Muslim males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're only talking about those one </v>

1482
01:05:59.071 --> 01:05:59.071
<v Speaker 2>males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like gun owners,</v>

1483
01:05:59.071 --> 01:06:03.270
<v Speaker 2>like people have this idea of gun owners</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gun owners are a bunch of fucking </v>

1484
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.510
<v Speaker 2>paranoid nuts with canned food in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>basement.</v>

1485
01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:05.810
<v Speaker 2>They're buying gold from Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1486
01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:06.700
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1487
01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:11.380
<v Speaker 2>The occasionally one of those guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoots up a school occasionally,</v>

1488
01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:16.770
<v Speaker 2>but you know how many people own guns?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more guns in this country than </v>

1489
01:06:16.770 --> 01:06:16.770
<v Speaker 2>there are fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1490
01:06:16.770 --> 01:06:20.080
<v Speaker 2>so we've really had like this crazy gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1491
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:22.750
<v Speaker 2>Things would be going off way more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

1492
01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:26.970
<v Speaker 2>It's remarkably safe considering the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of fucking firearms are available</v>

1493
01:06:26.971 --> 01:06:28.580
<v Speaker 2>to markably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredibly.</v>

1494
01:06:28.581 --> 01:06:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like almost every day of your life.</v>

1495
01:06:30.881 --> 01:06:33.550
<v Speaker 2>You go through town and you don't hear a</v>
<v Speaker 2>single gunshot,</v>

1496
01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:36.170
<v Speaker 2>but that's also going back to what I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying about you,</v>

1497
01:06:36.171 --> 01:06:37.810
<v Speaker 2>you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when somebody owns a gun,</v>

1498
01:06:37.811 --> 01:06:38.890
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rose McGowan says,</v>

1499
01:06:38.891 --> 01:06:41.380
<v Speaker 2>somebody says smile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she immediately says,</v>

1500
01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:42.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm putting words in your mouth,</v>

1501
01:06:42.881 --> 01:06:44.590
<v Speaker 2>but this is essentially what we said in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the interview,</v>

1502
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:50.070
<v Speaker 2>that that guy is being in one way or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another sexist or being in one way or </v>

1503
01:06:50.081 --> 01:06:51.940
<v Speaker 2>another somewhat oppressive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppressive.</v>

1504
01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure she feels that what I'm saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that for,</v>

1505
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.150
<v Speaker 2>for that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he may just be clumsily trying to say hi</v>

1506
01:06:58.151 --> 01:07:03.151
<v Speaker 2>to some of the most beautiful creature </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's ever seen in his life because at </v>

1507
01:07:03.151 --> 01:07:03.260
<v Speaker 2>the same way with gun owners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun owners,</v>

1508
01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.180
<v Speaker 2>a lot of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

1509
01:07:04.181 --> 01:07:05.950
<v Speaker 2>let me stop you there because couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>it be both things?</v>

1510
01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.890
<v Speaker 2>It could be both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sent it to him.</v>

1511
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:10.060
<v Speaker 2>It could be this one thing to her like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1512
01:07:10.061 --> 01:07:15.061
<v Speaker 2>if you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really into raping girls and it makes </v>

1513
01:07:15.061 --> 01:07:15.580
<v Speaker 2>you feel awesome and you don't want them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to feel like it's rape,</v>

1514
01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:18.280
<v Speaker 2>but it is 100 percent that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>always there.</v>

1515
01:07:18.281 --> 01:07:23.281
<v Speaker 2>They're equating those two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying that there could be </v>

1516
01:07:23.281 --> 01:07:24.070
<v Speaker 2>two different things going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His intention and the actual results.</v>

1517
01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:29.370
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying when you draw these </v>

1518
01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:29.370
<v Speaker 2>blanket statements like so when men </v>
<v Speaker 2>owned guns,</v>

1519
01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:29.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1520
01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:31.660
<v Speaker 2>If you hear the dialogue on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times it's like,</v>

1521
01:07:31.661 --> 01:07:32.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1522
01:07:32.501 --> 01:07:37.501
<v Speaker 2>these gun nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are these gun owners who are into all </v>

1523
01:07:37.501 --> 01:07:37.501
<v Speaker 2>this other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this macho stuff,</v>

1524
01:07:37.501 --> 01:07:41.070
<v Speaker 2>or are a lot of men owned guns?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of men's can sound crazy.</v>

1525
01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Lot of men on guns like me because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most effective way to protect my </v>

1526
01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.330
<v Speaker 2>family in case somebody comes in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>house in the middle of the night.</v>

1527
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:52.060
<v Speaker 2>That's actually something I think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>a something.</v>

1528
01:07:52.061 --> 01:07:57.061
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something I prepare for the past 20 </v>

1529
01:07:57.061 --> 01:07:57.061
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of men do that.</v>

1530
01:07:57.061 --> 01:07:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying at the end of the day,</v>

1531

01:10:47.181 --> 01:10:52.181
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Sam would get up and he would open </v>

1604
01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:54.161
<v Speaker 1>for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd go out there and just get a mic in </v>

1605
01:10:54.161 --> 01:10:56.081
<v Speaker 1>a little box and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an awkward with all these </v>

1606
01:10:56.081 --> 01:10:56.990
<v Speaker 1>soldiers sitting around in a war zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dude lit it up every fucking time.</v>

1607
01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:01.070
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things about Sam is he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of comics are comics has done</v>

1608
01:11:01.071 --> 01:11:06.071
<v Speaker 1>that room when there was zero crowd </v>
<v Speaker 1>control and he would get a lot of late </v>

1609
01:11:06.071 --> 01:11:09.701
<v Speaker 1>spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you learned that combat comedy style </v>

1610
01:11:09.701 --> 01:11:10.760
<v Speaker 1>combat company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like probably be more confident and</v>

1611
01:11:10.761 --> 01:11:13.680
<v Speaker 1>comfortable when shit goes crazy when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people start at him like,</v>

1612
01:11:13.730 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been</v>

1613
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.480
<v Speaker 2>here before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

1614
01:11:15.481 --> 01:11:17.280
<v Speaker 2>I know you ain't been here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've been here.</v>

1615
01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's roll buddy.</v>

1616
01:11:18.481 --> 01:11:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My favorite was Savvis.</v>

1617
01:11:20.221 --> 01:11:22.120
<v Speaker 2>He's always changing his face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His look,</v>

1618
01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:23.640
<v Speaker 2>he's got a goatee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a mustache,</v>

1619
01:11:23.641 --> 01:11:25.560
<v Speaker 2>got a full beard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got no peer,</v>

1620
01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:28.140
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like shaved up because switched </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1621
01:11:28.141 --> 01:11:30.720
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you gotta switch it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to switch it up sometimes.</v>

1622
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Then he grabs my body and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck do you do it?</v>

1623
01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:36.120
<v Speaker 2>How do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got the best body in comedy.</v>

1624
01:11:36.121 --> 01:11:36.880
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan,</v>

1625
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.610
<v Speaker 2>best body of comedy and then I walk </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

1626
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.190
<v Speaker 2>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loves you.</v>

1627
01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I got to get him on the podcast is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good dude.</v>

1628
01:11:43.321 --> 01:11:44.300
<v Speaker 2>The fighter and the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

1629
01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:46.010
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the Brian Counseling.</v>

1630
01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.320
<v Speaker 2>We call it mixed mental arts now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you call them and I think </v>

1631
01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:51.320
<v Speaker 2>it's better mixed metal arts because </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunter was like,</v>

1632
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:54.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because hunt mixed mental arts is better</v>

1633
01:11:54.331 --> 01:11:56.730
<v Speaker 2>and we've been having these great </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations and hunter was like,</v>

1634
01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:58.710
<v Speaker 2>let's stop being so myopic.</v>

1635
01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Let's just get all the ideas under one </v>
<v Speaker 2>umbrella.</v>

1636
01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Let's make ideas accessible to get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pull the ambitious project,</v>

1637
01:12:04.381 --> 01:12:06.330
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make sure everybody knows that</v>

1638
01:12:06.331 --> 01:12:11.331
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as being smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can all know these ideas and have a </v>

1639
01:12:11.331 --> 01:12:11.331
<v Speaker 2>constructive conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1640
01:12:11.331 --> 01:12:14.940
<v Speaker 2>he's got a great attitude about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really is the approach to that.</v>

1641
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.370
<v Speaker 2>It's not about smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about information.</v>

1642
01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Like I've had conversations with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>about something and I'll explain </v>

1643
01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:22.580
<v Speaker 2>something to them and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1644
01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:23.040
<v Speaker 2>I feel so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not stupid.</v>

1645
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:28.310
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just know this and the reason why I </v>

1646
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:29.280
<v Speaker 2>know this is because somebody figured it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and I bothered reading it.</v>

1647
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:30.510
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1648
01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:35.720
<v Speaker 2>But we like hold that over people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>heads with like such extreme arrogance </v>

1649
01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:39.560
<v Speaker 2>because so many people want to cling to </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost anything as like a sign of </v>

1650
01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:39.560
<v Speaker 2>superiority.</v>

1651
01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's information that they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplishments that they've done,</v>

1652
01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.040
<v Speaker 2>the money that they have in the bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1653
01:12:44.041 --> 01:12:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Like they always constantly want to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing that separates them from you.</v>

1654
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1655
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:52.050
<v Speaker 2>and that's one thing that people love to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with inflammation will,</v>

1656
01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:57.080
<v Speaker 2>if you had known if you read this then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would know that Kaba you cut the </v>

1657
01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.490
<v Speaker 2>shit and just tell me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me and I'll have a car.</v>

1658
01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:04.700
<v Speaker 2>But it was also this thing that we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>do and that you and I've worked very </v>

1659
01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:06.240
<v Speaker 2>hard to stop doing over the last decade </v>
<v Speaker 2>or so,</v>

1660
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:09.280
<v Speaker 2>which is to try to win conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1661
01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking horrible impediment to </v>

1662
01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:17.660
<v Speaker 2>learning anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best way to have a conversation is </v>

1663
01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:20.220
<v Speaker 2>mean challenge ideas for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But just talk.</v>

1664
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just talk.</v>

1665
01:13:21.271 --> 01:13:23.700
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone's telling you something </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have a question,</v>

1666
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:25.860
<v Speaker 2>don't look at it like you're attacking </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1667
01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Look at it like what is this we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing?</v>

1668
01:13:28.291 --> 01:13:30.030
<v Speaker 2>What is this actual thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1669
01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:31.890
<v Speaker 2>that weird thing that people do in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut.</v>

1670
01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:37.130
<v Speaker 2>They shut down and you know that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really discussing what you're </v>

1671
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:40.641
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just trying to find a way where </v>

1672
01:13:40.641 --> 01:13:40.641
<v Speaker 2>they could win the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1673
01:13:40.641 --> 01:13:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Because their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their point of view makes them feel a </v>

1674
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:43.950
<v Speaker 2>certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1675
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:45.660
<v Speaker 2>And if you start to break down those </v>
<v Speaker 2>walls,</v>

1676
01:13:45.690 --> 01:13:50.690
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid you're going to take away</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feeling of security or whatever </v>

1677
01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:51.300
<v Speaker 2>that feeling is confidence in being </v>
<v Speaker 2>consistently,</v>

1678
01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:52.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1679
01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.510
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1680
01:13:53.511 --> 01:13:55.920
<v Speaker 2>So when someone's not right about </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1681
01:13:55.940 --> 01:14:00.630
<v Speaker 2>like I have a good friend who's a animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights activist guide,</v>

1682
01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Vegan Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was saying we were talking about </v>

1683
01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.420
<v Speaker 2>the precursors for hormone development </v>
<v Speaker 2>and whether or not saturated fat and </v>

1684
01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol are</v>

1685
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:14.680
<v Speaker 1>the essential precursors to hormone </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

1686
01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much established fact </v>

1687
01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:19.710
<v Speaker 1>scientific fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the.</v>

1688
01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:24.330
<v Speaker 1>He didn't think it was because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading a lot of this ideological dogma </v>

1689
01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:25.840
<v Speaker 1>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1690
01:14:25.841 --> 01:14:28.690
<v Speaker 1>plant based dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started sending them all this stuff</v>

1691
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:29.860
<v Speaker 1>and then he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1692
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I got it all right now as to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Ken,</v>

1693
01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:34.600
<v Speaker 1>now we can have a discussion about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at all this,</v>

1694
01:14:34.601 --> 01:14:39.601
<v Speaker 1>look at all these studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all these things like we're not </v>

1695
01:14:39.601 --> 01:14:39.601
<v Speaker 1>saying you should go out and be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal eater,</v>

1696
01:14:39.601 --> 01:14:41.050
<v Speaker 1>know what I'm saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at the evidence,</v>

1697
01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.700
<v Speaker 1>that data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at what it actually is,</v>

1698
01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:45.600
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and look what is the actual problem with</v>

1699
01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:50.610
<v Speaker 1>trying to study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the actual problem with not </v>

1700
01:14:50.610 --> 01:14:52.591
<v Speaker 1>getting enough b12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the actual problem with not </v>

1701
01:14:52.591 --> 01:14:52.591
<v Speaker 1>getting enough of this vitamin that </v>
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>

1702
01:14:52.591 --> 01:14:53.860
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol,</v>

1703
01:14:53.861 --> 01:14:57.640
<v Speaker 1>all these fucking things that we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>told as kids are bad for you,</v>

1704
01:14:57.850 --> 01:15:02.850
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge problem because most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't learn anything about </v>

1705
01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:03.430
<v Speaker 1>nutrition past what they learn in </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

1706
01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1707
01:15:05.081 --> 01:15:10.081
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest things for me is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>having been around hunter as much as I </v>

1708
01:15:10.081 --> 01:15:13.471
<v Speaker 1>have and we always talk about how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've had to confront so much of </v>

1709
01:15:13.471 --> 01:15:17.791
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My own in my own way is I have a fast </v>

1710
01:15:17.791 --> 01:15:17.791
<v Speaker 1>thinking brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all do,</v>

1711
01:15:17.791 --> 01:15:18.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fast thinking brand that jumps out,</v>

1712
01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:23.610
<v Speaker 1>that triggers that things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you started talking about </v>

1713
01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:25.920
<v Speaker 1>liberalism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you start talking about big </v>

1714
01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:25.930
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you start talking about communism,</v>

1715
01:15:25.931 --> 01:15:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

1716
01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll get what happens is I'll get ready </v>
<v Speaker 1>to defend my free market.</v>

1717
01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.090
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox News.</v>

1718
01:15:34.091 --> 01:15:36.100
<v Speaker 1>You have a show on Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm defending my dad.</v>

1719
01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:41.160
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an emotional attachment to that </v>

1720
01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.420
<v Speaker 1>and so I'll stop listening to you about </v>
<v Speaker 1>bout five seconds in and I've already </v>

1721
01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:50.251
<v Speaker 1>got my guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm already loaded my guns as you're </v>

1722
01:15:50.251 --> 01:15:50.251
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

1723
01:15:50.251 --> 01:15:50.251
<v Speaker 1>I'm going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

1724
01:15:50.251 --> 01:15:50.251
<v Speaker 1>Let me get my gun so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1725
01:15:50.251 --> 01:15:51.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear you.</v>

1726
01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.820
<v Speaker 1>And now I can't wait to blast away at </v>
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

1727
01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Your collective ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1728
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:59.790
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll drop books like fix this </v>
<v Speaker 1>road to serfdom and all the things I've </v>

1729
01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:03.571
<v Speaker 1>read and all they want to do is win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I've had to and we always talk </v>

1730
01:16:04.361 --> 01:16:05.160
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hunter,</v>

1731
01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:07.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll send me articles that'll get me </v>
<v Speaker 1>enraged,</v>

1732
01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:12.530
<v Speaker 1>enraged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll freak out and I'll write this </v>

1733
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:12.530
<v Speaker 1>thing and he'll get me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll go,</v>

1734
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:12.530
<v Speaker 1>feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

1735
01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Now if you want to tranquilize the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast thinking elephant that you've been </v>

1736
01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:19.930
<v Speaker 1>riding and let's get some slow thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolves and take a look at what,</v>

1737
01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.990
<v Speaker 1>how your feelings are driving there </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking it's very.</v>

1738
01:16:22.991 --> 01:16:25.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a very fun exercise because as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get older,</v>

1739
01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:30.720
<v Speaker 1>what happens is you're able to sit back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and somebody says something and you're </v>

1740
01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.470
<v Speaker 1>able to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of me loading my guns,</v>

1741
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:35.530
<v Speaker 1>let me listen a little bit hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see if I can get.</v>

1742
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Take something from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there is a good argument.</v>

1743
01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there it may not be at a Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe there is some value to </v>

1744
01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:49.650
<v Speaker 1>regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there is some value to the FDA or </v>

1745
01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:50.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it might be.</v>

1746
01:16:50.951 --> 01:16:52.280
<v Speaker 1>I've been reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

1747
01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:57.480
<v Speaker 1>you have free market sort of prejudices </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that regard where you lean towards </v>

1748
01:16:57.881 --> 01:17:02.320
<v Speaker 1>deregulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lean towards a freer market because more</v>

1749
01:17:02.321 --> 01:17:05.760
<v Speaker 1>money gets made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Businesses does better.</v>

1750
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Lean toward freedom of choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I liked idea but,</v>

1751
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:14.980
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but environmental regulations where I </v>

1752
01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:14.980
<v Speaker 2>draw the line too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like me.</v>

1753
01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:17.390
<v Speaker 2>That's a classic example of the fishing </v>
<v Speaker 2>game and wildlife.</v>

1754
01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:18.530
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wildlife,</v>

1755
01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:21.080
<v Speaker 2>the fish and game department of fish and</v>
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

1756
01:17:21.230 --> 01:17:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Excellent job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1757
01:17:22.341 --> 01:17:27.341
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what anybody says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and I know and you know even more </v>

1758
01:17:27.341 --> 01:17:30.460
<v Speaker 2>than the states as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all deserve recognition because </v>

1759
01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.830
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've brought animals back from the </v>

1760
01:17:32.830 --> 01:17:34.631
<v Speaker 2>brink of extinction to gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>populations to get drunk and they shoot </v>

1761
01:17:34.631 --> 01:17:34.631
<v Speaker 2>the shit out of everything that moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

1762
01:17:34.631 --> 01:17:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was actually market farming.</v>

1763
01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Market farming is with didn't most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the animals in this country.</v>

1764
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:44.590
<v Speaker 2>After the war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that happened was </v>

1765
01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:47.591
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of soldiers after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>civil war that needed jobs and one of </v>

1766
01:17:48.381 --> 01:17:50.900
<v Speaker 2>the jobs that was available was market </v>
<v Speaker 2>farming.</v>

1767
01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:55.980
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means they didn't have </v>

1768
01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:55.980
<v Speaker 2>refrigerators back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buddy.</v>

1769
01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:56.180
<v Speaker 2>So if you wanted meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to go out and get it.</v>

1770
01:17:56.450 --> 01:18:01.450
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things they would do </v>
<v Speaker 2>is they would hire these young men to </v>

1771
01:18:01.450 --> 01:18:04.250
<v Speaker 2>take their rifles and go out and shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>every fucking buffalo that moved.</v>

1772
01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:07.070
<v Speaker 2>They would shoot buffalo just for their </v>
<v Speaker 2>tongues.</v>

1773
01:18:07.071 --> 01:18:09.260
<v Speaker 2>They would cut out the tongues of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>buffaloes.</v>

1774
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:11.330
<v Speaker 2>They would shoot other ones just for </v>
<v Speaker 2>their pelts.</v>

1775
01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.760
<v Speaker 2>They would shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shot down everything in sight,</v>

1776
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:17.690
<v Speaker 2>down to antelope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was harder to shoot antelope and kill</v>

1777
01:18:17.691 --> 01:18:22.691
<v Speaker 2>them off because they're designed from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking to have things like cheetahs</v>

1778
01:18:23.361 --> 01:18:25.070
<v Speaker 2>chasing a smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still keep it.</v>

1779
01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're faster than anything that can </v>

1780
01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:33.101
<v Speaker 2>catch them because they evolved during a</v>
<v Speaker 2>time where cheat as lived in North </v>

1781
01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:38.170
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big cats lived in North America that </v>

1782
01:18:38.170 --> 01:18:38.170
<v Speaker 2>were bigger than lions and African </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines.</v>

1783
01:18:38.170 --> 01:18:42.460
<v Speaker 2>So when you're thinking about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>times and these people that wiped out </v>

1784
01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:46.790
<v Speaker 2>all the animals in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a host of factors,</v>

1785
01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.820
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of different pressures on these </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>

1786
01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:51.500
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it was market hunting.</v>

1787
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so when hunters came along,</v>

1788
01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:56.420
<v Speaker 2>like in the beginning of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>

1789
01:18:56.660 --> 01:19:01.010
<v Speaker 2>there was very few deer and defined like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big deer with like a giant rack.</v>

1790
01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Super rare elk had been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd been extra painted from a </v>

1791
01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:10.280
<v Speaker 2>gigantic segment of the population or </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic sub segment of the country,</v>

1792
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:13.160
<v Speaker 2>and so they've slowly repopulated in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these groups.</v>

1793
01:19:13.161 --> 01:19:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Like the Rocky Mountain Elk Federation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've transplanted elk down to dearest</v>

1794
01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:19.610
<v Speaker 2>everywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1795
01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Sell planning philosophy because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>corn and a lot of the agricultural crops</v>

1796
01:19:23.481 --> 01:19:28.481
<v Speaker 2>that were planted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is true and that's also why white </v>

1797
01:19:28.481 --> 01:19:29.330
<v Speaker 2>tail deer have done so much better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>mule deer.</v>

1798
01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:31.360
<v Speaker 2>Mule deer kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1799
01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:36.400
<v Speaker 2>in a much healthier position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's still have healthy populations </v>

1800
01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.100
<v Speaker 2>and they still hunt them and you find </v>
<v Speaker 2>them everywhere.</v>

1801
01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:42.490
<v Speaker 2>But mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't live off crops like white </v>

1802
01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:44.270
<v Speaker 2>tail deer is like our friend Doug </v>
<v Speaker 2>Durham's farm.</v>

1803
01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.330
<v Speaker 2>Doug has this awesome place in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin.</v>

1804
01:19:47.331 --> 01:19:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Shout out to Doug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Powerful doctor.</v>

1805
01:19:49.670 --> 01:19:53.330
<v Speaker 2>He has essentially they're farm animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>

1806
01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:56.230
<v Speaker 2>They're wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're these giant as wild deer,</v>

1807
01:19:56.420 --> 01:20:01.420
<v Speaker 2>but they openly go around his farm or </v>
<v Speaker 2>farms in the area is different every </v>

1808
01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:03.380
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of the best meals I've ever had</v>

1809
01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:04.700
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

1810
01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're definitely getting like they're </v>

1811
01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:12.411
<v Speaker 2>eating that fucking monsanto corn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you bring me any elk fucking for </v>

1812
01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:17.220
<v Speaker 2>real or fake game me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't let me leave without a game.</v>

1813
01:20:17.221 --> 01:20:19.320
<v Speaker 2>We'd hunt more and that's the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1814
01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:24.410
<v Speaker 2>See you them to get balls deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm tired of all the fucking talk </v>

1815
01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:28.131
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you went hunting with me once and </v>

1816
01:20:28.131 --> 01:20:29.940
<v Speaker 2>then you motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you never got crazy with it.</v>

1817
01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:32.820
<v Speaker 2>I got crazy with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really missing hunting.</v>

1818
01:20:32.821 --> 01:20:34.340
<v Speaker 2>I said to my wife yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go and um,</v>

1819
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:35.580
<v Speaker 2>but I miss the hangout.</v>

1820
01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:38.490
<v Speaker 2>You don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a great time.</v>

1821
01:20:38.491 --> 01:20:39.930
<v Speaker 2>I started thinking I did something </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

1822
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much fun did we have?</v>

1823
01:20:41.071 --> 01:20:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Did we not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All twice and had a great time.</v>

1824
01:20:43.090 --> 01:20:45.150
<v Speaker 2>Still laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a fucking wonderful time.</v>

1825
01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Struck out the last time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went with Rinella.</v>

1826
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:48.750
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when are we going hunting?</v>

1827
01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:51.300
<v Speaker 2>You're hiking with him because he likes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to suffer and I'll hike with.</v>

1828

<v Speaker 2>could go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1832
01:20:58.610 --> 01:20:59.460
<v Speaker 2>we have a reasonable chance of success </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you always want the option,</v>

1833
01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:03.040
<v Speaker 2>the possibility rather than failing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've hunted a bunch of different ways.</v>

1838
01:21:12.630 --> 01:21:16.290

<v Speaker 2>that world that's so good at expressing </v>

1853

<v Speaker 2>but we got to go.</v>

1857
01:22:02.281 --> 01:22:07.281
<v Speaker 2>We should go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to maybe go elk hunting or </v>

1858
01:22:07.281 --> 01:22:07.281
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you bought me a bow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And you won't have,</v>

1861
01:22:09.670 --> 01:22:11.430
<v Speaker 2>which we're going to set you up with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>new one,</v>

1862
01:22:11.431 --> 01:22:14.660
<v Speaker 2>like the one I gave you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got it a year and a half ago.</v>

1863
01:22:14.690 --> 01:22:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with that?</v>

1864
01:22:15.641 --> 01:22:20.641
<v Speaker 2>With that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have new ones they're getting into </v>

1865
01:22:20.641 --> 01:22:21.570
<v Speaker 2>and I'm thinking the one you gave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trading my unused.</v>

1866
01:22:21.571 --> 01:22:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Both my brand new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you have graphite dust on it still,</v>

1867
01:22:26.170 --> 01:22:29.700
<v Speaker 2>but carbon carbon spider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really good bow.</v>

1868
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:30.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well believe me.</v>

1869
01:22:30.841 --> 01:22:32.630
<v Speaker 2>I'll be saying it's a carbon spider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1870
01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Is it carbon spider?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called the carbon spider.</v>

1871
01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say it was made of carbon</v>

1872
01:22:37.561 --> 01:22:39.840
<v Speaker 2>spider and they y d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>e R.</v>

1873
01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they use the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>spider for like Porsche boxster.</v>

1874
01:22:44.071 --> 01:22:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Spyder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spy,</v>

1875
01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:46.170
<v Speaker 2>d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>e R.</v>

1876
01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:51.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's for like certain cars that are </v>

1877
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:53.970
<v Speaker 2>convertibles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also for that bow.</v>

1878
01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a trademark thing and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>the spider loving,</v>

1879
01:22:58.410 --> 01:23:00.540
<v Speaker 2>but it's a really good bow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hoyts of the best.</v>

1880
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.280
<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1881
01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:05.010
<v Speaker 2>There's like three or four really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>bowman manufacturers.</v>

1882
01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:10.140
<v Speaker 2>It's generally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are six year listeners like it </v>

1883
01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:11.110
<v Speaker 2>gets into fucking generally a thought of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1884
01:23:11.111 --> 01:23:13.920
<v Speaker 2>It's white and matthews are the top bows</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the.</v>

1885
01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:16.120
<v Speaker 2>That's the only fucking bizarre shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>elite.</v>

1886
01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.790
<v Speaker 2>And then there's Bowtech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also really up there too,</v>

1887
01:23:18.791 --> 01:23:21.250
<v Speaker 2>and it's really depends on who you ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a white guy.</v>

1888
01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:22.600
<v Speaker 2>You got a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1889
01:23:22.670 --> 01:23:24.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm awake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get any better.</v>

1890
01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.050
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing better than a white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's matthews.</v>

1891
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:29.680
<v Speaker 2>The question is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you talk to guys like John Dudley,</v>

1892
01:23:29.681 --> 01:23:30.910
<v Speaker 2>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll say that hoists are better.</v>

1893
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:34.390
<v Speaker 2>He said like that in his opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he knows way more than me.</v>

1894
01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:36.970
<v Speaker 2>He thinks that hoist to the best pose in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1895
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.430
<v Speaker 2>So I just listened to him and Cameron </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hanes has the same thing,</v>

1896
01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:44.431
<v Speaker 2>so you guys would know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows more about no bow hunting </v>

1897
01:23:44.431 --> 01:23:45.760
<v Speaker 2>and bowhunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1898
01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:46.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1899
01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:48.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a scope from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from animals,</v>

1900
01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:54.360
<v Speaker 2>so I will shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I need meat and I'm running low </v>

1901
01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:54.610
<v Speaker 2>on me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll hunt an animal with a rifle.</v>

1902
01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm really into,</v>

1903
01:23:56.471 --> 01:23:57.610
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is archery.</v>

1904
01:23:57.730 --> 01:24:02.730
<v Speaker 2>I love archery even if I never bow </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunted again and even if I just hunted </v>

1905
01:24:02.730 --> 01:24:03.130
<v Speaker 2>with a rifle because it was too hard to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bowhunt,</v>

1906
01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.950
<v Speaker 2>which it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I will bow hunt again for sure,</v>

1907
01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:08.620
<v Speaker 2>but archery is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it's a.</v>

1908
01:24:08.621 --> 01:24:12.880
<v Speaker 2>it's like a meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's archery's a martial art in a lot of</v>

1909
01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:15.460
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a stillness martial art.</v>

1910
01:24:15.490 --> 01:24:18.400
<v Speaker 2>It's a martial art where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfecting one move.</v>

1911
01:24:18.730 --> 01:24:22.090
<v Speaker 2>This one move of having your arm out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of you.</v>

1912
01:24:22.091 --> 01:24:25.690
<v Speaker 2>Your hand is like in a halt position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's where it is,</v>

1913
01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:30.810
<v Speaker 2>and then the Bho doesn't pass over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifeline you wanted on this side of the </v>

1914
01:24:30.810 --> 01:24:34.330
<v Speaker 2>lifeline so it never goes deep in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>grip so you're not torquing your wrist,</v>

1915
01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:39.540
<v Speaker 2>so it's basically just balanced up </v>
<v Speaker 2>against your hand and then you're </v>

1916
01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:43.141
<v Speaker 2>pulling back and you're locking in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>anchor point and you're looking through </v>

1917
01:24:43.141 --> 01:24:47.161
<v Speaker 2>your peep site and all you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on is pulling back your </v>

1918
01:24:47.161 --> 01:24:48.220
<v Speaker 2>scapula and releasing that era without </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving at all.</v>

1919
01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Now what about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about emotion do.</v>

1920
01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:52.930
<v Speaker 2>How bent is your straight line?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Straight?</v>

1921
01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:53.860
<v Speaker 2>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but last time,</v>

1922
01:24:53.861 --> 01:24:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I do think that ended a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last time I did that,</v>

1923
01:24:55.811 --> 01:24:59.110
<v Speaker 2>the [inaudible] your stances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit my fucking hand and I.</v>

1924
01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're all out hurt so badly.</v>

1925
01:25:01.210 --> 01:25:05.140
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is right,</v>

1926
01:25:05.141 --> 01:25:07.810
<v Speaker 2>but I've hit my forearm before it hurts </v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit.</v>

1927
01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just don't.</v>

1928
01:25:08.801 --> 01:25:10.810
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't ever hit your forum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

1929
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:15.870
<v Speaker 2>if you're shooting correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be in a position where the big </v>

1930
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:17.860
<v Speaker 2>toe of your foot lines up with the ball </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your rear foot,</v>

1931
01:25:17.861 --> 01:25:20.770
<v Speaker 2>so your front foot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big toe and your rear foot ball.</v>

1932
01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:23.200
<v Speaker 2>And that gives you a slightly open </v>
<v Speaker 2>stance.</v>

1933
01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Very slightly martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love this stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1941
01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:51.940
<v Speaker 2>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1942
01:25:52.330 --> 01:25:57.330
<v Speaker 2>how much kinetic energy each arrow has </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on what percentage of weight is in</v>

1943
01:25:58.361 --> 01:26:00.090
<v Speaker 2>the front of the Arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1944
01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 2>what I love about that is when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>master something like Dudley in</v>

1945
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.800
<v Speaker 1>a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn everything in a way.</v>

1946
01:26:06.801 --> 01:26:11.801
<v Speaker 1>You're learning so much about life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe everything that's relevant about </v>

1947
01:26:11.801 --> 01:26:15.401
<v Speaker 1>life in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're going to get Orthodox and </v>

1948
01:26:15.401 --> 01:26:15.401
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking your brain patterns will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a certain way.</v>

1949
01:26:15.401 --> 01:26:18.980
<v Speaker 1>But like when you start talking that way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's thinking about like grade and,</v>

1950
01:26:18.981 --> 01:26:23.310
<v Speaker 1>and wait and aerodynamics and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1951
01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:26.060
<v Speaker 2>great discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What archery really is,</v>

1952
01:26:26.061 --> 01:26:28.400
<v Speaker 2>is a rabbit hole and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

1953
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:31.130
<v Speaker 2>some people go down that rabbit hole and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go fuck this rabbit hole.</v>

1954
01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:36.280
<v Speaker 2>And they get like an old school recurve </v>
<v Speaker 2>bow and just learn instinctive shooting </v>

1955
01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.540
<v Speaker 2>and they just get into just releasing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Arrow on their own and knowing.</v>

1956
01:26:38.541 --> 01:26:41.060
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you throw a rock if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw a rock,</v>

1957
01:26:41.061 --> 01:26:43.850
<v Speaker 2>you know your arm feels like you kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>know where that rocks can it go.</v>

1958
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:45.920
<v Speaker 2>And then you get pretty accurate about </v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing rocks.</v>

1959
01:26:45.921 --> 01:26:48.620
<v Speaker 2>But if you want to get really accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta throw rocks every day.</v>

1960
01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.570
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same thing with recurve </v>
<v Speaker 2>bows.</v>

1961
01:26:50.571 --> 01:26:55.571
<v Speaker 2>If you have the exact same weight arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a stack of these arrows </v>

1962
01:26:55.571 --> 01:26:59.590
<v Speaker 2>and you shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that if you bend it this way </v>

1963
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.870
<v Speaker 2>and you pull it back to here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes that far.</v>

1964
01:26:59.910 --> 01:27:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say,</v>

1965
01:27:00.911 --> 01:27:05.911
<v Speaker 2>well if the animals here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I gotta aim here and you just </v>

1966
01:27:05.911 --> 01:27:08.420
<v Speaker 2>develop this Eliel in your own mind or </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the Arrow's going to go.</v>

1967
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:13.510
<v Speaker 2>But it's not that accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you have an animal with a </v>

1968
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:17.351
<v Speaker 2>recurve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've watched hunting shows where </v>

1969
01:27:17.351 --> 01:27:17.351
<v Speaker 2>people hunt animals with recurves </v>
<v Speaker 2>wounding of animals.</v>

1970
01:27:17.351 --> 01:27:20.720
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of sketchy shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like if you watch,</v>

1971
01:27:20.721 --> 01:27:23.690
<v Speaker 2>like John Dudley puts out some videos of</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the hunters on,</v>

1972
01:27:24.230 --> 01:27:25.520
<v Speaker 2>they're all getting shot through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart.</v>

1973
01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:29.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm like 99 percent of the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they don't even know what happened.</v>

1974
01:27:29.031 --> 01:27:29.270
<v Speaker 2>And then there.</v>

1975
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:34.750
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was thinking about this because </v>

1976
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I've been obsessing over boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1977
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:38.320
<v Speaker 1>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like the reason I like to spar as </v>

1978
01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:41.111
<v Speaker 1>I don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not knocking my head off and stuff </v>

1979
01:27:41.111 --> 01:27:41.111
<v Speaker 1>and like Brendan's always like don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>spar and stuff.</v>

1980
01:27:41.111 --> 01:27:44.330
<v Speaker 1>But for me what I really love is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing I loved about taekwondo,</v>

1981
01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:49.480
<v Speaker 1>which is that with boxing it seems so </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible when you first started and </v>

1982
01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.150
<v Speaker 1>then like two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two and a half years later,</v>

1983
01:27:50.151 --> 01:27:52.400
<v Speaker 1>if you're actually sparring and moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with people,</v>

1984
01:27:52.730 --> 01:27:57.730
<v Speaker 1>you'll start developing patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a good teacher and you'll </v>

1985
01:27:57.730 --> 01:27:58.370
<v Speaker 1>start to learn how to get somebody to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think one thing,</v>

1986
01:27:58.371 --> 01:28:00.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you jab and the jab low,</v>

1987
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:03.920
<v Speaker 1>then you fake joe and you and maybe fly </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a hook or whatever and you learn to</v>

1988
01:28:03.921 --> 01:28:08.921
<v Speaker 1>protect you and you can start developing</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own sort of similar patterns that </v>

1989
01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:09.830
<v Speaker 1>aren't.</v>

1990
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:11.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a different discipline than </v>
<v Speaker 1>archery.</v>

1991
01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Archery seems so kinetic and detailed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1992
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Boxing is more kinetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more.</v>

1993
01:28:17.391 --> 01:28:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was more options box.</v>

1994
01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of strategy.</v>

1995
01:28:21.651 --> 01:28:24.230
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of split second timing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of,</v>

1996
01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting your opponent to.</v>

1997
01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:27.870
<v Speaker 1>You're fooling him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1998
01:28:27.871 --> 01:28:31.010
<v Speaker 1>You're getting to think you're doing one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and then capitalizing on,</v>

1999
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:32.600
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on sort of a.</v>

2000
01:28:32.601 --> 01:28:34.610
<v Speaker 1>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was doing this and I'm doing</v>

2001
01:28:34.611 --> 01:28:35.120
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2002
01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:37.370
<v Speaker 1>there's a different kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I,</v>

2003
01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:40.760
<v Speaker 1>what I love about all of it is almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2004
01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:43.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not even so much about the doing of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2005
01:28:43.190 --> 01:28:45.140
<v Speaker 1>of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always awesome.</v>

2006
01:28:45.141 --> 01:28:50.141
<v Speaker 1>But I think what I really get off on </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes is the discovery is the PR is </v>

2007
01:28:51.361 --> 01:28:56.361
<v Speaker 1>the learning maybe how to control </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that seems so out of control </v>

2008
01:28:56.361 --> 01:28:56.361
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2009
01:28:56.361 --> 01:29:01.090
<v Speaker 1>and sort of the discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the continual discovery of new things </v>

2010
01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:04.080
<v Speaker 1>and maybe what it does to my brain.</v>

2011
01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's what I like,</v>

2012
01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:10.730
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mindset it puts me in and the </v>

2013
01:29:10.730 --> 01:29:14.421
<v Speaker 1>understanding it gives me and maybe even</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it takes away the,</v>

2014
01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:20.120
<v Speaker 1>some of the mystery I was living under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I felt was a little learning one </v>

2015
01:29:20.461 --> 01:29:22.670
<v Speaker 1>new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that one new thing is unearthed.</v>

2016
01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:24.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that a little bit better.</v>

2017
01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:25.830
<v Speaker 1>You've got a little bit more data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:28.860
<v Speaker 1>And then now I'm not as intimidated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2019
01:29:28.861 --> 01:29:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean somebody who is quote unquote,</v>

2020
01:29:30.511 --> 01:29:35.511
<v Speaker 1>really smart and good at one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a surgeon or a brain </v>

2021
01:29:35.511 --> 01:29:37.200
<v Speaker 1>surgeon or a scientist or a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>

2022
01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Well a really good fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to Joe Schilling about this </v>

2023
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:42.530
<v Speaker 1>and to Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronnie about this,</v>

2024
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:43.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about patterns I'd come up</v>

2025
01:29:43.771 --> 01:29:45.510
<v Speaker 1>with is I was talking about this pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had and he goes,</v>

2026
01:29:45.511 --> 01:29:45.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2027
01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:47.310
<v Speaker 1>And she was showing said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'd have.</v>

2028
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:52.590
<v Speaker 1>So the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably have 30 of those patterns </v>

2029
01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:52.590
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I have deepened my memory.</v>

2030
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:54.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like Roberta Duran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember who was fighting him,</v>

2031
01:29:54.651 --> 01:29:59.651
<v Speaker 1>but he came back and he said the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy can read my mind and as I think it </v>

2032
01:29:59.651 --> 01:30:00.450
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his trainer said,</v>

2033
01:30:00.451 --> 01:30:05.451
<v Speaker 1>he's not reading your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's doing is that he knows those </v>

2034
01:30:05.451 --> 01:30:08.100
<v Speaker 1>patterns so well and he sees you about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the set him up and he's,</v>

2035
01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:10.170
<v Speaker 1>and he's beating you to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2036
01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:13.950
<v Speaker 1>and when I watched a Henner gracie tie </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

2037
01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:19.220
<v Speaker 1>tie up the likes of Brendan Schaub and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Leo Machida and all kinds of guys in </v>

2038
01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:24.111
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I watched him just do whatever you </v>

2039
01:30:24.111 --> 01:30:24.111
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starting to his back.</v>

2040
01:30:24.111 --> 01:30:24.111
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2041
01:30:24.150 --> 01:30:24.900
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2042
01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:29.960
<v Speaker 1>you're anticipating their movements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are already see what their patterns </v>

2043
01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:30.030
<v Speaker 1>are because you're ahead of them.</v>

2044
01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:33.840
<v Speaker 1>And it takes a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be as reverential.</v>

2045
01:30:33.841 --> 01:30:38.841
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to love the fact that life </v>

2046
01:30:38.841 --> 01:30:38.841
<v Speaker 1>is that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the universe can be that way,</v>

2047
01:30:38.841 --> 01:30:42.990
<v Speaker 1>that if you practice something enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get good enough at something,</v>

2048
01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:46.980
<v Speaker 1>it can seem like what you do is magic </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost right,</v>

2049
01:30:46.981 --> 01:30:51.981
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that you have learned how to </v>

2050
01:30:51.981 --> 01:30:54.831
<v Speaker 1>chunk large portions of information and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you will learn how to be ahead of </v>

2051
01:30:54.841 --> 01:30:57.570
<v Speaker 1>somebody and more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you play somebody at the same game,</v>

2052
01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:03.020
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see the tendencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to make tendencies and </v>

2053
01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:06.591
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna beat them to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those tendencies can be able to head </v>

2054
01:31:06.591 --> 01:31:06.591
<v Speaker 1>them off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2055
01:31:06.591 --> 01:31:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Because you've been there a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>times because you went through the same </v>

2056
01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:13.101
<v Speaker 1>thing and the difference between your </v>
<v Speaker 1>practicing beginner mind and your </v>

2057
01:31:13.101 --> 01:31:16.650
<v Speaker 1>mastery mind in that context is vastly </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

2058
01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.610
<v Speaker 1>And I can always tell somebody who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>mastered something versus somebody who's</v>

2059
01:31:20.611 --> 01:31:23.250
<v Speaker 1>never taken the time to really get good </v>
<v Speaker 1>at something.</v>

2060
01:31:23.610 --> 01:31:27.570
<v Speaker 1>I can always tell the difference and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>prefer to be around.</v>

2061
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Not always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not always,</v>

2062
01:31:29.371 --> 01:31:31.800
<v Speaker 1>because I got some real more on friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are so much fun,</v>

2063
01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:37.040
<v Speaker 1>but I typically tend to find more </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimacy in conversation with people </v>

2064
01:31:37.201 --> 01:31:41.610
<v Speaker 1>that have least continue to endeavor </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the road to mastery.</v>

2065
01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's very few people that can talk to</v>

2066
01:31:43.321 --> 01:31:44.240
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2067
01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:46.290
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're to talk to a real master about</v>

2068
01:31:46.291 --> 01:31:46.860
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2069
01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.290
<v Speaker 1>pull someone aside and talk to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>about their craft,</v>

2070
01:31:49.291 --> 01:31:52.590
<v Speaker 1>about achieving incredibly high level at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very difficult discipline.</v>

2071
01:31:52.591 --> 01:31:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Like a master chess player for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people did they have to talk to</v>

2072
01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.470
<v Speaker 1>see if Gary Kasparov is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2073
01:31:58.710 --> 01:32:03.710
<v Speaker 1>at a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and somebody wants to have a </v>

2074
01:32:03.710 --> 01:32:05.761
<v Speaker 1>conversation with him about food stamps </v>
<v Speaker 1>or fucking Hollywood gossip,</v>

2075
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood gossip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2076
01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Whatever happened to Taylor swift and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2077
01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:11.730
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

2078
01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:12.640
<v Speaker 1>hang inaccurate oculus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2079
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe what John did like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was.</v>

2080
01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:18.670
<v Speaker 1>So I was walking down and then he said I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to grab this package.</v>

2081
01:32:18.671 --> 01:32:23.671
<v Speaker 1>And he added or someone's next to him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's Sam Harris and Sam Harris and </v>

2082
01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Gary Kasparov have this deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense conversation that,</v>

2083
01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:30.640
<v Speaker 1>that fills a void inside of their souls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fills them up.</v>

2084
01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really hard to find someone </v>

2085
01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:37.270
<v Speaker 1>that can play ping pong with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like intellectually at that level.</v>

2086
01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it maybe it goes back to the </v>

2087
01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:42.420
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing we were talking about.</v>

2088
01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:44.791
<v Speaker 1>They're about to have a real discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not as attached to their </v>

2089
01:32:44.791 --> 01:32:44.791
<v Speaker 1>prejudices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2090
01:32:44.791 --> 01:32:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Because they tend to be like Sam Harris </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>

2091
01:32:46.451 --> 01:32:48.250
<v Speaker 1>if you listened to Sam Harris talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>

2092
01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:51.400
<v Speaker 1>His critique is so fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>

2093
01:32:51.670 --> 01:32:56.670
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's got these great metaphors and </v>

2094
01:32:56.670 --> 01:32:57.670
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not driven by dogma.</v>

2095
01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:01.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not driven by my team is right near</v>
<v Speaker 1>team is wrong.</v>

2096
01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:03.130
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's able to be more objective.</v>

2097
01:33:03.131 --> 01:33:05.200
<v Speaker 1>He's more humble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Wayne McCullough,</v>

2098
01:33:05.230 --> 01:33:07.210
<v Speaker 1>who's might my trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my boxing trainer,</v>

2099
01:33:07.211 --> 01:33:07.780
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2100
01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:10.360
<v Speaker 1>a former world champion he's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

2101
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:14.130
<v Speaker 1>When you're a world champion like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the most humble motherfucker on the</v>

2102
01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:15.000
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2103
01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:17.780
<v Speaker 1>he'll hold mitts for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clap your hands.</v>

2104
01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:20.860
<v Speaker 1>He's the greatest guy in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't get the respect.</v>

2105
01:33:20.861 --> 01:33:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows who the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

2106
01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:24.400
<v Speaker 1>what he accomplished as a boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It drives me fucking crazy,</v>

2107
01:33:24.401 --> 01:33:26.620
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking guy.</v>

2108
01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:29.160
<v Speaker 1>He'll give you every really level headed</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

2109
01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2110
01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Like one of my favorite people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

2111
01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I love that mother family was amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxer and his day,</v>

2112
01:33:35.490 --> 01:33:40.490
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a great teacher in a very </v>

2113
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:40.490
<v Speaker 1>lightweight guy.</v>

2114
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:43.750
<v Speaker 1>So it was lightweight guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that have the real technical </v>

2115
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.750
<v Speaker 1>skill and footwork and movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2116
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he teaches you boxing?</v>

2117
01:33:45.231 --> 01:33:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty cool.</v>

2118
01:33:45.911 --> 01:33:46.960
<v Speaker 1>He's my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's my guy.</v>

2119
01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2120
01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.570
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven moves around with me.</v>

2121
01:33:49.571 --> 01:33:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll put on gloves and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

2122
01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:53.500
<v Speaker 1>It's funny how he may be small like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2123
01:33:53.501 --> 01:33:54.970
<v Speaker 1>but good luck trying to hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2124
01:33:54.971 --> 01:33:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Well good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2125
01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:01.500
<v Speaker 1>When he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he catches you in the body and you </v>

2126
01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:01.500
<v Speaker 1>make your 15 mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it though.</v>

2127
01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:06.241
<v Speaker 1>It's so humbling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you'll ever get to Jujitsu </v>

2128
01:34:06.241 --> 01:34:06.241
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am dying to.</v>

2129
01:34:06.241 --> 01:34:08.400
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me like that one you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>

2130
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:11.260
<v Speaker 1>You could actually do it in a way where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get hurt.</v>

2131
01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.610
<v Speaker 1>That's the big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>striking and wrestling and grappling.</v>

2132
01:34:15.611 --> 01:34:20.611
<v Speaker 1>I love grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what I started with and I miss it </v>

2133
01:34:20.611 --> 01:34:20.611
<v Speaker 1>and I love it.</v>

2134
01:34:20.611 --> 01:34:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I liked the way it makes my body feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything else and grappling like </v>

2135
01:34:24.810 --> 01:34:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get really good and you can roll</v>

2136
01:34:25.211 --> 01:34:28.120
<v Speaker 1>with top level guys when you box and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to get good,</v>

2137
01:34:28.121 --> 01:34:30.640
<v Speaker 1>you got to spar and every time I spar </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2138
01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:35.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sparring tough guys and I'm </v>

2139
01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:37.141
<v Speaker 1>sparring pros like my buddy Brandon </v>
<v Speaker 1>Adams who can do whatever he wants to </v>

2140
01:34:37.141 --> 01:34:40.141
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just moving around with me and </v>

2141
01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:40.141
<v Speaker 1>touched me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

2142
01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:40.141
<v Speaker 1>I learned you're still getting hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still going to get hit.</v>

2143
01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:45.160
<v Speaker 1>You can still gonna take a couple shots </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you fight somebody who's like </v>

2144
01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:45.520
<v Speaker 1>your level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's going to get,</v>

2145
01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:47.020
<v Speaker 1>that's when you actually get hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2146
01:34:47.021 --> 01:34:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Because you know I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to lose.</v>

2147
01:34:49.691 --> 01:34:54.691
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though I'm 50 and I'm an idiot for </v>

2148
01:34:54.691 --> 01:34:54.691
<v Speaker 1>doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still going to.</v>

2149
01:34:54.691 --> 01:34:56.620
<v Speaker 1>I still try to hold onto my fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2150
01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Blah Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just move around and tell you,</v>

2151
01:34:59.001 --> 01:35:02.370
<v Speaker 1>catch me and then I'm going to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch it stings and your.</v>

2152
01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:04.970
<v Speaker 1>I would prefer not to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nerve wracking.</v>

2153
01:35:04.971 --> 01:35:06.410
<v Speaker 1>You know who loves it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucy Kay.</v>

2154
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:07.910
<v Speaker 1>He likes to box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2155
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:09.910
<v Speaker 1>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giant boxing fan too.</v>

2156
01:35:09.911 --> 01:35:11.730
<v Speaker 1>So that all the big.</v>

<v Speaker 1>about boxing,</v>

2159
01:35:15.321 --> 01:35:18.770
<v Speaker 1>like he's a fucking real boxing fan when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about guys like terrence</v>

2160

<v Speaker 1>Crawford or like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he loves it.</v>

2162
01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I just watched Tommy hearns fight with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hagler fight with sugar ray.</v>

2163

<v Speaker 1>he can.</v>

2167
01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Thinking that's the voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cry my private,</v>

2168
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:44.110
<v Speaker 1>my little private garden and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch old boxing bouts and it's my </v>

2169
01:35:44.241 --> 01:35:49.241
<v Speaker 1>favorite thing and I watched interviews </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them now interviews with Tommy </v>

<v Speaker 1>it was amazing.</v>

2172
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see his fight with Roberto </v>

2173
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Duran?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure did.</v>

2174
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Sure did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the first guys to </v>

2175
01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:00.470
<v Speaker 1>flatline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy like Roberto Duran.</v>

2176
01:36:00.490 --> 01:36:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Just leave are laid out the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second round.</v>

2177
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:04.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2178
01:36:04.290 --> 01:36:05.780
<v Speaker 1>second round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to remember,</v>

2179
01:36:05.781 --> 01:36:09.440
<v Speaker 1>but it was around two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit him like a pistol compliant.</v>

2180
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Six one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One 45.</v>

2181
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:14.480
<v Speaker 1>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was wide,</v>

2182
01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:19.400
<v Speaker 1>so wide torque behind the punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked Roger Mayweather fight,</v>

2183
01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:21.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his prime black Mamba Dude.</v>

2184
01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:25.160
<v Speaker 1>And he had legs that were about as </v>
<v Speaker 1>skinny as toothpick.</v>

2185
01:36:25.190 --> 01:36:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look like nine x cables.</v>

2186
01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:29.300
<v Speaker 1>They're just like these tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anything like it.</v>

2187
01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Good luck finding him too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2188
01:36:31.190 --> 01:36:34.340
<v Speaker 1>there's hearns flat over bird around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that picture.</v>

2189
01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:37.610
<v Speaker 1>He was a giant 45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2190
01:36:37.611 --> 01:36:39.170
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in this time though,</v>

2191
01:36:39.171 --> 01:36:40.130
<v Speaker 1>he was 54.</v>

2192
01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I think you went up to 54.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a because Roberto Duran had </v>

2193
01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.600
<v Speaker 1>beaten Davey Moore and I think that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>at 54.</v>

2194
01:36:47.601 --> 01:36:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Was it at 60?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Roberto follow all the way up to</v>

2195
01:36:50.091 --> 01:36:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Hagler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's my favorite.</v>

2196
01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Roberto Duran was my favorite fighter </v>
<v Speaker 1>jet.</v>

2197
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His attitude like the human pit bull,</v>

2198
01:36:56.841 --> 01:36:58.480
<v Speaker 1>the stair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much he loves fire.</v>

2199
01:36:58.510 --> 01:37:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Hearns is than him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>

2200
01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

2201
01:37:01.311 --> 01:37:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Literally a different looking human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

2202
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that picture of him jabbing them</v>

2203
01:37:05.091 --> 01:37:07.120
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David and Goliath right there.</v>

2204
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a large fellow.</v>

2205
01:37:10.371 --> 01:37:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Tommy hearns and Duran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loved to fight.</v>

2206
01:37:13.850 --> 01:37:18.850
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needed to stay the fuck away from </v>

2207
01:37:18.850 --> 01:37:18.850
<v Speaker 1>microphones to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2208
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps that whole talking things over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I watched some hagler.</v>

2209
01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I watched some marvelous Marvin Hagler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2210
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:26.120
<v Speaker 1>he was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marvelous.</v>

2211
01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Margaret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2212
01:37:26.810 --> 01:37:31.810
<v Speaker 1>I still to this day maintain that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gross should have won that fight with </v>

2213
01:37:31.810 --> 01:37:31.810
<v Speaker 1>sugar ray Leonard started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2214
01:37:31.810 --> 01:37:34.430
<v Speaker 1>enough to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just touching them.</v>

2215
01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

2216
01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:39.350
<v Speaker 1>How do you think the big questions are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People ask these but Connecticut,</v>

2217
01:37:39.351 --> 01:37:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Lufkin with Hagler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2218
01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:42.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of.</v>

2219
01:37:42.111 --> 01:37:47.111
<v Speaker 1>We'll never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll never get the real question is </v>

2220
01:37:47.111 --> 01:37:47.111
<v Speaker 1>what's Gennady Golovkin going to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Canelo Alvarez.</v>

2221
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Floyd mayweather things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canelo Alvarez.</v>

2222
01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Gonna Knock Lufkin out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Lufkin is bigger,</v>

2223
01:37:53.150 --> 01:37:54.500
<v Speaker 1>taller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>

2224
01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.120
<v Speaker 1>He hits bit as hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2225
01:37:57.540 --> 01:38:00.630
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a little much for Canelo.</v>

2226
01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what Gennady and Andre </v>

2227
01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Ward would have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would the thing is,</v>

2228
01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.420
<v Speaker 1>did you see the fight with Kell Brooks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kell Brooks had some serious moments.</v>

2229
01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:11.460
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made the human.</v>

2230
01:38:11.461 --> 01:38:13.140
<v Speaker 1>But the problem was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what I understand,</v>

2231
01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:15.930
<v Speaker 1>you also had a bad flu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2232
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2233
01:38:16.861 --> 01:38:18.470
<v Speaker 1>He had a bad flu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will that change?</v>

2234
01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:22.510
<v Speaker 1>And then can I proceeded to break it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kells,</v>

2235
01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:27.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think orbital socket and beat him up </v>

2236
01:38:27.530 --> 01:38:30.050
<v Speaker 1>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is as fucking hell of a </v>

2237
01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:30.050
<v Speaker 1>hell of a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2238
01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:34.820
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kell Brooks is not Canelo Canelo's a </v>

2239
01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:35.790
<v Speaker 1>murderous one punch knockout artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2240
01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:37.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a totally different experience.</v>

2241
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Like Canelo can flat line people and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does it.</v>

2242
01:38:40.650 --> 01:38:45.650
<v Speaker 1>He does it with bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is whether or not he'll </v>

2243
01:38:45.650 --> 01:38:46.680
<v Speaker 1>ever be able to get one of those bombs </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

2244
01:38:46.890 --> 01:38:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch them with Amir Khan,</v>

2245
01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:50.640
<v Speaker 1>he would keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd fake loan,</v>

2246
01:38:50.670 --> 01:38:51.930
<v Speaker 1>He Jab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jab,</v>

2247
01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Jab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logo,</v>

2248
01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.980
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't work like eight times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then finally Chad Lowe,</v>

2249
01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:57.510
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

2250
01:38:57.510 --> 01:39:00.600
<v Speaker 1>And just came to the top and just knock </v>
<v Speaker 1>them out that that's.</v>

2251
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of his Mane Gotu </v>
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>

2252
01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:04.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2253
01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:06.630
<v Speaker 1>that is a different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally different animal,</v>

2254
01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:07.220
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2255
01:39:07.230 --> 01:39:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean he has a way better chin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also.</v>

2256
01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.680
<v Speaker 1>He also makes you pay for things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You throw his,</v>

2257
01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:14.030
<v Speaker 1>his counters when you get hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the box and then smoke some weed and </v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to start lifting.</v>

2313
01:41:39.610 --> 01:41:44.610
<v Speaker 1>It's okay because I don't know because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just talking about dead lifting in </v>

2314
01:41:44.610 --> 01:41:45.820
<v Speaker 1>front of those guys at 1:45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's impressive.</v>

2315
01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried to Max out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2316
01:41:50.930 --> 01:41:51.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't Max out,</v>

2317
01:41:51.701 --> 01:41:52.720

<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

2318
01:41:52.721 --> 01:41:54.820
<v Speaker 1>If you really had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think you could bench?</v>

2319
01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to do what's three plates?</v>

2320
01:41:57.391 --> 01:41:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2321
01:41:57.691 --> 01:42:02.691
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three slash five slash three slash 15 </v>

2322
01:42:02.691 --> 01:42:02.691
<v Speaker 2>was 2:25</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 95?</v>

2323
01:42:02.691 --> 01:42:02.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do three.</v>

2324
01:42:02.691 --> 01:42:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five for three or four?</v>

2325
01:42:04.150 --> 01:42:05.460
<v Speaker 2>Three 52 plates?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2326
01:42:05.610 --> 01:42:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what it is?</v>

2327
01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of weight.</v>

2328
01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:08.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2329
01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever tried to dead lift Max?</v>

2330
01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2331
01:42:14.071 --> 01:42:18.690
<v Speaker 2>never did left at Max,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would work out with 4:50.</v>

2332
01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:21.840
<v Speaker 2>So what does that work out you deadlift </v>
<v Speaker 2>for 50?</v>

2333
01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:23.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did look for 50.</v>

2334
01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:28.160
<v Speaker 2>You work out with 450 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four hundred 50 pounds a fuck load of </v>

2335
01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:28.160
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

2336
01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:30.590
<v Speaker 2>It's not that much weight on a crossbar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>

2337
01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:32.340
<v Speaker 2>it's on a straight bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of bar?</v>

2338
01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Those ones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just stand inside those hexagon bars and</v>

2339
01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:35.590
<v Speaker 2>grabbed the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2340
01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:37.290
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a fuck load of weight.</v>

2341
01:42:37.290 --> 01:42:38.520
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strong as fuck,</v>

2342
01:42:38.521 --> 01:42:39.810
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2343
01:42:39.811 --> 01:42:43.050
<v Speaker 2>That's been dead deadlifting for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2344
01:42:43.410 --> 01:42:48.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started out dead lifting to 25 and </v>

2345
01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:51.171
<v Speaker 2>then I went up to three plates and now I</v>
<v Speaker 2>four plates a little bit more.</v>

2346
01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:55.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's total nine plates plus the bars.</v>

2347
01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Well he's twenty five cents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fuck little weight.</v>

2348
01:43:00.690 --> 01:43:05.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only do it for like two or three </v>

2349
01:43:05.690 --> 01:43:05.690
<v Speaker 2>reps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I want,</v>

2350
01:43:05.690 --> 01:43:08.720
<v Speaker 2>what I believe is that when you get to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain proficiency at lifting right </v>

2351
01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.410
<v Speaker 2>then and only then should you lift </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy,</v>

2352
01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:14.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've,</v>

2353
01:43:14.101 --> 01:43:17.970
<v Speaker 2>you've built up like a good solid base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then only then should you live to heavy.</v>

2354
01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:23.030
<v Speaker 2>And I follow like the Tat Salini </v>
<v Speaker 2>Protocol where like say if I can do 10 </v>

2355
01:43:25.561 --> 01:43:27.510
<v Speaker 2>reps or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never do 10,</v>

2356
01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:32.540
<v Speaker 2>I do five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if I get to like if I'm doing </v>

2357
01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:36.081
<v Speaker 2>something heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm doing 90 pound clean press </v>

2358
01:43:37.081 --> 01:43:39.240
<v Speaker 2>squats where I'm holding 90 pounds over </v>
<v Speaker 2>my head,</v>

2359
01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:43.540
<v Speaker 2>I could probably do 10 of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I only do for so.</v>

2360
01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:46.890
<v Speaker 2>So you don't go to muscle atrophy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't go to failure.</v>

2361
01:43:47.250 --> 01:43:50.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in going to failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think is the best off.</v>

2362
01:43:50.610 --> 01:43:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Doing less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less repetitions,</v>

2363
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:58.510
<v Speaker 2>more often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so instead of doing one day when you </v>

2364
01:43:58.510 --> 01:43:59.220
<v Speaker 2>blow your whole fucking system out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd do</v>

2365
01:43:59.250 --> 01:44:00.700
<v Speaker 1>one more bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on one more</v>

2366
01:44:02.210 --> 01:44:03.890
<v Speaker 2>the next day you could barely walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2367
01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:06.580
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what Paul says,</v>

2368
01:44:06.581 --> 01:44:09.730
<v Speaker 2>and this is what a lot of people like A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a company called strong first.</v>

2369
01:44:09.731 --> 01:44:14.731
<v Speaker 2>What they recommend this like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few people at the front of the line when</v>

2370
01:44:16.001 --> 01:44:20.770
<v Speaker 2>it comes to what you would call a </v>
<v Speaker 2>functional fitness functional strength,</v>

2371
01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:24.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they think that public halls,</v>

2372
01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:28.150
<v Speaker 2>greasing the groove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means do it more often,</v>

2373
01:44:28.690 --> 01:44:33.690
<v Speaker 2>but do it not to failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead of having one workout every </v>

2374
01:44:33.690 --> 01:44:35.230
<v Speaker 2>three days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we below your body,</v>

2375
01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:40.260
<v Speaker 2>I have one workout every day and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't blow your body and you'll get </v>

2376
01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:40.390
<v Speaker 2>stronger core.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stimulate,</v>

2377
01:44:40.391 --> 01:44:41.320
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not la.</v>

2378
01:44:41.410 --> 01:44:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason in pincher creek where</v>

2379
01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:45.280
<v Speaker 2>you can go to failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2380
01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Why would you go to failure in nature?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't.</v>

2381
01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:52.920
<v Speaker 2>So how does how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to how to animals and people and </v>

2382
01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:56.191
<v Speaker 2>farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they get strong farmers and get </v>

2383
01:44:56.191 --> 01:44:56.191
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously fucking strong from going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to failure?</v>

2384
01:44:56.191 --> 01:45:00.811
<v Speaker 2>Every day they get ridiculously strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>from consistently taxing their body </v>

2385
01:45:00.811 --> 01:45:03.640
<v Speaker 2>moving bails of Hay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>picking up heavy things.</v>

2386
01:45:03.670 --> 01:45:05.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do that consistently.</v>

2387
01:45:05.370 --> 01:45:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Make it stronger and stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2388
01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's mostly what I do.</v>

2389
01:45:08.711 --> 01:45:11.380
<v Speaker 2>So if I dead lift heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I rarely do,</v>

2390
01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.360
<v Speaker 2>that's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I only do it for a few rep.</v>

2391
01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:13.360
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

2392
01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:17.180
<v Speaker 1>so funny because I did a scene with Matt</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hughes on Kingdom that show that I recur</v>

2393
01:45:17.190 --> 01:45:19.820
<v Speaker 1>on and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda grabbed him.</v>

2394
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>back of my head.</v>

2399
01:45:28.791 --> 01:45:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of grabbed the back of my </v>

<v Speaker 1>instead of sprawling,</v>

2456
01:47:16.861 --> 01:47:21.480
<v Speaker 1>naturally I threw my body backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the way the way you would do like</v>

2457
01:47:21.481 --> 01:47:24.720
<v Speaker 1>when a girl sees a Rockstar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes like the stereotypical,</v>

2458
01:47:24.721 --> 01:47:29.721
<v Speaker 1>like in the movies in the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I throw my body back and I hit my </v>

2459
01:47:29.721 --> 01:47:33.450
<v Speaker 1>forearm so hard on the fucking door jam </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I gave myself a deep,</v>

2460
01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:37.320
<v Speaker 1>deep forearm bruise that I had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>perform through.</v>

2461
01:47:37.370 --> 01:47:39.110
<v Speaker 1>It was tough for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to know.</v>

01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:41.010
<v Speaker 1>I was very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a big guy.</v>

2463
01:47:41.011 --> 01:47:42.870
<v Speaker 1>You're a smaller guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is that it is.</v>

2464
01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I know what it's like to wrestle with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla.</v>

2465
01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's different size people at there.</v>

2466
01:47:46.501 --> 01:47:51.280

<v Speaker 1>that guy is a butcher smile.</v>

2467
01:47:51.330 --> 01:47:53.280
<v Speaker 1>I do it all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was very good at it because you could </v>

2470
01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:02.120
<v Speaker 1>do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rose McGowan.</v>

2471
01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Tell me he couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he kicked her.</v>

2472

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2473
01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:06.450
<v Speaker 1>I've never wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could fuck rose McGowan up.</v>

2474
01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could I probably ugly frozen Miguel and </v>

2475
01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:14.691
<v Speaker 1>try to kick your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're on a beach and you're </v>

2476
01:48:14.691 --> 01:48:17.121
<v Speaker 1>competing for coconuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was deciding the you didn't deserve </v>

2477
01:48:17.121 --> 01:48:17.121
<v Speaker 1>a coconut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2478
01:48:17.121 --> 01:48:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I'd be such a Beta male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

2479
01:48:18.241 --> 01:48:19.810
<v Speaker 1>let me put you into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like a cleanser,</v>

2480
01:48:19.811 --> 01:48:24.811
<v Speaker 1>a fucking tree for you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long do you think you'd have to go </v>

2481
01:48:24.811 --> 01:48:28.011
<v Speaker 1>before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to yell at her if you </v>

2482
01:48:28.011 --> 01:48:28.011
<v Speaker 1>were on an island?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good question.</v>

2483
01:48:28.011 --> 01:48:29.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rose McGowan on an island.</v>

2484
01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:33.450
<v Speaker 1>She'd probably be very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd probably be very effective.</v>

2485
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:38.750
<v Speaker 1>I would have helped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think she's probably one of those </v>

2486
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:41.441
<v Speaker 1>people is probably very focused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got enough anger to drive her </v>

2487
01:48:41.441 --> 01:48:44.361
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would decide that the community on </v>

2488
01:48:44.361 --> 01:48:44.361
<v Speaker 1>this island is incredibly sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2489
01:48:44.361 --> 01:48:46.260
<v Speaker 1>But then she's also really sexual and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd be like,</v>

2490
01:48:46.261 --> 01:48:49.080
<v Speaker 1>how old are you again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many squares in your stomach and why</v>

2491
01:48:49.081 --> 01:48:51.150
<v Speaker 1>do you move like a fucking cat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>

2492
01:48:51.151 --> 01:48:52.500
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what about this?</v>

2493
01:48:52.501 --> 01:48:54.510
<v Speaker 1>And she'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing can't be real.</v>

2494
01:48:54.511 --> 01:48:58.680
<v Speaker 1>And then we'd be off to the racist man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's optimistic.</v>

2495
01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying what would happen in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

2496
01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I have a feeling it would be like a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of yelling and then she would.</v>

2497
01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:09.030
<v Speaker 1>She was the only vagina in known </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization and she would just run your</v>

2498
01:49:09.031 --> 01:49:09.780
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2499
01:49:09.781 --> 01:49:14.781
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I let her run my world in a boat </v>

2500
01:49:14.781 --> 01:49:15.300
<v Speaker 1>would pull up to shore and be a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls that were on a yacht,</v>

2501
01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:19.380
<v Speaker 1>jumped away from this Russian mobster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they get lost at sea.</v>

2502
01:49:19.650 --> 01:49:24.650
<v Speaker 1>When they landed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they landed on this island and then all </v>

2503
01:49:24.650 --> 01:49:24.650
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden she would change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then she'd be your girlfriend.</v>

2504
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Then she'd be holding hands with you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking to you and everything </v>

2505
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:33.441
<v Speaker 1>would change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just be one guy knows how to get the </v>

2506
01:49:33.441 --> 01:49:33.441
<v Speaker 1>coconuts guy who knows how to fish with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a stick.</v>

2507
01:49:33.441 --> 01:49:37.390
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows how to get in there with the </v>

2508

2529
01:50:15.450 --> 01:50:17.251
<v Speaker 1>wrote a book about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was essentially the idea that when </v>

<v Speaker 1>you feel 100 percent secure in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

2531
01:50:17.251 --> 01:50:22.111
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad thing for a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should always feel like there's a </v>

2532
01:50:22.111 --> 01:50:25.141
<v Speaker 1>little danger of your spouse strain </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's fucking very important to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>those girls or her friend,</v>

2535
01:50:31.630 --> 01:50:34.940

<v Speaker 1>but they're really does strengthen the </v>

01:50:41.571 --> 01:50:41.571
<v Speaker 1>relationship that you and Rosa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>exotic lands and they'd taken selfies.</v>

01:51:46.601 --> 01:51:48.390
<v Speaker 1>You don't see the guys that are paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'd be one of those guys.</v>

2564
01:51:56.580 --> 01:51:57.440
<v Speaker 1>About 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think.</v>

2565
01:51:57.450 --> 01:51:58.330
<v Speaker 1>So keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2566
01:51:58.870 --> 01:52:03.870
<v Speaker 1>do you think you'll ever get to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like driving around in a yacht with a </v>

2567
01:52:04.721 --> 01:52:05.980
<v Speaker 1>bunch of prostitutes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2568
01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:07.860
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2569
01:52:07.930 --> 01:52:10.780
<v Speaker 1>and I've always had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to a little bit and I</v>

2570
01:52:10.781 --> 01:52:15.781
<v Speaker 1>always come back to my set point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you got to be a man of </v>

2571
01:52:15.781 --> 01:52:15.781
<v Speaker 1>substance and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2572
01:52:15.781 --> 01:52:20.550
<v Speaker 1>it's why I never dated super like Barbie</v>
<v Speaker 1>doll girls.</v>

2573
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I would always find it a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing.</v>

2574
01:52:22.871 --> 01:52:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the same reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never drove a really fast fancy car.</v>

2575
01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did something about that ostentatious </v>

<v Speaker 1>Like I like,</v>

2578
01:52:31.051 --> 01:52:31.580
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2579
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Here's a better way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

2580
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:36.020
<v Speaker 1>I want to get away from my appetites </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2581
01:52:36.021 --> 01:52:38.980

<v Speaker 1>That's all nice.</v>

2593
01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:12.140
<v Speaker 1>But I don't want to be somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 1>chases this sensation.</v>

2594
01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Are you chasing a sensation or are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just hitting the gas and headed straight</v>

<v Speaker 1>rest has been done too many times.</v>

2600
01:53:23.391 --> 01:53:24.740
<v Speaker 1>I've already felt that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've already done it.</v>

2601
01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:26.810
<v Speaker 1>I want to move away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>while.</v>

2607
01:53:38.961 --> 01:53:41.450
<v Speaker 1>They find the fact that those guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to buy him a bunch of shit.</v>

2608
01:53:41.570 --> 01:53:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>recorded him saying racist stuff.</v>

2613
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2614
01:53:54.231 --> 01:53:57.770
<v Speaker 1>I think chasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing something that is,</v>

2615
01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:03.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is to get more away from that </v>

2616
01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:03.520
<v Speaker 1>and try to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2618
01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:05.630
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also a sensation.</v>

2619
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:07.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's all it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a fun sensation.</v>

2620
01:54:08.150 --> 01:54:12.050
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so as a so as wanting to be like I'm</v>

2621
01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:15.230
<v Speaker 1>valued by younger people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

2622
01:54:15.231 --> 01:54:20.110
<v Speaker 1>when men go after young women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one side of it which is you just</v>

2623
01:54:20.150 --> 01:54:22.890
<v Speaker 1>want young women are delicious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and you know,</v>

2624
01:54:22.891 --> 01:54:24.290
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their skin and all that.</v>

2625
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:28.010
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's another </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological thing at play,</v>

2626
01:54:28.011 --> 01:54:30.950
<v Speaker 1>which is also the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 60.</v>

2627
01:54:31.470 --> 01:54:34.520
<v Speaker 1>I still got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She still finds me attractive.</v>

2628
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I still can get it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can still pleased her sexually.</v>

2629
01:54:37.401 --> 01:54:41.240
<v Speaker 1>I can still hang with the 20 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can still make her happy.</v>

2630
01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:44.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a way of telling yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still alive,</v>

2631
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:47.300
<v Speaker 1>that you're still have vitality and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit,</v>

2632
01:54:47.301 --> 01:54:48.950
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the third thing which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2633
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:50.600
<v Speaker 1>look at what I've accomplished.</v>

2634
01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I can afford this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is another toy along with my car </v>

2635
01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:59.410
<v Speaker 1>and my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all self affirmation and it's </v>

2636
01:54:59.410 --> 01:55:02.381
<v Speaker 1>all at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a manifestation of probably some shit </v>

2637
01:55:02.381 --> 01:55:04.300
<v Speaker 1>you haven't worked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is still a feeling of insecurity.</v>

2638
01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Still a hole you can't fill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I hope I can move with that savage </v>

2639
01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:13.271
<v Speaker 1>with a Martini in your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a giant hard Dick and you've paid 30 </v>

<v Speaker 1>a month because you're your doctor found</v>

<v Speaker 1>Some shit going down and it's growing.</v>

2643

<v Speaker 1>get that going through the air.</v>

2707
01:58:07.130 --> 01:58:09.490
<v Speaker 1>No sharks fly through the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They jump out of the water.</v>

2708
01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:11.460
<v Speaker 1>This time it's going to jump out of </v>

<v Speaker 1>Parasites out their skin.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

2716
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:29.140

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 250 years.</v>

2721
01:58:38.710 --> 01:58:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how long the Greenland </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shark?</v>

2722

<v Speaker 1>It's a huge shark to try.</v>

2724
01:58:46.841 --> 01:58:50.050
<v Speaker 1>About almost 500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

2726
01:58:51.130 --> 01:58:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Brand theme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greenland.</v>

2727
01:58:52.011 --> 01:58:57.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think the greenland shark might </v>

2728
01:58:57.011 --> 01:58:57.011
<v Speaker 1>have been what people were seeing in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>loch ness.</v>

2729
01:58:57.011 --> 01:59:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Loch ness at one point in history was </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to the ocean and I think that </v>

2730
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.930
<v Speaker 1>that might've been the animal that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>

2731
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:04.600
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting because it would live</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 years.</v>

2732
01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Although they live in very cold water </v>
<v Speaker 1>polo.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2734
01:59:08.830 --> 01:59:11.570

<v Speaker 1>that'll live 500 years apparently.</v>

2735
01:59:11.610 --> 01:59:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Four hundred year old greenland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shark is the oldest verblah animal </v>

2736
01:59:16.610 --> 01:59:16.690

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so amazing.</v>

2747
01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:51.730
<v Speaker 1>A tribe in the Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just found uncontacted tribe.</v>

2748
01:59:51.810 --> 01:59:53.260
<v Speaker 1>The Yanomamo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where were they from?</v>

2749

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2750
01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:57.310
<v Speaker 1>so I say Yanomamo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>

2751
01:59:57.400 --> 02:00:00.570
<v Speaker 1>isn't that the tribe that Rinella went </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting with?</v>

2752
02:00:00.571 --> 02:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>And Bolivia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2753
02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:06.740
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that they're the tribe that when </v>

2754
02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:06.740
<v Speaker 1>they came back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anthropologists in the seventies and</v>

2755
02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:11.371
<v Speaker 1>found that the ones that killed the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>men in battle with the ones that sired </v>

2756
02:00:11.371 --> 02:00:12.730
<v Speaker 1>the most children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they came back in the seventies</v>

2757
02:00:12.731 --> 02:00:17.710
<v Speaker 1>and told the academic world that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aggression was inherent and that it</v>

2758
02:00:17.711 --> 02:00:20.000
<v Speaker 1>was rewarded by females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2759
02:00:20.001 --> 02:00:22.180
<v Speaker 1>you should've seen the politically </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

2760
02:00:22.181 --> 02:00:24.040
<v Speaker 1>You should have seen what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the seventies.</v>

2761
02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:26.530
<v Speaker 1>And that is rearing its head again </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

2762
02:00:26.530 --> 02:00:28.390
<v Speaker 1>The idea that aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

2763
02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:29.770
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2764
02:00:29.771 --> 02:00:34.771
<v Speaker 1>So they rejected it in primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't know that they attacked.</v>

2765
02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:36.790
<v Speaker 1>There's a steven pinker's book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blank slate.</v>

2766
02:00:36.791 --> 02:00:39.490
<v Speaker 1>They attacked the scientist as policies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that came back.</v>

2767
02:00:39.491 --> 02:00:42.430
<v Speaker 1>They attack them personally over it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to ruin their reputations.</v>

2768
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Look at how this guy's dressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2771
02:00:50.290 --> 02:00:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Indian Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck do they keep calling them </v>

2772
02:00:55.290 --> 02:00:58.321
<v Speaker 1>Indians?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the thing that's the aborigines </v>

2773
02:00:58.321 --> 02:00:59.470
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes from that bar in Brazil's.</v>

2774
02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's indigenous in.</v>

2775
02:01:01.390 --> 02:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Could you say indigenous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you say Indian because of </v>

2776
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>indigenous or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2777
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:07.210
<v Speaker 1>but that is so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

2778
02:01:07.330 --> 02:01:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Stop scrolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please go back up to where I was reading</v>

2779
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>what it was saying there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tribe has moved a number of times </v>

2780
02:01:14.750 --> 02:01:17.860
<v Speaker 1>since that citing a scout expert and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>regions indigenous groups.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Morrell Mirror morels was on last </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunday's flight as well as previous </v>

2782
02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:26.510
<v Speaker 1>missions in 2008 and 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That also yield.</v>

2783
02:01:26.511 --> 02:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Did extraordinary images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These groups changed location every four</v>

2784
02:01:30.011 --> 02:01:32.830
<v Speaker 1>years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They move around,</v>

2785
02:01:32.831 --> 02:01:35.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's the same group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How fast is he on Amazon?</v>

2786
02:01:35.770 --> 02:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Amazon is amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those fucking people that are </v>

2787
02:01:40.770 --> 02:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>chopping down the trees are closing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

2788
02:01:40.770 --> 02:01:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Sure are less awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that guy.</v>

2790
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:51.880
<v Speaker 1>where those people live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Thatch Hut Bach to keep the Jaguars </v>

<v Speaker 1>Tattoos all over him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie go larger on that image of him </v>

<v Speaker 1>air.</v>

2796
02:02:02.370 --> 02:02:06.350

<v Speaker 1>knife that's pictures from the air dude.</v>

2797

<v Speaker 1>They're flying over these police shit.</v>

2799
02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Photographer was looking for another </v>
<v Speaker 1>area he was going back for and stumbled </v>

2800
02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:15.470
<v Speaker 1>across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He saw that hut and then Oh,</v>

2801
02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:20.500
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got in closer and then saw the people </v>

2802
02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:20.960
<v Speaker 1>and started taking photos of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are living like people live</v>

2803
02:02:20.961 --> 02:02:24.680
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2804
02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:27.680
<v Speaker 1>So that looks like a modern knife to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>now that I'm looking at a deeper,</v>

2805
02:02:27.681 --> 02:02:29.720
<v Speaker 1>because if you look below where he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding onto it,</v>

2806

<v Speaker 1>So how are they uncontacted if they have</v>

2809

<v Speaker 1>at this.</v>

2811
02:02:42.561 --> 02:02:44.600
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that you see on them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's modern though.</v>

2812
02:02:44.601 --> 02:02:46.270

<v Speaker 1>of communal have to be,</v>

2816
02:02:53.041 --> 02:02:54.090

2844
02:03:57.771 --> 02:03:59.250
<v Speaker 1>by studying them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no,</v>

2845
02:03:59.270 --> 02:04:00.860
<v Speaker 1>there's no way to really study them </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2846
02:04:00.861 --> 02:04:05.861
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like would really the real way to study </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you live with them you'll be </v>

2851
02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:18.220
<v Speaker 1>affecting them because then people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would know that you're there.</v>

2852
02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Like the only way to really study them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be the study them without them </v>

2853
02:04:22.810 --> 02:04:23.030
<v Speaker 1>knowing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like look where they are.</v>

2854
02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Go back there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back and all that shit.</v>

2855
02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Don't change pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to that picture,</v>

2856
02:04:27.021 --> 02:04:32.021
<v Speaker 1>look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the little hut and then look at </v>

2857
02:04:32.021 --> 02:04:32.021
<v Speaker 1>where they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2858
02:04:32.021 --> 02:04:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

2859
02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Nice Green,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive amount of rain forest and they </v>

2860
02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:37.890
<v Speaker 1>just got this clearing</v>

2861
02:04:38.610 --> 02:04:40.220
<v Speaker 2>with this little hut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

2862
02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:44.760
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a view how to live there though.</v>

2863
02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Like you could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we.</v>

2864
02:04:47.190 --> 02:04:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Everything that we have in our brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what is good in life is attached </v>

2865
02:04:52.291 --> 02:04:55.890
<v Speaker 2>to civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Nice house in a good neighborhood.</v>

2866
02:04:55.891 --> 02:05:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I want to have cable TV and fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>internet and a microwave food.</v>

2867
02:05:00.270 --> 02:05:02.200
<v Speaker 2>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get it immediately.</v>

2868
02:05:02.230 --> 02:05:04.410
<v Speaker 2>Even if you could get food there if like</v>
<v Speaker 2>they knew.</v>

2869
02:05:04.411 --> 02:05:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Like they said they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They planted bananas.</v>

2870
02:05:06.391 --> 02:05:08.850
<v Speaker 2>They planted all this core and they knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the food was.</v>

2871
02:05:08.851 --> 02:05:13.851
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's a ton of living shit </v>

2872
02:05:13.851 --> 02:05:13.851
<v Speaker 2>out there that you can eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2873
02:05:13.851 --> 02:05:18.140
<v Speaker 2>So even if you can hunt and gather all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the food you need every single day of </v>

2874
02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:18.300
<v Speaker 2>the week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you be happy?</v>

2875
02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:23.420
<v Speaker 2>Would never performing standup again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you be happy never watching </v>

2876
02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:26.961
<v Speaker 2>Netflix again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And would you be happy with no cell </v>

2877
02:05:26.961 --> 02:05:26.961
<v Speaker 2>phone?</v>

2878
02:05:26.961 --> 02:05:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Would you be happy with no air flights?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man Live forever.</v>

2879
02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Me and my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

2880
02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:30.710
<v Speaker 2>my Indian girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2881
02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Who by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it smells like an African prison riot.</v>

2882
02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:36.420
<v Speaker 2>How often does that chuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why rains a lot?</v>

2883
02:05:36.421 --> 02:05:39.410
<v Speaker 2>It rains a lot and the rains cleanse the</v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

2884
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:43.100
<v Speaker 2>You fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You smelled centric.</v>

2885
02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Mother's parcel gland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably smells like a skunk car.</v>

2886
02:05:47.071 --> 02:05:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Saw Gland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd probably.</v>

2887
02:05:48.361 --> 02:05:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Everyone probably smells like a skunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She will.</v>

2888
02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:52.380
<v Speaker 2>She probably doesn't bother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So few of them.</v>

2889
02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:57.440
<v Speaker 2>She smokes inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tribes were so small because they </v>

2890
02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:57.660
<v Speaker 2>smelled so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They rarely fucked.</v>

2891
02:05:58.590 --> 02:06:01.890
<v Speaker 2>And then once people figured out soap </v>
<v Speaker 2>population just exploded.</v>

2892
02:06:01.891 --> 02:06:03.740
<v Speaker 2>Like you smell good enough to fuck.</v>

2893
02:06:06.030 --> 02:06:11.030
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sanitation played a huge part in </v>

2894
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.030
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>

2895
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:14.670
<v Speaker 2>Smelled good enough to be super horny to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck one of these people.</v>

2896
02:06:14.671 --> 02:06:16.840
<v Speaker 2>They took pictures from the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2897
02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to do that is mind blowing.</v>

2898
02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:25.040
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they probably have this haircut and </v>

2899
02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:25.380
<v Speaker 2>this is a guy working as bow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is um,</v>

2900
02:06:25.530 --> 02:06:28.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean he had to have something to shave</v>
<v Speaker 2>his head,</v>

2901
02:06:28.201 --> 02:06:30.330
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Body paint.</v>

2902
02:06:30.331 --> 02:06:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Obviously to protect from insects </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

2903
02:06:32.290 --> 02:06:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're right.</v>

2904
02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:36.440
<v Speaker 2>But the hall right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the hair,</v>

2905
02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:41.560
<v Speaker 2>it appears like he's got a razor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can do that to his hair to look </v>

2906
02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:43.440
<v Speaker 2>at them or some sort of a knife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the shaved.</v>

2907
02:06:44.010 --> 02:06:46.110
<v Speaker 2>I cannot believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated by this.</v>

2908
02:06:46.210 --> 02:06:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>

2909
02:06:46.931 --> 02:06:48.170
<v Speaker 2>We're in the stone age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2910
02:06:48.171 --> 02:06:50.340
<v Speaker 2>intense shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's human beings in the raw.</v>

2911
02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:52.950
<v Speaker 2>That's human beings in the raw and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't had.</v>

2912
02:06:53.130 --> 02:06:58.130
<v Speaker 2>Haven't come into contact with other </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and other cultures and other </v>

2913
02:06:58.130 --> 02:06:59.520
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they stayed that way.</v>

2914
02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the argument against keeping </v>

2915
02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:08.181
<v Speaker 2>dolphins and whales in captivity that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people who in these are absolutely</v>

2916
02:07:08.911 --> 02:07:10.920
<v Speaker 2>100 percent human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2917
02:07:10.921 --> 02:07:13.200
<v Speaker 2>We would give them the same rights that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I both enjoy.</v>

2918
02:07:13.650 --> 02:07:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Those people live like they live </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years ago.</v>

2919
02:07:17.161 --> 02:07:20.900
<v Speaker 2>They have a very crude existence that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not very far removed from workers.</v>

2920
02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:26.200
<v Speaker 2>So it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that's different is </v>

2921
02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:26.200
<v Speaker 2>shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've developed shelter,</v>

2922
02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:27.510
<v Speaker 2>which is totally unnecessary for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphin or a killer whale.</v>

2923
02:07:27.930 --> 02:07:29.580
<v Speaker 2>So other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2924
02:07:29.581 --> 02:07:34.581
<v Speaker 2>with all the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the metrics that we use to describe </v>

2925
02:07:34.581 --> 02:07:34.581
<v Speaker 2>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have some tools,</v>

2926
02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:39.620
<v Speaker 2>so tools made out of sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could teach a boy scout how to make a </v>

2927
02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:40.300
<v Speaker 2>bow like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are differences.</v>

2928
02:07:40.670 --> 02:07:42.150
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their mind yet.</v>

2929
02:07:42.190 --> 02:07:43.580
<v Speaker 2>But to us looking at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2930
02:07:44.070 --> 02:07:48.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're looking at an incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>primitive form of human life in terms of</v>

2931
02:07:48.221 --> 02:07:53.221
<v Speaker 2>like what we think of as important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how much of a difference is that </v>

2932
02:07:53.221 --> 02:07:53.990
<v Speaker 2>than orcas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well here.</v>

2933
02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah.</v>

2934
02:07:54.810 --> 02:07:56.440
<v Speaker 2>You mean you're talking about that exact</v>
<v Speaker 2>example?</v>

2935
02:07:56.441 --> 02:07:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That hasn't come into it.</v>

2936
02:07:58.060 --> 02:07:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Hasn't had the benefit of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2937
02:07:59.290 --> 02:08:01.090
<v Speaker 2>of sort of sharing ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

2938
02:08:01.091 --> 02:08:03.640
<v Speaker 2>having sex as hunter says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2939
02:08:03.641 --> 02:08:04.960
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

2940
02:08:05.300 --> 02:08:07.660
<v Speaker 2>So it's so amazing that it exists </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2941
02:08:07.661 --> 02:08:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know how they could study </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2942
02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:10.690
<v Speaker 2>but God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to.</v>

2943
02:08:10.970 --> 02:08:15.970
<v Speaker 2>They have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's gotta be a way to </v>

2944
02:08:15.970 --> 02:08:18.481
<v Speaker 2>infiltrate in some sort of a way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand they did a lot of that in </v>

2945
02:08:18.481 --> 02:08:20.170
<v Speaker 2>influencing them pop on Guinea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did a lot of that.</v>

2946
02:08:20.190 --> 02:08:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

2947
02:08:21.041 --> 02:08:23.000
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of influence though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2948
02:08:23.001 --> 02:08:23.650
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2949
02:08:24.010 --> 02:08:25.930
<v Speaker 2>There's some horrible shit that came out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of New Guinea.</v>

2950
02:08:26.420 --> 02:08:27.460
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know about the new,</v>

2951
02:08:27.610 --> 02:08:32.610
<v Speaker 2>the semen warriors I sure do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And and they did a study on how many of </v>

2952
02:08:34.241 --> 02:08:36.970
<v Speaker 2>them actually become gay later on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only about five percent.</v>

2953
02:08:37.390 --> 02:08:39.040
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>

2954
02:08:39.041 --> 02:08:44.041
<v Speaker 2>But the boys to reach puberty have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>suck the sperm out of the men in the </v>

2955
02:08:44.981 --> 02:08:49.981
<v Speaker 2>tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to suck them off and take it </v>

2956
02:08:49.981 --> 02:08:52.291
<v Speaker 2>in their ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually it's sucking for about two </v>

2957
02:08:52.291 --> 02:08:52.291
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

2958
02:08:52.291 --> 02:08:53.890
<v Speaker 2>three years until they reach puberty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said,</v>

2959
02:08:53.950 --> 02:08:55.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can ingest a lot of Dick.</v>

2960
02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:00.880
<v Speaker 2>Suck a lot of debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to do that to get </v>

2961
02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:00.880
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2962
02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:02.190
<v Speaker 2>You got to do that to become a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone should just have the rock flying</v>

2963
02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:03.070
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at me.</v>

2964
02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Boys never sucked a dick once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2965
02:09:05.210 --> 02:09:07.030
<v Speaker 2>And then that was the whole thing would </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

2966
02:09:07.090 --> 02:09:11.240
<v Speaker 2>That is how it would stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly how you'd be like,</v>

2967
02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:12.960
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those fucking guys are really strong and</v>

2968
02:09:12.961 --> 02:09:17.961
<v Speaker 2>they never talked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They must ingest the semen of their </v>

2969
02:09:17.961 --> 02:09:20.310
<v Speaker 2>elders daily from the age of seven until</v>
<v Speaker 2>he turned 17 to achieve adult male </v>

2970
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:25.081
<v Speaker 2>status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not true to properly mature and </v>

2971
02:09:25.081 --> 02:09:27.511
<v Speaker 2>grow strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read that it was a little older than </v>

2972
02:09:27.511 --> 02:09:27.511
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

2973
02:09:27.511 --> 02:09:27.511
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not altogether true.</v>

2974
02:09:27.511 --> 02:09:30.790
<v Speaker 2>So they'll sure on wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck do you know?</v>

2975
02:09:30.820 --> 02:09:33.790
<v Speaker 2>I think that they may be because in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book a billion wicked thoughts.</v>

2976
02:09:33.791 --> 02:09:35.020
<v Speaker 2>I think they start when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2977
02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:40.140
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna reach puberty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like did like 13 when they started to </v>

2978
02:09:40.140 --> 02:09:41.020
<v Speaker 2>show signs and then it helps you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

2979
02:09:41.150 --> 02:09:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Because I had read that same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

2980
02:09:42.551 --> 02:09:44.460
<v Speaker 2>that it was younger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was seven.</v>

2981
02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's.</v>

2982
02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:46.530
<v Speaker 2>That guy's cock.</v>

2983
02:09:46.570 --> 02:09:49.210
<v Speaker 2>Smells good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at him.</v>

2984
02:09:49.690 --> 02:09:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look though.</v>

2985
02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:51.910
<v Speaker 2>They'll get them great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look.</v>

2986
02:09:51.911 --> 02:09:56.911
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a crazy look from a guy who you </v>

2987
02:09:56.911 --> 02:09:56.911
<v Speaker 2>have to blow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2988
02:09:56.911 --> 02:09:58.000
<v Speaker 2>look at how human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they decorate themselves.</v>

2989
02:09:58.040 --> 02:09:59.970
<v Speaker 2>It's going to suck my cock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's hanging?</v>

2990
02:10:00.630 --> 02:10:05.630
<v Speaker 2>You have to suck a grown man's Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's another thing if he's dressed up </v>

2991
02:10:05.630 --> 02:10:06.310
<v Speaker 2>like pokemon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what is that paint that he's got on</v>

2992
02:10:06.311 --> 02:10:08.830
<v Speaker 2>his face swell up so I can see the lungs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and American horror story.</v>

2993
02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Look at the pain on his face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of.</v>

2994
02:10:11.171 --> 02:10:16.171
<v Speaker 2>He's got this crazy white nose and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bright yellow paint all over his face </v>

2995
02:10:16.171 --> 02:10:16.870
<v Speaker 2>with red stripes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2996
02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:18.730
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's putting in your mouth.</v>

2997
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a hell of a fro.</v>

2998
02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:24.220
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's gonna stick with you.</v>

2999
02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Those images are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stick with you.</v>

3000
02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Average lifespan in Papa New Guinea for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of those tribes is 45 by the way,</v>

3001
02:10:29.590 --> 02:10:30.850
<v Speaker 2>because they're sucking dicks all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3002
02:10:30.851 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 2>That can't be good for eating roots and </v>
<v Speaker 2>food and they're getting</v>

3003
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:35.930
<v Speaker 1>infections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

3004
02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big myth about,</v>

3005
02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:39.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're in the jungle there.</v>

3006
02:10:39.261 --> 02:10:41.190
<v Speaker 1>You can assimilate and you live at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3007
02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:42.830
<v Speaker 1>no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happens.</v>

3008
02:10:42.831 --> 02:10:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Like you get a cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets infected.</v>

3009
02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:49.400
<v Speaker 1>It's immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And homicide is huge.</v>

3010
02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Homicides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the leading cause of death among</v>

3011
02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:57.120
<v Speaker 1>hunter gatherer tribes in Papa New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guinea because they just get into these </v>

3012
02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:58.850
<v Speaker 1>fights with the agenda because when to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get back the dude that made you suck his</v>

3013
02:10:58.851 --> 02:11:00.390
<v Speaker 1>dick when you were seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3014
02:11:00.410 --> 02:11:01.520
<v Speaker 1>he's in your tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

3015
02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:06.580
<v Speaker 1>That's just part of it because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting your dick suck now you have to </v>

3016
02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:09.101
<v Speaker 1>understand part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just passed down generation to </v>

3017
02:11:09.101 --> 02:11:11.090
<v Speaker 1>generation molestation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

3018
02:11:11.150 --> 02:11:14.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like child molestation built</v>

3019
02:11:14.391 --> 02:11:16.160
<v Speaker 1>into the operating system with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

3020
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Some pedophile said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what guys?</v>

3021
02:11:18.471 --> 02:11:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3022
02:11:19.210 --> 02:11:20.240
<v Speaker 1>I saw a vision.</v>

3023
02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:23.000
<v Speaker 1>You think that's one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing.</v>

3024
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Here's the real question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like throughout history,</v>

3025
02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean like literally from the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time people have been molesting young</v>

3026
02:11:30.321 --> 02:11:35.321
<v Speaker 1>boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like grown men would take young boys </v>

3027
02:11:35.321 --> 02:11:35.940
<v Speaker 1>places and the last time logs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's socrates,</v>

3028
02:11:35.970 --> 02:11:37.200
<v Speaker 1>it's in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the dialogue.</v>

3029
02:11:37.210 --> 02:11:38.450
<v Speaker 1>So the symposium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3030
02:11:38.451 --> 02:11:41.120
<v Speaker 1>How nuts is that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you consider socrates,</v>

3031
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:43.130
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you have to consider </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a PSA.</v>

3032
02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Socrates was a pedophile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He apparently was married and didn't </v>

3033
02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:51.911
<v Speaker 1>partake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly aristotle and Plato and </v>

3034
02:11:51.911 --> 02:11:55.301
<v Speaker 1>his students identities didn't and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his and his contemporaries would talk </v>

3035
02:11:55.301 --> 02:11:57.440
<v Speaker 1>about how we have nice boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back and drink some wine.</v>

3036
02:11:57.890 --> 02:12:02.890
<v Speaker 1>We'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go eat and kiss some beautiful </v>

3037
02:12:02.890 --> 02:12:02.890
<v Speaker 1>boys and then we'll talk some more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3038
02:12:02.890 --> 02:12:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust him.</v>

3039
02:12:06.290 --> 02:12:08.120
<v Speaker 1>He was never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was always.</v>

3040
02:12:08.340 --> 02:12:13.340
<v Speaker 1>He famously said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as philosophers should treat their </v>

3041
02:12:13.340 --> 02:12:13.360
<v Speaker 1>appetites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their body with a quiet contempt.</v>

3042
02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Learn to let go of your body as you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>older and not not hold onto it because </v>

3043
02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:20.450
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna have to let go of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who's the opposite of the dude in the</v>

3044
02:12:20.451 --> 02:12:24.590
<v Speaker 1>yacht with a ringing years and the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat really well and so much so that when</v>

3045
02:12:24.591 --> 02:12:27.440
<v Speaker 1>he got poisoned by the hemlock and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>students were crying,</v>

3046
02:12:27.710 --> 02:12:28.520
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

3047
02:12:28.521 --> 02:12:31.220
<v Speaker 1>what are you crying for it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're crying over my shell.</v>

3048
02:12:31.610 --> 02:12:36.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm going onto something bigger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're crying about this broken down </v>

3049
02:12:36.610 --> 02:12:36.860
<v Speaker 1>machinery that's going to break down </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

3050
02:12:36.861 --> 02:12:39.290
<v Speaker 1>If I taught you nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did he get poisoned again?</v>

3051
02:12:39.590 --> 02:12:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Because he wouldn't essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would not stop talking.</v>

3052
02:12:44.810 --> 02:12:47.720
<v Speaker 1>He was considered to be a heretic in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way he was,</v>

3053
02:12:47.721 --> 02:12:51.260
<v Speaker 1>he was speaking against Athens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bet against the elite,</v>

3054
02:12:51.290 --> 02:12:52.850
<v Speaker 1>against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3055
02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:56.060
<v Speaker 1>against the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was a man of reason,</v>

3056
02:12:56.330 --> 02:12:58.400
<v Speaker 1>not so much faith but rather reason.</v>

3057
02:12:58.730 --> 02:13:03.730
<v Speaker 1>And so he was somebody who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered to be a threat to the power </v>

3058
02:13:03.981 --> 02:13:06.230
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a threat to the religion threat to,</v>

3059
02:13:06.231 --> 02:13:06.650
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3060
02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:11.430
<v Speaker 1>and so socrates was considered a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially an enemy of the state.</v>

3061
02:13:11.490 --> 02:13:13.340
<v Speaker 1>He had an opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to kill him.</v>

3062
02:13:13.940 --> 02:13:15.560
<v Speaker 1>The Greek government said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

3063
02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:16.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

3064
02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're condemned to death.</v>

3065
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat,</v>

3066
02:13:18.651 --> 02:13:20.510
<v Speaker 1>we're looking the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck out of town.</v>

3067
02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Just be an exile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Socrates said,</v>

3068
02:13:22.911 --> 02:13:24.620
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

3069
02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:29.270
<v Speaker 1>because that would be admitting fault if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys want to sin against philosophy,</v>

3070
02:13:29.330 --> 02:13:32.610
<v Speaker 1>kill me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to what I said and I'm</v>

3071
02:13:32.611 --> 02:13:37.611
<v Speaker 1>not going to say sorry and I'm not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to leave because I've lived under these </v>

3072
02:13:37.611 --> 02:13:40.080
<v Speaker 1>rules and these laws forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that's the law of the land that I</v>

3073
02:13:40.081 --> 02:13:42.810
<v Speaker 1>will take my punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you guys are wrong,</v>

3074
02:13:42.811 --> 02:13:44.070
<v Speaker 1>but just know this is on you.</v>

3075
02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Not on me was very powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3076
02:13:46.841 --> 02:13:48.740
<v Speaker 1>there's the apology and there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3077
02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:50.790
<v Speaker 1>the you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should read it.</v>

3078
02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:52.380
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally different story.</v>

3079
02:13:52.381 --> 02:13:55.080
<v Speaker 1>If you talked to them a creepy voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't be.</v>

3080
02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:58.170
<v Speaker 1>It should read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to come and tell you how</v>

3081
02:13:58.171 --> 02:14:03.171
<v Speaker 1>he said it said Non Fault of 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 11 under Greg Love Lover Time.</v>

3082
02:14:04.770 --> 02:14:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever contemplated like what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be like?</v>

3083
02:14:07.530 --> 02:14:12.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume that this is going to be </v>

3084
02:14:12.530 --> 02:14:13.480
<v Speaker 1>available and some sort of a simulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>form in virtual reality within you know,</v>

3085
02:14:13.650 --> 02:14:18.650
<v Speaker 1>our lives to be able to go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience what it would be like to be </v>

3086
02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:24.080
<v Speaker 1>inside of a building and watching people</v>
<v Speaker 1>live as if people lived like in that </v>

3087
02:14:26.431 --> 02:14:31.431
<v Speaker 1>rain forest or watching people live as </v>
<v Speaker 1>people lived in ancient Greece or </v>

3088
02:14:31.431 --> 02:14:35.721
<v Speaker 1>ancient Rome and just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience what it would be like in our </v>

3089
02:14:35.721 --> 02:14:36.120
<v Speaker 1>minds.</v>

3090
02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:37.440
<v Speaker 1>This is normal life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3091
02:14:37.441 --> 02:14:39.780
<v Speaker 1>This is normal life being in a building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity,</v>

3092
02:14:39.781 --> 02:14:44.781
<v Speaker 1>all that set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be so fucking </v>

3093
02:14:44.781 --> 02:14:48.420
<v Speaker 1>enlightening if we could just for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brief moment,</v>

3094
02:14:48.421 --> 02:14:53.421
<v Speaker 1>even even if just for a few minutes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to experience what life was like </v>

3095
02:14:53.421 --> 02:14:55.710
<v Speaker 1>back then and then try to put it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

3096
02:14:56.010 --> 02:15:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the big factor would be that </v>

3097
02:15:01.010 --> 02:15:01.010
<v Speaker 1>there was so much we didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

3098
02:15:01.010 --> 02:15:02.080
<v Speaker 1>germ theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3099
02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:07.340
<v Speaker 1>forget about medical stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like when I'm talking about like </v>

3100
02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:10.230
<v Speaker 1>the way people look at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you listen to Lenny Bruce today,</v>

3101
02:15:10.650 --> 02:15:15.650
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to listen to Lenny Bruce today</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you already know a lot of the </v>

3102
02:15:15.650 --> 02:15:15.650
<v Speaker 1>things he's saying and it's not really </v>
<v Speaker 1>so groundbreaking anymore.</v>

3103
02:15:15.650 --> 02:15:18.360
<v Speaker 1>But if you listen to it in 1959 </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightclub,</v>

3104
02:15:18.361 --> 02:15:19.950
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

3105
02:15:20.250 --> 02:15:25.250
<v Speaker 1>this is blowing my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagined being in front of socrates,</v>

3106
02:15:25.730 --> 02:15:30.730
<v Speaker 1>imagine them being around all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that had so little access to </v>

3107
02:15:32.281 --> 02:15:36.480
<v Speaker 1>knowledge knew so little about how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world actually worked or did there.</v>

3108
02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3109
02:15:37.121 --> 02:15:39.270
<v Speaker 1>so sure they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In comparison to what we know today.</v>

3110
02:15:39.540 --> 02:15:40.440
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3111
02:15:40.441 --> 02:15:40.830
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3112
02:15:40.831 --> 02:15:45.831
<v Speaker 1>but okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually a saying in the context of </v>

3113
02:15:45.831 --> 02:15:46.320
<v Speaker 1>the civilization that existed at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

3114
02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:48.440
<v Speaker 1>what kind of a weird world would that </v>
<v Speaker 1>be?</v>

3115
02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I think the fundamental difference would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be you'd be much.</v>

3116
02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:53.670
<v Speaker 1>You'd have a much closer and intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with life and death.</v>

3117
02:15:53.671 --> 02:15:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3118
02:15:54.370 --> 02:15:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Because it was always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3119
02:15:55.951 --> 02:16:00.951
<v Speaker 1>all the time and you were going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably have to hide and so you died of</v>

3120
02:16:01.741 --> 02:16:04.740
<v Speaker 1>disease that would roll through and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plague would come and then it would be a</v>

3121
02:16:04.741 --> 02:16:09.741
<v Speaker 1>war and all this stuff would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you'd have a more intimate </v>

3122
02:16:09.741 --> 02:16:13.551
<v Speaker 1>relationship with death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think actually that when you say </v>

3123
02:16:13.551 --> 02:16:14.610
<v Speaker 1>we do have access to more information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know more.</v>

3124
02:16:14.910 --> 02:16:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A as in we know more about the </v>

3125
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:20.580
<v Speaker 1>methodology of like sort of how certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>things work.</v>

3126
02:16:20.580 --> 02:16:22.980
<v Speaker 1>We know that there's a shark that list </v>
<v Speaker 1>500 years.</v>

3127
02:16:22.981 --> 02:16:27.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if thinking people back </v>

3128
02:16:27.981 --> 02:16:32.451
<v Speaker 1>then less in terms of what it was to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially human and the responsibility</v>

3129
02:16:36.071 --> 02:16:37.600
<v Speaker 1>of a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

3130
02:16:37.601 --> 02:16:40.150
<v Speaker 1>if you really get down to brass tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

3131
02:16:40.330 --> 02:16:45.330
<v Speaker 1>you're left with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're left with the things you can </v>

3132
02:16:45.330 --> 02:16:48.451
<v Speaker 1>conquer within yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're left with the things you can put </v>

3133
02:16:48.451 --> 02:16:50.470
<v Speaker 1>into context about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're left with how much self knowledge</v>

3134
02:16:50.471 --> 02:16:53.740
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how well did you get to know yourself?</v>

3135
02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:59.040
<v Speaker 1>One of the big values of putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in in risky situations or </v>

3136
02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:01.780
<v Speaker 1>putting yourself into situations where </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to learn something that takes a lot</v>

3137
02:17:01.781 --> 02:17:06.781
<v Speaker 1>out of you as you learn about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the Greeks knew that and </v>

3138
02:17:06.781 --> 02:17:08.080
<v Speaker 1>wrote about that as well as anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

3139
02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:11.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think that they understood like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you read Seneca,</v>

3140
02:17:11.441 --> 02:17:16.441
<v Speaker 1>you read socrates and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have the technological </v>

3141
02:17:16.441 --> 02:17:19.320
<v Speaker 1>advantages we did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have the ability to get </v>

3142
02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:19.320
<v Speaker 1>as close to the rest of the world as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

3143
02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:24.120
<v Speaker 1>They had deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep concepts and wrestled with the big </v>

3144
02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:27.040
<v Speaker 1>ideas and questions that have never left</v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

3145
02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:32.280
<v Speaker 1>that still haunt us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of what is the difference </v>

3146
02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:33.340
<v Speaker 1>between good and evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How should I really live my life?</v>

3147
02:17:33.610 --> 02:17:38.610
<v Speaker 1>What is the right thing to do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's telling me to do this and </v>

3148
02:17:38.610 --> 02:17:39.730
<v Speaker 1>it's way more convenient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's the answer?</v>

3149
02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Am I really just my appetites or on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than that and if my dignity and my </v>

3150
02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:50.890
<v Speaker 1>morality and ethics are compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I have the courage to stand there </v>

3151
02:17:51.611 --> 02:17:53.950
<v Speaker 1>and say I'm going to stay in Greece and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not leave.</v>

3152
02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Those big human questions are as </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant today as they were then and if </v>

3153
02:17:59.321 --> 02:18:02.380
<v Speaker 1>you really get down to what it's what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>means to be a human being and if you get</v>

3154
02:18:02.381 --> 02:18:05.650
<v Speaker 1>down to knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they may be.</v>

3155
02:18:05.651 --> 02:18:06.790
<v Speaker 1>We don't know more than them.</v>

3156
02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge problem with the word we.</v>

3157
02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like who you talking about?</v>

3158
02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:17.280
<v Speaker 2>Are you talking about me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you talking about the greater human </v>

3159
02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:17.280
<v Speaker 2>knowledge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3160
02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:17.770
<v Speaker 2>for sure the greater human knowledge is </v>
<v Speaker 2>far,</v>

3161
02:18:17.950 --> 02:18:20.140
<v Speaker 2>far vast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far more vast,</v>

3162
02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:23.020
<v Speaker 2>far more in depth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know more about science.</v>

3163
02:18:23.021 --> 02:18:28.021
<v Speaker 2>We know more about cells and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe and the ocean and everything </v>

3164
02:18:28.021 --> 02:18:30.910
<v Speaker 2>there is to be observed as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>applied knowledge,</v>

3165
02:18:31.140 --> 02:18:33.550
<v Speaker 2>like are we living in a wise way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3166
02:18:33.551 --> 02:18:34.920
<v Speaker 2>we don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>

3167
02:18:34.921 --> 02:18:39.921
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know in comparison to how they </v>

3168
02:18:39.921 --> 02:18:40.930
<v Speaker 2>live then because we know we have tails </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were written down and passed.</v>

3169
02:18:41.260 --> 02:18:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Generation after generation are honest </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the day to day </v>

3170
02:18:46.571 --> 02:18:49.840
<v Speaker 2>existence in terms of what it would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to actually be there.</v>

3171
02:18:49.870 --> 02:18:51.760
<v Speaker 2>It's very limited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very.</v>

3172
02:18:51.761 --> 02:18:55.810
<v Speaker 2>It's also very speculative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of like putting the pieces</v>

3173
02:18:55.811 --> 02:19:00.811
<v Speaker 2>together and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that history </v>

3174
02:19:00.811 --> 02:19:00.811
<v Speaker 2>professors will do when they're teaching</v>
<v Speaker 2>a class.</v>

3175
02:19:00.811 --> 02:19:05.161
<v Speaker 2>They'll paint a picture of what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it was like back then based on </v>

3176
02:19:05.161 --> 02:19:07.810
<v Speaker 2>the facts that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can definitely cling to.</v>

3177
02:19:08.290 --> 02:19:11.570
<v Speaker 2>But as far as experiencing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it actually like?</v>

3178
02:19:11.590 --> 02:19:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I had a really great.</v>

3179
02:19:13.001 --> 02:19:14.470
<v Speaker 2>There's a great professor</v>

3180
02:19:14.980 --> 02:19:19.980
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who teaches this class and the turning </v>

3181
02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:19.980
<v Speaker 1>points in European history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can get that teaching company.</v>

3182
02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:22.090
<v Speaker 1>He said something really awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He starts to lecture with this.</v>

3183
02:19:22.091 --> 02:19:24.070
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you guys,</v>

3184
02:19:24.071 --> 02:19:29.071
<v Speaker 1>it was the fall of Constantinople,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a city that stood for a thousand years </v>

3185
02:19:29.071 --> 02:19:33.701
<v Speaker 1>and walls stood for a thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when the Turks came in with this </v>

3186
02:19:33.780 --> 02:19:37.760
<v Speaker 1>hundred foot gun and started blasting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the walls,</v>

3187
02:19:38.090 --> 02:19:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they sold most of the killed a </v>

3188
02:19:43.090 --> 02:19:45.611
<v Speaker 1>sack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city raped and killed most of the </v>

3189
02:19:45.611 --> 02:19:46.730
<v Speaker 1>men and then sold about 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the slavery,</v>

3190
02:19:46.731 --> 02:19:51.731
<v Speaker 1>which means they chained them up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>marched him back to one of their </v>

3191
02:19:51.731 --> 02:19:52.670
<v Speaker 1>colonies and sold them on an open </v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

3192
02:19:52.671 --> 02:19:53.850
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

3193
02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:58.880
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a city that had stood for a </v>

3194
02:19:58.880 --> 02:19:59.330
<v Speaker 1>hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was when that then became Istanbul,</v>

3195
02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:02.330
<v Speaker 1>became the center of the Ottoman Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

3196
02:20:02.331 --> 02:20:07.331
<v Speaker 1>I want you to think for a second about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it sounded like to be inside that </v>

3197
02:20:07.761 --> 02:20:09.500
<v Speaker 1>city are on that wall.</v>

3198
02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:14.920
<v Speaker 1>When it was coming down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you knew that walls that it stood </v>

3199
02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:18.581
<v Speaker 1>for a thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're finally giving way to this new </v>

3200
02:20:18.581 --> 02:20:21.191
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a giant cannon that it took </v>

3201
02:20:21.191 --> 02:20:21.890
<v Speaker 1>them a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mile a day to drag,</v>

3202
02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:26.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they did it for 100 miles or </v>

3203
02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:28.571
<v Speaker 1>something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want you to think these Ottomans </v>

3204
02:20:28.571 --> 02:20:31.511
<v Speaker 1>are outside these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these dudes are going to take no mercy </v>

3205
02:20:31.511 --> 02:20:34.930
<v Speaker 1>and they are going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to do what they want when </v>

3206
02:20:34.930 --> 02:20:35.600
<v Speaker 1>and I want you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did it smell like?</v>

3207
02:20:35.900 --> 02:20:40.900
<v Speaker 1>What when they get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did it sound like and what was </v>

3208
02:20:40.900 --> 02:20:44.621
<v Speaker 1>really going on as you were waiting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your house and they and they came </v>

3209
02:20:44.621 --> 02:20:47.150
<v Speaker 1>through the walls and for the first time</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a thousand years,</v>

3210
02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:51.470
<v Speaker 1>your city and everything you knew was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be burned,</v>

3211
02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:53.300
<v Speaker 1>raped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed,</v>

3212
02:20:53.450 --> 02:20:56.120
<v Speaker 1>sold into slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and changed.</v>

3213
02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Think about that shit for a second.</v>

3214
02:20:58.490 --> 02:21:03.490
<v Speaker 1>And that was a reality for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a fascinating way to teach </v>

3215
02:21:03.490 --> 02:21:05.240
<v Speaker 1>history because it brings it down to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>visceral level when you go.</v>

3216
02:21:05.241 --> 02:21:10.241
<v Speaker 1>These motherfuckers lived through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that the existential </v>

3217
02:21:10.241 --> 02:21:12.110
<v Speaker 1>possibility that you and everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3218
02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:15.350
<v Speaker 1>like almost oz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Israeli writers,</v>

3219
02:21:15.351 --> 02:21:20.351
<v Speaker 1>his mother killed herself and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother killed herself because in </v>

3220
02:21:20.351 --> 02:21:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in when,</v>

3221
02:21:20.771 --> 02:21:24.830
<v Speaker 1>when she was from Kiev,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in one day 25,000</v>

3222
02:21:24.831 --> 02:21:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Jews were killed by the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one day he said in her town,</v>

3223
02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:32.480
<v Speaker 1>everybody she knew and everybody that </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew those people and everything,</v>

3224
02:21:32.481 --> 02:21:36.920
<v Speaker 1>she came from for generation seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations wiped away,</v>

3225
02:21:37.250 --> 02:21:42.250
<v Speaker 1>all killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now she's in Sun Baked Jerusalem or </v>

3226
02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Haifa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever it is.</v>

3227
02:21:44.690 --> 02:21:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Think about what that was like for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being where everything,</v>

3228
02:21:47.511 --> 02:21:48.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being like,</v>

3229
02:21:48.250 --> 02:21:49.700
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like being a native American,</v>

3230
02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:52.400
<v Speaker 1>everything needed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the buffaloes killed their bodies.</v>

3231
02:21:52.530 --> 02:21:56.240
<v Speaker 1>The hides laced restrict nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the animals that are eating that are</v>

3232
02:21:56.241 --> 02:21:58.580
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all your entire mythology,</v>

3233
02:21:58.581 --> 02:22:03.581
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Campbell talks about that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole mythology has been wiped </v>

3234
02:22:03.581 --> 02:22:07.031
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The buffalo that is the centerpiece of </v>

3235
02:22:07.031 --> 02:22:08.480
<v Speaker 1>your mythology or God and all the Egos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything else in your God.</v>

3236
02:22:08.481 --> 02:22:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he's not strong enough to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>this incredibly strong western God.</v>

3237
02:22:12.890 --> 02:22:16.340
<v Speaker 1>What does that say about not only your </v>
<v Speaker 1>very existence but the gods?</v>

3238
02:22:16.341 --> 02:22:18.740
<v Speaker 1>You've been sacrificing and covering a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of territory here?</v>

3239
02:22:18.741 --> 02:22:23.741
<v Speaker 1>Brian callen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just went through three entire </v>

3240
02:22:23.741 --> 02:22:25.400
<v Speaker 1>distance creditors be a distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it's like to be an ancient person,</v>

3241
02:22:25.470 --> 02:22:25.920
<v Speaker 1>not good.</v>

3242
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:31.040
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you could lose everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have what my was going to get to </v>

3243
02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:33.621
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point was imagine that there's </v>

3244
02:22:33.621 --> 02:22:34.770
<v Speaker 2>going to be a civilization one day that </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks back on the primitive nature of us</v>

3245
02:22:34.771 --> 02:22:39.771
<v Speaker 2>today with the same sort of like bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 2>reflection that we look back at </v>

3246
02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:45.560
<v Speaker 2>socrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we look back on the people that were </v>

3247
02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:45.560
<v Speaker 2>on the mayflower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>

3248
02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:49.640
<v Speaker 2>It's just hard to imagine as we're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to expand our consciousness and </v>

3249
02:22:50.191 --> 02:22:55.191
<v Speaker 2>grow as a civilization and we would hope</v>
<v Speaker 2>that with every new president we have </v>

3250
02:22:55.191 --> 02:22:59.811
<v Speaker 2>like a a better way of doing things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>our government tightens up and our laws </v>

3251
02:22:59.811 --> 02:23:00.150
<v Speaker 2>get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that people are</v>

3252
02:23:00.151 --> 02:23:05.151
<v Speaker 2>so terrified about with this new </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration that if everyone feels </v>

3253
02:23:05.151 --> 02:23:06.500
<v Speaker 2>like it's slipping backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one day you know,</v>

3254
02:23:06.660 --> 02:23:11.660
<v Speaker 2>the give and take the flow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ebb and flow of information in 500 </v>

3255
02:23:11.660 --> 02:23:11.660
<v Speaker 2>years from now when they look back the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way we look at,</v>

3256
02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:12.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3257
02:23:12.601 --> 02:23:14.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3258
02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:19.400
<v Speaker 2>the attack of the Mongols on Gin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China or Baghdad and any of these </v>

3259
02:23:20.620 --> 02:23:25.620
<v Speaker 2>places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look back at the destruction that </v>

3260
02:23:25.620 --> 02:23:28.161
<v Speaker 2>took place just a few hundred years ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the kind of civilization that </v>

3261
02:23:28.161 --> 02:23:31.131
<v Speaker 2>existed back then and what would it be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to be in the felt tense of the </v>

3262
02:23:31.131 --> 02:23:35.361
<v Speaker 2>Mongols as they were camped outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gates of the city that they were </v>

3263
02:23:35.361 --> 02:23:35.361
<v Speaker 2>going to hurl.</v>

3264
02:23:35.361 --> 02:23:37.410
<v Speaker 2>Flaming bodies with catapults at would </v>
<v Speaker 2>sit there,</v>

3265
02:23:37.411 --> 02:23:39.510
<v Speaker 2>room's on fire with flaming human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

3266
02:23:39.660 --> 02:23:42.480
<v Speaker 2>The fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fat burns really good,</v>

3267
02:23:42.481 --> 02:23:45.390
<v Speaker 2>so they would light people on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doused him and kerosene,</v>

3268
02:23:45.391 --> 02:23:47.610
<v Speaker 2>light them on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then launch them through the fucking</v>

3269
02:23:47.611 --> 02:23:50.520
<v Speaker 2>air and they would land on buildings and</v>
<v Speaker 2>light them on fire from the outside.</v>

3270
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you this,</v>

3271
02:23:51.420 --> 02:23:53.830
<v Speaker 2>so let's jump ahead to 100 years or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3272
02:23:53.910 --> 02:23:58.910
<v Speaker 2>So you can live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can live 100 years longer than you </v>

3273
02:23:58.910 --> 02:24:01.041
<v Speaker 2>are now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fucking that robot that looks creep </v>

3274
02:24:01.041 --> 02:24:01.430
<v Speaker 2>when 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am 100 percent.</v>

3275
02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:04.670
<v Speaker 2>I have fat guy with the white belly on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

3276
02:24:04.770 --> 02:24:06.860
<v Speaker 2>now you want my ears and you won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't,</v>

3277
02:24:06.900 --> 02:24:11.900
<v Speaker 2>you won't have to do because I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs and you'll be all estate shredded </v>

3278
02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:11.900
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be a teenager,</v>

3279
02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:15.831
<v Speaker 2>the equivalent of a teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you do with another 100 </v>

3280
02:24:15.831 --> 02:24:15.831
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>

3281
02:24:15.831 --> 02:24:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Try to get better at life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

3282
02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Try to get better at my management of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life might be the entire experience.</v>

3283
02:24:22.291 --> 02:24:24.540
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of it is positive?</v>

3284
02:24:24.570 --> 02:24:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Not just positive for me but positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>for other people that I interact with.</v>

3285
02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:29.690
<v Speaker 2>How much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3286
02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:34.760
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much better have I gotten at a </v>

3287
02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:34.760
<v Speaker 2>standup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at podcasting,</v>

3288
02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:37.260
<v Speaker 2>at creating things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing things at expressing myself,</v>

3289
02:24:37.890 --> 02:24:38.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those things,</v>

3290
02:24:38.851 --> 02:24:41.520
<v Speaker 2>all the things that I'm doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I had to live five more years,</v>

3291
02:24:41.521 --> 02:24:43.860
<v Speaker 2>what would I do in five more years to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to get better at what I'm doing?</v>

3292
02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:46.050
<v Speaker 2>If I had 95 more years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

3293
02:24:46.051 --> 02:24:51.051
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll definitely get better if my body </v>

3294
02:24:51.051 --> 02:24:51.051
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to keep doing Jujitsu.</v>

3295
02:24:51.051 --> 02:24:52.410
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to keep doing martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to keep working out.</v>

3296
02:24:52.411 --> 02:24:53.730
<v Speaker 2>I like Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

3297
02:24:53.730 --> 02:24:55.920
<v Speaker 2>It feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do it how you do it a lot.</v>

3298
02:24:56.010 --> 02:24:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it three times a week now.</v>

3299
02:24:57.840 --> 02:24:58.640
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah man.</v>

3300
02:24:58.641 --> 02:25:01.470
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think more things you do,</v>

3301
02:25:01.770 --> 02:25:06.770
<v Speaker 2>the better you get at doing things and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think the better you get at doing </v>

3302
02:25:06.770 --> 02:25:07.650
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more of an understanding you have of</v>

3303
02:25:07.651 --> 02:25:09.420
<v Speaker 2>yourself and if you're being totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>honest,</v>

3304
02:25:09.690 --> 02:25:11.310
<v Speaker 2>the more of an understanding you have of</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

3305
02:25:11.311 --> 02:25:16.311
<v Speaker 2>the better you are at managing life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just try to get better at managing </v>

3306
02:25:16.311 --> 02:25:18.420
<v Speaker 2>life I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so defining life at managing life as</v>

3307
02:25:18.421 --> 02:25:21.600
<v Speaker 2>in knowing where to place your energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing where to place your energy.</v>

3308
02:25:21.601 --> 02:25:23.800
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm knowing,</v>

3309
02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:24.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3310
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:28.300
<v Speaker 2>what something actually means versus how</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you feel.</v>

3311
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing why things make you feel certain</v>

3312
02:25:31.931 --> 02:25:36.931
<v Speaker 2>way while you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could feel totally different in a </v>

3313
02:25:36.931 --> 02:25:36.931
<v Speaker 2>different day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a different circumstance,</v>

3314
02:25:36.931 --> 02:25:39.460
<v Speaker 2>like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you going into things neutral or</v>

3315
02:25:39.470 --> 02:25:42.820
<v Speaker 2>you going to things loaded up already </v>
<v Speaker 2>with emotions and with negativity.</v>

3316
02:25:42.821 --> 02:25:47.821
<v Speaker 2>And then you immediately react from this</v>
<v Speaker 2>loaded up position instead of from a </v>

3317
02:25:47.821 --> 02:25:52.621
<v Speaker 2>neutral position where you can analyze </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and decided that nothing truly has </v>

3318
02:25:52.621 --> 02:25:53.440
<v Speaker 2>any meaning other than the meeting that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you give it.</v>

3319
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:58.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the book thinking fast and slow </v>

3320
02:25:58.590 --> 02:25:58.590
<v Speaker 1>by Daniel Economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3321
02:25:58.590 --> 02:25:58.590
<v Speaker 1>About,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

3322
02:25:58.590 --> 02:26:00.440
<v Speaker 1>He won a Nobel Prize in economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3323
02:26:00.470 --> 02:26:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he talks about that.</v>

3324
02:26:02.330 --> 02:26:03.650
<v Speaker 1>He did all those experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3325
02:26:03.651 --> 02:26:04.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3326
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:08.150
<v Speaker 1>just about getting to know how your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

3327
02:26:08.151 --> 02:26:12.160
<v Speaker 1>how your fast thinking brain reacts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning that,</v>

3328
02:26:12.250 --> 02:26:16.730
<v Speaker 1>that sort of getting a handle on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms and how even the way you hold</v>

3329
02:26:16.731 --> 02:26:18.770
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're smiling,</v>

3330
02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:20.750
<v Speaker 1>you're going to think something's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually funnier.</v>

3331
02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:25.960
<v Speaker 1>And then if you're frowning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had people hold a pencil in their </v>

3332
02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:26.630
<v Speaker 1>teeth sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw joke.</v>

3333
02:26:26.631 --> 02:26:28.690
<v Speaker 1>They thought it was funnier than if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were holding a pencil,</v>

3334
02:26:28.691 --> 02:26:30.370
<v Speaker 1>a deuce with the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3335
02:26:30.500 --> 02:26:32.870
<v Speaker 1>they were in a frown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought it wasn't as funny.</v>

3336
02:26:33.380 --> 02:26:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so or when they were told that take a </v>

3337
02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:40.751
<v Speaker 1>test and make come up with sentences out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the words gray and wrinkled and </v>

3338
02:26:40.751 --> 02:26:44.951
<v Speaker 1>sunshine and bald.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They moved to the next test slower </v>

3339
02:26:44.951 --> 02:26:49.630
<v Speaker 1>because those words made them think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>old people and so how the language you </v>

3340
02:26:50.811 --> 02:26:52.880
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you hold your body,</v>

3341
02:26:53.180 --> 02:26:58.180
<v Speaker 1>all those things affect how you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to interact with data and stimulus</v>

3342
02:26:58.731 --> 02:27:02.570
<v Speaker 1>that you're presented with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the state that you are in is going to</v>

3343
02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:05.900
<v Speaker 1>influence how you react to something.</v>

3344
02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I think we all are aware of that though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3345
02:27:07.611 --> 02:27:08.620
<v Speaker 2>You're aware of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3346
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes you're not about myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

3347
02:27:10.850 --> 02:27:13.430
<v Speaker 2>you're ramped up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be exposed to bad news</v>

3348
02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:15.290
<v Speaker 2>because then you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

3349
02:27:15.630 --> 02:27:16.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just compound.</v>

3350
02:27:16.701 --> 02:27:21.701
<v Speaker 2>And we all know people who are always </v>
<v Speaker 2>ramped up and they're always having bad </v>

3351
02:27:21.701 --> 02:27:22.670
<v Speaker 2>things happen to them and it could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected.</v>

3352
02:27:22.750 --> 02:27:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do.</v>

3353
02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever find that you like it really</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have to guard myself against </v>

3354
02:27:29.070 --> 02:27:30.460
<v Speaker 1>negative shit because it'll distract me </v>
<v Speaker 1>from my work?</v>

3355
02:27:30.740 --> 02:27:31.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

3356
02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3357
02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:37.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean what if you wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could fill your head up everyday </v>

3358
02:27:37.150 --> 02:27:41.050
<v Speaker 2>with horror stories that helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not helpful and and also unmanageable.</v>

3359
02:27:41.570 --> 02:27:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Like again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about the 7 billion people</v>

3360
02:27:44.361 --> 02:27:45.860
<v Speaker 2>in the world that you're getting news </v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

3361
02:27:45.890 --> 02:27:50.890
<v Speaker 2>You're getting all the events that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to 7 billion people and only the </v>

3362
02:27:50.890 --> 02:27:52.550
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary ones that fucked up ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the ones that are interesting.</v>

3363
02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:54.770
<v Speaker 2>The guy who takes that truck and runs it</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the crowd,</v>

3364
02:27:54.980 --> 02:27:59.980
<v Speaker 2>those are the ones that are interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget about all the people handing out </v>

3365
02:27:59.980 --> 02:28:02.471
<v Speaker 2>flowers and inviting people in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>homes for t all those things that are </v>

3366
02:28:02.471 --> 02:28:03.200
<v Speaker 2>taking place at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't attract our attention.</v>

3367
02:28:03.230 --> 02:28:05.210
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it does become a real problem.</v>

3368
02:28:05.211 --> 02:28:08.510
<v Speaker 2>If you want to look at the experiences </v>
<v Speaker 2>of 7 billion people,</v>

3369
02:28:08.690 --> 02:28:13.690
<v Speaker 2>you can find a lot of horrific shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to look at the </v>

3370
02:28:13.690 --> 02:28:13.690
<v Speaker 2>experience of one person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3371
02:28:13.690 --> 02:28:18.311
<v Speaker 2>Brian Callen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your interactions are almost entirely </v>

3372
02:28:18.311 --> 02:28:18.311
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>

3373
02:28:18.311 --> 02:28:21.050
<v Speaker 2>Know your day is almost entirely filled </v>
<v Speaker 2>with laughter and friendship and fun and</v>

3374
02:28:21.470 --> 02:28:26.470
<v Speaker 2>around and getting on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>performing and doing podcasts and time </v>

3375
02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:30.400
<v Speaker 2>with your family and having a wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 2>time so you can.</v>

3376
02:28:30.580 --> 02:28:35.580
<v Speaker 2>You can have a distorted view of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world by being too aware of the whole </v>

3377
02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:37.040
<v Speaker 2>world and then people will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3378
02:28:37.041 --> 02:28:42.041
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't live your life in a fucking </v>

3379
02:28:42.041 --> 02:28:42.041
<v Speaker 2>bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3380
02:28:42.041 --> 02:28:42.041
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's called life.</v>

3381
02:28:42.050 --> 02:28:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Everybody lives in a bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't like.</v>

3382
02:28:44.190 --> 02:28:47.900
<v Speaker 2>That's why Maryland can go on TV and say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mixed martial arts isn't art.</v>

3383
02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Like why is she saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's her bubble in her bubble.</v>

3384
02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:55.960
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She could say that if she said that if </v>

3385
02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:56.090
<v Speaker 2>we were all backstage at the UFC and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>said that people would be like,</v>

3386
02:28:56.400 --> 02:28:58.040
<v Speaker 2>fuck what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3387
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:59.270
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck did she just say?</v>

3388
02:28:59.430 --> 02:29:00.860
<v Speaker 2>That is so rude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you say that?</v>

3389
02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Why would you come here where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>love and worship this and say that?</v>

3390
02:29:04.370 --> 02:29:08.430
<v Speaker 2>Why would you come here when people find</v>
<v Speaker 2>the importance in this sport,</v>

3391
02:29:08.450 --> 02:29:10.400
<v Speaker 2>in this art form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and why would you disagree and why would</v>

3392
02:29:10.401 --> 02:29:11.890
<v Speaker 2>you downplay it that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3393
02:29:12.020 --> 02:29:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did because she's in her bubble.</v>

3394
02:29:13.491 --> 02:29:18.491
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's in a fucking bubble course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you could be good at </v>

3395
02:29:18.491 --> 02:29:18.491
<v Speaker 2>anything you'd have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to create a bubble.</v>

3396
02:29:18.491 --> 02:29:22.520
<v Speaker 2>I would argue like because if I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>write standup and I'm walking down and I</v>

3397
02:29:22.521 --> 02:29:27.521
<v Speaker 2>started thinking about the drug cartels </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Mexico and how they kill innocent </v>

3398
02:29:27.521 --> 02:29:28.040
<v Speaker 2>people or whatever it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get ramped up and I'm going</v>

3399
02:29:28.041 --> 02:29:29.480
<v Speaker 2>to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would I do in that situation?</v>

3400
02:29:29.481 --> 02:29:34.481
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get full of fear and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to be thinking about what I </v>

3401
02:29:34.481 --> 02:29:34.481
<v Speaker 2>got to thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

3402
02:29:34.481 --> 02:29:34.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it might be.</v>

3403
02:29:34.481 --> 02:29:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe I can use that in my stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I find I have to really guard </v>

3404
02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:42.390
<v Speaker 2>against unhelpful think you should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3405
02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:47.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the reasons why I </v>

3406
02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:49.211
<v Speaker 2>refuse to go down all these God damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy holes that everybody wants </v>

3407
02:29:49.211 --> 02:29:50.870
<v Speaker 2>you to go down and read this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Read that like I don't want to.</v>

3408
02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

3409
02:29:51.921 --> 02:29:53.010
<v Speaker 2>You should know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should know about it.</v>

3410
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3411
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:54.860
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't.</v>

3412
02:29:54.861 --> 02:29:57.470
<v Speaker 2>I can't know about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking can't.</v>

3413
02:29:57.620 --> 02:30:00.310
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough time in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3414
02:30:00.311 --> 02:30:04.610
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know who killed Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a long time ago and I'm done.</v>

3415
02:30:04.700 --> 02:30:05.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

3416
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:08.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to look into it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe one day I'll change my mind,</v>

3417
02:30:08.450 --> 02:30:10.850
<v Speaker 2>but you can't say that someone has to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

3418
02:30:10.851 --> 02:30:12.680
<v Speaker 2>These roads are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to pay attention to this.</v>

3419
02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to pay attention to my work to </v>

3420
02:30:17.920 --> 02:30:17.920
<v Speaker 2>be too much.</v>

3421
02:30:17.920 --> 02:30:19.610
<v Speaker 2>If you want to find out all the threats </v>
<v Speaker 2>that isis poses to civilization,</v>

3422
02:30:19.611 --> 02:30:20.660
<v Speaker 2>cheeses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Christ.</v>

3423
02:30:20.780 --> 02:30:25.780
<v Speaker 2>How much time do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to find out how dangerous </v>

3424
02:30:25.780 --> 02:30:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Putin really is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

3425
02:30:25.780 --> 02:30:27.830
<v Speaker 2>how much fucking time do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much time do you have?</v>

3426
02:30:28.010 --> 02:30:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to find out all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>different potential gender roles that </v>

3427
02:30:33.010 --> 02:30:37.481
<v Speaker 2>people play and gender identities that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people cling to and all the different </v>

3428
02:30:37.481 --> 02:30:42.460
<v Speaker 2>types of sexuality that exists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>perversion and how many people jerk off </v>

3429
02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:46.430
<v Speaker 2>on feet and it's not any time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's high tech procrastination.</v>

3430
02:30:46.431 --> 02:30:48.770
<v Speaker 2>If you do think that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it keeps you away from yourself,</v>

3431
02:30:48.980 --> 02:30:51.130
<v Speaker 2>but they're putting things a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>scary.</v>

3432
02:30:51.170 --> 02:30:53.510
<v Speaker 2>It's all scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we have more about that?</v>

3433
02:30:53.940 --> 02:30:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Do we know more about whether he has any</v>
<v Speaker 2>black shit?</v>

3434
02:30:56.210 --> 02:30:56.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

3435
02:30:56.950 --> 02:30:57.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3436
02:30:57.421 --> 02:30:57.680
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3437
02:30:57.681 --> 02:31:00.180
<v Speaker 2>That came that whole story about him </v>
<v Speaker 2>hiring.</v>

3438
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fake news.</v>

3439
02:31:01.341 --> 02:31:06.341
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it came out of a fucking post on </v>

3440
02:31:06.341 --> 02:31:06.450
<v Speaker 2>what was it on was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately I fell for it.</v>

3441
02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I just felt for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is the thing that's the world </v>

3442
02:31:11.560 --> 02:31:11.560
<v Speaker 2>we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3443
02:31:11.560 --> 02:31:14.890
<v Speaker 2>this is this fake news is a real problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's even bigger problem because </v>

3444
02:31:14.890 --> 02:31:18.950
<v Speaker 2>what we consider to be legitimate news </v>
<v Speaker 2>sources talk about it as a rumor.</v>

3445
02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:21.000
<v Speaker 2>This is the rumor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they don't even.</v>

3446
02:31:21.001 --> 02:31:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Some say unsubstantiated reports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say that.</v>

3447
02:31:23.581 --> 02:31:25.160
<v Speaker 2>You can't even say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know because I,</v>

3448
02:31:25.210 --> 02:31:28.410
<v Speaker 2>the Wall Street Journal said this has </v>
<v Speaker 2>not been substantiated,</v>

3449
02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:33.450
<v Speaker 2>but those fucks and now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

3450
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:38.130
<v Speaker 2>They are dying every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The entire system of mainstream media is</v>

3451
02:31:38.131 --> 02:31:43.131
<v Speaker 2>slowly eroding to the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with this is we need reliable </v>

3452
02:31:43.131 --> 02:31:43.131
<v Speaker 2>sources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do,</v>

3453
02:31:43.131 --> 02:31:47.260
<v Speaker 2>we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we need someone who's going to be </v>

3454
02:31:47.260 --> 02:31:47.260
<v Speaker 2>reliably do it on the Internet and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think that's impossible.</v>

3455
02:31:47.260 --> 02:31:50.670
<v Speaker 2>I think we find someone who's truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely 100 percent ethical.</v>

3456
02:31:50.700 --> 02:31:55.700
<v Speaker 2>They're out there and objective and also</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who is not just going to go </v>

3457
02:31:55.700 --> 02:31:57.780
<v Speaker 2>after fantastic stories because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>make big ratings,</v>

3458
02:31:57.990 --> 02:32:02.990
<v Speaker 2>but someone who goes after stories that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are actually important because their </v>

3459
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:04.320
<v Speaker 2>significant events and issues and does </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in an objective way.</v>

3460
02:32:04.530 --> 02:32:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Everything's editorialized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these things that people realize </v>

3461
02:32:09.530 --> 02:32:10.350
<v Speaker 2>this fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fake.</v>

3462
02:32:10.410 --> 02:32:13.170
<v Speaker 2>The golden showers and all that shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounded like bullshit.</v>

3463
02:32:13.171 --> 02:32:14.670
<v Speaker 2>It sounds too obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3464
02:32:14.671 --> 02:32:19.671
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He likes to Hire Hookers to pee on the </v>

3465
02:32:19.671 --> 02:32:19.671
<v Speaker 2>bed that Obama slept on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get out of here.</v>

3466
02:32:19.671 --> 02:32:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems so corny.</v>

3467
02:32:20.701 --> 02:32:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if he did do it,</v>

3468
02:32:22.531 --> 02:32:27.531
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be surprised if he was in </v>

3469
02:32:27.531 --> 02:32:29.361
<v Speaker 2>Russia and you know that he had some </v>
<v Speaker 2>gorgeous women with them and they have </v>

3470
02:32:29.361 --> 02:32:31.050
<v Speaker 2>video of it that I wouldn't be surprised</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

3471
02:32:31.170 --> 02:32:32.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean either.</v>

3472
02:32:32.460 --> 02:32:37.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if he hired someone to pee </v>

3473
02:32:37.460 --> 02:32:39.261
<v Speaker 2>on the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if he thinks it's funny to </v>

3474
02:32:39.261 --> 02:32:41.481
<v Speaker 2>hire someone to pee on the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that that makes him a bad </v>

3475
02:32:41.481 --> 02:32:44.451
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a rich guy who does fucked </v>

3476
02:32:44.451 --> 02:32:44.451
<v Speaker 2>up shit sometimes because he's a rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
