00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.863
<v Speaker 1>Hello</v>

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:02.963
<v Speaker 2>Bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk for a little bit about </v>

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.173
<v Speaker 2>the cryotherapy because this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that I emailed you when there </v>

4
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:08.934
<v Speaker 2>was a disturbing article that was sorta </v>
<v Speaker 2>poopooing the benefits cryotherapy in </v>

5
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 2>the article was I thought it was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>poorly.</v>

6
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poorly done,</v>

7
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.953
<v Speaker 2>poorly researched and it was also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was studied really subjective things </v>

8
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:26.211
<v Speaker 2>like how sore you felt after exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>and whether or not benefited from that,</v>

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.563
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are real positive benefits of </v>

10
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Cryo therapy that are measurable.</v>

11
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that happened as well.</v>

12
00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:38.230
<v Speaker 1>First of all that article that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>referring to from that,</v>

13
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever website it was,</v>

14
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 2>but the article was Steve Novella is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and I think what he did is he rushed</v>

15
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:45.534
<v Speaker 2>to put this article out because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman died in Las Vegas from Cryo </v>

16
00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 2>therapy and it was a really tragic </v>
<v Speaker 2>incident.</v>

17
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:52.104
<v Speaker 2>She was by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two different types of cryo </v>

18
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 2>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things we should point out,</v>

19
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.483
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any guys I've been accused </v>

20
00:00:58.171 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Speaker 2>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should just say right now,</v>

21
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any vested interest in </v>
<v Speaker 2>cryotherapy.</v>

22
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't own any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

23
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't make any money from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

24
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:09.630
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy the benefits of it and I use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this woman who did it,</v>

25
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 2>she did the type.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two kinds.</v>

26
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 2>One of them goes from the neck down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you stand in this booth.</v>

27
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Your head is above breathing and normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen,</v>

28
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 2>but below you is liquid nitrogen.</v>

29
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 2>You can't read that stuff in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why your head is not under.</v>

30
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 2>If you do breathe that stuff in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any oxygen.</v>

31
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 2>You'll black out and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to her.</v>

32
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.493
<v Speaker 2>She did it by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was poorly set up and apparently she </v>

33
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:31.524
<v Speaker 2>was quite short so her head was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>below the the the limit where you're </v>

34
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:37.974
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she was breathing in the liquid </v>

35
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.790
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen and she fell asleep and blacked</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

36
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.710
<v Speaker 2>So you get one of those times I thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was in like,</v>

37
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.030
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

38
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

39
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.363
<v Speaker 2>The full on ones are much rarer and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the full on ones do is they super cool </v>

40
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:53.184
<v Speaker 2>the air with the nitrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the air itself is pumped in really </v>

41
00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:58.104
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I did,</v>

42
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 2>that's what you did and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna do today too,</v>

43
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:01.014
<v Speaker 2>if you have the time.</v>

44
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.071
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

45
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 2>let's do that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can breathe in.</v>

46
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 2>It's just fucking unbelievably cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

47
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 2>So the one that she did was she set up </v>
<v Speaker 2>by herself,</v>

48
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:11.754
<v Speaker 2>which you're never supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always supposed to have </v>

49
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 2>supervision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't whether or not.</v>

50
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's the only person I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard of this died from this.</v>

51
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 2>And it's a horrible trash committing </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide.</v>

52
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

53
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 2>She was just worried there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes women will,</v>

54
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.693
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll put their face under it because </v>

55
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:30.010
<v Speaker 2>they want the effects of a cryo facial </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

56
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Cryo facial has been shown to improve </v>
<v Speaker 2>Collagen and</v>

57
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.350
<v Speaker 1>flattens your therapy actually prevents </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

58
00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:37.184
<v Speaker 1>Stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It inhibits enzymes that break down </v>

59
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:39.104
<v Speaker 1>collagen called college and is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually part of the reason </v>

60
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:41.834
<v Speaker 1>it helps with arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arthro College Nase is break down </v>

61
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Collagen and they break down like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.360
<v Speaker 1>the tendons college and around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tendons and seven,</v>

63
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.210
<v Speaker 1>it can cause arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arthritic pain.</v>

64
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.960
<v Speaker 1>So doing it would make sense why you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do something cryo because it.</v>

65
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.550
<v Speaker 1>It would have an effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

66
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.060
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

67
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women love it when they get their face </v>

68
00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently get or</v>

69
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>vein men to or any man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

70
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.823
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be vain to college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point being that article came </v>

71
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>out and all these people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh see,</v>

72
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I told you cryotherapy was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

73
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a Piss poor article.</v>

74
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.153
<v Speaker 1>And it was all talking about soreness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that he said that </v>

75
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:15.094
<v Speaker 1>really drove me crazy was you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd get just as much benefit from a </v>

76
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 1>cool down and stretch after a workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

77
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>tell that to these fucking people that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that go there all the time,</v>

78
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>that do it twice a day because they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>severe arthritis and it's the only thing</v>

79
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.020
<v Speaker 1>that's given them any form of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

80
00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 1>of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of movement of their hands.</v>

81
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.483
<v Speaker 1>I know a bunch of people that go there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have had some really debilitating </v>

82
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:39.934
<v Speaker 1>arthritis and this has given them relief</v>
<v Speaker 1>where nothing else was given it to them </v>

83
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.233
<v Speaker 1>other than like pretty severe </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical drugs or Ibuprofen at </v>

84
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>high levels or what you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

85
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lady that goes to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

86
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>but she was raving about how she can </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally stretch your hands out.</v>

87
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Like her hands had been locked in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>position for years.</v>

88
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has.</v>

89
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.233
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cold itself is a hormetic stressor </v>

90
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 1>that is activating a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>antiinflammatory pathways,</v>

91
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>antioxidant pathways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

92
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:10.610
<v Speaker 1>and it's also last time I think on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast we talked about,</v>

93
00:04:10.611 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 1>it increases norepinephrine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>norepinephrine itself.</v>

94
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:14.374
<v Speaker 1>It can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cryotherapy and cold water immersion </v>

95
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:17.644
<v Speaker 1>are two forms of cold exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cryotherapy just two minutes at like a </v>

96
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>minus 180 Fahrenheit can increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>norepinephrine.</v>

97
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's twofold over what you were before</v>

98
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:29.494
<v Speaker 1>you went in and nor epinephrin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition to the brain benefits we </v>

99
00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>were talking about how it makes you feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

100
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:34.474
<v Speaker 1>how it helps with learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also is a very potent anti </v>

101
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.163
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it inhibits the production of TNF </v>

102
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very.</v>

103
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like in arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tnf Alpha is kind of like going haywire.</v>

104
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.253
<v Speaker 1>You're making too much tnf Alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what happens is tnf alpha is a </v>

105
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>signaling molecule to or your immune </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells that says,</v>

106
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an infection here because that's</v>

107
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:56.584
<v Speaker 1>normally what happens when you release </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tnf Alpha is because there's some </v>

108
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>bacteria or some something that you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kill.</v>

109
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>And so your immune cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they see is the signal.</v>

110
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:05.254
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what's causing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know that it's because your </v>

111
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.833
<v Speaker 1>gut cells and your immune cells in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>gut are seeing bacteria because of your </v>

112
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:11.374
<v Speaker 1>poor diet or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's getting into the </v>

113
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream and causing chronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

114
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.263
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't know that it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All it knows is that this means there's </v>

115
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:18.844
<v Speaker 1>a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they start to increase the </v>

116
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Speaker 1>production of your immune cells make </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypochlorite,</v>

117
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.473
<v Speaker 1>which is like bleach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're making bleach in your body to </v>

118
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 1>kill things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's happening chronically.</v>

119
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:32.860
<v Speaker 1>That's gonna cause some tissue damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to cause pain.</v>

120
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.091
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also,</v>

121
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:34.924
<v Speaker 1>they also make hydrogen peroxide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make that your immune cells will </v>

122
00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:38.174
<v Speaker 1>make that so cryotherapy inhibits the </v>
<v Speaker 1>signaling molecule so that your immune </v>

123
00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:45.280
<v Speaker 1>cells quiet down because now they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing that signal that says,</v>

124
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.271
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

125
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:47.290
<v Speaker 1>fire up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire up.</v>

126
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.123
<v Speaker 1>It's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good thing to inhibit tnf </v>

127
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 1>alpha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>

128
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:53.610
<v Speaker 1>with the college and a's as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

129
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.290
<v Speaker 1>but there are so many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

130
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just spent two weeks just researching </v>

131
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:01.020
<v Speaker 1>and reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing some cold exposure,</v>

132
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cold shower and also jumping in the</v>

133
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 1>ocean ice bath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really liked the cryotherapy,</v>

134
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.693
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I did last time we were here and </v>

135
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 1>so I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been very interested in it,</v>

137
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.873
<v Speaker 1>like understanding why you feel so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I did some reading on it and </v>

138
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:18.584
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormetic benefits from doing </v>

139
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>cryotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have,</v>

140
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

141
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:27.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anti-inflammatory part and this,</v>

142
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.273
<v Speaker 1>and this also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been shown that doing like 10 </v>

143
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:30.434
<v Speaker 1>sessions of cryotherapy in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it increases the expression of </v>

144
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 1>glutathione reductase by twofold.</v>

145
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.330
<v Speaker 1>And another glue of that fly on related </v>
<v Speaker 1>enzyme glutathione peroxidase by like 68</v>

146
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:42.164
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are these enzymes like you </v>

147
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:46.820
<v Speaker 1>could be taking all the liposomal </v>
<v Speaker 1>glutathione you want,</v>

148
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.683
<v Speaker 1>like it's not going to matter if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the enzyme's active to use </v>

149
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:51.224
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can take lyposomal glutathione </v>

150
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.900
<v Speaker 1>and that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're increasing your,</v>

151
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 1>you make glutathione inside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourselves.</v>

152
00:06:57.771 --> 00:06:58.740
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

153
00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.883
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't make as much of it as we get </v>

154
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:01.664
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you take it and you don't have </v>

155
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:04.724
<v Speaker 1>the enzymes that use it to actually do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good stuff active that it doesn't </v>

156
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:08.444
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cryotherapy was shown to activate to </v>

157
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 1>different glutathione related enzymes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty awesome.</v>

158
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 1>So it would enhance your body's ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to absorb glutosiome no,</v>

159
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:19.520
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't enhance your body's ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to absorb it.</v>

160
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:20.354
<v Speaker 1>It enhances your body's ability to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>it right off the bat and then you're </v>

161
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 1>using cryotherapy.</v>

162
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 1>It would enhance it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

163
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.460
<v Speaker 1>so what I'm saying is that the lyposomal</v>
<v Speaker 1>glutathione that you take,</v>

164
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 1>all that does is increase glutathione </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of yourselves.</v>

165
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Gludethyon inside of your cells does </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing without enzymes that use it to,</v>

166
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.053
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to basically sequester damaging </v>

167
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.070
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the cryo therapy increased,</v>

168
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.410
<v Speaker 1>activates the enzymes that use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

169
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.333
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have all this food with Iowa and </v>

170
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:53.984
<v Speaker 1>sitting around on myself that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking and I also now have the enzymes </v>

171
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.730
<v Speaker 1>that use it to do good stuff now are </v>
<v Speaker 1>being turned on that.</v>

172
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 1>What was very interesting is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>took like multiple sessions before,</v>

173
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 1>before those got like 10 to 2010 and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least 10 and yeah.</v>

174
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:14.140
<v Speaker 1>And then the other study was 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was it consecutively at 10 days in</v>

175
00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:15.230
<v Speaker 1>a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

176
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.620
<v Speaker 1>10 days in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the first day I didn't do it.</v>

177
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was also very interesting.</v>

178
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like your body is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

179
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:25.250
<v Speaker 1>this crazy fuck of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do data response.</v>

180
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:25.911
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

181
00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Your body's preparing for war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

182
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.990
<v Speaker 1>it's stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a stressful response.</v>

183
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.800
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that's really cool that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't talk about last minute podcast</v>

184
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.400
<v Speaker 1>is the thermogenic effect when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you release Nora norepinephrine.</v>

185
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:40.603
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep going back to that because it's </v>

186
00:08:41.561 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 1>like you can't refute that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven Novella,</v>

187
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.610
<v Speaker 1>no one know debunker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no skeptic,</v>

188
00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:47.930
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care who you are.</v>

189
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.070
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

190
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>it's consistent in every type of cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure period.</v>

191
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:53.933
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

192
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 1>it's consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You release norepinephrine will.</v>

193
00:08:56.431 --> 00:08:57.264
<v Speaker 1>There always seems to be some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalization with a lot of the </v>

194
00:08:59.161 --> 00:08:59.994
<v Speaker 1>debunking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whether it's the benefits of </v>

195
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:02.274
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the benefits of </v>

196
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.330
<v Speaker 1>cryotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's almost like a rationalization for</v>

197
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 1>not doing it.</v>

198
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:07.973
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're looking for an excuse </v>
<v Speaker 1>to not do it and not really very </v>

199
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:14.270
<v Speaker 1>objective that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was disturbing about it.</v>

200
00:09:14.271 --> 00:09:17.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is like you're poopooing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's often people grape.</v>

201
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

202
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.700
<v Speaker 1>it was clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean after I especially,</v>

203
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:22.770
<v Speaker 1>especially after I did the two weeks of </v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

204
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think there's a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality when you're.</v>

205
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people like to think I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep thinker and I'm not,</v>

206
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am intentionally.</v>

207
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:31.524
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you get in this mentality of </v>

208
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.650
<v Speaker 1>always debunking something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

209
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like the spiral and you can't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good.</v>

210
00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't keep an open mind to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>get past.</v>

211
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:44.550
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's in your box that you know?</v>

212
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:48.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that blind spot it is.</v>

213
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:51.600
<v Speaker 1>And there are a lot of scientists that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know they're very smart,</v>

214
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.463
<v Speaker 1>extremely smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are in that loop where it's </v>

215
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:58.350
<v Speaker 1>like just they have to debunk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticized and it's like,</v>

216
00:09:58.351 --> 00:09:59.184
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point huge discoveries are made </v>

217
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:04.630
<v Speaker 1>by like connecting the dots and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting past that like,</v>

218
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to be critical.</v>

219
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Being critical is very important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also like,</v>

220
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a certain threshold </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you just start to like,</v>

221
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to this like spiral,</v>

222
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.400
<v Speaker 1>but well it was also was infuriating </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this as the data's out there.</v>

223
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.500
<v Speaker 1>This is not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like there's no data.</v>

224
00:10:19.501 --> 00:10:20.334
<v Speaker 1>It's like he made a cursory examination </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the evidence and what he chose to </v>

225
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.973
<v Speaker 1>focus on was it was so subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was focused on a study that tested </v>

226
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.200
<v Speaker 1>muscle soreness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>posts,</v>

227
00:10:32.201 --> 00:10:33.660
<v Speaker 1>exercise with cryotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

228
00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:36.930
<v Speaker 1>actually the study that he referred to </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a Meta analysis,</v>

229
00:10:36.931 --> 00:10:37.764
<v Speaker 1>and it was subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it actually came to the conclusion </v>

230
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 1>that there were benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however it said more studies that needed</v>

231
00:10:44.281 --> 00:10:45.114
<v Speaker 1>to be done because there wasn't large </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough sample sizes and the quality of </v>

232
00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:49.074
<v Speaker 1>data was poor because there were not </v>
<v Speaker 1>double blinded placebo controlled </v>

233
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:54.180
<v Speaker 1>clinical trials and I have to say to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

234
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.970
<v Speaker 1>so they're actually what he resided in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that article.</v>

235
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.833
<v Speaker 1>There was a positive effect of the cow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is is that because they </v>

236
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.040
<v Speaker 1>followed it up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well it's poor quality,</v>

237
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.083
<v Speaker 1>basically poor science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality is is that you can't do a </v>

238
00:11:09.121 --> 00:11:12.420
<v Speaker 1>double blinded placebo controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled trial with cryotherapy.</v>

239
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:13.523
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to be cold and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna be putting this chamber where </v>

240
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:18.110
<v Speaker 1>there's like cold or you're not and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna know,</v>

241
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:20.550
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

242
00:11:20.551 --> 00:11:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like whatever.</v>

243
00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

244
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:27.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read about this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know I've experienced it.</v>

245
00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:28.284
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely something going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that happens is </v>

246
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:34.440
<v Speaker 1>the norepinephrine and when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>released,</v>

247
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.690
<v Speaker 1>when you released that norepinephrine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it activates a pathway in,</v>

248
00:11:38.691 --> 00:11:40.860
<v Speaker 1>inside of your cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

249
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.250
<v Speaker 1>that basically our causes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your energy metabolism,</v>

250
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.550
<v Speaker 1>metabolism to ramp up because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to generate heat,</v>

251
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.490
<v Speaker 1>you want basically your body wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>heal.</v>

252
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Your body is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to die,</v>

253
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I need to make heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a couple of ways it can do that.</v>

254
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can shiver and shivering is when your</v>

255
00:11:57.461 --> 00:12:01.880
<v Speaker 1>muscles start to contract and that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>requires energy for your muscles to like</v>

256
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.220
<v Speaker 1>twitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

257
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.340
<v Speaker 1>it's not very thermodynamically </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorable.</v>

258
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:08.650
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good way to generate heat but</v>

259
00:12:08.651 --> 00:12:11.800
<v Speaker 1>you generate heat because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like ramp up to twitch.</v>

260
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Speaker 1>But then what happens after you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed?</v>

261
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:16.210
<v Speaker 1>And actually this happens to me because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we did the crowd twice.</v>

262
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:18.460
<v Speaker 1>The first time I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was shivering.</v>

263
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.593
<v Speaker 1>The entire time I was shivering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really crazy because I've never </v>

264
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:22.993
<v Speaker 1>shivered like that in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the second time I went in I did not </v>

265
00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 1>shiver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after reading about it,</v>

266
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.100
<v Speaker 1>what happens is your body quickly adapt </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you adapt.</v>

267
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.680
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is non shivering </v>
<v Speaker 1>thermogenesis,</v>

268
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.580
<v Speaker 1>so the nor epinephrin causes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitochondria,</v>

269
00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:39.730
<v Speaker 1>which are the energy producing little </v>
<v Speaker 1>organelles inside of yourselves,</v>

270
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:40.703
<v Speaker 1>what causes them in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your adipose tissue to like get </v>

271
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:44.494
<v Speaker 1>activated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it does this by increasing the </v>

272
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:46.954
<v Speaker 1>expression of a gene called UCP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one which basically freaks your </v>

273
00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:53.440
<v Speaker 1>mitochondria out because your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitochondria are kind of like batteries,</v>

274
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:54.423
<v Speaker 1>they're charged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a negative charge on the </v>

275
00:12:55.361 --> 00:12:57.370
<v Speaker 1>inside and a positive charge on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

276
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Will you see p one totally uncouples </v>
<v Speaker 1>that so that there's no more charge.</v>

277
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.200
<v Speaker 1>And that charge is very important </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when that charge is there,</v>

278
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.640
<v Speaker 1>your body knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

279
00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:10.150
<v Speaker 1>I've been making energy because the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you make the charge is by making energy.</v>

280
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.980
<v Speaker 1>So when the charge goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's like,</v>

281
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:13.750
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know energy.</v>

282
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:16.270
<v Speaker 1>So it just starts to ramp up fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolism.</v>

283
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.270
<v Speaker 1>So it does that and you start to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>more mitochondria.</v>

284
00:13:19.271 --> 00:13:20.104
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making more mitochondria in your </v>

285
00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 1>fat cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is often called Brown fat.</v>

286
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can actually,</v>

287
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.093
<v Speaker 1>the reason it's called Brown fat is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you look at a fat cell </v>

288
00:13:27.881 --> 00:13:29.920
<v Speaker 1>under the microscope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it has more Mitochondria,</v>

289
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.113
<v Speaker 1>then it looks Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you actually start to burn fat and </v>

290
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.550
<v Speaker 1>you have this thermogenic because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>burning fat.</v>

291
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:39.040
<v Speaker 1>It's creating heat as a byproduct so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're warming your body,</v>

292
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.040
<v Speaker 1>but it has this nice side effect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning fat,</v>

293
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:42.903
<v Speaker 1>which people like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more you expose yourself to the </v>

294
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:46.840
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you're browning your fat,</v>

295
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:48.430
<v Speaker 1>the more you're increasing those </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitochondria,</v>

296
00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:49.264
<v Speaker 1>your fats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means the next time you're in the </v>

297
00:13:50.201 --> 00:13:51.850
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tolerate it longer.</v>

298
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.340
<v Speaker 1>So people that have been exposing </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to cold,</v>

299
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.320
<v Speaker 1>like yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing the Cryo,</v>

300
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often you actually can tolerate the </v>

301
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.103
<v Speaker 1>colder for longer periods of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have more mitochondria in </v>

302
00:14:03.671 --> 00:14:04.660
<v Speaker 1>your fat cells.</v>

303
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.270
<v Speaker 1>And this allows you to then generate </v>
<v Speaker 1>more heat.</v>

304
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this has been shown in people,</v>

305
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.833
<v Speaker 1>people that have been exposed to a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have been shown to increase </v>

306
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:14.590
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

307
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:15.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown adipose tissue.</v>

308
00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:16.684
<v Speaker 1>But like 38 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're exposed to 10 days of 50 </v>

309
00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:20.860
<v Speaker 1>degree air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like outside air,</v>

310
00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:23.410
<v Speaker 1>just regular air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 degrees all day,</v>

311
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.410
<v Speaker 1>10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like six hours a day out and like,</v>

312
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York in the winter or fall,</v>

313
00:14:30.581 --> 00:14:31.414
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that being out there for </v>

314
00:14:32.381 --> 00:14:33.214
<v Speaker 1>six hours for 10 days in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men were able to increase their brown </v>

315
00:14:35.771 --> 00:14:37.690
<v Speaker 1>adipose tissue by like 38 percent or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

316
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Why people from the east coast or from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the northeast?</v>

317
00:14:40.361 --> 00:14:43.120
<v Speaker 1>The move to California and then they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back during the winter,</v>

318
00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:43.954
<v Speaker 1>they go home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My blood gut too thin was really is </v>

319
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:46.683
<v Speaker 1>there really is like a physical factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your body not being accustomed to </v>

320
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.220
<v Speaker 1>dealing with Colebra.</v>

321
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.230
<v Speaker 1>You adapt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you adapt.</v>

322
00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:53.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's what Brown adipose tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really one cold.</v>

323
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 1>How cold got really popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Popularized because people wanted to use</v>

324
00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 1>it as a hack to lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

325
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:00.020
<v Speaker 1>So they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

326
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:00.854
<v Speaker 1>if I do these cold showers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use it for the brain benefits because </v>

327
00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 1>I noticed I feel really good and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>more focused.</v>

328
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.953
<v Speaker 1>So I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people I've talked to have </v>

329
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.910
<v Speaker 1>felt the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

330
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.030
<v Speaker 1>but then I think the other part of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>article was the,</v>

331
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:21.690
<v Speaker 1>the effects of it blunting some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength training and you know,</v>

332
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.573
<v Speaker 1>I talked about this in this report that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote or the in the podcasts that I </v>

333
00:15:25.471 --> 00:15:26.304
<v Speaker 1>released and it's so complicated I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like sit there and literally just </v>

334
00:15:28.881 --> 00:15:32.480
<v Speaker 1>read for like two weeks to try to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out because you know,</v>

335
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:35.360
<v Speaker 1>the problem is that exercise is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormetic stress.</v>

336
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Cold is a hormetic stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So exercise itself,</v>

337
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.343
<v Speaker 1>you need some of the inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need the bad stuff to get the good </v>

338
00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:43.580
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it works.</v>

339
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:44.893
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inflammation that's happening </v>

340
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 1>happens while you're exercising and up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to one hour after,</v>

341
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.833
<v Speaker 1>one hour after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when the whole hormetic response </v>

342
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:54.044
<v Speaker 1>kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this has been shown in multiple </v>

343
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:55.514
<v Speaker 1>studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hour seems to be when the anti </v>

344
00:15:57.991 --> 00:15:58.824
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory response kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've generated the implementation </v>

345
00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:03.320
<v Speaker 1>and then now you've got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>antiinflammatory effects.</v>

346
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.600
<v Speaker 1>If you do a cold exposure within that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour after exercising,</v>

347
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.093
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may blunt some of the inflammatory </v>

348
00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:13.154
<v Speaker 1>effects that the exercise is inducing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the cold is activating anti </v>

349
00:16:16.311 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory genes too early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know that for certain,</v>

350
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:20.804
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that this study that </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed there was one study that showed </v>

351
00:16:23.931 --> 00:16:25.370
<v Speaker 1>strength training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you did it,</v>

352
00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:27.380
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you did see cryotherapy immediately,</v>

353
00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 1>like immediately after a Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was actually cold water immersion,</v>

354
00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:31.874
<v Speaker 1>which is not the same as the Cryo cryo </v>
<v Speaker 1>chamber that it blended some of the </v>

355
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:37.400
<v Speaker 1>anabolic I'm signaling.</v>

356
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 1>And so there was like some of the muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass was,</v>

357
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.290
<v Speaker 1>was not gained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

358
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:45.800
<v Speaker 1>there's other studies that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>done that have shown for some reason.</v>

359
00:16:45.801 --> 00:16:47.840
<v Speaker 1>All the insurance guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always wait an hour.</v>

360
00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.253
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm wondering is if people that </v>

361
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:55.730
<v Speaker 1>are doing this research like sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a step back,</v>

362
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are always in this.</v>

363
00:16:57.471 --> 00:16:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I got to publisher to publish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

364
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.073
<v Speaker 1>was a real big publisher parish </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality in science where it's like </v>

365
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:06.050
<v Speaker 1>your bread and butter depends on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>publishing and so you're just constantly</v>

366
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.230
<v Speaker 1>trying to get that data out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you really,</v>

367
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.093
<v Speaker 1>I think things are so complicated just </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sit down and take a look at </v>

368
00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:14.870
<v Speaker 1>everything that's out there and start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go wait a minute,</v>

369
00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:15.704
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of little details that need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be considered to design this trial </v>

370
00:17:18.981 --> 00:17:19.814
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

371
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.820
<v Speaker 1>So I'm hoping that at least for those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people doing strength training,</v>

372
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:23.654
<v Speaker 1>that they'll do one where they actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>wait until an hour because there's been </v>

373
00:17:26.511 --> 00:17:27.344
<v Speaker 1>other studies where there that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength to strength training in </v>

374
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:33.560
<v Speaker 1>combination with cryotherapy done much </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

375
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Even the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are actually benefits,</v>

376
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.793
<v Speaker 1>performance benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they were able to do more of those </v>

377
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.013
<v Speaker 1>leg curl things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they called leg </v>

378
00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:42.074
<v Speaker 1>extensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

379
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:43.303
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

380
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

381
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.103
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know what's going on but </v>

382
00:17:45.971 --> 00:17:46.804
<v Speaker 1>at what I do know is that it seems as </v>
<v Speaker 1>though it's very likely that doing the </v>

383
00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:52.410
<v Speaker 1>cryotherapy like immediately after and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

384
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

385
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking about someone that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

386
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.303
<v Speaker 1>like there's been studies that have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>published showing that people that are </v>

387
00:17:58.711 --> 00:17:59.544
<v Speaker 1>doing two bouts of exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're like riding a bike and then </v>

388
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:03.840
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're waiting,</v>

389
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:04.973
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our 30 minutes and then they go and run </v>

390
00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:08.004
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

391
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.410
<v Speaker 1>If they do cold water immersion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between those,</v>

392
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.540
<v Speaker 1>they actually have performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancements,</v>

393
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.230
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>

394
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.050
<v Speaker 1>if they wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

395
00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:17.880
<v Speaker 1>I have to do it between two bouts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>

396
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Some of that's due to the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>

397
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.873
<v Speaker 1>the cold water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to improve heart rate </v>

398
00:18:22.681 --> 00:18:23.514
<v Speaker 1>variability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually been shown to improve it </v>

399
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:25.764
<v Speaker 1>by like two to three fold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So heart rate variability is the change </v>

400
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:32.640
<v Speaker 1>in oscillation between heartbeats and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

401
00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:33.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

402
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.810
<v Speaker 1>people judge a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart recovery from a workout.</v>

403
00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:38.850
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as you're done with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense workout,</v>

404
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.760
<v Speaker 1>the ability of your heart rate to lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately within minutes,</v>

405
00:18:41.761 --> 00:18:43.710
<v Speaker 1>that's like a marker of heart rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>variability.</v>

406
00:18:43.711 --> 00:18:47.100
<v Speaker 1>And it's supposed to be good because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're able to deal with these stressful</v>

407
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:47.963
<v Speaker 1>changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

408
00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.460
<v Speaker 1>because when you're making cortisol or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

409
00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:54.240
<v Speaker 1>your heart starts racing more or some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these other stress hormones.</v>

410
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's been shown to improve that.</v>

411
00:18:55.951 --> 00:18:56.880
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having,</v>

412
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.043
<v Speaker 1>being able to have your heart rates </v>
<v Speaker 1>slower right after a workout and then </v>

413
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.573
<v Speaker 1>immediately going into a workout again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine there would be a </v>

414
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.890
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancement with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

415
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.280
<v Speaker 1>So there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference in the,</v>

416
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:12.480
<v Speaker 1>the physiological response between cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>water immersion and Cryo therapy,</v>

417
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:13.261
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

418
00:19:13.261 --> 00:19:15.210
<v Speaker 1>it depends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

419
00:19:15.211 --> 00:19:18.360
<v Speaker 1>if you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are differences in the ability for</v>

420
00:19:18.361 --> 00:19:21.480
<v Speaker 1>those two different modalities to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extract heat from the body,</v>

421
00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:22.773
<v Speaker 1>know if we're talking about submerging </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and cold water up to our </v>

422
00:19:26.101 --> 00:19:27.540
<v Speaker 1>shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

423
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:33.290
<v Speaker 1>water or ice is a much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much better at extracting heat from</v>

424
00:19:34.231 --> 00:19:36.420
<v Speaker 1>the body than error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

425
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.870
<v Speaker 1>but surface area also plays a role and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end,</v>

426
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.713
<v Speaker 1>the temperature change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're sitting in cold water </v>

427
00:19:41.971 --> 00:19:43.840
<v Speaker 1>that's 57 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

428
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.180
<v Speaker 1>that's not as cold as going into a minus</v>
<v Speaker 1>180 or whatever crowd chamber.</v>

429
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:51.480
<v Speaker 1>But you can also sit in the cold water </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot longer.</v>

430
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:56.280
<v Speaker 1>So I to do it for 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there has been a study that</v>

431
00:19:56.281 --> 00:19:57.114
<v Speaker 1>compared the norepinephrine release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 seconds at 40 degree water up to the </v>

432
00:20:01.081 --> 00:20:06.081
<v Speaker 1>shoulders is comparable to two minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a minus standard,</v>

433
00:20:06.871 --> 00:20:10.410
<v Speaker 1>something one 80 minus one 84,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no epinephrin,</v>

434
00:20:10.411 --> 00:20:13.460
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of these effects are mediated </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Nora Norepinephrine,</v>

435
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.080
<v Speaker 1>but listened for 20 seconds at 40 to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse those two minutes.</v>

436
00:20:16.081 --> 00:20:16.914
<v Speaker 1>So imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine staying in the water for five </v>

437
00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:19.434
<v Speaker 1>minutes in that and this has been shown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you have someone that stays in </v>

438
00:20:22.711 --> 00:20:23.544
<v Speaker 1>water 57 degree water for an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they increased their norepinephrine by </v>

439
00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.990
<v Speaker 1>fivefold instead of twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a more robust response so it</v>

440
00:20:30.991 --> 00:20:31.824
<v Speaker 1>could be good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it could be bad if you're talking </v>

441
00:20:34.051 --> 00:20:34.884
<v Speaker 1>about doing it right after a strength </v>
<v Speaker 1>training session and jumping into cold </v>

442
00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:38.730
<v Speaker 1>water for five minutes.</v>

443
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:39.863
<v Speaker 1>That could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could have some very potent anti </v>

444
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.080
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the best way to handle it would be to</v>

445
00:20:46.081 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 1>wait at least an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

446
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

447
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.140
<v Speaker 1>What about anti inflammatory markers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the blood?</v>

448
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.263
<v Speaker 1>So there happened studies that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>shown that cryotherapy lower c reactive </v>

449
00:20:58.391 --> 00:21:00.730
<v Speaker 1>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be an inflammatory marker,</v>

450
00:21:00.731 --> 00:21:04.900
<v Speaker 1>and then the glutathione related enzymes</v>
<v Speaker 1>going up and also superoxide dismutase,</v>

451
00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:05.734
<v Speaker 1>that would be a marker for inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's also a decrease </v>

452
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:11.650
<v Speaker 1>inflammation when you have more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

453
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.870
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so cryotherapy does.</v>

454
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:14.980
<v Speaker 1>And then also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

455
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.040
<v Speaker 1>there's been mark measurements of TNF </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha going down.</v>

456
00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also another marker that macrophages</v>

457
00:21:22.091 --> 00:21:24.820
<v Speaker 1>release macrophage inhibitory protein or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

458
00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:29.860
<v Speaker 1>some inflammatory molecule that's made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's less of it when you,</v>

459
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.813
<v Speaker 1>when Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember if it was cold water </v>

460
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:34.120
<v Speaker 1>immersion or cryotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's cold exposure.</v>

461
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.433
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was mediated through north and </v>

462
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:38.770
<v Speaker 1>ignore epinephrin mediates a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

463
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.480
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mediating the brain effects.</v>

464
00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:42.880
<v Speaker 1>It's meeting in thermogenesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's antiinflammatory,</v>

465
00:21:42.881 --> 00:21:43.714
<v Speaker 1>it's anti-pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get injected with norepinephrine </v>

466
00:21:45.341 --> 00:21:48.610
<v Speaker 1>and their spine to alleviate a pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

467
00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 1>because it's anti-inflammatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

468
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.753
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably other things going on </v>

469
00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:56.200
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So science just science,</v>

470
00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:57.043
<v Speaker 1>just the hard science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of evidence that there's </v>

471
00:21:58.391 --> 00:22:00.640
<v Speaker 1>benefits to crow therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

472
00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:02.830
<v Speaker 1>So why would need write an article like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

473
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

474
00:22:04.931 --> 00:22:06.040
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>

475
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:10.690
<v Speaker 1>there's the bad article that was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anabolic blunting effects which was done</v>

476
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.033
<v Speaker 1>immediately after exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which made a huge splash because it's </v>

477
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:14.801
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

478
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:16.900
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your gains.</v>

479
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.980
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

480
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.630
<v Speaker 1>the hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very skeptical people that are like,</v>

481
00:22:22.631 --> 00:22:24.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of data,</v>

482
00:22:24.461 --> 00:22:25.600
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the thing is,</v>

483
00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:26.434
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a large body of data and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if you can't have a double </v>

484
00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:33.310
<v Speaker 1>blinded placebo controlled trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to look at mechanism.</v>

485
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.950
<v Speaker 1>You have to look at animal studies </v>
<v Speaker 1>combined with human studies.</v>

486
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:40.010
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't refute the norepinephrine.</v>

487
00:22:40.011 --> 00:22:41.950
<v Speaker 1>And we know that in orbit difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing all these things,</v>

488
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:43.023
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you just have to be very </v>

489
00:22:44.921 --> 00:22:47.800
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when the,</v>

490
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.230
<v Speaker 1>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the argument that the,</v>

491
00:22:50.231 --> 00:22:54.310
<v Speaker 1>there's no placebo controlled trials are</v>
<v Speaker 1>too subjective,</v>

492
00:22:54.311 --> 00:22:56.530
<v Speaker 1>but there's lots of ways that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective.</v>

493
00:22:56.531 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 1>And this has been measured in people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have measured c reactive protein,</v>

494
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:01.090
<v Speaker 1>they've measured these enzyme </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities,</v>

495
00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.510
<v Speaker 1>they've measured these inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules and people also when animals,</v>

496
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.310
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

497
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.273
<v Speaker 1>I'm confident when I say that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely health benefits from doing </v>

498
00:23:10.961 --> 00:23:13.810
<v Speaker 1>cold exposure for your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti-inflammatory,</v>

499
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.920
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

500
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.450
<v Speaker 1>for thermogenesis.</v>
