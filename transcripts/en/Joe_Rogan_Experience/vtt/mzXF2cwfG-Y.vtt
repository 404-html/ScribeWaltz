<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

20
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.870
<v Speaker 2>The best people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they worked for Steve Rinella,</v>

21
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 2>meat eater and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know the well.</v>

22
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Doug [inaudible] of course is my friend</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Wisconsin and he brought his friend</v>

23
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 2>Nathan and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're gonna talk about some stuff</v>

24
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 2>and we'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good to see.</v>

25
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

26
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to talk about this one thing</v>

27
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 2>that came out today that I tweeted that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 2>they found that there's a huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference,</v>

29
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 2>not just a little difference because</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have always wondered like,</v>

30
00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 2>does it matter if you buy grass fed</v>
<v Speaker 2>food?</v>

31
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 2>Does it matter if you bought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

32
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.630
<v Speaker 2>what if it does it really matter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

33
00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 2>it apparently it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a new study that found clear</v>

34
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 2>differences between organic and non</v>
<v Speaker 2>organic meat and milk.</v>

35
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.220
<v Speaker 2>And this is the largest study of its</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind.</v>

36
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.170
<v Speaker 2>An international team of experts led by</v>
<v Speaker 2>new castle university in the UK is shown</v>

37
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:53.171
<v Speaker 2>that both organic milk and organic meat</v>
<v Speaker 2>contains around 50% more beneficial</v>

38
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:56.290
<v Speaker 2>omega three fatty acids than</v>
<v Speaker 2>conventionally pro,</v>

39
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce products.</v>

40
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Which is pretty fascinating because a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people have speculated that it's</v>

41
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:03.780
<v Speaker 2>all bs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you go and you buy grass fed this</v>

42
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 2>or grass fed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it doesn't mean anything,</v>

43
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 2>but it means a lot.</v>

44
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's interesting to me about</v>

45
00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:13.900
<v Speaker 1>it is so much of it for me is intuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

46
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I grew up with cattle and it makes sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a,</v>

47
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 1>a ruminant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cow,</v>

48
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it eats grass,</v>

49
00:02:23.141 --> 00:02:24.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it eats.</v>

50
00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:26.260
<v Speaker 1>And you start putting all this other</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff into it.</v>

51
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.940
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corn,</v>

52
00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:30.730
<v Speaker 1>soybeans and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what they were made to eat.</v>

53
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then you take that a step further</v>

54
00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>and have it be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're referring in this</v>

55
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 1>organic that they're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>grasping.</v>

56
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're,</v>

57
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.370
<v Speaker 1>they're eating what they're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>

58
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 1>not what we somehow along the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided,</v>

59
00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:47.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what they're going to eat,</v>

60
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.460
<v Speaker 1>corn or soybeans because I'll put on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fat that we all liked so much</v>

61
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.660
<v Speaker 1>speeds up the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

62
00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:55.690
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It speeds up the maturing process of the</v>

63
00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:56.524
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

64
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not who the good way.</v>

65
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

66
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.110
<v Speaker 1>so many bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>It makes so much sense to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>from it just from a common sense level</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is going to be the best thing</v>

69
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>for the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then down in the way,</v>

70
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be the best thing for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not forcing stuff on that animal</v>

71
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:17.210
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

72
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.650
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.483
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>normally normally be eating and they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to eat it by choice.</v>

75
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>But I will tell you if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 1>the cows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not the ones that I had when you</v>

77
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>were out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I go out with the cattle that I</v>

78
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>have now that I bought a about a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

79
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>I bang two buckets together and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>come running because they know the</v>

80
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>food's coming well because they used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be fed corn.</v>

81
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these are animals that you purchased?</v>

82
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're already at maturity.</v>

83
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.611
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

84
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>they were bred cows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was looking to get,</v>

85
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

86
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>those cattle that I had when you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>there that we had when you were there.</v>

87
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>I sold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a drought year and he prices went</v>

88
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:57.060
<v Speaker 1>through the roof and I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

89
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>had a barn and shed full of Hay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was pretty valuable and the cattle</v>

90
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>were still pretty valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

91
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 1>salt was able to sell those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then take the winter off and spent</v>

92
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 1>some time in Mexico and what not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if they might be a few cattle,</v>

93
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

94
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to get back into the game.</v>

95
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 1>So now I've got her to Herford so that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>bought last year.</v>

96
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I heard of what Herford what's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>herferd.</v>

97
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Her ferg is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a breed that I think originated in</v>

98
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

99
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.380
<v Speaker 1>and wait face red animal.</v>

100
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the ones that we had when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were there the last time,</v>

101
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:34.290
<v Speaker 1>we're actually a herferd cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

102
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.030
<v Speaker 1>so they were Herford originally or their</v>
<v Speaker 1>original brood cows were her fridge.</v>

103
00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>And if we bred them to like a black</v>
<v Speaker 1>anchor,</v>

104
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 1>sir readying cause crossbred um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get some hybrid vigor out of him and</v>

105
00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:46.680
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or wait,</v>

106
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>what is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference of between</v>

107
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 1>different styles of cows are different</v>
<v Speaker 1>breeds of cows.</v>

108
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

109
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 1>everything from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they put on weight to how they look</v>

110
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

111
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the nation.</v>

112
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 1>See Holly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put weight on,</v>

113
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

114
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.430
<v Speaker 1>if they're dairy cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

115
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.290
<v Speaker 1>some of the like guernseys and jerseys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of thing.</v>

116
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't produce as much milk,</v>

117
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 1>but it'll have a real high butter fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>content that's fascinating with the same</v>

118
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

119
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>So at the same feeding them the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

120
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Different cows produce different butter</v>
<v Speaker 1>fats.</v>

121
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

122
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 1>so holsteins which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

123
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>the sort of the traditional dairy cow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big black and white thing.</v>

124
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen him on everything.</v>

125
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a big animal,</v>

126
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.620
<v Speaker 1>big boned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 1>a really tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big animal.</v>

128
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they sort of have the ability to</v>

129
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 1>kind of eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not as picky eater.</v>

130
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>They produce a lot of milk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will have a lower butterfat.</v>

131
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.720
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I'm talking about dairy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

132
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I've been out of the dairy business</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 1988,</v>

133
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:54.640
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

134
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>what's fascinating stuff you'll have no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no</v>

135
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The different cows will produce a</v>

136
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 2>different level of dairy fat.</v>

137
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

138
00:06:03.851 --> 00:06:06.970
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then butterfat is what a farmers is</v>

139
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
<v Speaker 1>paid on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a hundred pounds,</v>

140
00:06:10.331 --> 00:06:12.820
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is about eight pounds to the gallon.</v>

141
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.173
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

142
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.120
<v Speaker 1>and in milk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're paid by the pound.</v>

143
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100 pounds of 3.5%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Butterfat for instance,</v>

144
00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:25.060
<v Speaker 1>is not worth as much as a 100 pounds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>4.5% butter fat.</v>

145
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.540
<v Speaker 1>So there's this whole calibration system</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to do that.</v>

146
00:06:28.541 --> 00:06:28.931
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:30.640
<v Speaker 1>milk's being tested all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both,</v>

148
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organic grass fed,</v>

149
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage,</v>

150
00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:39.841
<v Speaker 1>pasture raised and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more modern if you will.</v>

151
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

152
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.170
<v Speaker 1>confined animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>facilities where they're,</v>

153
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>milk,</v>

154
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand cows in a real small area,</v>

155
00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:55.390
<v Speaker 1>are very confining them to a very small</v>
<v Speaker 1>area where,</v>

156
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nate and I both grew up,</v>

157
00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and use our farm,</v>

158
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.590
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pasture fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

159
00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:05.860
<v Speaker 1>So the catalog kind of walking around</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing their thing out on pasture,</v>

160
00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 1>they come in at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the evening,</v>

161
00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:08.290
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd feed them,</v>

162
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a supplement of it might be</v>

163
00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:12.850
<v Speaker 1>great or it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

164
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be these various things.</v>

165
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.440
<v Speaker 1>And it kind of depended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That all evolved over time.</v>

166
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in my lifetime,</v>

167
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.830
<v Speaker 1>and you were always sort of aiming to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the most out of each one of those</v>

168
00:07:23.831 --> 00:07:27.730
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And depending on how you looked at the</v>

169
00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:29.200
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

170
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people spent their whole life studying</v>

171
00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:33.490
<v Speaker 1>how to get the most out of a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

172
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.440
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you looked at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

173
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made decisions about that.</v>

174
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid it was a lot more of,</v>

175
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.110
<v Speaker 1>and I mean a kid like in the 60s and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>early sixties,</v>

176
00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:45.820
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot more common sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

177
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now it's much more like in those big</v>

178
00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:51.460
<v Speaker 1>milking operations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

179
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.100
<v Speaker 1>It's more science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

180
00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how we can get the most out of</v>

181
00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

182
00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 2>So you remember this shift between what</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like normal farming,</v>

183
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.260
<v Speaker 2>normal dairy farming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal meat,</v>

184
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 2>cow farming to this thing that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing now that most people have a real</v>

185
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:12.290
<v Speaker 2>big problem with this factory farming</v>
<v Speaker 2>installations where you have these cows</v>

186
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:16.040
<v Speaker 2>jammed into these warehouses and</v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens and the same thing with pigs</v>

187
00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:18.650
<v Speaker 2>and the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the things that people have a</v>

188
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:22.090
<v Speaker 2>real issue with when they see them on</v>
<v Speaker 2>television and they see youtube videos.</v>

189
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.540
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember this shift?</v>

190
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.573
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

191
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was 57 years old.</v>

192
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:31.030
<v Speaker 1>I was born in 1959 by the time I was old</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to drive tractor,</v>

193
00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:32.740
<v Speaker 1>which was when you're about four years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old where I'm from,</v>

194
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.180
<v Speaker 1>you're driving to check their full out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're sitting there steering it anyway,</v>

195
00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:38.620
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through the field and they're</v>

196
00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:40.060
<v Speaker 1>popping in Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sick.</v>

197
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I was six when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I jumped out.</v>

198
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.350
<v Speaker 1>You remember this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

199
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.360
<v Speaker 1>And so when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

200
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.590
<v Speaker 1>do you remember where we shot when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>had that shooting range set up by my</v>

201
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:52.930
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little kind of a,</v>

202
00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:54.970
<v Speaker 1>it was an old foundation there that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chicken coop.</v>

203
00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 1>We had chickens there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a greenery in between the</v>

204
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>little building that we finally call the</v>
<v Speaker 1>keepout shed now because it's the</v>

205
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:04.200
<v Speaker 1>security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just says keep out on the door.</v>

206
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

207
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a facility where we raised pigs and that</v>

208
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 1>we had a rolling herd of about 40 milk</v>
<v Speaker 1>cows and they were holsteins.</v>

209
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>And so it was a diverse farm was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity ecosystem,</v>

210
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:22.230
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I dunno,</v>

211
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the Nixon administration,</v>

212
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earl Butz who was the secretary of</v>

213
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 1>agriculture then came out and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get big or get out.</v>

214
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.030
<v Speaker 1>And that was really the beginning of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the small</v>

215
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.730
<v Speaker 2>family farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

216
00:09:37.731 --> 00:09:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said this like,</v>

217
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.380
<v Speaker 2>was it a statement on them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the halogen or what?</v>

218
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.500
<v Speaker 2>How did this go down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

219
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.040
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

220
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm sure it can be found somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

221
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get bigger get,</v>

222
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.300
<v Speaker 1>and that's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

223
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.730
<v Speaker 1>it was like part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

224
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.370
<v Speaker 1>it was a r a press conference or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to that effect</v>

225
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.540
<v Speaker 4>that was going to be the move and</v>
<v Speaker 4>agriculture,</v>

226
00:09:59.541 --> 00:10:01.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was a long process.</v>

227
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember,</v>

228
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.760
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our exit,</v>

229
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.623
<v Speaker 4>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the,</v>

230
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.780
<v Speaker 4>the dairy sector.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

231
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.350
<v Speaker 4>ours came in the late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there was a big shift,</v>

232
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if just for example,</v>

233
00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:18.500
<v Speaker 4>my grandfather was running the farm in</v>
<v Speaker 4>1977 and then the milk price was like 14</v>

234
00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:23.501
<v Speaker 4>or $15 per hundred weight when my dad</v>
<v Speaker 4>was forced to sell in,</v>

235
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.200
<v Speaker 4>I think it was 98 or 99,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like nine bucks,</v>

236
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're trying to raise a family and</v>

237
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.750
<v Speaker 4>continue a legacy and you're getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>paid dirt,</v>

238
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.390
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what caused that shift?</v>

239
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.770
<v Speaker 4>Big Agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>systematic,</v>

240
00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a systematic shift to the corporate</v>

241
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.890
<v Speaker 4>and there's some sense,</v>

242
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.823
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

243
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I want to say there's some sense in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's probably not a completely,</v>

244
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand that efficient getting,</v>

245
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

246
00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:53.830
<v Speaker 1>it's the American way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get bigger,</v>

247
00:10:53.831 --> 00:10:57.190
<v Speaker 1>you get A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's efficiencies in the in scale.</v>

248
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to understand like what was</v>

249
00:10:59.141 --> 00:11:02.500
<v Speaker 2>the motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it that populations were booming</v>

250
00:11:02.501 --> 00:11:04.720
<v Speaker 2>because there's a lot more people today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

251
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we looked at it up the other</v>

252
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.150
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in the night in 1970 there was</v>

253
00:11:10.151 --> 00:11:12.190
<v Speaker 2>something like 150 million people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>

254
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Now there's 300 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

255
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not that long ago.</v>

256
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's in my lifetime and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

257
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.870
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy that the population has</v>
<v Speaker 2>doubled and the demand for food</v>

258
00:11:22.871 --> 00:11:24.010
<v Speaker 2>obviously doubled as well.</v>

259
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's really interesting if</v>

260
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:28.560
<v Speaker 1>you look at that area where you came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and visited,</v>

261
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.440
<v Speaker 1>exact opposite has happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>population there.</v>

262
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 1>There's half as many people.</v>

263
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our areas they were as there were</v>

264
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.800
<v Speaker 2>farm area and it's a farm area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

265
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.840
<v Speaker 2>so the small farm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the family farm is what's really</v>

266
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:45.310
<v Speaker 2>suffering because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to make ends meet with</v>

267
00:11:45.311 --> 00:11:48.640
<v Speaker 2>these gigantic operations that are just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

268
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

269
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.870
<v Speaker 4>well they can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

270
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

271
00:11:51.951 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 4>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a business you</v>

272
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.710
<v Speaker 1>can afford to sell a product cheaper if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it bigger,</v>

273
00:11:56.711 --> 00:12:00.490
<v Speaker 1>but the things you lose there are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality and the,</v>

274
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>the sustainability and environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact of the process.</v>

275
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got these big farms.</v>

276
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.690
<v Speaker 1>We're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>

277
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.060
<v Speaker 1>they got make more product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they also make more shit,</v>

278
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a water issue.</v>

279
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

280
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 2>well that was a big part of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary cowspiracy where they were</v>

281
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:19.420
<v Speaker 2>trying to talk about the methane that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>produced by cows,</v>

282
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.050
<v Speaker 2>the methane and just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just getting rid of the actual cow shit</v>

283
00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're talking about massive,</v>

284
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:27.120
<v Speaker 2>massive quantities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

285
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.420
<v Speaker 1>and when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was younger,</v>

286
00:12:29.421 --> 00:12:32.570
<v Speaker 1>and even now the manure that's producing</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our farm,</v>

287
00:12:32.571 --> 00:12:37.400
<v Speaker 1>like now in the winter where I'm feeding</v>
<v Speaker 1>hay and they're confined would be kind</v>

288
00:12:37.401 --> 00:12:39.380
<v Speaker 1>of a strong word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stay around where the Hay is,</v>

289
00:12:39.381 --> 00:12:41.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've got fresh water,</v>

290
00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:43.340
<v Speaker 1>therefore him and it's spring water and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can talk about that later,</v>

291
00:12:43.341 --> 00:12:47.330
<v Speaker 1>but they stay in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

292
00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.760
<v Speaker 1>and so that's where also where they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

293
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

294
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.210
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I ended up piling that stuff up</v>

295
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.280
<v Speaker 1>and I pile it up and I composted and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it on everything from a community</v>

296
00:12:58.281 --> 00:13:01.790
<v Speaker 1>garden nearby to our fields to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

297
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.380
<v Speaker 1>people want to come by and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

298
00:13:03.381 --> 00:13:05.480
<v Speaker 1>can I go and I look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a load of shit.</v>

299
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.400
<v Speaker 1>And I'm and sure as heck I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

300
00:13:07.401 --> 00:13:09.840
<v Speaker 1>I give it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas for them,</v>

301
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.010
<v Speaker 1>for a big facility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's where do we get rid of this shit?</v>

302
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.953
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

303
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm one of the reasons why I wanted</v>

304
00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:20.530
<v Speaker 2>to talk to you about this is because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that,</v>

305
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of us that live,</v>

306
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.300
<v Speaker 2>when I say us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people that live in cities have</v>

307
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.440
<v Speaker 2>almost no idea of how all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>works and when,</v>

308
00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:33.430
<v Speaker 2>when people examine it or where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to watch a documentary on it or</v>

309
00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:35.090
<v Speaker 2>try to figure out like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

310
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.430
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how cows are raised.</v>

311
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.660
<v Speaker 2>W one of the things we get confused</v>
<v Speaker 2>about is stop playing with that same</v>

312
00:13:40.661 --> 00:13:45.370
<v Speaker 2>answer we get confused about is how did</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happen?</v>

313
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Like how did these things become these</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic sort of operations where it</v>

314
00:13:52.241 --> 00:13:55.630
<v Speaker 2>seems so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so inhumane?</v>

315
00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

316
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:00.651
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

317
00:14:00.651 --> 00:14:01.790
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a business model.</v>

318
00:14:01.791 --> 00:14:04.440
<v Speaker 1>This business model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like corporations,</v>

319
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.290
<v Speaker 1>banks like everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same.</v>

320
00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.870
<v Speaker 1>It's the same idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly to me in our area and,</v>

321
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.930
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and neat.</v>

322
00:14:11.931 --> 00:14:13.630
<v Speaker 1>And some of the folks that he knows her</v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

323
00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I know and I am to a lesser extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

324
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.920
<v Speaker 1>because it's just a little bit different</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our farm.</v>

325
00:14:18.921 --> 00:14:21.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not something where I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a living at it,</v>

326
00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:22.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

327
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.670
<v Speaker 1>that it's starting to go the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it very much has gone the other way.</v>

328
00:14:25.671 --> 00:14:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Things like community supported</v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture and those sort of things are</v>

329
00:14:28.161 --> 00:14:31.010
<v Speaker 1>happening that people want to know their</v>
<v Speaker 1>farmer,</v>

330
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:31.903
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's like a,</v>

331
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a blowback.</v>

332
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.630
<v Speaker 2>So people are realizing that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>something kind of crazy about these</v>

333
00:14:36.631 --> 00:14:40.230
<v Speaker 2>factory farming setups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now they're trying to get their</v>

334
00:14:40.231 --> 00:14:44.700
<v Speaker 2>meat more form organic farms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how much more expensive is it say</v>

335
00:14:44.701 --> 00:14:47.790
<v Speaker 2>like one of your farms?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sell bulk.</v>

336
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider bulk anything over 50 pounds</v>

337
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 1>for six 50</v>

338
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 5>upon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like a family could come to you and</v>

339
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:57.080
<v Speaker 5>by directly Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

340
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 5>And do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you sell most of your stuff directly</v>

341
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:02.480
<v Speaker 5>or do you sell it to like a wholesaler</v>
<v Speaker 5>or how does that work?</v>

342
00:15:02.481 --> 00:15:05.270
<v Speaker 5>What I try to do is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and my whole goal with my meat</v>

343
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:07.070
<v Speaker 5>production,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we do a lot of other things we'll</v>

344
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.740
<v Speaker 5>maybe get into later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

345
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:13.810
<v Speaker 5>the meat production,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I try to take care of a certain amount</v>

346
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:14.810
<v Speaker 5>of families,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

347
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:16.610
<v Speaker 5>and when they need meet I have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not really,</v>

348
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't market it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's all,</v>

349
00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:20.600
<v Speaker 5>I have customers and they come to me</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they want meat.</v>

350
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:25.270
<v Speaker 5>So it's like a word of mouth type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And some people buy a quarter you don't,</v>

351
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.980
<v Speaker 5>which is like a hundred to 150 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes.</v>

352
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.110
<v Speaker 5>And some people will come up by 20</v>
<v Speaker 5>pounds when they need it.</v>

353
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.410
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a buddy who is a fireman who does</v>

354
00:15:33.411 --> 00:15:34.510
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has like a,</v>

355
00:15:34.511 --> 00:15:37.730
<v Speaker 5>a deal with a local rancher and he buys</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the,</v>

356
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:40.400
<v Speaker 5>him and a couple of the families that</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's friends with,</v>

357
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.010
<v Speaker 5>they'll go in on like a side of beef.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll go in on like a whole half of</v>

358
00:15:44.011 --> 00:15:45.860
<v Speaker 5>the cow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

359
00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:46.694
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

360
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.450
<v Speaker 5>they save money that way and then they</v>
<v Speaker 5>know they're getting like real organic</v>

361
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:54.110
<v Speaker 5>grass fed cows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like would that nice yellow fat.</v>

362
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

363
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to tell you this story.</v>

364
00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some years ago when we were raising</v>

365
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:00.830
<v Speaker 1>beef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

366
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I did for my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

367
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:07.520
<v Speaker 1>my ex wife and I did for my brother and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sister in law was gave them a,</v>

368
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.780
<v Speaker 1>a quarter of a beef for Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought it was being real clever.</v>

369
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the steers at that time kind of all had</v>

370
00:16:13.821 --> 00:16:16.700
<v Speaker 1>the same name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Heifer calves,</v>

371
00:16:16.701 --> 00:16:18.650
<v Speaker 1>the female calves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give them different names for</v>

372
00:16:18.651 --> 00:16:20.360
<v Speaker 1>different numbers and everything cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>we keep them around.</v>

373
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:22.520
<v Speaker 1>But the steers all had the same name and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was dinner</v>

374
00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:29.030
<v Speaker 5>and a steer for people don't know cow</v>
<v Speaker 5>that has its balls removed,</v>

375
00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:31.930
<v Speaker 5>the male male trial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So unique and yeah.</v>

376
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of,</v>

377
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of good reasons for doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

378
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just so nobody says,</v>

379
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:40.600
<v Speaker 1>so you're knocking this thing down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting,</v>

380
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:41.301
<v Speaker 1>it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Off,</v>

381
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:41.661
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

382
00:16:41.661 --> 00:16:43.460
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when we knock it down,</v>

383
00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:46.100
<v Speaker 1>we actually sedated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes to sleep,</v>

384
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.550
<v Speaker 1>it wakes up and it's singing soprano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

385
00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:51.140
<v Speaker 1>that's how that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how that works.</v>

386
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.570
<v Speaker 5>Jerk a little bit though when you went</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

387
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.210
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were to imagine,</v>

388
00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.740
<v Speaker 5>I don't care what you're sedated or not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

389
00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:01.260
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

390
00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.940
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so yeah,</v>

391
00:17:02.941 --> 00:17:05.880
<v Speaker 1>that is what is serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sorry,</v>

392
00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.290
<v Speaker 1>the story was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

393
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:12.280
<v Speaker 1>so we gave a Sarah anarchies this</v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of beef and um,</v>

394
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.110
<v Speaker 1>we're making a presentation of it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>

395
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:16.831
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

396
00:17:16.831 --> 00:17:19.920
<v Speaker 1>the neighbors over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

397
00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:24.690
<v Speaker 1>and so everybody's sitting around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>table and there's a couple of girls,</v>

398
00:17:24.691 --> 00:17:27.480
<v Speaker 1>young women maybe tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and 14,</v>

399
00:17:27.481 --> 00:17:29.280
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember their exact ages,</v>

400
00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:32.820
<v Speaker 1>but I had this polaroid picture of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that steer and said,</v>

401
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had it in quotations dinner and</v>

402
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.190
<v Speaker 1>made a presentation of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

403
00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:40.410
<v Speaker 1>we gave you this meat and here's this</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful steak that we're having and</v>

404
00:17:40.411 --> 00:17:43.650
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the before and here's the</v>

405
00:17:43.651 --> 00:17:46.230
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently I turned one of those girls</v>

406
00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:47.064
<v Speaker 1>into a vegetarian.</v>

407
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I felt</v>

408
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.900
<v Speaker 1>horrible about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

409
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.790
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been there from the beginning,</v>

410
00:17:54.791 --> 00:17:57.330
<v Speaker 2>from the time you were really young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been there from the,</v>

411
00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a part of your life,</v>

412
00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

413
00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.110
<v Speaker 2>you've always been around cows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always been around cattle.</v>

414
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.540
<v Speaker 2>It seems totally normal to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to somebody that just is used to go</v>

415
00:18:05.541 --> 00:18:09.490
<v Speaker 2>to the supermarket and buying a steak</v>
<v Speaker 2>that comes neatly wrapped in Saran wrap</v>

416
00:18:09.491 --> 00:18:12.190
<v Speaker 2>on a nice little foam tray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

417
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.440
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of freaking them out with</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

418
00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.680
<v Speaker 1>And I learned something that day about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

419
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.130
<v Speaker 1>But some of the folks that buy meat for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

420
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.120
<v Speaker 1>they come out and they take a look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place and you know,</v>

421
00:18:25.121 --> 00:18:25.721
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been there,</v>

422
00:18:25.721 --> 00:18:28.510
<v Speaker 1>you've been there not maybe the nicest</v>
<v Speaker 1>time of the year because it was cold</v>

423
00:18:28.511 --> 00:18:29.560
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>

424
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.750
<v Speaker 1>And the cattle were not in a pasture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had them confined in the barn yard.</v>

425
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not walking around.</v>

426
00:18:35.621 --> 00:18:38.260
<v Speaker 1>They're laying on the hillside there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chewing their cud.</v>

427
00:18:38.261 --> 00:18:39.094
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

428
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.150
<v Speaker 1>they're just happy as they can be in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're looking at me and they're</v>

429
00:18:43.151 --> 00:18:45.450
<v Speaker 1>looking at the Catalan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to have some of that meat.</v>

430
00:18:45.451 --> 00:18:47.020
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that connection,</v>

431
00:18:47.021 --> 00:18:47.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

432
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.680
<v Speaker 1>if I don't get anything else across here</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting this conversation,</v>

433
00:18:50.681 --> 00:18:52.900
<v Speaker 1>and I encourage people to know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>their farmer,</v>

434
00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who's raised in that,</v>

435
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

436
00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.050
<v Speaker 1>because that's the bowls or meat or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever for him.</v>

437
00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for someone who is</v>

438
00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:06.040
<v Speaker 2>not used to the idea of an animal being</v>
<v Speaker 2>alive and then being dead and then cut</v>

439
00:19:06.041 --> 00:19:08.440
<v Speaker 2>up and then portioned into steaks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then cooking it.</v>

440
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.030
<v Speaker 2>People that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are used to going to the</v>

441
00:19:10.031 --> 00:19:15.031
<v Speaker 2>supermarket and buying it already done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For them to be sort of a forced to look</v>

442
00:19:17.021 --> 00:19:22.021
<v Speaker 2>at that whole process as an adult is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little disconcerting for a lot of</v>

443
00:19:22.481 --> 00:19:25.660
<v Speaker 2>people because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're faced with is very convenient</v>

444
00:19:25.661 --> 00:19:30.580
<v Speaker 2>world where we're completely detached</v>
<v Speaker 2>from any of this stuff now as a guy</v>

445
00:19:30.581 --> 00:19:34.120
<v Speaker 2>who's been around it your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's gotta be kind of frustrating when</v>

446
00:19:34.121 --> 00:19:37.570
<v Speaker 2>you see the hypocrisy of people who eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meat,</v>

447
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.790
<v Speaker 2>but really kind of don't want to know</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it came from.</v>

448
00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hypocrisy is the only sin,</v>

449
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my world.</v>

450
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.480
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of the way I feel about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

451
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.590
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know the other sets</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily.</v>

452
00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:52.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the hypocrisy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hypocrisy as much as it's just ignorance</v>

453
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

454
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.951
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

455
00:19:55.951 --> 00:19:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I also want to say I don't take it</v>
<v Speaker 1>lightly at all.</v>

456
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.830
<v Speaker 1>We load up a cow or a steer or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put him on there,</v>

457
00:20:01.831 --> 00:20:04.620
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like when we shoot wildlife,</v>

458
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:05.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we kill wildlife.</v>

459
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Something like that is we did a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're doing a,</v>

460
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.370
<v Speaker 1>this is a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reverence.</v>

461
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Reverence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a river,</v>

462
00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:17.850
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly the right word there a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverence to it that you have in these</v>

463
00:20:18.391 --> 00:20:21.600
<v Speaker 1>smaller situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

464
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:26.280
<v Speaker 1>I could see where if I had 500 steers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm raising the 1,250 pounds,</v>

465
00:20:26.281 --> 00:20:29.510
<v Speaker 1>they might not have the same reverence</v>
<v Speaker 1>to those animals.</v>

466
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 1>But they're giving me something and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

467
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:33.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking it from him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's my deal.</v>

468
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:33.620
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

469
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's similar.</v>

470
00:20:34.461 --> 00:20:37.370
<v Speaker 2>There's similar argument when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about large populations of</v>

471
00:20:37.371 --> 00:20:40.520
<v Speaker 2>people that there's sort of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fusion of responsibility that</v>

472
00:20:40.521 --> 00:20:44.390
<v Speaker 2>comes with interacting with 20 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>people versus 20 people.</v>

473
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.520
<v Speaker 2>When you're around 20 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a town of 20 people,</v>

474
00:20:46.521 --> 00:20:47.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

475
00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:49.330
<v Speaker 2>and the relationships are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>

476
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.750
<v Speaker 2>whereas 20 million people you'd give the</v>
<v Speaker 2>finger to somebody on the road was the</v>

477
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:53.420
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

478
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.050
<v Speaker 2>you're never gonna see them again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

479
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:55.741
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

480
00:20:55.741 --> 00:20:59.170
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're in Cazenovia and you see</v>

481
00:20:59.171 --> 00:21:02.730
<v Speaker 2>that dickhead down the street from me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it leaves the nasty voicemail</v>

482
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:07.740
<v Speaker 2>messages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll never forget the fucking guys</v>

483
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:10.840
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You played that for us because that was</v>

484
00:21:10.841 --> 00:21:14.380
<v Speaker 2>seared into our head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know that you are forced into a</v>

485
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:17.560
<v Speaker 2>relationship with that person and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to manage that relationship when</v>

486
00:21:17.561 --> 00:21:18.820
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

487
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.190
<v Speaker 2>how many cows you have now.</v>

488
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I have 20 head run it.</v>

489
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have 20 cows,</v>

490
00:21:25.231 --> 00:21:27.120
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have to,</v>

491
00:21:27.121 --> 00:21:27.750
<v Speaker 2>and even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

492
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:28.680
<v Speaker 2>when you do the deed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

493
00:21:28.681 --> 00:21:31.230
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really not saying I have to kill</v>

494
00:21:31.231 --> 00:21:33.810
<v Speaker 2>this Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're saying when we load went up,</v>

495
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.040
<v Speaker 2>when we do the deed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

496
00:21:35.041 --> 00:21:36.840
<v Speaker 2>there's all these euphemisms for what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing.</v>

497
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:40.030
<v Speaker 2>You're going to kill this cow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a,</v>

498
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:44.230
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's because of the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many of them or there,</v>

499
00:21:44.231 --> 00:21:46.200
<v Speaker 2>but the rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so few of them that you have</v>

500
00:21:46.201 --> 00:21:46.830
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

501
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.600
<v Speaker 2>this is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big moment.</v>

502
00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.260
<v Speaker 1>It is a big moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

503
00:21:50.261 --> 00:21:55.030
<v Speaker 1>I sold a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cow this fall that I'm through no</v>

504
00:21:55.031 --> 00:21:57.760
<v Speaker 1>fault of her own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a prolapsed cervix.</v>

505
00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.650
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially her cervix pushed out.</v>

506
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.710
<v Speaker 1>And no matter how many times you push it</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in and sew things up,</v>

507
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.300
<v Speaker 1>she's going to continue to push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's not going to be productive.</v>

508
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and her productivity is to have calves.</v>

509
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I felt terrible about it.</v>

510
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Didn't mean I didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

511
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:20.523
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew.</v>

512
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Do it mean killer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

513
00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I didn't kill her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

514
00:22:23.261 --> 00:22:24.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the adults do it well.</v>

515
00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

516
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:25.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

517
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.373
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

518
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

519
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:33.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>passing that responsibility off to</v>

520
00:22:33.281 --> 00:22:35.050
<v Speaker 1>somebody else from the standpoint of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

521
00:22:35.051 --> 00:22:36.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have somebody else do it.</v>

522
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.560
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it when it needs to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when were neat and I both are</v>

523
00:22:41.561 --> 00:22:44.710
<v Speaker 1>selling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're selling meat to people.</v>

524
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:46.990
<v Speaker 1>There's regulations that go along with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

525
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't just like drop a cow in the,</v>

526
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.981
<v Speaker 1>in the barn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

527
00:22:50.981 --> 00:22:51.670
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

528
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.980
<v Speaker 1>in the driveway of the barn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang her up,</v>

529
00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.080
<v Speaker 1>cut her up and start selling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan meet.</v>

530
00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's USDA inspection and all that.</v>

531
00:23:00.341 --> 00:23:03.970
<v Speaker 1>So we both send our animals to very</v>
<v Speaker 1>small,</v>

532
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:05.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family run.</v>

533
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaughterhouses butcher shops and they,</v>

534
00:23:08.421 --> 00:23:10.300
<v Speaker 1>so you don't necessarily kill them</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>

535
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:10.921
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

536
00:23:10.921 --> 00:23:11.754
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

537
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

538
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:14.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something,</v>

539
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.220
<v Speaker 1>if you were doing one for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>

540
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

541
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:18.930
<v Speaker 1>and have,</v>

542
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.460
<v Speaker 2>so if you want to sell it then you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go through these and it has to be</v>

543
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:23.990
<v Speaker 1>yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it has the stamp.</v>

544
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

545
00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

546
00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.060
<v Speaker 1>and there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

547
00:23:29.061 --> 00:23:30.380
<v Speaker 1>a standard to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

548
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.820
<v Speaker 1>I would confidently never sell you any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my beef if I butchered it myself,</v>

549
00:23:34.821 --> 00:23:38.990
<v Speaker 1>but I would confidently give it to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say this,</v>

550
00:23:38.991 --> 00:23:39.771
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

551
00:23:39.771 --> 00:23:41.120
<v Speaker 1>you've seen how we do it out there.</v>

552
00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Basically it just government regulations</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to fall.</v>

553
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

554
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a standardization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm all,</v>

555
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm done with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

556
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.960
<v Speaker 4>there's a pretty cool movement going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The place I go to is called driftless</v>

557
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:57.020
<v Speaker 4>meets and [inaudible] and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a really,</v>

558
00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.830
<v Speaker 4>like when they bring in a cow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like one of the big problems with these</v>

559
00:23:59.831 --> 00:24:00.830
<v Speaker 4>slaughterhouses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

560
00:24:00.831 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

561
00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:05.180
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you bring your cow in the night before</v>

562
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.600
<v Speaker 4>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows how many cows jammed into a</v>

563
00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:10.910
<v Speaker 4>pen and they're stressed out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're running around bumping each</v>

564
00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:12.650
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These guys up there,</v>

565
00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:16.450
<v Speaker 4>I think the Max they take in on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>slaughter day is four.</v>

566
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.510
<v Speaker 4>And so these cows got their own pen</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

567
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very stress free.</v>

568
00:24:20.031 --> 00:24:21.860
<v Speaker 4>It's very relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

569
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:25.940
<v Speaker 4>so the process and then that's what's so</v>
<v Speaker 4>important about all of this and the</v>

570
00:24:25.941 --> 00:24:29.210
<v Speaker 4>sustainability and environmental impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all about the process.</v>

571
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.270
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fortunately there's a really strong</v>

572
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:36.050
<v Speaker 4>movement in that sector of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the processing is going on,</v>

573
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.003
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

574
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.800
<v Speaker 5>conscious carnivores is a place near us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a facility near us.</v>

575
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.620
<v Speaker 5>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a very important way of</v>

576
00:24:46.621 --> 00:24:47.730
<v Speaker 5>putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

577
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:50.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guys from a cowspiracy,</v>

578
00:24:50.251 --> 00:24:53.620
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot I read wept with those</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys too.</v>

579
00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:54.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's</v>

580
00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.120
<v Speaker 5>unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>About the exaggerations of some,</v>

581
00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.710
<v Speaker 5>some of their claims.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I think that if they just stuck</v>

582
00:25:01.711 --> 00:25:05.970
<v Speaker 5>with what's absolute and reality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very disturbing that this</v>

583
00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.920
<v Speaker 5>sustainability doesn't look good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

584
00:25:07.921 --> 00:25:11.680
<v Speaker 5>But what's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's interesting is here's some things</v>

585
00:25:11.681 --> 00:25:13.950
<v Speaker 5>that you disagree with strongly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the reasons why we got into</v>

586
00:25:13.951 --> 00:25:15.720
<v Speaker 5>this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One thing,</v>

587
00:25:15.721 --> 00:25:18.540
<v Speaker 5>the amount of acreage that it takes to</v>
<v Speaker 5>grow a cow.</v>

588
00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.490
<v Speaker 5>I just raise a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>

589
00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:21.380
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

590
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:24.370
<v Speaker 5>I've been in looking at my own,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

591
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:29.070
<v Speaker 5>cattle one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but and also spending some time with our</v>

592
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.930
<v Speaker 5>udw extension.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the egg people at the end through a</v>

593
00:25:31.931 --> 00:25:32.701
<v Speaker 5>university,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

594
00:25:32.701 --> 00:25:37.701
<v Speaker 5>Land Grant University 1.4,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1.4 to 14,</v>

595
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.370
<v Speaker 5>depending on how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a big difference.</v>

596
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.590
<v Speaker 5>And that's a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

597
00:25:42.591 --> 00:25:44.580
<v Speaker 5>1.4 to 58.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

598
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.170
<v Speaker 5>no one agrees with that places.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It probably is though going to have to</v>

599
00:25:49.171 --> 00:25:50.820
<v Speaker 5>be like desert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but wasn't that guy.</v>

600
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.370
<v Speaker 5>And why we raised was from Wisconsin was</v>
<v Speaker 5>from South Dakota.</v>

601
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.181
<v Speaker 5>Didn't you tell me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

602
00:25:54.181 --> 00:25:56.220
<v Speaker 5>there was that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He made a reference on this and you</v>

603
00:25:56.221 --> 00:25:56.761
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna,</v>

604
00:25:56.761 --> 00:25:58.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to pick all their numbers</v>
<v Speaker 5>apart or,</v>

605
00:25:58.291 --> 00:26:01.070
<v Speaker 5>and if not ranchers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think what happens is someone told</v>

606
00:26:01.071 --> 00:26:03.020
<v Speaker 5>him that that sounds great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They went with it.</v>

607
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:03.953
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

608
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.730
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is like,</v>

609
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.320
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they made a great documentary,</v>

610
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.070
<v Speaker 5>but when you make a documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you also have a great responsibility.</v>

611
00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.380
<v Speaker 5>Like they have an agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very clear,</v>

612
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.800
<v Speaker 5>their agenda is the promote veganism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's because they feel very strongly</v>

613
00:26:16.801 --> 00:26:18.240
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether you agree with it or why you</v>

614
00:26:18.241 --> 00:26:19.800
<v Speaker 5>don't agree with it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's their point of view.</v>

615
00:26:19.801 --> 00:26:23.100
<v Speaker 5>That's what they're trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>through in this documentary is that if</v>

616
00:26:23.101 --> 00:26:24.870
<v Speaker 5>you grow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just grow vegetables and you live off</v>

617
00:26:24.871 --> 00:26:26.850
<v Speaker 5>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't need as many acres,</v>

618
00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:28.950
<v Speaker 5>you could feed more people and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>healthier way to do it.</v>

619
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:31.140
<v Speaker 5>That's just their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their perspective and their point of</v>

620
00:26:31.141 --> 00:26:32.070
<v Speaker 5>view.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they sort of,</v>

621
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.650
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they lean towards that in a very strong</v>

622
00:26:34.651 --> 00:26:39.120
<v Speaker 5>way while highlighting some irrefutable</v>
<v Speaker 5>facts that are very disturbing.</v>

623
00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:39.830
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

624
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.050
<v Speaker 4>that's the shame of it is because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

625
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 4>they're environmentalist too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

626
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.060
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's obvious,</v>

627
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.120
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it kind of put off the vibe that,</v>

628
00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:49.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people like Doug and I aren't,</v>

629
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the problem is as you look at</v>

630
00:26:52.231 --> 00:26:53.970
<v Speaker 4>the big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big corporations that are,</v>

631
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>feeding off of all this misinformation</v>

632
00:26:57.481 --> 00:26:59.100
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

633
00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:01.140
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean by the big corporations</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are going well?</v>

634
00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:02.040
<v Speaker 4>You talk about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

635
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.050
<v Speaker 4>the big farms you can talk about in any</v>
<v Speaker 4>industry,</v>

636
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

637
00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.710
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a disjointed effort.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

638
00:27:07.711 --> 00:27:09.150
<v Speaker 4>you've got these guys talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

639
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.530
<v Speaker 4>you've got these guys talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

640
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.440
<v Speaker 4>We're all concerned about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>

641
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some of this stuff came off as an</v>

642
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:18.120
<v Speaker 4>attack on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

643
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.650
<v Speaker 4>beef production,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cattle,</v>

644
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.680
<v Speaker 4>livestock production.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we all agree on certain things.</v>

645
00:27:22.681 --> 00:27:26.310
<v Speaker 4>I think if you really want to focus and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to make a change in the world,</v>

646
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:29.130
<v Speaker 4>find a way to work together.</v>

647
00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're there.</v>

648
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Change is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't eat animals.</v>

649
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

650
00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Don't kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've got to compromise,</v>

651
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.810
<v Speaker 2>but they don't want to come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not in the proper less problem.</v>

652
00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:41.170
<v Speaker 2>There's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's very strong connections between</v>

653
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.880
<v Speaker 2>veganism and religion and if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of their ideologies,</v>

654
00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:49.150
<v Speaker 2>they're very similar and a lot of ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>to religious zealots,</v>

655
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:52.270
<v Speaker 2>like they have these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to promote them.</v>

656
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.130
<v Speaker 2>That and only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

657
00:27:54.131 --> 00:27:55.480
<v Speaker 2>this is the way they want to go about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

658
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:58.450
<v Speaker 2>And you know some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them say crazy shit.</v>

659
00:27:58.451 --> 00:28:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Like I've had these conversations with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people on twitter who this guy was</v>

660
00:28:01.361 --> 00:28:03.820
<v Speaker 2>saying that human beings are not meant</v>
<v Speaker 2>to eat meat.</v>

661
00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.170
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're herbivores.</v>

662
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's just not fucking true.</v>

663
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Showing her teeth dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well not only,</v>

664
00:28:09.241 --> 00:28:11.650
<v Speaker 2>but forget about the canine teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's absolutely true.</v>

665
00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:16.450
<v Speaker 2>But how about the fact that scientists</v>
<v Speaker 2>have done very clear studies on ancient</v>

666
00:28:16.451 --> 00:28:19.940
<v Speaker 2>humans and the reason why we became</v>
<v Speaker 2>human in the first place is the</v>

667
00:28:19.941 --> 00:28:23.710
<v Speaker 2>consumption of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It literally changed the amount of brain</v>

668
00:28:23.711 --> 00:28:27.610
<v Speaker 2>tissue we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then hunting changed how crafty</v>

669
00:28:27.611 --> 00:28:30.890
<v Speaker 2>people had to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It changed the innovation of,</v>

670
00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.250
<v Speaker 2>of these lower primates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these lower hominids.</v>

671
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.690
<v Speaker 2>They had to innovate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to figure out tools.</v>

672
00:28:35.691 --> 00:28:38.410
<v Speaker 2>He had to figure out weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just to defend themselves from</v>

673
00:28:38.411 --> 00:28:40.270
<v Speaker 2>humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in order to hunt animals.</v>

674
00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:42.290
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an irrefutable facts,</v>

675
00:28:42.291 --> 00:28:44.110
<v Speaker 2>essential part of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

676
00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.750
<v Speaker 2>It's so there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if I could speak for them,</v>

677
00:28:46.751 --> 00:28:50.950
<v Speaker 2>if I would play the devil's advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their point of view is now we have</v>

678
00:28:50.951 --> 00:28:53.920
<v Speaker 2>evolved to a point where we don't need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do this anymore.</v>

679
00:28:53.921 --> 00:28:56.140
<v Speaker 2>We don't need meat anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're very intelligent.</v>

680
00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:01.060
<v Speaker 2>We are also aware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're also faced with this overwhelming</v>

681
00:29:01.061 --> 00:29:04.360
<v Speaker 2>amount of evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this over whelming amount of information</v>

682
00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:05.740
<v Speaker 2>that we have now because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>

683
00:29:05.741 --> 00:29:08.260
<v Speaker 2>because of her access to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've never had before.</v>

684
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.560
<v Speaker 2>So you can look at some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>statistics and some of the things they</v>

685
00:29:11.561 --> 00:29:13.480
<v Speaker 2>brought up and you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

686
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.870
<v Speaker 2>this is their argument for promoting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegan lifestyle.</v>

687
00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.730
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go with that.</v>

688
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.540
<v Speaker 2>It's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the problem is that a lot of these</v>

689
00:29:22.541 --> 00:29:23.400
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

690
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:26.560
<v Speaker 2>they say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings can't process meet.</v>

691
00:29:26.561 --> 00:29:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Or we had this guy that robb wolf was</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguing on twitter who said,</v>

692
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal fat is toxic.</v>

693
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

694
00:29:33.611 --> 00:29:34.910
<v Speaker 2>How To inuits live?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

695
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.520
<v Speaker 2>How would the how they've been around</v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

696
00:29:36.521 --> 00:29:40.480
<v Speaker 2>They just eat nothing but fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These fucking people and if you look at</v>

697
00:29:40.481 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 2>their diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at what their,</v>

698
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.180
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their diseases.</v>

699
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.320
<v Speaker 5>The only fucking inuits that are getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>cancer.</v>

700
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.950
<v Speaker 5>The ones that are smoking cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

701
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.570
<v Speaker 5>Nasty fucking western habit that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>passed up to these poor people.</v>

702
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.510
<v Speaker 5>That's how they're getting cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're getting cancer in in higher</v>

703
00:29:55.511 --> 00:29:58.060
<v Speaker 5>numbers than they ever have before</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they weren't getting it before</v>

704
00:29:58.061 --> 00:29:58.900
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

705
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:03.250
<v Speaker 5>Cause people were eating blubber and fat</v>
<v Speaker 5>and seals and whatever fish they could</v>

706
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:06.100
<v Speaker 5>get and I can't grow a goddamn single</v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetable and they weren't getting</v>

707
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:06.720
<v Speaker 5>cancer.</v>

708
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.010
<v Speaker 4>The cancer thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

709
00:30:08.011 --> 00:30:12.080
<v Speaker 4>that's a great issue because recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've caught the whole</v>

710
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:15.180
<v Speaker 4>red meat and cancer thing and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they came out and they said,</v>

711
00:30:15.181 --> 00:30:19.040
<v Speaker 4>you know definitely your smoked meats</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're cured meats.</v>

712
00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:21.940
<v Speaker 4>Like our meats aren't cured.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what you mean by cured?</v>

713
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.630
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talking about like sodium nitrite.</v>

714
00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you make bacon,</v>

715
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:29.220
<v Speaker 4>like if you took a package of my bacon</v>
<v Speaker 4>and looked at the label,</v>

716
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.380
<v Speaker 4>I think there's three or four</v>
<v Speaker 4>ingredients in mind.</v>

717
00:30:31.381 --> 00:30:32.100
<v Speaker 4>You look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

718
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.210
<v Speaker 4>what it like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are those ingredients?</v>

719
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.670
<v Speaker 4>Water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pork,</v>

720
00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

721
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.060
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like celery,</v>

722
00:30:39.061 --> 00:30:40.230
<v Speaker 4>salt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

723
00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.760
<v Speaker 4>which is how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

724
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:44.460
<v Speaker 4>So problem is your bacon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you sat on a shelf,</v>

725
00:30:44.461 --> 00:30:46.230
<v Speaker 4>Nascar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oscar Meyer Bacon,</v>

726
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.870
<v Speaker 4>if you put them both on the same shelf</v>
<v Speaker 4>and sat for a week,</v>

727
00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.050
<v Speaker 4>Oscar Meyer will look the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Years would start to fall apart.</v>

728
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.520
<v Speaker 4>Mine would need to be frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

729
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.040
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the only thing fucking normal,</v>

730
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why do we think it's just going to</v>

731
00:30:58.561 --> 00:30:59.610
<v Speaker 4>sit around</v>

732
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.840
<v Speaker 5>and not fall apart at 39 degrees or</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever your refrigerator is.</v>

733
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:06.270
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not how it goes.</v>

734
00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.000
<v Speaker 4>Then the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the cancer thing and that,</v>

735
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:08.940
<v Speaker 4>and I get done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

736
00:31:08.941 --> 00:31:10.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that stuff was probably is linked to</v>

737
00:31:10.351 --> 00:31:12.870
<v Speaker 4>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they've pulled back on the red meat</v>

738
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.730
<v Speaker 4>in general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not sure about it.</v>

739
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.180
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think the study is skewed because</v>

740
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.480
<v Speaker 4>you talk about cancer and Ph.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

741
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.990
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grass fed beef has a neutral Ph,</v>

742
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.000
<v Speaker 4>corn fed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grain fed beef,</v>

743
00:31:27.001 --> 00:31:31.380
<v Speaker 4>that Ph goes up and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we know that cancer thrives in an</v>

744
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.870
<v Speaker 4>acidic environment environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

745
00:31:33.871 --> 00:31:36.870
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's other things that the cows that</v>

746
00:31:36.871 --> 00:31:40.470
<v Speaker 4>have a high acid guts basically is what</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

747
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.900
<v Speaker 4>They're more prone to acidosis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

748
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:45.360
<v Speaker 4>which needs more medication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need antibiotics.</v>

749
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:49.770
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's also a prime harbor for e coli.</v>

750
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:51.023
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

751
00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:51.541
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

752
00:31:51.541 --> 00:31:53.560
<v Speaker 4>I'll find a stat for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the Ecole I,</v>

753
00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:55.920
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was 6 million,</v>

754
00:31:55.921 --> 00:31:58.030
<v Speaker 4>300,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

755
00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.800
<v Speaker 4>milligrams per,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll look that up.</v>

756
00:32:01.801 --> 00:32:03.330
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll try back here and you guys talk.</v>

757
00:32:03.331 --> 00:32:04.440
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an important,</v>

758
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.111
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

759
00:32:05.111 --> 00:32:07.660
<v Speaker 5>Go ahead and look that up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's a very important point I</v>

760
00:32:07.661 --> 00:32:09.130
<v Speaker 5>think you're making about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

761
00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:12.400
<v Speaker 5>about how these animals that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>unhealthy,</v>

762
00:32:12.401 --> 00:32:14.620
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of unhealthy to eat an</v>
<v Speaker 5>unhealthy animal.</v>

763
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.700
<v Speaker 5>That seems logical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is one of the points that I found</v>

764
00:32:18.701 --> 00:32:22.810
<v Speaker 5>really interesting about about the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the documentary was how these guys spoke</v>

765
00:32:22.811 --> 00:32:23.850
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

766
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:28.240
<v Speaker 5>cattle aren't intended to eat and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't agree with Martin and corn.</v>

767
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:30.270
<v Speaker 5>It's corn and soybeans can agree with</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more.</v>

768
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:33.250
<v Speaker 5>That's why mine eat grass right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're eating here's taste very</v>

769
00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:34.180
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

770
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gave me a couple of rib eyes last</v>

771
00:32:36.971 --> 00:32:41.420
<v Speaker 5>time I took it home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were damn delicious and lean and a</v>

772
00:32:41.421 --> 00:32:44.840
<v Speaker 5>nice dark red meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's how account supposed to be</v>

773
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:49.010
<v Speaker 5>when you get these cows that when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>get beef from a store,</v>

774
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.310
<v Speaker 5>you're getting this really light red</v>
<v Speaker 5>meat.</v>

775
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.410
<v Speaker 5>It's very light,</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost like a pinkish meat.</v>

776
00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:56.440
<v Speaker 5>And you compare that to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like someone,</v>

777
00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.720
<v Speaker 5>one of the elk steaks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't back those elk steaks or like</v>

778
00:32:59.721 --> 00:33:03.080
<v Speaker 5>a red like got dark,</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost like a purple,</v>

779
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just fucking overflowing with</v>

780
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 5>testosterone and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

781
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 5>and an outcome or whatever the hell they</v>
<v Speaker 5>got in about us.</v>

782
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a healthy animal.</v>

783
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.280
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that animal is choosing to eat.</v>

784
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:17.620
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an elk is choosing,</v>

785
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.980
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's obviously a product of his</v>

786
00:33:18.981 --> 00:33:20.780
<v Speaker 5>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's eating what's available.</v>

787
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:22.820
<v Speaker 5>Just like a white tail deer is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember when,</v>

788
00:33:22.821 --> 00:33:25.580
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you and Brian were out and,</v>

789
00:33:25.581 --> 00:33:28.420
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think Brian held up one of the back</v>

790
00:33:28.421 --> 00:33:30.290
<v Speaker 5>straps and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

791
00:33:30.291 --> 00:33:34.850
<v Speaker 5>this is like Shashimi grade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

792
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.820
<v Speaker 5>And we cook that on your kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

793
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.960
<v Speaker 5>We just butter salt and garlic and we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

794
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.380
<v Speaker 5>we grilled up some of those and we were</v>
<v Speaker 5>all eating them going good Lord.</v>

795
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.620
<v Speaker 5>And it was from an animal that you shot</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

796
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.460
<v Speaker 5>three hours ago?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

797

<v Speaker 5>he's incredible.</v>

798
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:51.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To talk about fresh.</v>

799
00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.870
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do have that counter.</v>

800
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.100
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

801
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:56.740
<v Speaker 5>remember he's my numbers</v>

802
00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:01.520
<v Speaker 6>brought Nathan here to know the flight</v>
<v Speaker 6>information.</v>

803
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.600
<v Speaker 6>What's the hotel room?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What Time's the podcast?</v>

804
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:08.120
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is fun dog,</v>

805
00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:09.620
<v Speaker 6>but come on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've got a family bag.</v>

806
00:34:09.621 --> 00:34:10.160
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

807
00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.540
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so this is,</v>

808
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.880
<v Speaker 5>now we're talking cells per gram of</v>
<v Speaker 5>meat.</v>

809
00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:14.511
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

810
00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:18.380
<v Speaker 5>So in your grain fed the count of</v>
<v Speaker 5>eco-line,</v>

811
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.350
<v Speaker 5>the grain fed in the count of e coli,</v>
<v Speaker 5>6 million,</v>

812
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:26.440
<v Speaker 5>300,000 cells per gram and the grass fed</v>
<v Speaker 5>20,000 holy Shit.</v>

813
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.470
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's all about the environment that</v>

814
00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:35.000
<v Speaker 5>you're creating by what you're putting</v>
<v Speaker 5>into this thing.</v>

815
00:34:35.001 --> 00:34:37.700
<v Speaker 5>It's unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is unnatural.</v>

816

<v Speaker 5>I'm sharing a room with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

837

<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

838
00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.220
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was a weird experience.</v>

839
00:35:35.221 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 5>It was the first time I'd ever been a</v>
<v Speaker 5>place where like when I had</v>

840
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.550
<v Speaker 2>gone hunting before it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before that time,</v>

841
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:46.410
<v Speaker 2>it had only been in the wild in Missouri</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the breaks where there's no people</v>

842
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:51.730
<v Speaker 2>when we were in your area in Cazenovia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like everybody is so geared up for</v>

843
00:35:52.681 --> 00:35:54.280
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we stopped at that sporting good</v>

844
00:35:54.281 --> 00:35:57.210
<v Speaker 2>store and got tags and got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got some equipment,</v>

845
00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.240
<v Speaker 2>like everybody was rip rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raw and ready to go.</v>

846
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Like tomorrow is like the opening day of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a race.</v>

847
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:06.600
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A deer per second opening day in</v>

848
00:36:06.601 --> 00:36:09.720
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin is shot cheese here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Curse sex.</v>

849
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a testament to how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are.</v>

850
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.001
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

851
00:36:12.001 --> 00:36:14.880
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we read a statistic in about Minnesota</v>

852
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:18.060
<v Speaker 2>about how many car accidents or in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Minnesota was a Michigan,</v>

853
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michigan has 100,000 car accidents a</v>

854
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.860
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's from people hitting deer.</v>

855
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Just stop for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

856
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.150
<v Speaker 2>And you tell me you don't think they</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to kill some fucking deer.</v>

857
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.360
<v Speaker 2>There's 100,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that's the number I</v>

858
00:36:38.581 --> 00:36:41.520
<v Speaker 2>should probably like be careful if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep repeating it over and over a lot.</v>

859
00:36:41.521 --> 00:36:46.220
<v Speaker 2>So there's always a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>

860
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:51.950
<v Speaker 2>It was the number 50,000 I was so close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>80% of these crashes occur on two lane</v>

861
00:36:54.391 --> 00:36:58.260
<v Speaker 2>roads between dusk and dawn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50,000 what is the amount of uh,</v>

862
00:36:58.261 --> 00:37:00.930
<v Speaker 2>animals that kill people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

863
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.340
<v Speaker 2>here the states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2 million deer,</v>

864
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:10.020
<v Speaker 2>2 million deer in one fucking state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people are in Michigan?</v>

865
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not a whole lot more.</v>

866
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.350
<v Speaker 1>And I think in Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cattle out and other folks are dropping</v>

867
00:37:17.351 --> 00:37:18.184
<v Speaker 1>by the day with them.</v>

868
00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.140
<v Speaker 2>1.9 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

869
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:24.380
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are 20% dear.</v>

870
00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.850
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the reality.</v>

871
00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:33.170
<v Speaker 2>You literally could feed that entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>state of the deer population.</v>

872
00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:38.330
<v Speaker 2>That's real because one deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking eat a deer from months and</v>

873
00:37:38.331 --> 00:37:40.280
<v Speaker 2>one deer is going to make more than one</v>
<v Speaker 2>deer.</v>

874
00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:42.120
<v Speaker 2>I think that is</v>

875
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:45.050
<v Speaker 1>a really interesting point and it kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of goes along with it.</v>

876
00:37:45.051 --> 00:37:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Some of my agreement with these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

877
00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.960
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're subsidizing the dollar meal or</v>

878
00:37:50.961 --> 00:37:51.711
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

879
00:37:51.711 --> 00:37:53.260
<v Speaker 1>the dollar hamburger and,</v>

880
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:57.560
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that kind of like quick meet you</v>

881
00:37:57.561 --> 00:37:59.750
<v Speaker 2>drive through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the Burger and off you go.</v>

882
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

883
00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.990
<v Speaker 1>but I would advocate for is that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay with eating less meat.</v>

884
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had Michael Paul and he talked</v>

885
00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.850
<v Speaker 1>about eating less meat based on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers that they were using,</v>

886
00:38:11.851 --> 00:38:14.040
<v Speaker 1>which I think was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

887
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 0.6 something I think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they said on the movie.</v>

888
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:20.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like a half a half a pound of meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>a day.</v>

889
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was more than I was 0.6 something.</v>

890
00:38:23.251 --> 00:38:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

891
00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:26.970
<v Speaker 1>that's what the average American eats</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever done.</v>

892
00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Way more net balance that shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You bring the average up.</v>

893
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to think about the guys.</v>

894
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've</v>

895
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.020
<v Speaker 4>all seen these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

896
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.970
<v Speaker 4>Charlie chicken fingers and slobber</v>
<v Speaker 4>mcgee,</v>

897
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating fast food.</v>

898
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:44.320
<v Speaker 4>Everything is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've seen these guys eat right?</v>

899
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:47.350
<v Speaker 4>You're going to eat your finger dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One slow down</v>

900
00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:49.750
<v Speaker 4>food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

901
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.780
<v Speaker 4>That's what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what we're dealing with because</v>

902
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:55.090
<v Speaker 4>the real sickness isn't the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're raising meat.</v>

903
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.780
<v Speaker 4>It's the demand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

904
00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:01.660
<v Speaker 4>so farmers are rising to meet that</v>
<v Speaker 4>demand and people aren't demanding good</v>

905
00:39:01.661 --> 00:39:03.160
<v Speaker 4>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're demanding Shitty,</v>

906
00:39:03.161 --> 00:39:05.860
<v Speaker 4>cheap meat that they can buy for 99</v>
<v Speaker 4>cents.</v>

907
00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:06.360
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

908
00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.170
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that these folks were</v>
<v Speaker 2>addressing in that documentary that w w</v>

909
00:39:10.171 --> 00:39:13.260
<v Speaker 2>w w I think didn't get to the heart of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all,</v>

910
00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.890
<v Speaker 2>but the heart of it all really is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of human beings.</v>

911
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:19.770
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if there was only,</v>

912
00:39:19.771 --> 00:39:22.350
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Cazenovia was the world,</v>

913
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:24.930
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't need a fucking factory</v>
<v Speaker 2>farm.</v>

914
00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Sure it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't need it.</v>

915
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Cazenovia is essentially a sustainable</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

916
00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:33.180
<v Speaker 2>All you need is some solar power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some windmills for electricity.</v>

917
00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.910
<v Speaker 2>You got your own spring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got your water,</v>

918
00:39:35.911 --> 00:39:36.900
<v Speaker 2>you can get from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

919
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:40.410
<v Speaker 2>you got your cattle to graze that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have more than enough food for you.</v>

920
00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:44.250
<v Speaker 2>You could grow your own vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can don't have in the winter,</v>

921
00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:44.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we don't.</v>

922
00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.850
<v Speaker 2>You know what you want to last through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the winter and you're good,</v>

923
00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:50.470
<v Speaker 2>but we have too many God damn people,</v>

924
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that often comes down to people.</v>

925
00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:58.930
<v Speaker 4>Keep fucking then that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fan of it.</v>

926
00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.720
<v Speaker 4>Well I have three kids</v>

927
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:06.340
<v Speaker 2>so I should shut the fuck up because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

928
00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:08.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously making more people than I</v>
<v Speaker 2>am.</v>

929
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:10.570
<v Speaker 4>Oh boys are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all boys.</v>

930
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:11.404
<v Speaker 4>All girls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

931
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:14.590
<v Speaker 4>My best friend Gatlin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got five boys.</v>

932
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:16.330
<v Speaker 4>If five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one thing to have five kids,</v>

933
00:40:16.331 --> 00:40:18.570
<v Speaker 4>but to have them all be boys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like you're talking to,</v>

934
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:23.950
<v Speaker 4>they're just going to shoot just all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>land and make more boys.</v>

935
00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.640

946
00:40:53.471 --> 00:40:54.440
<v Speaker 4>suburbs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

947
00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be around that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sounded good.</v>

948
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.280
<v Speaker 4>Thank you for putting us down there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>

949
00:40:58.900 --> 00:40:59.733
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

950
00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:01.840
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

951
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.620
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's perfect.</v>

952
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.580
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a good place to,</v>

953
00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to come here people watch.</v>

954
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.430
<v Speaker 4>But one thing we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've been talking about a lot of,</v>

955
00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.890
<v Speaker 4>lot of awesome people and really digging</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeper into this,</v>

956
00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:15.400
<v Speaker 4>but there's guys like doug can expand on</v>
<v Speaker 4>this more because he's read more of the</v>

957
00:41:15.401 --> 00:41:16.001
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this guy,</v>

958
00:41:16.001 --> 00:41:18.690
<v Speaker 4>Mark Sheppard and other guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

959
00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:22.090
<v Speaker 4>people contend that that we can raise</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough food sustainably.</v>

960
00:41:22.091 --> 00:41:24.360
<v Speaker 4>But part of that equation is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

961
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:27.790
<v Speaker 4>and that's what maybe we could unify</v>
<v Speaker 4>with these guys like guys from</v>

962
00:41:27.791 --> 00:41:29.350
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

963
00:41:29.351 --> 00:41:31.810
<v Speaker 4>let's not talk about ending meet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an unachievable goal.</v>

964
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.880
<v Speaker 4>That's never going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's talk about educating people.</v>

965
00:41:34.881 --> 00:41:35.714
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

966
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.060
<v Speaker 4>let's not eat quite so much so we can</v>
<v Speaker 4>sustain.</v>

967
00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Just to play devil's advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of these guys are there.</v>

968
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.900
<v Speaker 2>They love of animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love animals or animal lovers.</v>

969
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:45.410
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

970
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:46.590
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like that.</v>

971
00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.880
<v Speaker 2>But they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do it in a way where they don't</v>

972
00:41:49.881 --> 00:41:52.190
<v Speaker 2>want animals to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want those animals to dive all the</v>

973
00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:53.380
<v Speaker 2>age only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

974
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:55.400
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem,</v>

975
00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:58.640
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an ideology attached to veganism</v>

976
00:41:58.641 --> 00:42:02.360
<v Speaker 2>where once they stop eating meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want everybody else to stop to,</v>

977
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:05.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about 95% of the world</v>

978
00:42:05.361 --> 00:42:07.610
<v Speaker 2>that he to meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 95%.</v>

979
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:10.520
<v Speaker 2>Something crazy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please always check my numbers</v>

980
00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:17.080
<v Speaker 2>off by 100% the day off to those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

981
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:22.430
<v Speaker 2>But you know that why if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if these guys,</v>

982
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.580
<v Speaker 2>this is to play devil's advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if these guys can stop eating meat and</v>

983
00:42:25.581 --> 00:42:27.440
<v Speaker 2>become vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't the world,</v>

984
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.080
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's what a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>were saying.</v>

985
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Well other things I would agree with</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

986
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:34.910
<v Speaker 2>I have a garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

987
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.760
<v Speaker 2>Grow some food on your balcony in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>

988
00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:41.240
<v Speaker 2>We have a couple of mutual friends who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are growing stuff on their balcony.</v>

989
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:42.853
<v Speaker 2>That's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

990
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:46.000
<v Speaker 2>Well I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing I noticed</v>

991
00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:51.620
<v Speaker 2>was dudes hydroponic system on the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tile was empty robotic system or</v>

992
00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:55.010
<v Speaker 2>homeless</v>
<v Speaker 2>picked up on.</v>

993
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:56.120
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

994
00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.860
<v Speaker 2>and we're not here to throw punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

995
00:42:57.861 --> 00:43:01.580
<v Speaker 2>It could have started it and they set it</v>
<v Speaker 2>up by some plants and put them in there</v>

996
00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:03.440
<v Speaker 2>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of my favorite stories is this</v>

997
00:43:03.441 --> 00:43:08.441
<v Speaker 2>former FBI agents who were retired and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were arrested because they were</v>

998
00:43:09.261 --> 00:43:12.740
<v Speaker 2>growing hydroponic plants and vegetables</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their basement.</v>

999
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:16.550
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dea passes by houses and they scan</v>

1000
00:43:16.551 --> 00:43:18.470
<v Speaker 2>these people bought hydroponic</v>
<v Speaker 2>equipment.</v>

1001
00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.950
<v Speaker 2>When you buy hydroponic equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they flag you and they follow you.</v>

1002
00:43:21.951 --> 00:43:26.951
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucking insane that growing</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables has become a crime because so</v>

1003
00:43:26.991 --> 00:43:29.570
<v Speaker 2>many people grow pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They assume that if you're growing a</v>

1004
00:43:29.571 --> 00:43:33.290
<v Speaker 2>plant with some sort of a plant system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you must be going an illegal drug.</v>

1005
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:36.740
<v Speaker 2>So with no evidence whatsoever to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking former FBI agents,</v>

1006
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:39.410
<v Speaker 2>they break down their door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns a blazing,</v>

1007
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:43.100
<v Speaker 2>and they arrest these people and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>find out their fucking grown tomatoes.</v>

1008
00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of a hot button deal going</v>

1009
00:43:45.431 --> 00:43:48.220
<v Speaker 4>on in Reedsburg right now were my home</v>
<v Speaker 4>town.</v>

1010
00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.340
<v Speaker 4>My Buddy Gatlin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I already mentioned him,</v>

1011

<v Speaker 4>he's in a successful appraiser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real estate appraiser,</v>

1013
00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.130
<v Speaker 4>but he's always looking for that home</v>
<v Speaker 4>run,</v>

<v Speaker 4>so he's making a living,</v>

1015
00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.180
<v Speaker 4>but he's taken his cuts and so now his</v>
<v Speaker 4>latest venture,</v>

1016
00:44:04.181 --> 00:44:06.550

<v Speaker 4>turned,</v>

1017
00:44:06.551 --> 00:44:08.830
<v Speaker 4>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this building that he couldn't lease</v>

1018
00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:13.000
<v Speaker 4>into a hydroponic wonderland and we'd</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1019
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:14.350
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and he wants to do a cbd oil extraction.</v>

1021

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1022
00:44:18.341 --> 00:44:19.810
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government's going to have to that</v>

1023
00:44:19.811 --> 00:44:20.351
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1024
00:44:20.351 --> 00:44:22.180
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you get these people walking by and</v>

1025

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:12.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we're all,</v>

1048
00:45:12.451 --> 00:45:15.330
<v Speaker 5>we're all in agreement with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's a guy named Ron Finley that</v>

1049
00:45:15.331 --> 00:45:19.110
<v Speaker 5>I had on before who was awesome and he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a proponent of urban gardening.</v>

1050
00:45:19.111 --> 00:45:22.520
<v Speaker 5>And what he does is he takes medians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you know that you just see grass</v>

1051
00:45:22.521 --> 00:45:26.100
<v Speaker 5>and the bullshit in an la genius.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He grows plants in them,</v>

1052
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:30.000
<v Speaker 5>he grows vegetables and foods and he</v>
<v Speaker 5>does it in a abandoned lots.</v>

1053
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:32.370
<v Speaker 5>He'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll set up gardens and abandoned lots</v>

1054
00:45:32.371 --> 00:45:34.020
<v Speaker 5>and he does it all throughout south</v>
<v Speaker 5>central.</v>

1055
00:45:34.021 --> 00:45:36.810
<v Speaker 5>And he has people that live in these</v>
<v Speaker 5>communities growing their own food.</v>

1056
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:39.210
<v Speaker 5>And he had this amazing point that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>never considered before.</v>

1057
00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.520
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you drive down this street and you see</v>

1058
00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:43.320
<v Speaker 5>bushes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see trees,</v>

1059
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:46.500
<v Speaker 5>you see all these plants and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 5>eat none of it.</v>

1060
00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.600
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're wasting water on shit.</v>

1061
00:45:48.601 --> 00:45:49.980
<v Speaker 5>We can't even eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1062
00:45:49.981 --> 00:45:53.160
<v Speaker 5>you could have food growing in the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>places.</v>

1063
00:45:53.161 --> 00:45:56.460
<v Speaker 5>You have all of these trees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why don't we do that?</v>

1064
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.710
<v Speaker 5>And I was sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why don't we do that?</v>

1065
00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:01.470
<v Speaker 5>I can talk about laws two longs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah,</v>

1066
00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:03.540
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>An orange tree looks great.</v>

1067
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:04.640
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's exactly right.</v>

1068
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.830
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Aesthetically pleasing on top of it all</v>

1069
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.260
<v Speaker 5>this said you to get him some of these</v>
<v Speaker 5>pictures.</v>

1070
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:14.540
<v Speaker 1>This Guy Mark Sheppard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's from our area and he doesn't know</v>

1071
00:46:14.541 --> 00:46:16.220
<v Speaker 1>me from the man in the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is his book,</v>

1072
00:46:16.221 --> 00:46:17.860
<v Speaker 1>rest restoration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture.</v>

1073
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:21.710
<v Speaker 1>A real world per permaculture for</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1074
00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:27.050
<v Speaker 1>aerial photographs of his farm art and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks exactly,</v>

1075
00:46:27.051 --> 00:46:29.180
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a landscape architect was</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

1076
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>layering of plants starting with the</v>

1077
00:46:31.881 --> 00:46:34.730
<v Speaker 1>tallest trees down to annual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So eventually,</v>

1078
00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time he's pastoring through</v>

1079
00:46:37.551 --> 00:46:38.620
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1080
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:40.610
<v Speaker 1>three and four different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

1081
00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're cleaning up the,</v>

1082
00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:44.630

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>

1084
00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.630
<v Speaker 1>they didn't hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is good enough.</v>

1085
00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:48.733
<v Speaker 1>Clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're nuts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Molson pub.</v>

1087
00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:55.750
<v Speaker 5>Unless you're in a weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people like dirty things.</v>

1088
00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.440
<v Speaker 5>Three get minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

1089
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm not buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was this is done.</v>

1090
00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.520
<v Speaker 5>So check that out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>

1091
00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.750
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's gorgeous.</v>

1092
00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:08.950
<v Speaker 5>And so this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it says new forest farm Mark Sheppard</v>

1093
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.830
<v Speaker 5>permit culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does it say the words abbreviated</v>

1094
00:47:11.831 --> 00:47:13.390
<v Speaker 5>there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Permacultural a pup pup.</v>

1095
00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:16.210
<v Speaker 5>Hipaa apprenticeship program.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he does his classes and stuff.</v>

1096
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:17.440
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's cool.</v>

1097
00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.570
<v Speaker 5>And the amount of food he can pull off</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Joe.</v>

1098
00:47:19.571 --> 00:47:20.141
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1099
00:47:20.141 --> 00:47:21.910
<v Speaker 5>and they graze that then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1100
00:47:21.911 --> 00:47:26.620
<v Speaker 5>and he talks about what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cows graze that V and pigs and chickens.</v>

1101
00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:28.840
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Ras in,</v>

1102
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:30.183
<v Speaker 5>he says</v>

1103
00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.840
<v Speaker 4>any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe doug can find this,</v>

1104
00:47:31.841 --> 00:47:34.480
<v Speaker 4>but I've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The amount of food he can grow on there.</v>

1105
00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.580
<v Speaker 4>And he talks about just how many</v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetables he's like,</v>

1106
00:47:36.581 --> 00:47:39.250
<v Speaker 4>but if you're only growing vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna have to mold this stuff.</v>

1107
00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.950
<v Speaker 4>So it makes sense to it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the whole thing.</v>

1108
00:47:41.951 --> 00:47:44.380
<v Speaker 4>You've got to complete the loop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to complete the cycle.</v>

1109
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:47.860
<v Speaker 4>You got to close that loop and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and find that he ecological harmony.</v>

1110
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:49.240
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the whole thing.</v>

1111
00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:51.400
<v Speaker 4>Two photos that go jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't go through those real quick right</v>

1112
00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:52.000
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

1113
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.610
<v Speaker 4>Make that bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1114
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:56.920
<v Speaker 4>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a little ponds in there too.</v>

1115
00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:00.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the cattle graze in the grass</v>

1116
00:48:00.161 --> 00:48:03.460
<v Speaker 4>area and then in between the grass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got trees that grow food.</v>

1117
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:05.070
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's beautiful too.</v>

1118
00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:08.020
<v Speaker 4>And then he brings the pigs chickens</v>
<v Speaker 4>through and this is near you.</v>

1119
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:13.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>viola or broke the real quick and go to</v>

1120
00:48:13.061 --> 00:48:14.980
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's a big fucking ice skating rink.</v>

1121
00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:17.050
<v Speaker 4>Frozen Tundra.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1122
00:48:17.051 --> 00:48:19.140
<v Speaker 4>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go and change his point</v>

1123
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:22.950
<v Speaker 1>being that when we grow one crop on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>farm,</v>

1124
00:48:22.951 --> 00:48:24.330
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corn,</v>

1125
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:26.880
<v Speaker 1>soybeans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organic or otherwise,</v>

1126
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:28.740
<v Speaker 1>or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>

1127
00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:32.490
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in our area in the winter,</v>

1128
00:48:32.491 --> 00:48:34.110
<v Speaker 1>then that's a desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1129
00:48:34.111 --> 00:48:36.060
<v Speaker 1>once the corner wants the beans come</v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

1130
00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.200
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1131
00:48:37.201 --> 00:48:38.880
<v Speaker 1>you saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deer come out into the field and</v>

1132
00:48:38.881 --> 00:48:40.230
<v Speaker 1>need a little bit of this stuff and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1133
00:48:40.231 --> 00:48:40.971
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And guys,</v>

1134
00:48:40.971 --> 00:48:44.370
<v Speaker 1>we'll pasture out on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it really does become a,</v>

1135
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:46.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of that one trick pony,</v>

1136
00:48:46.291 --> 00:48:49.230
<v Speaker 1>which to a certain degree vegetable</v>
<v Speaker 1>gardening we'll be as well,</v>

1137
00:48:49.231 --> 00:48:52.230
<v Speaker 1>although you can rotate crops through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1138
00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.530
<v Speaker 1>but like on my place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're growing livestock,</v>

1139
00:48:55.531 --> 00:48:57.480
<v Speaker 1>we're enriching the soil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

1140
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:58.343
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1141
00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:01.650
<v Speaker 1>our pastor is getting better all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time because we're not over pasturing in</v>

1142
00:49:01.651 --> 00:49:03.490
<v Speaker 1>any particular place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1143
00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:06.810
<v Speaker 1>there's carbon sequestering going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that mean?</v>

1144
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:08.100
<v Speaker 1>The carbon sequestering,</v>

1145
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.390
<v Speaker 4>the carbon in the soil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like I'm with composting and things</v>

1146
00:49:13.391 --> 00:49:14.230
<v Speaker 4>on those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1147
00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:15.820
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people can see on two out of the</v>

1148
00:49:15.821 --> 00:49:20.821
<v Speaker 4>APP contend that that cattle and proper</v>
<v Speaker 4>management in the pasture rotation that</v>

1149
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:25.240
<v Speaker 4>they can start to turn back the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the climate change,</v>

1150
00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:28.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by sequestering the carbon starting to</v>

1151
00:49:28.751 --> 00:49:29.950
<v Speaker 4>pull it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull it out.</v>

1152
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:33.000
<v Speaker 4>And we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we till and you know,</v>

1153
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.110
<v Speaker 4>the constant tillage is that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the,</v>

1154
00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:35.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a no,</v>

1155
00:49:35.891 --> 00:49:36.724
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1156
00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.820
<v Speaker 4>a lot of no tilling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of rotational grazing.</v>

1157
00:49:39.821 --> 00:49:41.500
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's up and up.</v>

1158
00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:42.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where we need to be</v>

1159
00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:49.960
<v Speaker 1>multiple benefits from one action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm pastoring and you saw some of the</v>

1160
00:49:50.301 --> 00:49:51.800
<v Speaker 1>pastures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the places where you hunted,</v>

1161
00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:55.520
<v Speaker 1>it was pasturing or there's wildlife in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and we've got good clean water.</v>

1162
00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.680
<v Speaker 1>When we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1163
00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:00.530
<v Speaker 1>went to a point on our farm where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't over pasturing and it was just</v>

1164
00:50:00.531 --> 00:50:01.730
<v Speaker 1>something that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1165
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:05.030
<v Speaker 1>we sort of learned the stream's real</v>
<v Speaker 1>wide.</v>

1166
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were over pasturing,</v>

1167
00:50:07.071 --> 00:50:08.420
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were really wide.</v>

1168
00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water was shallow and it was warm.</v>

1169
00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:16.280
<v Speaker 1>No trout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As time has gone by and we weren't over</v>

1170
00:50:16.281 --> 00:50:19.550
<v Speaker 1>pasturing anymore of those streams</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow up because it's running water</v>

1171
00:50:19.551 --> 00:50:22.100
<v Speaker 1>that's going to cut that and those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts to fill in.</v>

1172
00:50:22.101 --> 00:50:26.470
<v Speaker 1>The grass starts to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you stepped across a creek that used</v>

1173
00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.290
<v Speaker 1>to have to walk [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1174
00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:32.210
<v Speaker 1>so there's strout in there now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1175
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:35.300
<v Speaker 1>the catalog going in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're eating a certain amount of the</v>

1176
00:50:35.301 --> 00:50:36.000
<v Speaker 1>grass.</v>

1177
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we keep them,</v>

1178
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:42.160
<v Speaker 1>we keep moving them through a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of the grass or keeping some of</v>

1179
00:50:42.171 --> 00:50:45.320
<v Speaker 1>the invasive species down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A deer are still living in,</v>

1180
00:50:45.321 --> 00:50:47.240
<v Speaker 1>their songbirds are still living there</v>
<v Speaker 1>at game.</v>

1181
00:50:47.241 --> 00:50:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Birds are still living in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those things are happening and</v>

1182
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.200
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plants themselves are pulling the CEO</v>

1183
00:50:55.201 --> 00:50:55.641
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1184
00:50:55.641 --> 00:50:58.550
<v Speaker 1>the whole photosynthetic process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pulling that out and putting it back</v>

1185
00:50:58.551 --> 00:51:02.780
<v Speaker 1>into the ground where it belongs</v>
<v Speaker 1>to counteract some of that.</v>

1186
00:51:02.781 --> 00:51:05.240
<v Speaker 1>So Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm getting like three or four</v>

1187
00:51:05.241 --> 00:51:10.241
<v Speaker 1>different positive results from having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pasture know hickory orchard with some</v>

1188
00:51:11.751 --> 00:51:16.070
<v Speaker 1>bigger trees and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This dude with permaculture starts to</v>

1189
00:51:16.071 --> 00:51:19.940
<v Speaker 1>add multiple other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>layers of,</v>

1190
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:22.250
<v Speaker 1>so if you think about an acre of land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this table,</v>

1191
00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.180
<v Speaker 1>and if you're growing one crop on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one vegetable crop,</v>

1192
00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:28.820
<v Speaker 1>you've got an acre of land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>43,000,</v>

1193
00:51:28.821 --> 00:51:32.870
<v Speaker 1>560 square feet of that particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetable or that was groups of</v>

1194
00:51:32.871 --> 00:51:33.704
<v Speaker 1>vegetables.</v>

1195
00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:39.040
<v Speaker 1>But with the idea of permaculture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your upper layers,</v>

1196
00:51:39.261 --> 00:51:40.580
<v Speaker 1>trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big trees,</v>

1197
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:44.370
<v Speaker 1>big oak trees and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1198
00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might make of Hickory for hickory</v>

1199
00:51:47.661 --> 00:51:50.420
<v Speaker 1>nuts and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So short things and uh,</v>

1200
00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.150
<v Speaker 1>well to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the upper level,</v>

1201
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:57.230
<v Speaker 1>so on that same chunk of ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got this large tree,</v>

1202
00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:00.310
<v Speaker 1>it's producing wood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1203
00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:02.240
<v Speaker 1>looks like a good oak table here that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're leaning on.</v>

1204
00:52:02.241 --> 00:52:03.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same sort of thing.</v>

1205
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:05.840
<v Speaker 1>The next layer is the smaller trees like</v>
<v Speaker 1>app,</v>

1206
00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:07.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit trees and that sort of thing,</v>

1207
00:52:07.521 --> 00:52:10.240
<v Speaker 1>below that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>below that or are shrubs that are going</v>

1208
00:52:10.241 --> 00:52:11.390
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1209
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1210
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>service Berry,</v>

1211
00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:15.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chokeberry Rania,</v>

1212
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:16.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the,</v>

1213
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:18.270
<v Speaker 1>some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1214
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:22.740
<v Speaker 1>antioxidant producing fruits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1215
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:25.910
<v Speaker 1>and then you go down to the next layer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is going to be things like</v>

1216
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:29.240
<v Speaker 1>asparagus and rhubarb and keep coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1217
00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.850
<v Speaker 1>So now instead of just that one plane</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1218
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:34.940
<v Speaker 1>of plants growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got it on that same acre,</v>

1219
00:52:34.941 --> 00:52:39.860
<v Speaker 1>you've just grown multiple acres of food</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is just something that needs to</v>

1220
00:52:39.861 --> 00:52:43.520
<v Speaker 1>be thought about in the bigger thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's then rotating through four</v>

1221
00:52:43.521 --> 00:52:45.620
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running beef through it.</v>

1222
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not in there all the time</v>

1223
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:51.740
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it takes management after beef,</v>

1224
00:52:51.741 --> 00:52:54.710
<v Speaker 1>he's run and it's called a leader</v>
<v Speaker 1>follower grazing system.</v>

1225
00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after beef,</v>

1226
00:52:56.361 --> 00:52:59.450
<v Speaker 1>he's running pigs through it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigs are great cleanup animal.</v>

1227
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that comes turkeys in Turkeys or</v>

1228
00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:06.770
<v Speaker 1>cleaning up the grubs and whatnot in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit from the,</v>

1229
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:11.180
<v Speaker 1>from the cows and the pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He run sheep in it.</v>

1230
00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:14.120
<v Speaker 1>And last might be chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the intensity,</v>

1231
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:18.080
<v Speaker 1>the intensity of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of management is incredible.</v>

1232
00:53:18.081 --> 00:53:19.880
<v Speaker 1>And the amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1233
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:22.310
<v Speaker 1>layers of food that are coming off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1234
00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.980
<v Speaker 1>And then layers of acreage will suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting,</v>

1235
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:26.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his scenario,</v>

1236
00:53:26.731 --> 00:53:28.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting three or four benefits out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

1237
00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:30.390
<v Speaker 1>He's still getting all that carbon</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequestering and all that.</v>

1238
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now he's built that up to 10 or 12</v>

1239
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:37.230
<v Speaker 1>different positive results from the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1240
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:39.570
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is from a wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

1241
00:53:39.571 --> 00:53:41.700
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things that gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about all the time.</v>

1242
00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:44.760
<v Speaker 1>You grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your garden at home,</v>

1243
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I garden at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the one thing that every garden</v>

1244
00:53:47.251 --> 00:53:52.251
<v Speaker 1>that has wildlife around it has a fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to grow vegetables for a</v>

1245
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:55.920
<v Speaker 1>profit or for fun and put your effort</v>
<v Speaker 1>into it,</v>

1246
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:57.570
<v Speaker 1>you can put a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't put a fence around it,</v>

1247
00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.400
<v Speaker 1>you're going to exclude wildlife from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1248
00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:00.340
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1249
00:54:00.341 --> 00:54:03.850
<v Speaker 4>and that's one of the main contingents</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had when we sat down and were like,</v>

1250
00:54:03.851 --> 00:54:05.260
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be tough.</v>

1251
00:54:05.261 --> 00:54:09.370
<v Speaker 4>These guys put forth a really good</v>
<v Speaker 4>narrative and had some really</v>

1252
00:54:09.371 --> 00:54:11.830
<v Speaker 4>irrefutable facts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then one of the things we talked</v>

1253
00:54:11.831 --> 00:54:13.180
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the water talked about the acreage,</v>

1254
00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:15.790
<v Speaker 4>but the wildlife thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing that they said was,</v>

1255
00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:19.660
<v Speaker 4>and where these livestock or are living</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>

1256
00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:24.250
<v Speaker 4>that is area of void of wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I look at my pasture from the</v>

1257
00:54:24.251 --> 00:54:28.090
<v Speaker 4>soil microbes and worms to the bugs and</v>
<v Speaker 4>butterflies to the,</v>

1258
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:30.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>field mice and moles and we've got hawks</v>

1259
00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:32.740
<v Speaker 4>and we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we'd see a badger and a Fox.</v>

1260
00:54:32.741 --> 00:54:34.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1261
00:54:34.901 --> 00:54:35.734
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it had a very</v>

1262
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:38.070
<v Speaker 2>realistic point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't understand the wolves,</v>

1263
00:54:38.071 --> 00:54:39.800
<v Speaker 2>they didn't understand the management</v>
<v Speaker 2>roles.</v>

1264
00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:43.260
<v Speaker 2>They didn't understand that the reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>why they're starting to open up hunting</v>

1265
00:54:43.261 --> 00:54:46.320
<v Speaker 2>seasons on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they also didn't know that Idaho is</v>

1266
00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.240
<v Speaker 2>one of the most wildlife rich places in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country where people go and hunt elk</v>

1267
00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:52.620
<v Speaker 2>and mule deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1268
00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Idaho is fucking filled with animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they thought that Idaho is like,</v>

1269
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:57.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all farms now.</v>

1270
00:54:57.901 --> 00:54:59.070
<v Speaker 2>It's devoid of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

1271
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:04.320
<v Speaker 2>it's an idealized sort of Hippie vegan</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach,</v>

1272
00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:05.041
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1273
00:55:05.041 --> 00:55:06.990
<v Speaker 2>they're just leaning towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

1274
00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.670
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean they don't have great</v>
<v Speaker 2>points.</v>

1275
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.920
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1276
00:55:09.921 --> 00:55:11.750
<v Speaker 4>that's what we're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a tough,</v>

1277
00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:14.800
<v Speaker 4>it was a tough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tough thing to do to come out and,</v>

1278
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.610
<v Speaker 4>and be a counterpoint for something that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you agree with a lot of</v>

1279
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.570
<v Speaker 2>what their main bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of people,</v>

1280
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:24.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the factory farming thing.</v>

1281
00:55:24.001 --> 00:55:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about here.</v>

1282
00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:28.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's sustainable for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>population of Los Angeles.</v>

1283
00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:30.060
<v Speaker 2>And we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about here with this kind</v>

1284
00:55:30.061 --> 00:55:34.470
<v Speaker 2>of a farm man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would need a giant fucking farm like</v>

1285
00:55:34.471 --> 00:55:36.660
<v Speaker 2>that to feed Los Angeles.</v>

1286
00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Are a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of small,</v>

1287
00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:38.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1288
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:40.130
<v Speaker 2>a lot of small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low.</v>

1289
00:55:40.131 --> 00:55:45.131
<v Speaker 2>But you would mean so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much they produce in,</v>

1290
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:50.690
<v Speaker 2>if you compared in comparison to one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these gigantic factory farms.</v>

1291
00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1292
00:55:52.701 --> 00:55:53.960
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1293
00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.060
<v Speaker 1>my number guy isn't going to have those</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

1294
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:57.051
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one is,</v>

1295
00:55:57.051 --> 00:55:58.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the thing,</v>

1296
00:55:58.071 --> 00:56:00.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can keep going deeper and deeper with</v>

1297
00:56:00.021 --> 00:56:01.580
<v Speaker 2>this because people can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1298
00:56:01.581 --> 00:56:02.420
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1299
00:56:02.421 --> 00:56:04.130
<v Speaker 2>it's sustainable and Cazenovia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1300
00:56:04.131 --> 00:56:05.570
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this sustainable in Wisconsin?</v>

1301
00:56:05.571 --> 00:56:07.910
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the sustainable on the entire</v>

1302
00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:11.360
<v Speaker 2>eastern side of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>

1303
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what about,</v>

1304
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:14.610
<v Speaker 2>what if we can get the United States of</v>
<v Speaker 2>standable,</v>

1305
00:56:14.611 --> 00:56:15.820
<v Speaker 2>we'll still got India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1306
00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:16.663
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're fucked.</v>

1307
00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:17.601
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1308
00:56:17.601 --> 00:56:19.130
<v Speaker 2>you've got a billion people living in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

1309
00:56:19.131 --> 00:56:21.950
<v Speaker 2>a third the size of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do then?</v>

1310
00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.470
<v Speaker 2>Those numbers be wrong.</v>

1311
00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:28.030
<v Speaker 4>The big thing here is in the bigger</v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation,</v>

1312
00:56:28.031 --> 00:56:28.930
<v Speaker 4>I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1313
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:30.040
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's something that,</v>

1314
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.870
<v Speaker 4>gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that care should really,</v>

1315
00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:33.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she'll veganism and,</v>

1316
00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:35.450
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meeting,</v>

1317
00:56:35.451 --> 00:56:36.920
<v Speaker 4>eating aside and just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1318
00:56:36.921 --> 00:56:38.260
<v Speaker 4>how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do we make this work?</v>

1319
00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's education.</v>

1320
00:56:40.181 --> 00:56:44.380
<v Speaker 4>I think people need to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to understand that you can't just go</v>

1321
00:56:44.381 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 4>around eating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating meat.</v>

1322
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my Mama,</v>

1323
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:49.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Charlie's chicken fingers.</v>

1324
00:56:49.211 --> 00:56:51.310
<v Speaker 4>You can't be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you got to have a balanced diet and</v>

1325
00:56:51.311 --> 00:56:54.660
<v Speaker 4>you can't be eating pounds of me today</v>
<v Speaker 4>off,</v>

1326
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:55.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1327
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:57.840
<v Speaker 2>you probably shouldn't overeat with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we all agree if you've read</v>

1328
00:56:57.841 --> 00:56:59.550
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is um,</v>

1329
00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:01.830
<v Speaker 2>this is a different subject I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about,</v>

1330
00:57:01.831 --> 00:57:06.030
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about sustainability and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about feeding gigantic</v>

1331
00:57:06.031 --> 00:57:07.620
<v Speaker 2>swaths of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1332
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's what these factory farms have</v>
<v Speaker 2>set up.</v>

1333
00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:13.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the method of collecting</v>

1334
00:57:13.441 --> 00:57:15.540
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen from the oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1335
00:57:15.541 --> 00:57:18.180
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what from the air that the hopper method</v>

1336
00:57:18.181 --> 00:57:20.910
<v Speaker 2>that they invented in like the early 19</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds.</v>

1337
00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:23.550
<v Speaker 2>That's how they figured out how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>extract nitrogen.</v>

1338
00:57:23.551 --> 00:57:26.370
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gigantic population boom and sued.</v>

1339
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:30.180
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason why there's so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the world today.</v>

1340
00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:34.410
<v Speaker 2>This is widely accredited with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopper method of collecting nitrogen</v>

1341
00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:37.290
<v Speaker 2>because before that it was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to fertilize soil.</v>

1342
00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Once they figured out how to extract</v>
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen from the actual Ehr itself,</v>

1343
00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:45.540
<v Speaker 2>things got a little easier to grow food</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the population boomed.</v>

1344
00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:47.730
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of what we're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with here.</v>

1345
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.940
<v Speaker 2>What we're dealing with here is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1346
00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.140
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1347
00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:55.650
<v Speaker 2>what we talk about wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about the 50,000 car</v>

1348
00:57:55.651 --> 00:58:00.060
<v Speaker 2>accidents that are in Michigan every</v>
<v Speaker 2>year alone because of the over abundance</v>

1349
00:58:00.061 --> 00:58:02.430
<v Speaker 2>of deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is sort of what we're talking about</v>

1350
00:58:02.431 --> 00:58:04.800
<v Speaker 2>with human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have an over abundance of human</v>

1351
00:58:04.801 --> 00:58:05.634
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1352
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:09.720
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'm not suggesting we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive hunts on humans,</v>

1353
00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:13.680
<v Speaker 2>so turning to herd the herd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we would,</v>

1354
00:58:13.681 --> 00:58:16.080
<v Speaker 2>if we were some sort of an alien and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at,</v>

1355
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:17.850
<v Speaker 2>okay look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it this way.</v>

1356
00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:23.420
<v Speaker 2>If chimpanzees were overrunning Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like somehow or another chimpanzees like</v>

1357
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:28.080
<v Speaker 2>figured out how to get Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1358
00:58:28.081 --> 00:58:32.190
<v Speaker 2>they fucking swinging from tree to tree</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they moved in and started,</v>

1359
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:35.590
<v Speaker 2>it starts setting up shop and overriding</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place apart where people are getting</v>

1360
00:58:35.591 --> 00:58:38.940
<v Speaker 2>in car accidents with chimps and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would we kill them?</v>

1361
00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:42.390
<v Speaker 2>That would be very tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we would because chimps</v>

1362
00:58:42.391 --> 00:58:45.030
<v Speaker 2>are way fucking smarter than beer and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>liked smart shit.</v>

1363
00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:48.300
<v Speaker 2>So we wouldn't kill champs away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would kill deer.</v>

1364
00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:52.200
<v Speaker 2>So people obviously are smarter than</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people are smarter than chimp.</v>

1365
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:54.060
<v Speaker 2>I know some people that probably aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>smarter than chimps,</v>

1366
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:57.720
<v Speaker 2>but when it gets too intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>

1367
00:58:57.721 --> 00:59:00.330
<v Speaker 2>that's when we get weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like nobody gives a fuck if you kill a</v>

1368
00:59:00.331 --> 00:59:01.380
<v Speaker 2>bug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

1369
00:59:01.590 --> 00:59:05.910
<v Speaker 2>If mosquitoes contained Zika virus and</v>
<v Speaker 2>malaria and all this different shit,</v>

1370
00:59:05.911 --> 00:59:09.240
<v Speaker 2>you can kill mosquitoes all God damn day</v>
<v Speaker 2>long and for whatever reason,</v>

1371
00:59:09.241 --> 00:59:12.600
<v Speaker 2>nobody gives a fuck about mosquitoes</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we've all agreed that mosquitoes</v>

1372
00:59:12.601 --> 00:59:13.680
<v Speaker 2>are the enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1373
00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Mosquitoes contain malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Malaria has killed.</v>

1374
00:59:15.751 --> 00:59:16.980
<v Speaker 2>This is a number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it was real.</v>

1375
00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Malaria has killed 50% of all the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have died ever.</v>

1376
00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:21.890
<v Speaker 2>How that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1377
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.980
<v Speaker 2>So you've had again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50% of all the human beings that have</v>

1378
00:59:24.981 --> 00:59:27.860
<v Speaker 2>died ever in the history of people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>died from malaria.</v>

1379
00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:31.230
<v Speaker 2>How about them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Map</v>

1380
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Real Shit is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been fascinated with malaria for</v>

1381
00:59:36.201 --> 00:59:36.870
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've,</v>

1382
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:40.220
<v Speaker 2>I've read a lot of Shit on malaria and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had two friends that got malaria,</v>

1383

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's the blood of a carried eater.</v>

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.350

<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>

1401
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:23.420
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain level like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1402
01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:27.980
<v Speaker 2>if a up an aunt is on your food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times a Vegan will kill that</v>

1403
01:00:27.981 --> 01:00:29.420
<v Speaker 2>ant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do you do with the body?</v>

1404
01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:32.060
<v Speaker 2>You throw it to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd ignore it cause it's little,</v>

1405
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:35.090
<v Speaker 2>but don't you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just fucking killed an aunt in my</v>

1406
01:00:35.091 --> 01:00:36.890
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you went like that and brushed it</v>

1407
01:00:36.891 --> 01:00:38.240
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say a word.</v>

1408
01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.550
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug's doing some acceptable behavior.</v>

1409
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:43.670
<v Speaker 2>He killed an aunt that's on his pants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He dropped it on the ground.</v>

1410
01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.970
<v Speaker 2>But if a mouse ran across my kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stomped it and then ignored it.</v>

1411
01:00:46.971 --> 01:00:47.804
<v Speaker 2>I be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:52.310
<v Speaker 2>what is this fucking job hair you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>left?</v>

1413
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:55.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a weird hierarchy of living</v>

1414
01:00:55.281 --> 01:00:57.920
<v Speaker 2>things and the lion is clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1415
01:00:57.921 --> 01:00:59.660
<v Speaker 2>one of the lines is fellow mammals.</v>

1416
01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1417
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:05.030
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what to say about</v>

1418
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:06.190
<v Speaker 2>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1419
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:08.810
<v Speaker 2>but not rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck rats,</v>

1420
01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.880
<v Speaker 2>rats of the black plague and all kinds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1421
01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.080
<v Speaker 2>nobody gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you fucking kill a rat and your</v>

1422
01:01:15.081 --> 01:01:16.520
<v Speaker 2>garage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1423
01:01:16.521 --> 01:01:18.740
<v Speaker 2>if you're so hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not into killing rats.</v>

1424
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:20.800
<v Speaker 2>I've got a great rad story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your hairdresser,</v>

1425
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:27.140
<v Speaker 2>I was living in the hills and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rented this house and I had a real rat</v>

1426
01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:30.350
<v Speaker 2>problem to the point where I'd hear him</v>
<v Speaker 2>banging around inside the rafters.</v>

1427
01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:34.040
<v Speaker 2>There are big man like the hills around</v>
<v Speaker 2>Los Angeles.</v>

1428
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Los Angeles is a very strange place</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have this city and then you</v>

1429
01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:41.090
<v Speaker 2>have just outside the city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty abundant wildlife,</v>

1430
01:01:41.091 --> 01:01:43.580
<v Speaker 2>including coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of hawks.</v>

1431
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:48.290
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this a place that I lived had a rat</v>

1432
01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:51.230
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I set out a rat trap and,</v>

1433
01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I killed this fucking big ass rat,</v>

1434
01:01:53.691 --> 01:01:54.860
<v Speaker 2>like as big as my laptop.</v>

1435
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:55.940
<v Speaker 2>It was huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1436
01:01:55.941 --> 01:01:59.780
<v Speaker 2>It was no bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like body big fucker.</v>

1437
01:01:59.781 --> 01:02:01.510
<v Speaker 2>We gotta be real careful when you said</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1438
01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Definitely break one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1439
01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I set it out and I,</v>

1440
01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.000
<v Speaker 2>and I heard it in my kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

1441
01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:09.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1442
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got one.</v>

1443
01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:15.890
<v Speaker 2>And I went out there and I looked and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this big fucking like fat boy rat.</v>

1444
01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.360
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Geez,</v>

1445
01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:19.620
<v Speaker 2>look at the size of that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>

1446
01:02:19.621 --> 01:02:21.290
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning I'll get up and don't</v>

1447
01:02:21.291 --> 01:02:22.980
<v Speaker 2>kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put that thing in the garbage and</v>

1448
01:02:22.981 --> 01:02:24.780
<v Speaker 2>whenever and deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to sleep.</v>

1449
01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:27.120
<v Speaker 2>I got up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucker was gone.</v>

1450
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:32.070
<v Speaker 2>They ate him down to almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that was left is the tail.</v>

1451
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.470
<v Speaker 2>So rats apparently don't even like rat</v>
<v Speaker 2>tail,</v>

1452
01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.360
<v Speaker 2>but they had most of his body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rats had cannibalized most of his</v>

1453
01:02:39.361 --> 01:02:39.930
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

1454
01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:43.230
<v Speaker 2>That's why we say fuck rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1455
01:02:43.231 --> 01:02:45.030
<v Speaker 2>And if you see one red,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a dozen.</v>

1456
01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll eat.</v>

1457
01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:49.620
<v Speaker 2>My house was overrun with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really bad.</v>

1458
01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was real bad,</v>

1459
01:02:51.091 --> 01:02:52.890
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like one of the first places I</v>

1460
01:02:52.891 --> 01:02:54.600
<v Speaker 2>lived when I lived out here and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1461
01:02:54.601 --> 01:02:55.810
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I,</v>

1462
01:02:55.811 --> 01:02:59.400
<v Speaker 2>I had before that I lived in New York</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in new Rochelle and um,</v>

1463
01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:02.370
<v Speaker 2>my area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although New York City has a huge rat</v>

1464
01:03:02.371 --> 01:03:04.890
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York City's rat problem is crazy.</v>

1465
01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I parked my car once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's back in the days of phones,</v>

1466
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.110
<v Speaker 2>payphones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a cell phone.</v>

1467
01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:14.460
<v Speaker 2>I parked my car at this gas station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was getting some gas and I walked over</v>

1468
01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:19.440
<v Speaker 2>to the pay phone and as I'm on the phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw three rats jump up in my wheel</v>

1469
01:03:19.441 --> 01:03:23.850
<v Speaker 2>wells climb up over my tires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three big fat rats.</v>

1470
01:03:23.851 --> 01:03:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Like this place was overrun with rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were looking to move or something.</v>

1471
01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:30.490
<v Speaker 2>They say you see one ret,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1472
01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:33.180
<v Speaker 2>maybe check the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you see one,</v>

1473
01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:37.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's a hundred or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred or a thousand or something like</v>

1474
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:39.690

<v Speaker 2>rat?</v>

1477
01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:48.880

<v Speaker 2>people don't know.</v>

1481
01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Rats are hunters.</v>

1490
01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like their little lane prey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this rat has this pigeon by the neck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The pigeon tries to get away and the rat</v>

1494
01:04:38.551 --> 01:04:39.270

<v Speaker 5>this went down in the middle of the</v>

1596
01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.290
<v Speaker 5>night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You went outside cause I couldn't</v>

1597
01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:31.220
<v Speaker 5>believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never seen anything.</v>

<v Speaker 5>How many coyotes?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1599
01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.990
<v Speaker 5>based on he didn't see how many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was,</v>

1600
01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:37.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1601
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:39.650
<v Speaker 5>they work in groups of two or three or</v>
<v Speaker 5>four or five.</v>

1602
01:08:40.230 --> 01:08:41.710
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they were right.</v>

1603
01:08:41.730 --> 01:08:42.800
<v Speaker 5>They had me right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1604
01:08:42.801 --> 01:08:46.580
<v Speaker 5>I have a chicken coop in my yard and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went out in the middle of the night to</v>

1605
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:49.790
<v Speaker 5>shut the coop because I let the chickens</v>
<v Speaker 5>out and they wander around and I closed</v>

1606
01:08:49.791 --> 01:08:51.140
<v Speaker 5>the coop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1607
01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:53.930
<v Speaker 5>when I closed the coop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just outside enjoying the piece,</v>

1608
01:08:53.931 --> 01:08:54.920
<v Speaker 5>looking up at the stars.</v>

1609
01:08:55.310 --> 01:09:00.260
<v Speaker 5>And I heard these deer running,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like running full clip.</v>

1610
01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:02.030
<v Speaker 5>And then something was chasing after</v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

1611
01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.310
<v Speaker 5>full clip,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was dark and my eyes hadn't</v>

1612
01:09:04.311 --> 01:09:06.350
<v Speaker 5>adjusted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I was trying to figure out what the</v>

1613
01:09:06.351 --> 01:09:09.610
<v Speaker 5>fuck was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But these deer were running and this is</v>

1614
01:09:09.611 --> 01:09:11.890
<v Speaker 5>something was chasing them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I saw,</v>

1615
01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:14.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure it was a coyote,</v>

1616
01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:16.160
<v Speaker 5>but it could have been an outline.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I saw,</v>

1617
01:09:16.210 --> 01:09:19.160
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw what looked like the silhouette of</v>

1618
01:09:19.161 --> 01:09:21.410
<v Speaker 5>a coyote on the top of this hill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>this is so wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>right there.</v>

1625
01:09:38.601 --> 01:09:41.600
<v Speaker 5>These coyotes are chasing down these</v>
<v Speaker 5>deer because there's a,</v>

1626
01:09:41.601 --> 01:09:44.990
<v Speaker 5>there's a series of oak trees down the</v>
<v Speaker 5>street from my house where these deer</v>

1627
01:09:44.991 --> 01:09:45.824
<v Speaker 5>tend to bed.</v>

1628
01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:47.360
<v Speaker 5>I see them there all the time and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1629
01:09:47.361 --> 01:09:48.950
<v Speaker 5>probably like five or six of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1630
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:49.941
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1631
01:09:49.941 --> 01:09:53.060
<v Speaker 5>you'll see coyotes especially come</v>
<v Speaker 5>spring,</v>

1632
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:55.310
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when the phones are being born,</v>

1633
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:58.670
<v Speaker 5>you see these fuckers hanging around</v>
<v Speaker 5>just looking for an easy meal.</v>

1634
01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:01.550
<v Speaker 5>You know guys who raise cattle around</v>
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

1635

<v Speaker 5>and I don't know Nathan if you know</v>

1636
01:10:03.621 --> 01:10:05.100
<v Speaker 5>anything about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

1637
01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:09.140
<v Speaker 5>to my knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never had a calf taken by a cop by</v>

1638
01:10:09.141 --> 01:10:12.740
<v Speaker 5>coyotes or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have had a calf that was born and</v>

1639
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:15.770
<v Speaker 5>died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was stillborn or something that</v>

1640
01:10:15.771 --> 01:10:18.470
<v Speaker 5>wasn't there the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Coyote's took it.</v>

1641
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:20.270
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>call abandon it too.</v>

1642
01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:22.250
<v Speaker 5>The one thing that you do not want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>mess with,</v>

1643
01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:26.210
<v Speaker 5>it was a 1,450 pound Herford cow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just had a calf.</v>

1644
01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:26.691
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1645
01:10:26.691 --> 01:10:30.110
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine is not going to let you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're that guy get kicked by a cow.</v>

1646
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.420
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've only had pigs and chickens tagging</v>

1647
01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:35.510
<v Speaker 5>and that's the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The dogs like we forget and leave the</v>

1648
01:10:35.511 --> 01:10:38.840
<v Speaker 5>dogs in for the night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A pig lit or an actual whole piglet.</v>

1649
01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:41.450
<v Speaker 5>Piglet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A full grown pig would probably,</v>

1650
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:44.510
<v Speaker 5>especially if there's more than one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they take care of themselves.</v>

1651
01:10:44.511 --> 01:10:47.110
<v Speaker 5>They're vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got her to one of my pig's ears.</v>

1652
01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:49.010
<v Speaker 5>I mean if I were to fall down and my pig</v>
<v Speaker 5>pen,</v>

1653
01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:52.230
<v Speaker 5>you'd be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if I couldn't get up there,</v>

1654
01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.710
<v Speaker 5>my wife would come home and there'd be</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing left to me.</v>

1655
01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:56.270
<v Speaker 5>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>four pigs would have to be done.</v>

1656
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:57.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's real.</v>

1657
01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.110
<v Speaker 5>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the number one.</v>

1658
01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:04.110
<v Speaker 5>Here's more statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it's your number.</v>

1659
01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:07.440
<v Speaker 5>The number 1% of people that have died</v>
<v Speaker 5>is another one.</v>

1660
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:09.440
<v Speaker 5>Number one animal that kills people on</v>
<v Speaker 5>farms.</v>

1661
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:10.880
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pigs.</v>

1662
01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:13.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People fall like sometimes like an old</v>

1663
01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:17.880
<v Speaker 5>farmer will have a heart attack and fall</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the pigsty and they just gobble</v>

1664
01:11:17.881 --> 01:11:18.440
<v Speaker 5>them up.</v>

1665
01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.820
<v Speaker 5>I for the first time I actually saw it</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my pigs,</v>

1666
01:11:20.821 --> 01:11:22.040
<v Speaker 5>eat a chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 5>please google it.</v>

1667
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:24.330
<v Speaker 5>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't save the chicken and time.</v>

1668
01:11:24.331 --> 01:11:25.440
<v Speaker 5>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what am I going to do?</v>

1669
01:11:25.441 --> 01:11:27.150
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to save a half mangled</v>
<v Speaker 5>chicken,</v>

1670
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I let him finish it,</v>

1671
01:11:29.641 --> 01:11:32.970
<v Speaker 5>but they systematically cornered the</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing and I'm running over and try it.</v>

1672
01:11:32.971 --> 01:11:35.460
<v Speaker 5>And then it was over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was too many coyote take a chicken</v>

1673
01:11:35.461 --> 01:11:36.840
<v Speaker 5>from my yarn or watching a hop the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fence,</v>

1674
01:11:36.841 --> 01:11:38.850
<v Speaker 5>but it's in its mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was crazy.</v>

1675
01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:42.900
<v Speaker 5>And I was going to kill the fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then I realized it was a female and</v>

1676
01:11:42.901 --> 01:11:45.840
<v Speaker 5>then it had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it had cubs like a lot of the typing and</v>

1677
01:11:45.841 --> 01:11:48.690
<v Speaker 5>hollering that you hear like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like people think there's a lot of</v>

1678
01:11:48.691 --> 01:11:51.780
<v Speaker 5>misconceptions about coyotes and one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>them is that when you ever hear that</v>

1679
01:11:51.781 --> 01:11:53.380
<v Speaker 5>that there's like some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a party,</v>

1680
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:55.860
<v Speaker 5>a lot of it is a mother,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1681
01:11:55.861 --> 01:11:56.850
<v Speaker 5>communicating with her young.</v>

1682
01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:58.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1683
01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:01.560
<v Speaker 5>I was pretty sure that this was hat what</v>
<v Speaker 5>happened because my dog had let this</v>

1684
01:12:01.561 --> 01:12:06.210
<v Speaker 5>female near the chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the dog had like it was sort of</v>

1685
01:12:06.211 --> 01:12:08.730
<v Speaker 5>like aided and abetted this coyote</v>
<v Speaker 5>killing this,</v>

1686
01:12:08.731 --> 01:12:09.990
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this chicken.</v>

1687
01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:11.160
<v Speaker 5>And then I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1688
01:12:11.161 --> 01:12:15.420
<v Speaker 5>this is a female that has babies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's where your soft spot.</v>

1689
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you hear that sound though,</v>

1690
01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean when my wife first moved to our</v>
<v Speaker 5>farm,</v>

1691
01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:26.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean it sounds like there are a pack</v>
<v Speaker 5>of children being murdered and it was</v>

1692
01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:30.090
<v Speaker 5>still night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like all where we are and it just</v>

1693
01:12:30.091 --> 01:12:31.740
<v Speaker 5>resonates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>

1694
01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:35.850
<v Speaker 5>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a relatively new friend out in</v>

1695
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:40.920
<v Speaker 5>Washington who has actually been</v>
<v Speaker 5>emailing me and asking me for advice</v>

1696
01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:45.120
<v Speaker 5>about a coyotes trapping coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You knew when you think about trapping</v>

1697
01:12:45.121 --> 01:12:50.121
<v Speaker 5>cocktail Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he rep recommend sub sonic 22 is when I</v>

1698
01:12:52.930 --> 01:12:54.710
<v Speaker 5>trapping wildlife colleges.</v>

1699
01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.280
<v Speaker 5>I know in Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1700
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:58.980
<v Speaker 5>when people would start to talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk to them about,</v>

1701
01:12:59.130 --> 01:13:01.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to get rid of the sea animal</v>

1702
01:13:01.651 --> 01:13:04.260
<v Speaker 5>or whatever happened to make a woodchuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>or something like that,</v>

1703
01:13:04.261 --> 01:13:07.140
<v Speaker 5>he would always recommend a small piece</v>
<v Speaker 5>of land at a very high velocity.</v>

1704
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's what a buddy of mine does.</v>

1705
01:13:11.131 --> 01:13:13.770
<v Speaker 5>He sets out cat food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he puts cat food.</v>

1706
01:13:13.771 --> 01:13:15.960
<v Speaker 5>He leaves these coyotes that we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>targeting is dogs.</v>

1707
01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:21.260
<v Speaker 5>So we would set out plates of cat food</v>
<v Speaker 5>and sit on his balcony and just wait and</v>

1708
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:24.270
<v Speaker 5>call him into yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can call with Predator calls,</v>

1709
01:13:24.271 --> 01:13:26.180
<v Speaker 5>but that you might call them some other</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit too.</v>

1710
01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:30.480
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about this yesterday</v>

1711
01:13:30.481 --> 01:13:31.314
<v Speaker 5>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1712
01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.980
<v Speaker 5>they just did this study of all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>different mountain mines that they've</v>

1713
01:13:34.981 --> 01:13:36.870
<v Speaker 5>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's some more numbers.</v>

1714
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:39.840
<v Speaker 5>I think they killed like a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 5>mountain lions in the San Francisco</v>

1715
01:13:39.841 --> 01:13:41.490
<v Speaker 5>area,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in northern California area.</v>

1716
01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:42.811
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1717
01:13:42.811 --> 01:13:44.400
<v Speaker 5>out of these mountain lions that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>killed,</v>

1718
01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:48.330
<v Speaker 5>most of them had cats and dogs in their</v>
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>

1719
01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:50.910
<v Speaker 5>That's a finding out that this is what</v>
<v Speaker 5>these things are eating.</v>

1720
01:13:50.911 --> 01:13:53.760
<v Speaker 5>Only 5% of them had deer in their body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1721
01:13:53.761 --> 01:13:56.670
<v Speaker 5>it's easier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's bizarre.</v>

1722
01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:57.953
<v Speaker 5>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1723
01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:00.180

<v Speaker 5>town.</v>

1727

1750
01:15:00.090 --> 01:15:02.930
<v Speaker 2>the stuffed animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the coyote has a fucking cat and its</v>

<v Speaker 2>mouth and it's on someone's porch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to at home.</v>

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a national history.</v>

1757
01:15:17.451 --> 01:15:19.820
<v Speaker 2>it's killing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the entire museum,</v>

1758
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.210
<v Speaker 2>this is the animal that's killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was the notes from the,</v>

1759
01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:25.710
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

1760
01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:27.470
<v Speaker 2>museum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized that that was it.</v>

1761
01:15:27.471 --> 01:15:28.880
<v Speaker 2>You had written that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1762
01:15:28.881 --> 01:15:29.930
<v Speaker 2>See if they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying,</v>

1763
01:15:29.931 --> 01:15:32.220
<v Speaker 2>fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1764
01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.920
<v Speaker 2>but look what these people are saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this guy.</v>

1765
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:36.320
<v Speaker 2>My cat was just killed by one of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuckers.</v>

1766
01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:39.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll shoot a coyote for no reason other</v>

1767
01:15:39.241 --> 01:15:41.300
<v Speaker 2>than it's a coyote fuck a coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1768
01:15:41.301 --> 01:15:42.021
<v Speaker 2>And they were right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1769
01:15:42.021 --> 01:15:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Those are a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little creepers,</v>

1770
01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:46.200
<v Speaker 2>little creepers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

1771
01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it say?</v>

1772
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Swine likely kill fewer people than</v>
<v Speaker 2>cattle do,</v>

1773
01:15:51.231 --> 01:15:52.970
<v Speaker 2>but there's no reliable data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1774
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:54.860
<v Speaker 2>20 people a year killed by cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It said,</v>

1775
01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:56.090
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1776
01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:58.940
<v Speaker 2>find out how many people killed by pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't find any but one story</v>

1777
01:15:58.941 --> 01:16:00.590
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mm hmm.</v>

1778
01:16:00.710 --> 01:16:03.380
<v Speaker 4>One guy in Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would guess that that number is a</v>

1779
01:16:03.381 --> 01:16:04.310
<v Speaker 4>little bit higher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1780
01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:05.480
<v Speaker 4>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

1781
01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.393
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1782
01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:07.870
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1783
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:12.430
<v Speaker 4>Two people have been killed by bowls or</v>
<v Speaker 4>bowls is especially solitary bulls.</v>

1784
01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:14.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1785
01:16:14.051 --> 01:16:15.670
<v Speaker 4>the old expression is you fuck with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bull,</v>

1786
01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:18.000
<v Speaker 4>you get the horn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine that was,</v>

1787
01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:21.430
<v Speaker 4>I was milking for a farmer one time and</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1788
01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:23.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things with dairy farming and</v>

1789
01:16:23.381 --> 01:16:24.970
<v Speaker 4>I grew up dairy farming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1790
01:16:24.971 --> 01:16:27.790
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if a cow has a stepdown teat that's,</v>

1791
01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:29.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we usually say tit,</v>

1792
01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:29.913
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're on the,</v>

1793
01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.180
<v Speaker 4>I guess it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1794
01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:34.930
<v Speaker 4>but they have stepped on time to clean</v>
<v Speaker 4>it up or they get mastitis,</v>

1795
01:16:34.931 --> 01:16:37.090
<v Speaker 4>which is a sort of infection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1796
01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.700
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very sore obviously.</v>

1797
01:16:39.730 --> 01:16:41.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you gotta you gotta,</v>

1798
01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strap up the milker and not put it on</v>

1799
01:16:44.771 --> 01:16:45.790
<v Speaker 4>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was in a hurry.</v>

1800
01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:48.310
<v Speaker 4>I was late for my other job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm trying to hurry and I forgot</v>

1801
01:16:48.311 --> 01:16:50.470
<v Speaker 4>about this one column.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's cows didn't go in the right</v>

1802
01:16:50.471 --> 01:16:52.420
<v Speaker 4>stall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so my head wasn't where it needed to be.</v>

1803
01:16:52.421 --> 01:16:53.710
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put the,</v>

1804
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:58.330
<v Speaker 4>I put the milker on the bad tit and she</v>
<v Speaker 4>kicked me so hard.</v>

1805
01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:02.710
<v Speaker 4>She kicked me in the face and then I</v>
<v Speaker 4>flew back into the metal post.</v>

1806
01:17:03.130 --> 01:17:05.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was out for good 20 minutes,</v>

1807
01:17:05.381 --> 01:17:06.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you wake up in a daze.</v>

1808
01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:09.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's one example of how somebody</v>

1809
01:17:09.471 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 4>could</v>

1810
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:12.530
<v Speaker 2>easily be killed by a car or you were so</v>
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>

1811
01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:16.100
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do is fall and once dumps you and</v>

1812
01:17:16.101 --> 01:17:16.934
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

1813
01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1814
01:17:18.021 --> 01:17:19.720
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to the calving thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1815
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:21.380
<v Speaker 1>our neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who I used to,</v>

1816
01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:23.540
<v Speaker 1>while he still does some farming for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1817
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:25.620
<v Speaker 1>for us to cuts and rakes and bales or</v>
<v Speaker 1>hay,</v>

1818
01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:28.160
<v Speaker 1>it was almost killed by a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1819
01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car would just fresh and just had a</v>

1820
01:17:31.131 --> 01:17:33.650
<v Speaker 1>calf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went in there to deal with the</v>

1821
01:17:33.651 --> 01:17:37.070
<v Speaker 1>calf and she got him into a corner and</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat the snot out of him.</v>

1822
01:17:37.071 --> 01:17:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Eventually he was able to crawl out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get under a gate.</v>

1823
01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.910
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't normally a very nice</v>

1824
01:17:43.911 --> 01:17:44.840
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1825
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1826
01:17:46.551 --> 01:17:51.140
<v Speaker 1>so it's funny to tell that story when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been sending you all this shit</v>

1827
01:17:51.141 --> 01:17:52.450
<v Speaker 1>about how nice my cows aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

1828
01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:55.780
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1829
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:58.910
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about that because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>said that when we were around your cows,</v>

1830
01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.530
<v Speaker 2>they fucking panic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they ran off.</v>

1831
01:18:00.531 --> 01:18:03.200
<v Speaker 2>But you brought up an important point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were shooting squirrels.</v>

1832
01:18:04.450 --> 01:18:05.890
<v Speaker 2>They're shooting pigeons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

1833
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:08.540
<v Speaker 2>we had shot anything yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a lot of you though too?</v>

1834
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:10.850
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few fewer guys,</v>

1835
01:18:10.851 --> 01:18:13.640
<v Speaker 2>four guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian Count might have been singing</v>

1836
01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:16.390
<v Speaker 2>loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was singing and you guys smelled</v>

1837
01:18:16.391 --> 01:18:19.160
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I definitely don't let strangers</v>

1838
01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:20.270
<v Speaker 2>in with mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1839
01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:21.580
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1840
01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:24.930
<v Speaker 1>What happened that day is what it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of different things that</v>

1841
01:18:24.931 --> 01:18:26.430
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

1842
01:18:26.431 --> 01:18:29.940
<v Speaker 1>factually you were correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened was is you went into their</v>

1843
01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.500
<v Speaker 1>pasture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they weren't out in pasture.</v>

1844
01:18:31.501 --> 01:18:34.620
<v Speaker 1>We had them in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a corral barn yard because we'd been</v>

1845
01:18:34.621 --> 01:18:37.260
<v Speaker 1>hunting and I didn't want him out on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pasture where they would be and that</v>

1846
01:18:37.261 --> 01:18:39.510
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1847
01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:43.830
<v Speaker 1>there is that video of that and you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you guys are walking in,</v>

1848
01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:46.650
<v Speaker 1>and I never even thought about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Joe was like,</v>

1849
01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:49.290
<v Speaker 1>I should probably go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cattle would be a little calmer if</v>

1850
01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1851
01:18:50.970 --> 01:18:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I was afraid that Brian was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall through the floor.</v>

1852
01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:57.200
<v Speaker 1>It's shown email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's where you can buy it.</v>

1853
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:59.880
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to throw rocks too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1854
01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:02.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you're walking out there,</v>

1855
01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:05.310
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all turn and look at you as you're</v>

1856
01:19:05.311 --> 01:19:07.470
<v Speaker 1>walking in because that's on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that outtake.</v>

1857
01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.770
<v Speaker 1>And then when you start shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all down in the corner.</v>

1858
01:19:11.130 --> 01:19:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Being very in a defensive position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the analogy I think I use to you is</v>

1859
01:19:15.991 --> 01:19:20.991
<v Speaker 1>imagine you're at home having dinner and</v>
<v Speaker 1>four dudes walk into your house with</v>

1860
01:19:22.561 --> 01:19:26.730
<v Speaker 1>cameras and guns talking loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing their whole thing and,</v>

1861
01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:29.910
<v Speaker 1>and then they start shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guessing you're going to probably go to</v>

1862
01:19:29.911 --> 01:19:30.780
<v Speaker 1>a corner of the house.</v>

1863
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no defensive position at once.</v>

1864
01:19:33.171 --> 01:19:35.340
<v Speaker 2>The shooting started happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1865
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just pulled this up.</v>

1866
01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.570
<v Speaker 2>There was more people were killed by</v>
<v Speaker 2>pigs in 2014 than were killed by sharks.</v>

1867
01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Sharks get a bad rap last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1868
01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:49.781
<v Speaker 2>it says there were 12 fatal pig attacks</v>
<v Speaker 2>worldwide versus 10 shark fatalities.</v>

1869
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:52.450
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

1870
01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:55.460
<v Speaker 2>Different stats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess different websites on Pharma</v>

1871
01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:59.210
<v Speaker 2>specific by that might've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1872
01:19:59.290 --> 01:20:01.190
<v Speaker 2>I think they're talking about wild pigs</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

1873
01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:02.323
<v Speaker 2>which I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1874
01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Well that many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking creepers though.</v>

1875
01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever been around wild pigs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually have not,</v>

1876
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:09.630
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in home ranch with Rinella and we</v>

1877
01:20:09.631 --> 01:20:12.630
<v Speaker 2>were walking down this road and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>pig hunting and we got close to these</v>

1878
01:20:12.631 --> 01:20:15.840
<v Speaker 2>pigs and they didn't know we were there</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's really thick brush and</v>

1879
01:20:15.841 --> 01:20:18.480
<v Speaker 2>grasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we heard them fighting and they were</v>

1880
01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:22.430
<v Speaker 2>less than 20 yards away and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to war.</v>

1881
01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.590
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are demons,</v>

1882
01:20:25.591 --> 01:20:26.730
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fucking demons.</v>

1883
01:20:26.731 --> 01:20:28.680
<v Speaker 2>They sound like monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This sound like something from the Lord</v>

1884
01:20:28.681 --> 01:20:32.640
<v Speaker 2>of the rings</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're attacking each other for</v>

1885
01:20:32.641 --> 01:20:34.560
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right there.</v>

1886
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:35.221
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1887
01:20:35.221 --> 01:20:38.580
<v Speaker 2>there's fucking creepy things when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're giant tusks and they're black</v>

1888
01:20:38.581 --> 01:20:41.240
<v Speaker 2>hair and that they look like demons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1889
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:43.830
<v Speaker 2>And they sound crazy to hear one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd go,</v>

1890
01:20:43.831 --> 01:20:44.664
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1891
01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how the king and the game of</v>

1892
01:20:46.831 --> 01:20:48.210
<v Speaker 2>thrones died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember?</v>

1893
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever watch that show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you?</v>

1894
01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:51.710
<v Speaker 2>How dare you say no?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1895
01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.340
<v Speaker 2>he was killed by a boar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wild boar.</v>

1896
01:20:53.341 --> 01:20:54.174
<v Speaker 2>Spoiler.</v>

1897
01:20:56.710 --> 01:20:57.543
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

1898
01:20:58.730 --> 01:21:00.030
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to doug,</v>

1899
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:02.700
<v Speaker 2>he dies quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does early in the show.</v>

1900
01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:03.540
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1901
01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:05.070
<v Speaker 2>but he was killed by a wild boar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1902
01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:06.570
<v Speaker 2>that's not uncommon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1903
01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:08.430
<v Speaker 2>they're big animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1904
01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:10.590
<v Speaker 2>They get real big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>

1905
01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:12.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going out to,</v>

1906
01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:16.590
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to feel well that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>there had very different animal.</v>

1907
01:21:16.591 --> 01:21:18.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deer have killed people.</v>

1908
01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:19.920
<v Speaker 2>It has happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just car accidents,</v>

1909
01:21:19.921 --> 01:21:22.110
<v Speaker 2>but they have gord people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has happened.</v>

1910
01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.690
<v Speaker 2>It is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare,</v>

1911
01:21:24.691 --> 01:21:25.890
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It usually they just want to get the</v>

1912
01:21:25.891 --> 01:21:28.350
<v Speaker 2>fuck away from him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1913
01:21:28.351 --> 01:21:30.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wild.</v>

1914
01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:32.850
<v Speaker 2>They're animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't play by our rules.</v>

1915
01:21:32.851 --> 01:21:36.060
<v Speaker 2>And I think we have a real problem in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this world with our idea of what an</v>

1916
01:21:36.061 --> 01:21:37.050
<v Speaker 2>animal is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1917
01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.270
<v Speaker 2>we anthropomorphize these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think of,</v>

1918
01:21:39.271 --> 01:21:40.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm the same way we think about our</v>
<v Speaker 2>pets.</v>

1919
01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.340
<v Speaker 2>When you have a dog and you think of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your dog the same way you think of a</v>

1920
01:21:44.341 --> 01:21:45.720
<v Speaker 2>wild bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1921
01:21:45.721 --> 01:21:47.220
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're playing on some fucking</v>

1922
01:21:47.221 --> 01:21:49.950
<v Speaker 2>completely different fields.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have completely different rule</v>

1923
01:21:49.951 --> 01:21:51.330
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1924
01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:53.490
<v Speaker 2>and we'd like to think that we're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

1925
01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:57.510
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of connects us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's where the disengagement and</v>

1926
01:21:57.511 --> 01:21:59.850
<v Speaker 2>the disconnection with our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our food supply comes from.</v>

1927
01:21:59.851 --> 01:22:00.684
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're so,</v>

1928
01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:02.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're above it.</v>

1929
01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:04.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's our psyche.</v>

1930
01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.290
<v Speaker 2>When we were also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just not used to being around</v>

1931
01:22:07.291 --> 01:22:10.740
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people are not around wild animals</v>

1932
01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:12.210
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

1933
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:16.140
<v Speaker 2>The great majority of people that live</v>
<v Speaker 2>in cities are virtually never run</v>

1934
01:22:16.141 --> 01:22:17.700
<v Speaker 2>anything other than pigeons and</v>
<v Speaker 2>squirrels.</v>

1935
01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:21.480
<v Speaker 2>They're just not around them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our ideas of wild animals,</v>

1936
01:22:21.481 --> 01:22:23.400
<v Speaker 2>I like these beautiful things that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>rarely see.</v>

1937
01:22:23.401 --> 01:22:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want to kill one?</v>

1938
01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An interesting point about squirrels,</v>

1939
01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:31.120
<v Speaker 1>urban squirrels versus a woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Squirrels.</v>

1940
01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shot a couple more episodes,</v>

1941
01:22:34.391 --> 01:22:36.640
<v Speaker 1>immediate or that'll be coming out here</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the next couple of weeks.</v>

1942
01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:38.490
<v Speaker 1>And A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we took Helen and,</v>

1943
01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.520
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Brittany,</v>

1944
01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:43.390
<v Speaker 1>a squirrel hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their experience mostly with</v>

1945
01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:45.850
<v Speaker 1>squirrels was urban.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Helen had this,</v>

1946
01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.710
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're way different than,</v>

1947
01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.180
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know what squirrels,</v>

1948
01:22:49.190 --> 01:22:51.640
<v Speaker 1>they're like not coming down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course Brittany was talking about</v>

1949
01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:55.450
<v Speaker 1>like rubbing acorns on her body and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they'll come out and stuff like</v>

1950
01:22:55.451 --> 01:23:00.451
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a completely different wild animals.</v>

1951
01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.670
<v Speaker 1>They're out there making the living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're out there surviving that,</v>

1952
01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.900
<v Speaker 1>that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They aren't going to react the same way</v>

1953
01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:08.170
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to human beings walking into the woods.</v>

1954
01:23:09.330 --> 01:23:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Animals are pliable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1955
01:23:10.801 --> 01:23:14.220
<v Speaker 2>they're flexible just like people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you start feeding wild animals,</v>

1956
01:23:14.221 --> 01:23:17.370
<v Speaker 2>they kind of become domesticated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a park right down here in north</v>

1957
01:23:17.371 --> 01:23:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could sit down in the park and if you</v>

1958
01:23:20.101 --> 01:23:22.440
<v Speaker 2>bring a bag of peanuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the squirrels will literally come and</v>

1959
01:23:22.441 --> 01:23:24.270
<v Speaker 2>take them from your hands like a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

1960
01:23:24.570 --> 01:23:25.950
<v Speaker 2>And it's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1961
01:23:25.951 --> 01:23:28.140

<v Speaker 2>this is a real deer.</v>

1973
01:23:47.670 --> 01:23:49.110

<v Speaker 2>I'd shoot it.</v>

1979
01:23:59.070 --> 01:24:01.440

1980
01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:06.120
<v Speaker 2>It has never been attacked by a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't associate people with danger.</v>

1981
01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:07.830
<v Speaker 2>They're just standing there staring at</v>

<v Speaker 2>if you have to survive.</v>

1985
01:24:14.611 --> 01:24:16.770

2120
01:29:07.711 --> 01:29:11.280
<v Speaker 2>blueberries and he was saying that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the best meat bar.</v>

2121
01:29:11.281 --> 01:29:14.430
<v Speaker 2>None in the world are known.</v>

2125
01:29:24.061 --> 01:29:25.590
<v Speaker 2>You drink a soda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't think about it,</v>

2126
01:29:25.591 --> 01:29:28.950
<v Speaker 2>but that is your cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were literally supplying nutrients</v>

2127
01:29:28.951 --> 01:29:31.860
<v Speaker 2>to yourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your food and when you eat,</v>

2128
01:29:31.861 --> 01:29:34.890
<v Speaker 2>like I used to work with this dude,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like his skin tarts started turn orange</v>

2130
01:29:38.191 --> 01:29:41.130
<v Speaker 2>cause he was eating like three or four</v>
<v Speaker 2>glasses of carrot juice a day.</v>

2131

<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

2136
01:29:51.151 --> 01:29:54.990
<v Speaker 2>You know why that was shirking off with</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheese.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

2139
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.610

<v Speaker 2>jerking off like we mean it's,</v>

2140
01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:04.210
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>potato chips or whatever the fuck it is,</v>

2148
01:30:27.930 --> 01:30:31.650
<v Speaker 2>that is literally supplying yourselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we don't think about it that way.</v>

2149
01:30:31.651 --> 01:30:33.120
<v Speaker 2>We just think about this tastes good.</v>

2150
01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:34.650
<v Speaker 2>I am me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

2153
01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:41.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started this diet recently.</v>

2154
01:30:41.671 --> 01:30:46.560
<v Speaker 2>This is called the primal blueprint diet</v>
<v Speaker 2>is guy on the podcast name Mark Sisson</v>

2155
01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:49.920
<v Speaker 2>and he is an advocate of no grains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no bread,</v>

2156
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:51.480
<v Speaker 2>no pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no rice,</v>

2157
01:30:51.481 --> 01:30:53.430
<v Speaker 2>no nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly fats.</v>

2158
01:30:53.431 --> 01:30:56.010
<v Speaker 2>You get your fats from Avocados,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a healthy fats,</v>

2159
01:30:56.011 --> 01:31:01.011
<v Speaker 2>from beef and the chicken or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck you eat and coconut oil,</v>

2160
01:31:01.561 --> 01:31:03.510
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mct oil.</v>

2161
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:07.200
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been on it now for two weeks and</v>

2162
01:31:07.201 --> 01:31:09.510
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty fascinating.</v>

2163
01:31:09.511 --> 01:31:11.700
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took me a while to like adjust from</v>

2164
01:31:11.970 --> 01:31:14.490
<v Speaker 2>going on a carbohydrate based,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2165
01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:19.110
<v Speaker 2>energy to a fat base energy getting my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my energy from fats.</v>

2166
01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.980
<v Speaker 2>My body fat's decreased pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>significantly.</v>

2167
01:31:22.981 --> 01:31:27.981
<v Speaker 2>I lost at least six pounds now and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating like normal amounts,</v>

2168
01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:33.500
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just eating fat and proteins and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of vegetables and no sugars at</v>

2169
01:31:33.631 --> 01:31:33.900
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

2170
01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:34.681
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>

2171
01:31:34.681 --> 01:31:37.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm not eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not eating any processed sugar.</v>

2172
01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I eat occasional piece of fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blueberries and things along those</v>

2173
01:31:40.861 --> 01:31:42.840
<v Speaker 2>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's mostly vegetables and meat that</v>

2174
01:31:42.841 --> 01:31:45.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of Avocados.</v>

2175
01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:50.540
<v Speaker 2>But my cells obviously are getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrients off of this,</v>

2176
01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:54.900
<v Speaker 2>off of healthy fats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he found is he had arthritis.</v>

2177
01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.440
<v Speaker 2>He also had irritable bowel syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those things went away when he,</v>

2178
01:31:58.590 --> 01:32:01.660
<v Speaker 2>when he cut grains out of his diet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we stopped eating processed sugar</v>

2179
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.390
<v Speaker 2>influence things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation.</v>

2180
01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that these healthy fats like healthy</v>

2181
01:32:07.931 --> 01:32:09.520
<v Speaker 2>fats for your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like coconut oil,</v>

2182
01:32:09.521 --> 01:32:14.521
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines is really the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best fuel for your body and your body</v>

2183
01:32:14.561 --> 01:32:17.430
<v Speaker 2>gets into a state of Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which takes about two weeks where I just</v>

2184
01:32:17.431 --> 01:32:20.800
<v Speaker 2>started getting into it just started</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting into the state of Ketosis and</v>

2185
01:32:20.801 --> 01:32:23.050
<v Speaker 2>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once it reaches a state of Ketosis,</v>

2186
01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:28.320
<v Speaker 2>gets its energy primarily from fat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a more normal natural way for your</v>

2187
01:32:28.481 --> 01:32:31.420
<v Speaker 2>body to respond and your body can shift.</v>

2188
01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body's very flexible can shift from</v>

2189
01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:38.440
<v Speaker 2>a glucose based carbohydrate based fuel</v>
<v Speaker 2>system to a fat based fuel system.</v>

2190
01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.980
<v Speaker 2>So this one of my body has just started</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do and I committed to this.</v>

2191
01:32:42.190 --> 01:32:44.200
<v Speaker 2>I was going to do a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just decided to make it two</v>

2192
01:32:44.201 --> 01:32:46.150
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm committing to this for two months</v>

2193
01:32:46.151 --> 01:32:47.680
<v Speaker 2>and I'm gonna talk about it and see what</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like.</v>

2194
01:32:47.681 --> 01:32:52.210
<v Speaker 2>But I'm sold two weeks in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it in the fact that if I go</v>

2195
01:32:52.211 --> 01:32:55.900
<v Speaker 2>to a restaurant and someone's got a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spaghetti and meatballs next to me,</v>

2196
01:32:55.901 --> 01:32:57.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck the meatballs.</v>

2197
01:32:58.230 --> 01:33:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't eat spaghetti like I have.</v>

2198
01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I can't eat any sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No desserts.</v>

2199
01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Does that seem different to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2200
01:33:04.650 --> 01:33:07.230
<v Speaker 2>and what I mean is what you smell like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2201
01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:08.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a carbohydrate like that.</v>

2202
01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a crazy,</v>

2203
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:11.710
<v Speaker 2>it was all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2204
01:33:12.270 --> 01:33:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not so much before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2205
01:33:13.841 --> 01:33:15.970
<v Speaker 2>it's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what's really strange about it.</v>

2206
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:20.590
<v Speaker 2>I what they've said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people have hypothesized and the</v>

2207
01:33:20.591 --> 01:33:24.220
<v Speaker 2>theories are that your gut bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 2>controls a lot of your appetite.</v>

2208
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:27.850
<v Speaker 2>And this is one of the reasons why I</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be stuffed,</v>

2209
01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:30.700
<v Speaker 2>like stuffed at the end of a meal and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would still want sugar.</v>

2210
01:33:30.970 --> 01:33:33.270
<v Speaker 2>I'd still wants to candy or it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2211
01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:35.170
<v Speaker 2>it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2212
01:33:35.290 --> 01:33:39.120
<v Speaker 2>You still want some pie all bring up on</v>
<v Speaker 2>her nose.</v>

2213
01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I don't,</v>

2214
01:33:40.810 --> 01:33:45.810
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because of this show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My body taking plenty of probiotics,</v>

2215
01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:47.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking a lot of Kombucha,</v>

2216
01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:50.920
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking some probiotic supplements.</v>

2217
01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:53.950
<v Speaker 2>You're you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you introduce healthy bacteria into your</v>

2218
01:33:53.951 --> 01:33:57.700
<v Speaker 2>stomach and your gut and because of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>your shift,</v>

2219
01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:01.150
<v Speaker 2>it shifts like what you're hungry for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange.</v>

2220
01:34:01.151 --> 01:34:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Like bread to me looks like a like why</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you eat stuffing out of a</v>

2221
01:34:05.261 --> 01:34:07.600
<v Speaker 2>mattress?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it looks like nonsense to me.</v>

2222
01:34:07.630 --> 01:34:09.850
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange cause I used to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>like bread,</v>

2223
01:34:10.150 --> 01:34:13.430
<v Speaker 2>someone bring out like a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice loaf of bread and butter.</v>

2224
01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:14.710
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh give me that.</v>

2225
01:34:15.290 --> 01:34:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Be All excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slap some butter on that bitch and eat</v>

2226
01:34:17.711 --> 01:34:19.390
<v Speaker 2>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I look at him like that's not even</v>

2227
01:34:19.391 --> 01:34:20.530
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

2228
01:34:20.531 --> 01:34:23.350
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't register to me as a two week</v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time.</v>

2229
01:34:23.351 --> 01:34:25.390
<v Speaker 2>You have two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two weeks and you were such an</v>

2230
01:34:25.450 --> 01:34:26.283
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy.</v>

2231
01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:31.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think part of it must be</v>

2232
01:34:31.151 --> 01:34:34.810
<v Speaker 2>psychological that I've decided that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't food that I've made a shift</v>

2233
01:34:34.811 --> 01:34:37.510
<v Speaker 2>in my mind because I'm not eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't eaten it in two weeks,</v>

2234
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:41.110
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's a real good argument</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's gut bacteria.</v>

2235
01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:43.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a big part of it because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>

2236
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:46.750
<v Speaker 2>like they had like a dessert tray thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they brought it out at a restaurant</v>

2237
01:34:46.751 --> 01:34:48.030
<v Speaker 2>I was at the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2238
01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:51.190
<v Speaker 2>you know like the fancy place they bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like would you look dude,</v>

2239
01:34:51.490 --> 01:34:55.900
<v Speaker 2>this wound you would need to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and none of it looked good.</v>

2240
01:34:56.110 --> 01:34:58.430
<v Speaker 2>It all looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas before I'd be like,</v>

2241
01:34:58.431 --> 01:35:01.330
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to fuck my body up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to figure this out,</v>

2242
01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:04.640
<v Speaker 2>we're going to take home with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting stuff.</v>

2243
01:35:04.730 --> 01:35:05.820
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2244
01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to experiment with it because</v>

2245
01:35:07.611 --> 01:35:08.570
<v Speaker 2>the guy was fascinating.</v>

2246
01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:10.040
<v Speaker 2>He's very intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

2247
01:35:10.041 --> 01:35:10.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how,</v>

2248
01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:12.620
<v Speaker 2>what does it hurt for me to try this</v>
<v Speaker 2>out?</v>

2249
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:15.830
<v Speaker 2>I thought it'd be an interesting topic</v>
<v Speaker 2>of discussion to do it first,</v>

2250
01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:17.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 days or so and then maybe even have</v>

2251
01:35:17.691 --> 01:35:20.390
<v Speaker 2>him back on or have someone else on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>advocates it.</v>

2252
01:35:20.391 --> 01:35:22.220
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've read people that don't advocate</v>

2253
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:25.820
<v Speaker 2>a carbohydrate rich diets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me that your body is</v>

2254
01:35:25.821 --> 01:35:29.150
<v Speaker 2>pretty flexible in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can exist on a bunch of different types</v>

2255
01:35:29.151 --> 01:35:31.790
<v Speaker 2>of fuel and people get really dogmatic</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

2256
01:35:31.791 --> 01:35:33.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have to do it this way,</v>

2257
01:35:33.471 --> 01:35:35.690
<v Speaker 2>you have to do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2258
01:35:35.691 --> 01:35:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's all,</v>

2259
01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:39.350
<v Speaker 2>there's also biodiversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2260
01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:41.240
<v Speaker 2>There's different people come from</v>
<v Speaker 2>different climates.</v>

2261
01:35:41.241 --> 01:35:42.590
<v Speaker 2>They come from different parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2262
01:35:42.591 --> 01:35:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Originally their ancestors did and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think their bodies have become more</v>

2263
01:35:46.551 --> 01:35:50.720
<v Speaker 2>acclimated to those types of foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was like the big issue with</v>

2264
01:35:50.721 --> 01:35:53.810
<v Speaker 2>native Americans when the European</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed up with alcohol and they</v>

2265
01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:56.600
<v Speaker 2>literally didn't have the genes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>process this stuff,</v>

2266
01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:59.870
<v Speaker 2>whereas Irish people processed shit like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2267
01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2268
01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:00.943
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2269
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Italians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that you said that</v>

2270
01:36:03.681 --> 01:36:07.970
<v Speaker 1>about probiotic because I've been taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>a probiotic for about 18 months now.</v>

2271
01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the places where I got this advice</v>

2272
01:36:10.761 --> 01:36:15.170
<v Speaker 1>was from my accountant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a buddy.</v>

2273
01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it like a,</v>

2274
01:36:16.701 --> 01:36:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I went over your taxes and which she</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed?</v>

2275
01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:21.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of her clients.</v>

2276
01:36:21.651 --> 01:36:22.340
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2277
01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:27.340
<v Speaker 1>I had been sick and she said something</v>
<v Speaker 1>about probiotics and honest to God,</v>

2278
01:36:27.621 --> 01:36:30.260
<v Speaker 1>18 months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been taking a probiotic every</v>

2279
01:36:30.261 --> 01:36:33.440
<v Speaker 1>morning and I'm not been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I haven't done anything else</v>

2280
01:36:33.441 --> 01:36:34.820
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been,</v>

2281
01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:38.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily healthier but less ill,</v>

2282
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.863
<v Speaker 1>ill at all really.</v>

2283
01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:44.690
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an article I read once about skin flora</v>

2284
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:47.720
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was in regards to grappling cause a</v>

2285
01:36:47.721 --> 01:36:51.080
<v Speaker 2>with Jujitsu and wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big issue is ringworm.</v>

2286
01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:53.330
<v Speaker 2>And even staff infection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten both.</v>

2287
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:54.321
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2288
01:36:54.321 --> 01:36:55.610
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sucks that there were,</v>

2289
01:36:55.611 --> 01:36:57.590
<v Speaker 2>the staff was real scary because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2290
01:36:57.890 --> 01:37:00.530
<v Speaker 2>my friend Tate Fletcher spotted it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were at an airport,</v>

2291
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:03.080
<v Speaker 2>we were hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting ready to go on a plane and I</v>

2292
01:37:03.081 --> 01:37:06.230
<v Speaker 2>just had my foot sitting up on my knee</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's looking at the bottom of my</v>

2293
01:37:06.231 --> 01:37:08.270
<v Speaker 2>calf and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2294
01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:09.650
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with your leg?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2295
01:37:09.651 --> 01:37:10.730
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2296
01:37:10.731 --> 01:37:12.470
<v Speaker 2>what's going to get at least like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's all this?</v>

2297
01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:13.453
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

2298
01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:15.230
<v Speaker 2>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's little pimples on my ligament.</v>

2299
01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:15.861
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2300
01:37:15.861 --> 01:37:17.840
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that looks like staff.</v>

2301
01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Like are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

2302
01:37:19.401 --> 01:37:20.690
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that man.</v>

2303
01:37:20.690 --> 01:37:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Go get that checked out because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2304
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:24.410
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought,</v>

2305
01:37:24.411 --> 01:37:26.330
<v Speaker 2>has been grappling his whole life and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

2306
01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:28.130
<v Speaker 2>he had caught it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never caught it.</v>

2307
01:37:28.131 --> 01:37:31.790
<v Speaker 2>I caught ringworm before and I knew what</v>
<v Speaker 2>that looked like and so I was like,</v>

2308
01:37:31.791 --> 01:37:33.500
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking pimples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it?</v>

2309
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:34.700
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

2310
01:37:34.701 --> 01:37:37.490
<v Speaker 2>I think that staff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I go immediately to a dermatologist,</v>

2311
01:37:37.670 --> 01:37:39.350
<v Speaker 2>take his advice and the guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

2312
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:43.280
<v Speaker 2>you can get on some fucking antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gives me these horse pills of death.</v>

2313
01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.390
<v Speaker 2>This stuff's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These first of all antibiotics when you</v>

2314
01:37:47.391 --> 01:37:51.920
<v Speaker 2>have staff wrecks your entire system</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it doesn't just kill the staff.</v>

2315
01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:54.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kills all the healthy flora too.</v>

2316
01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:57.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just start over what they say to</v>

2317
01:37:57.511 --> 01:38:01.650
<v Speaker 2>counter that is to take probiotics once</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done with your whole cycle,</v>

2318
01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:04.020
<v Speaker 2>but also to prevent it in the future.</v>

2319
01:38:04.230 --> 01:38:07.130
<v Speaker 2>You take healthy bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of acid off list,</v>

2320
01:38:07.170 --> 01:38:11.370
<v Speaker 2>different forms of probiotics and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are essentially giving your body</v>

2321
01:38:11.371 --> 01:38:16.371
<v Speaker 2>soldiers to fight off infection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the skin flora changes when you take</v>

2322
01:38:17.290 --> 01:38:19.770
<v Speaker 2>high doses of healthy acidophilus and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>

2323
01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also like people that are Vegan.</v>

2324
01:38:23.310 --> 01:38:27.840
<v Speaker 2>There's a some different probiotics like</v>
<v Speaker 2>raw sauerkraut,</v>

2325
01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:31.410
<v Speaker 2>like raw sauerkraut has really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kimchi is another one that's really</v>

2326
01:38:31.411 --> 01:38:33.390
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic probiotic.</v>

2327
01:38:33.391 --> 01:38:36.210
<v Speaker 2>You're essentially taking it live</v>
<v Speaker 2>organisms that become a part of your</v>

2328
01:38:36.211 --> 01:38:40.050
<v Speaker 2>body and their soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these live organisms fight off</v>

2329
01:38:40.051 --> 01:38:43.440
<v Speaker 2>against shitty bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing stuff.</v>

2330
01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason I was convinced other</v>

2331
01:38:46.711 --> 01:38:51.230
<v Speaker 1>than I get my medical advice</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap is,</v>

2332
01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:54.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the other work that I do,</v>

2333
01:38:54.391 --> 01:38:57.340
<v Speaker 1>I build and manage athletic fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2334
01:38:57.630 --> 01:39:00.840
<v Speaker 1>and there a huge movement to go towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>organic,</v>

2335
01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:03.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2336
01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:08.280
<v Speaker 1>fertilization or cultural practices in</v>
<v Speaker 1>on athletic fields.</v>

2337
01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:11.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one facility that I manage,</v>

2338
01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:13.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before every tournament,</v>

2339
01:39:13.321 --> 01:39:17.340
<v Speaker 1>we'll get emails and calls from parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>who bring their eight year old and say,</v>

2340
01:39:17.341 --> 01:39:19.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're coming in from wherever and we</v>

2341
01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.510
<v Speaker 1>would like to know what's been applied</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your fields.</v>

2342
01:39:21.511 --> 01:39:25.440
<v Speaker 1>My son or daughter has a issue with</v>
<v Speaker 1>herbicide and tolerance or whatever.</v>

2343
01:39:25.441 --> 01:39:29.420
<v Speaker 1>And I take that shit really seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2344
01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:34.640
<v Speaker 1>we started using a compost from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2345
01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:39.570
<v Speaker 1>both a facility nearby from the county,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also from a supplier.</v>

2346
01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:42.510
<v Speaker 1>And applying that as a part of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2347
01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:46.350
<v Speaker 1>our regime cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're able to cut back on fertilizer.</v>

2348
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:48.330
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing that was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting is that,</v>

2349
01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:51.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the pathogens that we have</v>

2350
01:39:51.721 --> 01:39:53.640
<v Speaker 1>issue with on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see my golf courses,</v>

2351
01:39:53.641 --> 01:39:56.820
<v Speaker 1>they get a different kinds of fungus</v>
<v Speaker 1>that affect the grasp because you're,</v>

2352
01:39:57.210 --> 01:39:59.100
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're putting water on it and you're</v>

2353
01:39:59.101 --> 01:40:04.101
<v Speaker 1>feeding the shit out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by putting that compost on there,</v>

2354
01:40:04.450 --> 01:40:05.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and providing,</v>

2355
01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:08.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially the organisms that are good</v>

2356
01:40:08.581 --> 01:40:09.990
<v Speaker 1>for the soil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're feeding the soil,</v>

2357
01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.780
<v Speaker 1>not the plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which nitrogen that they,</v>

2358
01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>synthetic nitrogen or,</v>

2359
01:40:14.221 --> 01:40:15.470
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2360
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:17.380
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what ends up happening is we're,</v>

2361
01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:20.810
<v Speaker 1>we're feeding that soil and so now we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a whole environment there that,</v>

2362
01:40:20.811 --> 01:40:21.860
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2363
01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:25.830
<v Speaker 1>turf grass has got an opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>utilize everything that's in that soil</v>

2364
01:40:26.130 --> 01:40:27.620
<v Speaker 1>and it's healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2365
01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:28.141
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2366
01:40:28.141 --> 01:40:32.190
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of going the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going the other direction in,</v>

2367
01:40:32.590 --> 01:40:35.580
<v Speaker 1>in everything from farming to grown</v>
<v Speaker 1>grass,</v>

2368
01:40:35.581 --> 01:40:36.750
<v Speaker 1>for kids to play soccer on it.</v>

2369
01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a guy who lived near a golf</v>

2370
01:40:38.561 --> 01:40:42.720
<v Speaker 2>course growing up and the pesticides</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they use on the golf course fact</v>

2371
01:40:42.850 --> 01:40:47.140
<v Speaker 2>the water supply and he got bone cancer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cancer throughout his neighborhood.</v>

2372
01:40:47.141 --> 01:40:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Everyone in his neighborhood was</v>
<v Speaker 2>affected.</v>

2373
01:40:49.301 --> 01:40:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Someone they knew got cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was rampant and it was just that were</v>

2374
01:40:53.441 --> 01:40:57.520
<v Speaker 2>drinking the water that came from this</v>
<v Speaker 2>area where the had been contaminated</v>

2375
01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.430
<v Speaker 1>because of a fucking golf course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2376
01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:00.553
<v Speaker 1>Reaching in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2377
01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:03.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one company that I work with,</v>

2378
01:41:04.450 --> 01:41:07.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has built,</v>

2379
01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:08.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a part of a construction of a golf</v>

2380
01:41:08.861 --> 01:41:12.640
<v Speaker 1>course that from day one was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually certified organic,</v>

2381
01:41:13.330 --> 01:41:17.020
<v Speaker 1>but it was better part of their process</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way along and they control,</v>

2382
01:41:17.170 --> 01:41:18.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of traffic on it and all of</v>

2383
01:41:18.881 --> 01:41:21.400
<v Speaker 1>those sort of things too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a beautiful golf course and</v>

2384
01:41:21.401 --> 01:41:23.160
<v Speaker 1>they haven't used any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2385
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:26.260
<v Speaker 1>best sides or synthetic fertilizers on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2386
01:41:26.370 --> 01:41:30.510
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that they had brought</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in that same article about organic</v>

2387
01:41:30.511 --> 01:41:35.460
<v Speaker 2>meat being healthier was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>incorporation of clover and with grass</v>

2388
01:41:35.461 --> 01:41:37.560
<v Speaker 2>and then somehow or another clover</v>
<v Speaker 2>helps.</v>

2389
01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:41.880
<v Speaker 2>It helps sustain like a nitrogen balance</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the grasses.</v>

2390
01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clover is a nitrogen fixing plant.</v>

2391
01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:47.940
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2392
01:41:47.941 --> 01:41:49.010
<v Speaker 1>in a pasture we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2393
01:41:49.050 --> 01:41:54.050
<v Speaker 1>we introduced clover into our pastures</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it fixes nitrogen into the soil</v>

2394
01:41:55.951 --> 01:41:58.560
<v Speaker 1>that's then available for the grasses</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2395
01:41:58.650 --> 01:42:02.070
<v Speaker 1>white clovers and a lot of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I actually plant in some of the</v>

2396
01:42:02.071 --> 01:42:03.760
<v Speaker 1>food plot stuff that we do for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for deer.</v>

2397
01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For deer.</v>

2398
01:42:05.290 --> 01:42:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sweet.</v>

2399
01:42:06.361 --> 01:42:09.690
<v Speaker 1>It tastes good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also providing nitrogen to the</v>

2400
01:42:09.691 --> 01:42:11.810
<v Speaker 1>plants that need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2401
01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:12.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2402
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:13.900
<v Speaker 2>Nah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big problem with things</v>

2403
01:42:13.901 --> 01:42:18.901
<v Speaker 2>like gigantic fields of only grain of</v>
<v Speaker 2>only corn or have only wheat that this,</v>

2404
01:42:19.271 --> 01:42:24.271
<v Speaker 2>it's not natural for one plant species</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be mano critter.</v>

2405
01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:26.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not normal.</v>

2406
01:42:26.531 --> 01:42:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not natural.</v>

2407
01:42:27.461 --> 01:42:30.070
<v Speaker 2>And it's kind of like what you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about when we were talking about</v>

2408
01:42:30.071 --> 01:42:34.750
<v Speaker 2>these really interesting diverse</v>
<v Speaker 2>ecosystems that are created by these</v>

2409
01:42:34.751 --> 01:42:37.180
<v Speaker 2>organic farms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this one that you were,</v>

2410
01:42:37.210 --> 01:42:38.470
<v Speaker 2>you were highlighting earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2411
01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:41.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it is,</v>

2412
01:42:41.691 --> 01:42:43.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a complete ecosystem.</v>

2413
01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:45.390
<v Speaker 2>No Sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it's supposed to be.</v>

2414
01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that gets me is that,</v>

2415
01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:48.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Mark Sheppard,</v>

2416
01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:49.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2417
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I've just page through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2418
01:42:51.121 --> 01:42:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Doug's read more of it than I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

2419
01:42:53.281 --> 01:42:55.710
<v Speaker 2>you look at this and you read it and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes sense and you're like,</v>

2420
01:42:55.711 --> 01:42:56.700
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's a genius.</v>

2421
01:42:57.060 --> 01:43:01.590
<v Speaker 2>But then you think about ancient</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations were doing things along</v>

2422
01:43:01.591 --> 01:43:03.150
<v Speaker 2>these lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where did we lose that?</v>

2423
01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:04.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where did that go away?</v>

2424
01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:09.150
<v Speaker 2>We lost it with this factory farming and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we also lost it when we started putting</v>

2425
01:43:09.151 --> 01:43:12.870
<v Speaker 2>people in cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think cities are a real big part of</v>

2426
01:43:12.871 --> 01:43:16.830
<v Speaker 2>our disconnect and also awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love cities.</v>

2427
01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:18.480
<v Speaker 2>I love to be able to go to the and</v>
<v Speaker 2>implement.</v>

2428
01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like getting like highway,</v>

2429
01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:23.490
<v Speaker 2>like the guy you mentioned the guy you</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned Joel,</v>

2430
01:43:23.491 --> 01:43:24.390
<v Speaker 2>that girls this shit.</v>

2431
01:43:25.050 --> 01:43:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no that was,</v>

2432
01:43:27.670 --> 01:43:28.950
<v Speaker 2>that was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron Finley,</v>

2433
01:43:28.951 --> 01:43:31.350
<v Speaker 2>you know you've heard of Joel Salitan</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been on the podcast.</v>

2434
01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's Aussie.</v>

2435
01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:35.100
<v Speaker 2>I was going to reference him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's amazing.</v>

2436
01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:36.680
<v Speaker 2>He's got some amazing books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2437
01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:40.650
<v Speaker 2>he's got a lot of books on a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting strategy for like letting</v>

2438
01:43:40.651 --> 01:43:42.570
<v Speaker 2>pigs and all these different animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>graze.</v>

2439
01:43:42.770 --> 01:43:45.060
<v Speaker 2>And so what he does is he sets up this</v>
<v Speaker 2>perimeter fence,</v>

2440
01:43:45.061 --> 01:43:48.450
<v Speaker 2>this large like mildly charged fan stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that go to it.</v>

2441
01:43:48.451 --> 01:43:50.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a irritates them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said they don't run over the</v>

2442
01:43:50.551 --> 01:43:53.990
<v Speaker 2>fence and then he moves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it moves the fence and they graze in new</v>

2443
01:43:53.991 --> 01:43:56.910
<v Speaker 2>area so they don't just distraught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2444
01:43:57.110 --> 01:44:00.590
<v Speaker 2>They don't just end their living as if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were wild.</v>

2445
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:03.410
<v Speaker 2>They're essentially grazing off acorns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>

2446
01:44:03.411 --> 01:44:08.270
<v Speaker 2>And it just giant areas where they roam</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forage and they eat just like a wild</v>

2447
01:44:08.271 --> 01:44:08.710
<v Speaker 2>pig.</v>

2448
01:44:08.710 --> 01:44:11.150
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their flesh is very different.</v>

2449
01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:12.770
<v Speaker 2>But that's what you got in your freezer</v>
<v Speaker 2>now dude,</v>

2450
01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:14.780
<v Speaker 2>well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is elk,</v>

2451
01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:17.030
<v Speaker 2>but I have a one kid from my free smart</v>
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

2452
01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:19.430
<v Speaker 2>You got to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2453
01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:20.840
<v Speaker 2>we your them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2454
01:44:20.841 --> 01:44:23.240
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the way to do it.</v>

2455
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:25.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a different kind of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks different.</v>

2456
01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:27.830
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a deeper,</v>

2457
01:44:27.831 --> 01:44:29.330
<v Speaker 2>darker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>richer color.</v>

2458
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:32.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed when we shot when Rinella and I</v>

2459
01:44:32.241 --> 01:44:37.130
<v Speaker 2>shot a pig at the till hone ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was thick with fat from acorns and</v>

2460
01:44:37.131 --> 01:44:38.200
<v Speaker 2>its texture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2461
01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:41.090
<v Speaker 2>the meat was like a dark red and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>delicious.</v>

2462
01:44:41.210 --> 01:44:42.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a different animal.</v>

2463
01:44:42.690 --> 01:44:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it an interesting like with beef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2464
01:44:46.330 --> 01:44:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I still eat the occasional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2465
01:44:48.970 --> 01:44:50.680
<v Speaker 1>beef that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2466
01:44:50.710 --> 01:44:52.090
<v Speaker 1>that I might not know where it came</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

2467
01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:53.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not very often,</v>

2468
01:44:53.621 --> 01:44:54.760
<v Speaker 1>but are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one,</v>

2469
01:44:54.930 --> 01:44:55.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one place,</v>

2470
01:44:56.140 --> 01:45:00.070
<v Speaker 1>one restaurant at a nearby or place that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to and he finishes his beef with,</v>

2471
01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:01.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with corn.</v>

2472
01:45:02.090 --> 01:45:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's mostly,</v>

2473
01:45:03.310 --> 01:45:04.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grass fed,</v>

2474
01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:08.370
<v Speaker 1>but he's still sort of old school with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marble it to yeah,</v>

2475
01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I taste the difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course she tasted his difference</v>

2476
01:45:13.481 --> 01:45:14.920
<v Speaker 1>between Venice soon because really</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2477
01:45:14.921 --> 01:45:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't have this wide experience of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and in,</v>

2478
01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:19.700
<v Speaker 1>in different areas and having meet from</v>
<v Speaker 1>different areas.</v>

2479
01:45:19.701 --> 01:45:24.430
<v Speaker 1>So I am excited like your elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so the venison to grass fed beef to</v>

2480
01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:26.650
<v Speaker 1>corn fed beef.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2481
01:45:27.370 --> 01:45:29.440
<v Speaker 1>and it's been a long time since I've had</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I,</v>

2482
01:45:29.470 --> 01:45:31.360
<v Speaker 1>like I said where I didn't know where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>came from,</v>

2483
01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:34.690
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you when it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it was a fat cattle,</v>

2484
01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:36.460
<v Speaker 1>they call them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2485
01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:38.950
<v Speaker 1>I feel like after I get done eating a</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of meat like that,</v>

2486
01:45:38.951 --> 01:45:40.540
<v Speaker 1>like I have a little prime rib or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2487
01:45:40.541 --> 01:45:42.960
<v Speaker 1>When they go out on a Saturday night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I should take a knife and</v>

2488
01:45:42.961 --> 01:45:44.620
<v Speaker 1>he's like scraped that fed off of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue.</v>

2489
01:45:44.621 --> 01:45:46.990
<v Speaker 1>It just has a completely different</v>
<v Speaker 1>tastes and that just,</v>

2490
01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my taste has changed that way.</v>

2491
01:45:53.070 --> 01:45:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

2492
01:45:55.570 --> 01:45:59.710
<v Speaker 2>it's very tender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also because that animals dying</v>

2493
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:04.090
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're eating a sumo wrestler,</v>

2494
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:05.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ain't no slob.</v>

2495
01:46:06.190 --> 01:46:06.971

<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>

2496
01:46:06.971 --> 01:46:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2497
01:46:08.670 --> 01:46:09.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colby.</v>

2498
01:46:09.650 --> 01:46:14.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or why you are the more common as I say,</v>

2499
01:46:14.590 --> 01:46:17.470
<v Speaker 2>why do you I don't like that stuff man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had it before.</v>

2500
01:46:17.610 --> 01:46:19.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>

2501
01:46:19.481 --> 01:46:24.430
<v Speaker 2>it's so fucking soft and weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like why w w how the fuck is this</v>

2502
01:46:24.431 --> 01:46:27.790
<v Speaker 2>muscle carrying this animal around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gelatinous?</v>

2503
01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:29.140
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

2504
01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it to even more of an extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2505
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:33.250
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is a veal.</v>

2506
01:46:33.490 --> 01:46:37.540
<v Speaker 1>There was down the road from our old</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend who had the issue with us when we</v>

2507
01:46:37.541 --> 01:46:40.510
<v Speaker 1>were hunting and he would call and leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>me those crazy message</v>

2508
01:46:40.630 --> 01:46:42.750
<v Speaker 2>just before,</v>

2509
01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:46.350
<v Speaker 1>before he will in that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was owned by another guy who raised</v>

2510
01:46:46.351 --> 01:46:48.930
<v Speaker 1>veal and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I was younger I helped out up</v>

2511
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.810
<v Speaker 1>once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how you helped out was to help him</v>

2512
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:56.870
<v Speaker 1>load the veal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those animals are in a cage where they</v>

2513
01:46:56.881 --> 01:47:01.500
<v Speaker 1>essentially can't turn a box where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can barely turn around and they're being</v>

2514
01:47:01.501 --> 01:47:02.660
<v Speaker 1>fed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2515
01:47:02.661 --> 01:47:07.661
<v Speaker 1>a milk replacer powdery that you mix</v>
<v Speaker 1>with water and it's kind of a liquid.</v>

2516
01:47:07.801 --> 01:47:11.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's all they're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the best looking veal calves,</v>

2517
01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:14.730
<v Speaker 1>calves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the last animal I ever wanted to</v>

2518
01:47:14.731 --> 01:47:16.950
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it smelled bad.</v>

2519
01:47:16.951 --> 01:47:19.470
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing good about it.</v>

2520
01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:21.380
<v Speaker 6>Muscles aren't developed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not,</v>

2521
01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:23.000
<v Speaker 6>they don't want them to develop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2522
01:47:23.001 --> 01:47:24.410
<v Speaker 6>crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

2523
01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:27.380
<v Speaker 6>I don't even understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand how it got started</v>

2524
01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:29.330
<v Speaker 6>and I don't understand why people keep</v>
<v Speaker 6>eating it.</v>

2525
01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:31.330
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people eat lutefisk I mean,</v>

2526
01:47:31.331 --> 01:47:33.580
<v Speaker 6>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Lutefisk what does that look like?</v>

2527
01:47:34.170 --> 01:47:35.890
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's ludicrous.</v>

2528
01:47:35.891 --> 01:47:37.110
<v Speaker 6>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what did he do wrong?</v>

2529
01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:40.070
<v Speaker 6>But fish in a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is it a lie?</v>

2530
01:47:40.210 --> 01:47:40.761
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2531
01:47:40.761 --> 01:47:41.541
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2532
01:47:41.541 --> 01:47:43.970
<v Speaker 6>they took it to mean we shouldn't think</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a survival thing.</v>

2533
01:47:43.971 --> 01:47:45.980
<v Speaker 6>The Vikings did it on ships and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but people still,</v>

<v Speaker 5>once or twice a month then well,</v>

2651
01:52:32.351 --> 01:52:35.500
<v Speaker 5>there's certainly a benefit to having a</v>
<v Speaker 5>small community like that where</v>

2652
01:52:35.501 --> 01:52:39.190
<v Speaker 5>everybody really does care about the</v>
<v Speaker 5>welfare of the community and cares about</v>

2653
01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:42.820
<v Speaker 5>all these different things like red</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrestling team needing money for</v>

2654
01:52:42.821 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 5>uniforms and things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We lose a lot</v>

2655
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:47.630
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have big cities,</v>

2656
01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:50.090
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much to gain in a big city,</v>

2657
01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:53.630
<v Speaker 2>but there's so much to lose to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like we were talking earlier</v>

2658
01:52:53.631 --> 01:52:56.480
<v Speaker 2>about the diffusion of responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have when there's 20 million</v>

2659
01:52:56.481 --> 01:52:58.640
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see somebody with their fucking car</v>

2660
01:52:58.641 --> 01:53:00.920
<v Speaker 2>broken down the side of the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think about stopping.</v>

2661
01:53:01.190 --> 01:53:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Well I hope this asshole as aaa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2662
01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Brown pass by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're on some country road and</v>

2663
01:53:07.011 --> 01:53:09.170
<v Speaker 2>you see someone broken down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think one or two things,</v>

2664
01:53:09.171 --> 01:53:11.270
<v Speaker 2>I hope this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not a serial killer and I should</v>

2665
01:53:11.271 --> 01:53:11.990
<v Speaker 2>probably try to help him.</v>

2666
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2667
01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:14.900
<v Speaker 4>Those are the two things you think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing out in our,</v>

2668
01:53:14.970 --> 01:53:18.530
<v Speaker 4>our territory when you're driving right</v>
<v Speaker 4>in our area when you're driving around</v>

2669
01:53:18.531 --> 01:53:20.210
<v Speaker 4>is you wave to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2670
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:21.103
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She'd drive or not.</v>

2671
01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:22.910
<v Speaker 4>It might not be putting your hand up</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this or anything,</v>

2672
01:53:22.911 --> 01:53:24.050
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least to driving on little.</v>

2673
01:53:24.730 --> 01:53:26.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2674
01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:30.410
<v Speaker 4>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that that is definitely missing</v>

2675
01:53:30.411 --> 01:53:32.150
<v Speaker 4>on the highway cause otherwise he'd be</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking</v>

2676
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:39.860
<v Speaker 4>break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2677
01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:43.930
<v Speaker 4>it's a saint as you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

2678
01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:44.810
<v Speaker 4>It's all weird in that</v>

2679
01:53:45.010 --> 01:53:46.330
<v Speaker 2>it is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are weird,</v>

2680
01:53:46.331 --> 01:53:50.230
<v Speaker 2>but cities are especially weird because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think this is a normal thing.</v>

2681
01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:51.093
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2682
01:53:51.190 --> 01:53:55.090
<v Speaker 2>we've only had them for the last couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred years in this sort of magnitude</v>

2683
01:53:55.091 --> 01:53:57.400
<v Speaker 2>that we have now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with New York and La and things</v>

2684
01:53:57.401 --> 01:54:00.280
<v Speaker 2>along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to have so many people jammed into</v>

2685
01:54:00.281 --> 01:54:04.480
<v Speaker 2>an area like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as we started this conversation,</v>

2686
01:54:04.481 --> 01:54:08.800
<v Speaker 2>have a complete disconnect as to where</v>
<v Speaker 2>your food comes from and that the food</v>

2687
01:54:08.801 --> 01:54:12.850
<v Speaker 2>is coming from life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's plant life or whether it's</v>

2688
01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:15.490
<v Speaker 2>animal life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your food comes from life.</v>

2689
01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Life eats life,</v>

2690
01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:19.540
<v Speaker 4>allogenic London.</v>

<v Speaker 4>about this.</v>

2692
01:54:22.991 --> 01:54:23.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What'd he say?</v>

2693
01:54:24.180 --> 01:54:24.821
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2694
01:54:24.821 --> 01:54:25.700
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this character,</v>

2695
01:54:25.701 --> 01:54:28.540
<v Speaker 4>it's this old pirate in this book called</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Sea Sea Wolf.</v>

2696
01:54:28.690 --> 01:54:33.690
<v Speaker 4>I knew it was going to get a pirate</v>
<v Speaker 4>fan of pirates who isn't man cards are</v>

2697
01:54:34.751 --> 01:54:37.050
<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2698
01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:39.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe not to the new age ones.</v>

2699
01:54:39.311 --> 01:54:40.470
<v Speaker 4>The Somalis are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well yeah,</v>

2700
01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:42.330
<v Speaker 4>they're a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2701
01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:44.590
<v Speaker 4>those are the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not without my sympathy as well.</v>

2702
01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:47.410
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's got an agenda and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's got a reason to fight.</v>

2703
01:54:47.411 --> 01:54:49.060
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a very,</v>

2704
01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:50.020
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll get into that.</v>

2705
01:54:50.590 --> 01:54:52.300
<v Speaker 4>This specific pirate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his whole,</v>

2706
01:54:52.690 --> 01:54:55.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a loner and his whole thing in the</v>

2707
01:54:55.690 --> 01:54:58.390
<v Speaker 4>conversation throughout the book is he</v>
<v Speaker 4>talks about it as a yeast,</v>

2708
01:54:58.890 --> 01:55:01.540
<v Speaker 4>yeast eats life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his whole contention is</v>

2709
01:55:03.070 --> 01:55:05.050
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck matters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Life eats life.</v>

2710
01:55:05.051 --> 01:55:07.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could make an argument like you're</v>

2711
01:55:07.931 --> 01:55:08.890
<v Speaker 4>going to be dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be dead,</v>

2712
01:55:08.891 --> 01:55:09.940
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who gives a fuck?</v>

2713
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.410
<v Speaker 4>Who gives a fuck what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2714
01:55:11.411 --> 01:55:12.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people's,</v>

2715
01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:13.780
<v Speaker 4>that's not a very nice way to look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

2716
01:55:13.810 --> 01:55:14.643
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it is,</v>

2717
01:55:14.650 --> 01:55:15.730
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2718
01:55:15.731 --> 01:55:16.690
<v Speaker 4>it's a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2719
01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:19.620
<v Speaker 2>as a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also this moment right now is</v>

2720
01:55:19.621 --> 01:55:20.640
<v Speaker 2>enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2721
01:55:20.641 --> 01:55:23.730
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a problem with that sort of</v>

2722
01:55:23.731 --> 01:55:26.250
<v Speaker 2>absolute sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2723
01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:28.300
<v Speaker 2>worrying about the end and not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2724
01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:30.060
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moment is enjoyable.</v>

2725
01:55:30.090 --> 01:55:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Like an l sit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All comradery and friendship and a good</v>

2726
01:55:32.851 --> 01:55:34.980
<v Speaker 2>meal with friends is one of the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>things you can have in life.</v>

2727
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Adventures and things that you enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>activities that you like to participate</v>

2728
01:55:39.451 --> 01:55:41.040
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are very enjoyable.</v>

2729
01:55:41.190 --> 01:55:45.840
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's what life is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life is about these friendships and</v>

2730
01:55:45.841 --> 01:55:47.970
<v Speaker 2>these enjoyable moments that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>with each other.</v>

2731
01:55:48.210 --> 01:55:50.820
<v Speaker 2>So this is absolute ideas that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

2732
01:55:50.821 --> 01:55:52.260
<v Speaker 2>but what is the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

2733
01:55:52.290 --> 01:55:53.101
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

2734
01:55:53.101 --> 01:55:54.660
<v Speaker 2>it's all going to end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2735
01:55:54.690 --> 01:55:55.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2736
01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:57.690
<v Speaker 2>you could look at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what's the point in playing</v>

2737
01:55:57.691 --> 01:55:59.430
<v Speaker 2>the game?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The is going to be over one day.</v>

2738
01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Do you not enjoy the fucking game?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enjoy the game.</v>

2739
01:56:03.170 --> 01:56:05.790
<v Speaker 2>We saw sitting on the steps today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2740
01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:08.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sitting there in Hollywood,</v>

2741
01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:12.270
<v Speaker 2>just poisoned Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're poisoned by the brake dust.</v>

2742
01:56:12.271 --> 01:56:13.890
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking flying through the air</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

2743
01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:17.280
<v Speaker 2>Shit's terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully different smells out here,</v>

2744
01:56:17.281 --> 01:56:19.050
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This brake dust is terrible.</v>

2745
01:56:19.051 --> 01:56:21.210
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the one things that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't talk about,</v>

2746
01:56:21.211 --> 01:56:23.520
<v Speaker 2>about living in urban environments that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

2747
01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:25.530
<v Speaker 2>You go to your car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that shit.</v>

2748
01:56:25.531 --> 01:56:28.080
<v Speaker 2>If you have a wheel and you see that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff on the outside of your wheel,</v>

2749
01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:30.570
<v Speaker 2>you're breathing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're breathing that everywhere.</v>

2750
01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you live in New York or if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live in La and there's constant</v>

2751
01:56:33.601 --> 01:56:35.970
<v Speaker 2>traffic going by you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time they hit the brakes,</v>

2752
01:56:35.971 --> 01:56:38.400
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of fucking dust gets up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air and that stuff,</v>

2753
01:56:38.650 --> 01:56:41.310
<v Speaker 2>and you're dealing with millions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of cars and stuff permeates the</v>

2754
01:56:41.311 --> 01:56:41.780
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

2755
01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:45.690
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People's People's vault,</v>

2756
01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:47.370
<v Speaker 2>the voluntary coast guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Somalia,</v>

2757
01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:49.140
<v Speaker 2>that's what the pirates called</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

2758
01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:52.980
<v Speaker 2>The reason why they started doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>pirating in Somalia,</v>

2759
01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:56.190
<v Speaker 2>because they were fishermen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fishermen and these assholes from</v>

2760
01:56:56.191 --> 01:57:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Europe and Russia were dumping toxic</v>
<v Speaker 2>waste off their shores,</v>

2761
01:57:00.450 --> 01:57:02.730
<v Speaker 2>nuclear waste,</v>
<v Speaker 2>toxic chemical waste.</v>

2762
01:57:02.970 --> 01:57:05.580
<v Speaker 2>And it was killing all the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they started doing was</v>

2763
01:57:05.581 --> 01:57:08.850
<v Speaker 2>kidnapping the people that were in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>boat that we're doing the dumping.</v>

2764
01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:12.060
<v Speaker 2>So these fishermen who were fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>starving to death because they,</v>

2765
01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:14.280
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their waters were polluted.</v>

2766
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:16.890
<v Speaker 2>They started going after these guys and</v>
<v Speaker 2>kidnapping them.</v>

2767
01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Then they realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2768
01:57:18.091 --> 01:57:21.240
<v Speaker 2>we get way more fucking money from</v>
<v Speaker 2>kidnapping people than we do from</v>

2769
01:57:21.241 --> 01:57:22.950
<v Speaker 2>fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They became pirates.</v>

2770
01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:26.280
<v Speaker 2>And so they also started taking this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff called cat.</v>

2771
01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:27.880
<v Speaker 2>And this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2772
01:57:27.890 --> 01:57:31.170
<v Speaker 2>it's a narcotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a stimulant that they,</v>

2773
01:57:31.171 --> 01:57:32.004
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take.</v>

2774
01:57:32.670 --> 01:57:35.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like a plant that they chew and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives them like,</v>

2775
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:37.530
<v Speaker 2>like it's like a fucking meth type</v>
<v Speaker 2>plant.</v>

2776
01:57:37.531 --> 01:57:39.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the exact uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull,</v>

2777
01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:40.620
<v Speaker 2>pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's k,</v>

2778
01:57:40.621 --> 01:57:41.790
<v Speaker 2>h,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a t,</v>

2779
01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:44.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's a stimulant that they chew all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

2780
01:57:44.311 --> 01:57:47.550
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are so there it is cat to be banned in</v>

2781
01:57:47.551 --> 01:57:50.760
<v Speaker 2>the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see like this guy's eating chewing</v>

2782
01:57:50.761 --> 01:57:51.610
<v Speaker 2>on these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2783
01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:56.660
<v Speaker 2>these leaves and it produces popup up a</v>
<v Speaker 2>website or a web description instead of</v>

2784
01:57:57.181 --> 01:57:59.610
<v Speaker 2>an image and we'll find out what is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual,</v>

2785
01:57:59.611 --> 01:58:01.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to all set of images.</v>

2786
01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:06.140
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda like a big league chew on</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2787
01:58:06.990 --> 01:58:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a as scene in that movie.</v>

2788
01:58:09.241 --> 01:58:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Captain Phillips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2789
01:58:11.230 --> 01:58:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Though this or this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff is,</v>

2790
01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:16.830
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a drug and these people take it.</v>

2791
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:19.650
<v Speaker 2>It's an alkaloid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2792
01:58:19.651 --> 01:58:23.640
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catherine known or it's an amphetamine</v>

2793
01:58:23.641 --> 01:58:26.250
<v Speaker 2>amphetamine like stimulant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has said to cause excitement,</v>

2794
01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:29.520
<v Speaker 2>a loss of appetite and euphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so these guys take this,</v>

2795
01:58:29.521 --> 01:58:32.550
<v Speaker 2>they get jacked on this cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>k,</v>

2796
01:58:32.551 --> 01:58:33.121
<v Speaker 2>h,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2797
01:58:33.121 --> 01:58:34.410
<v Speaker 2>t.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>

2798
01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:36.630
<v Speaker 2>M.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would go out and fucking kidnap</v>

2799
01:58:36.631 --> 01:58:39.030
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2800
01:58:39.031 --> 01:58:39.930
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2801
01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:40.973
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my initial,</v>

2802
01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:42.300
<v Speaker 2>when I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except</v>

2803
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:43.810
<v Speaker 4>Somali pirates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2804
01:58:43.811 --> 01:58:48.280
<v Speaker 4>that's how we tell history is from</v>
<v Speaker 4>Captain Phillips side.</v>

2805
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:49.690
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's like the Howard Zinn thing.</v>

2806
01:58:49.691 --> 01:58:51.310
<v Speaker 4>Howard Zinn tells it from the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>

2807
01:58:51.311 --> 01:58:53.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let me retract that.</v>

2808
01:58:53.290 --> 01:58:55.880
<v Speaker 4>I like Somali pirates a little bit too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what you guys got to,</v>

2809
01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:56.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2810
01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:57.940
<v Speaker 4>they've got a reason to fight.</v>

2811
01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:59.660
<v Speaker 2>They got fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for the longest time,</v>

2812
01:58:59.661 --> 01:59:02.270
<v Speaker 2>they were incredibly peaceful people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somalians were very peaceful.</v>

2813
01:59:02.330 --> 01:59:02.961
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2814
01:59:02.961 --> 01:59:05.330
<v Speaker 2>they weren't out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robin and trying to Jack People,</v>

2815
01:59:05.331 --> 01:59:07.880
<v Speaker 2>they were fishermen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when the Europeans started dumping</v>

2816
01:59:07.881 --> 01:59:10.370
<v Speaker 2>that stuff off their shores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to take a new approach.</v>

2817
01:59:10.850 --> 01:59:14.540
<v Speaker 2>They had to just adapt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>improvise,</v>

2818
01:59:14.541 --> 01:59:15.420
<v Speaker 2>overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2819
01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:17.540
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's that coming from?</v>

2820
01:59:17.541 --> 01:59:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2821
01:59:18.530 --> 01:59:21.890
<v Speaker 2>large scale human beings living in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant civilizations,</v>

2822
01:59:21.891 --> 01:59:24.350
<v Speaker 2>creating waste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what to do with some</v>

2823
01:59:24.351 --> 01:59:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Dick hole decides to dump it off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>coast of Africa because they don't have</v>

2824
01:59:28.131 --> 01:59:29.090
<v Speaker 2>any say in the matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2825
01:59:29.091 --> 01:59:32.010
<v Speaker 2>they didn't want to dump it in the then</v>
<v Speaker 2>the London Bay.</v>

2826
01:59:32.330 --> 01:59:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they decided to do that here too long</v>

2827
01:59:35.171 --> 01:59:38.480
<v Speaker 2>to do it all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make loosen standards so that</v>

2828
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:41.960
<v Speaker 2>companies can put more in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big deal with New York City as</v>

2829
01:59:41.961 --> 01:59:44.540
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Hudson River's fucking deserted</v>

2830
01:59:44.541 --> 01:59:46.430
<v Speaker 2>wasteland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was at one point in time,</v>

2831
01:59:46.431 --> 01:59:48.540
<v Speaker 2>they're dredging it up now and starting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>

2832
01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:51.100
<v Speaker 2>to clean it and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to uh,</v>

2833
01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:56.200
<v Speaker 2>really impose very strict regulations on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of waste that gets in it.</v>

2834
01:59:56.850 --> 01:59:59.720
<v Speaker 1>But these large animal facilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

2835
01:59:59.750 --> 02:00:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2836
02:00:00.681 --> 02:00:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Where we put this stuff and you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>these trucks going up into these big</v>

2837
02:00:03.681 --> 02:00:04.760
<v Speaker 1>tank trucks full of,</v>

2838
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.440
<v Speaker 4>and they had the hall it really far</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they don't have enough,</v>

2839
02:00:07.470 --> 02:00:10.740
<v Speaker 4>they're renting land all over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're hauling it as a big issue in</v>

2840
02:00:10.741 --> 02:00:14.190
<v Speaker 4>our areas is the weight on the roads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then,</v>

2841
02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:15.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the farmers,</v>

2842
02:00:15.630 --> 02:00:18.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't want to be taxed or</v>

2843
02:00:18.211 --> 02:00:19.044
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

2844
02:00:19.230 --> 02:00:21.810
<v Speaker 4>I believe there's a compromise where it</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't a road tax,</v>

2845
02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:25.410
<v Speaker 4>but they made him have another axle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it spread the weight out and wasn't,</v>

2846
02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:26.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn the hell out of the</v>

2847
02:00:26.590 --> 02:00:27.261
<v Speaker 2>roads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2848
02:00:27.261 --> 02:00:29.030
<v Speaker 2>so the actual physical weight on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>road,</v>

2849
02:00:29.031 --> 02:00:31.280
<v Speaker 2>is that why they go to the giant tankers</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

2850
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.280
<v Speaker 2>I always wondered why they weighed them.</v>

2851
02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Well in our neck of the woods again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2852
02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the roads were just gravel</v>
<v Speaker 1>roads and then over time they did this</v>

2853
02:00:39.211 --> 02:00:41.460
<v Speaker 1>thing called tarn chip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I grabbed the road.</v>

2854
02:00:41.461 --> 02:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not built in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have any particular engineer.</v>

2855
02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Well this was supposed to have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering standards,</v>

2856
02:00:46.771 --> 02:00:48.080
<v Speaker 1>but fun as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2857
02:00:49.110 --> 02:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>And there aren't any engineering</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards,</v>

2858
02:00:51.901 --> 02:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>but gravel roads are a bitch to keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they started to Taryn chip them.</v>

2859
02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:56.831
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2860
02:00:56.831 --> 02:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a poor man's a blacktop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you put uh,</v>

2861
02:01:00.810 --> 02:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>or asphalt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you put this tar down and then go</v>

2862
02:01:02.941 --> 02:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>over the top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I could have pea gravel,</v>

2863
02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>pea gravel stuff and it all binds</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and then over 10 people keep</v>

2864
02:01:08.311 --> 02:01:10.710
<v Speaker 1>driving on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And over time it actually seals it up.</v>

2865
02:01:11.150 --> 02:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>And if you're just driving over it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars and pickup trucks,</v>

2866
02:01:13.381 --> 02:01:16.610
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now here comes big tanker truck or</v>

2867
02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:17.810
<v Speaker 1>being taker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2868
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>w you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind a monster tractor and you know,</v>

2869
02:01:20.431 --> 02:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>it's breaking down the sides of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>roads and it ends up being an issue for</v>

2870
02:01:23.581 --> 02:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as nate said,</v>

2871
02:01:25.470 --> 02:01:28.290
<v Speaker 1>they're having to haul this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>further for cause you can only put so</v>

2872
02:01:28.291 --> 02:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>much shit on so much ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the shit that they are putting out</v>

2873
02:01:32.041 --> 02:01:33.890
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2874
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2875
02:01:35.861 --> 02:01:39.800
<v Speaker 1>it's liquid manure that's going into</v>
<v Speaker 1>these tanks or into these</v>

2876
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:42.850
<v Speaker 4>facilities and newer liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2877
02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:45.310
<v Speaker 4>it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just found a new way to torch the</v>

2878
02:01:45.311 --> 02:01:46.300
<v Speaker 4>terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a,</v>

2879
02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:48.770
<v Speaker 4>there's a double standard with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2880
02:01:48.990 --> 02:01:50.450
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] so he got this massive</v>
<v Speaker 4>model,</v>

2881
02:01:50.451 --> 02:01:51.540
<v Speaker 4>liquid manure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't,</v>

2882
02:01:51.550 --> 02:01:52.400
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to store it.</v>

2883
02:01:52.401 --> 02:01:53.960
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to compost it or</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything like that.</v>

2884
02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:56.510
<v Speaker 4>So like right now we've got a nice snow</v>
<v Speaker 4>pack,</v>

2885
02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:58.520
<v Speaker 4>12 inches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're spread it on top of the</v>

2886
02:01:58.521 --> 02:01:59.840
<v Speaker 4>snow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2887
02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:00.660
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2888
02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:02.390
<v Speaker 4>and just to illustrate the double</v>
<v Speaker 4>standard,</v>

2889
02:02:02.391 --> 02:02:03.770
<v Speaker 4>I got family that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2890
02:02:03.771 --> 02:02:05.420
<v Speaker 4>is in the septic business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2891
02:02:05.421 --> 02:02:08.720
<v Speaker 4>so if they go out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they spread this shit on a certain</v>

2892
02:02:08.721 --> 02:02:09.710
<v Speaker 4>slope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human shit,</v>

2893
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:12.620
<v Speaker 4>human shit from like holding tanks are</v>
<v Speaker 4>pumping out.</v>

2894
02:02:12.621 --> 02:02:14.100
<v Speaker 4>So spread it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2895
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:15.560
<v Speaker 4>we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing though.</v>

2896
02:02:15.630 --> 02:02:18.140
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they spread it on the snow and if they</v>

2897
02:02:18.141 --> 02:02:19.100
<v Speaker 4>do it over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you,</v>

2898
02:02:19.190 --> 02:02:20.440
<v Speaker 4>if they do it over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2899
02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:23.980
<v Speaker 4>he said that because Jamie just pulled</v>
<v Speaker 4>up liquid I newer spreaders and tool</v>

2900
02:02:23.981 --> 02:02:27.080
<v Speaker 4>bars for the people that are listening</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've added added axles,</v>

2901
02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:27.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a new thing.</v>

2902
02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:31.280
<v Speaker 4>They used to have one axle just spread</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was just too much on the road.</v>

2903
02:02:31.281 --> 02:02:34.520
<v Speaker 4>But so a septic dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes out there to get rid of this</v>

2904
02:02:34.521 --> 02:02:37.220
<v Speaker 4>human shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if he does it on a certain grade,</v>

2905
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:41.730
<v Speaker 4>he'll get a giant fine from the dnr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a farmer goes out and does it and</v>

2906
02:02:41.731 --> 02:02:42.440
<v Speaker 4>it's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2907
02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:43.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so human shit,</v>

2908
02:02:43.821 --> 02:02:45.050
<v Speaker 4>a farmer can dump human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2909
02:02:45.210 --> 02:02:47.420
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A farmer can go dump cow shit.</v>

2910
02:02:47.421 --> 02:02:48.350
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2911
02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:50.420
<v Speaker 4>in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean shit a shit a shit.</v>

2912
02:02:50.450 --> 02:02:51.283
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean</v>

2913
02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:52.031
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2914
02:02:52.031 --> 02:02:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Because cow shit is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're eating grass.</v>

2915
02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:55.480
<v Speaker 2>So like manure</v>

2916
02:02:56.110 --> 02:02:57.950
<v Speaker 4>facilities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not $30 kid.</v>

2917
02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:00.210
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2918
02:03:00.310 --> 02:03:03.770
<v Speaker 4>obviously this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the snow melts and you know that,</v>

2919
02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:06.370
<v Speaker 4>that a lot of that shit is going into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the stream.</v>

2920
02:03:06.371 --> 02:03:08.950
<v Speaker 4>So like we're doug and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2921
02:03:09.670 --> 02:03:11.530
<v Speaker 4>we really value our shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2922
02:03:11.531 --> 02:03:12.790
<v Speaker 4>we keep it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we compost it,</v>

2923
02:03:12.791 --> 02:03:15.310
<v Speaker 4>we turn it into something with value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] that's a waste.</v>

2924
02:03:15.311 --> 02:03:18.220
<v Speaker 4>It's going into the water and polluting</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's a waste of money.</v>

2925
02:03:19.260 --> 02:03:21.180
<v Speaker 2>The drone footage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did it.</v>

2926
02:03:21.181 --> 02:03:24.090
<v Speaker 2>This pig farm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy.</v>

2927
02:03:24.091 --> 02:03:26.090
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if not a particular memory</v>

2928
02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:27.960
<v Speaker 2>that you would probably agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with.</v>

2929
02:03:27.961 --> 02:03:30.600
<v Speaker 2>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people in the cowspiracy</v>

2930
02:03:30.601 --> 02:03:34.470
<v Speaker 2>documentary certain degree with is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something evil about these ag</v>

2933
02:03:39.061 --> 02:03:41.970
<v Speaker 2>atrocities that are being committed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these factory farms.</v>

<v Speaker 2>live these cages.</v>

2938
02:03:56.670 --> 02:03:57.930
<v Speaker 2>And then here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a guy.</v>

2963
02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:56.430
<v Speaker 2>the person they talked to the neighbor</v>

<v Speaker 2>people's houses and think some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbors are saying it gets like it</v>

2974
02:05:21.091 --> 02:05:23.400
<v Speaker 2>within the facility there too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>these things don't get treated like a</v>

2979
02:05:31.351 --> 02:05:33.030
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get treated like a commodity.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's levels right?</v>

2981
02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:38.520
<v Speaker 2>To people that are vegans,</v>

2987
02:05:50.461 --> 02:05:51.990
<v Speaker 2>but then eventually you're gonna kill</v>

02:06:07.971 --> 02:06:08.804
<v Speaker 1>going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2996
02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:13.230
<v Speaker 1>or it probably won't be pleased where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't be mature,</v>

2997
02:06:13.640 --> 02:06:14.300
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2998
02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:16.130
<v Speaker 1>unless she gets a prolapsed cervix or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2999
02:06:16.131 --> 02:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3000
02:06:18.990 --> 02:06:19.823
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

3001
02:06:19.930 --> 02:06:22.930
<v Speaker 1>So if you push these broken and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>done for cows,</v>

3002
02:06:23.410 --> 02:06:25.360
<v Speaker 1>cows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to be specific there,</v>

3003
02:06:25.361 --> 02:06:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to say that there's not a difference</v>

3004
02:06:29.860 --> 02:06:30.730
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3005
02:06:30.731 --> 02:06:32.080
<v Speaker 1>there's depth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not paying attention,</v>

3006
02:06:32.110 --> 02:06:32.621
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3007
02:06:32.621 --> 02:06:34.900
<v Speaker 1>if that's what the argument is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not paying attention and we</v>

3008
02:06:34.901 --> 02:06:36.190
<v Speaker 1>can't have a conversation about it.</v>

3009
02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:39.930
<v Speaker 2>I just think they think that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate goal at the end is definitely</v>

3010
02:06:39.931 --> 02:06:44.010
<v Speaker 2>death or the ultimate result for these</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

3011
02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3012
02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same people don't want you to be</v>

3013
02:06:47.001 --> 02:06:48.190
<v Speaker 1>shooting wild animals either.</v>

3014
02:06:48.270 --> 02:06:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3015
02:06:49.290 --> 02:06:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even wolves,</v>

3016
02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:54.540
<v Speaker 2>which is why I've just read one is</v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious because there's so much</v>

3017
02:06:54.541 --> 02:06:58.920
<v Speaker 2>ignorance involved in people's idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a wolf is and why there's so many</v>

3018
02:06:58.921 --> 02:07:02.940
<v Speaker 2>folk tales and stories that involve bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves killing people.</v>

3019
02:07:03.090 --> 02:07:05.810
<v Speaker 2>There was a two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just read this to,</v>

3020
02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:06.541
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves,</v>

3021
02:07:06.541 --> 02:07:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can,</v>

3022
02:07:07.710 --> 02:07:12.090
<v Speaker 2>we can check it and if we're not to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but two wolves killed 176 sheep or</v>

3023
02:07:12.091 --> 02:07:13.980
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And One night I am for fun.</v>

3024
02:07:14.250 --> 02:07:15.690
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the thing that wolves do</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

3025
02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:18.570
<v Speaker 2>and then they're having a real big</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with this and yellowstone and,</v>

3026
02:07:18.571 --> 02:07:21.810
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of places that have elk is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they don't kill.</v>

3027
02:07:21.811 --> 02:07:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Like a cat will kill a wolf or a cat</v>
<v Speaker 2>will kill an elk rather.</v>

3028
02:07:25.501 --> 02:07:27.690
<v Speaker 2>And he will eat that elk for a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time.</v>

3029
02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:30.990
<v Speaker 2>He'll bury it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll try and he'll eat it and a wolf</v>

3030
02:07:30.991 --> 02:07:32.370
<v Speaker 2>kills it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eats a little bit,</v>

3031
02:07:32.371 --> 02:07:35.140
<v Speaker 2>and then kills another one and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>kills another one and kills another one.</v>

3032
02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:39.220
<v Speaker 2>And they do whatever the fuck they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of these guys that I know at hoyt</v>

3033
02:07:39.250 --> 02:07:42.070
<v Speaker 2>was telling me about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this wolf,</v>

3034
02:07:42.071 --> 02:07:46.150
<v Speaker 2>that it killed this a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way it did it was it attacked</v>

3035
02:07:46.151 --> 02:07:49.420
<v Speaker 2>the cat cow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elk attacked it towards guts apart and</v>

3036
02:07:49.421 --> 02:07:52.090
<v Speaker 2>then this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then backed off and just watched and</v>

3037
02:07:52.091 --> 02:07:56.140
<v Speaker 2>sat and didn't eat and watch this thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle and try to walk away and tried</v>

3038
02:07:56.141 --> 02:07:59.560
<v Speaker 2>to walk into this river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to get away and they would go</v>

3039
02:07:59.561 --> 02:08:02.170
<v Speaker 2>after it again and tear it apart a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit more and then back off again.</v>

3040
02:08:02.590 --> 02:08:06.430
<v Speaker 2>They do it for fun and it's what they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>designed for.</v>

3041
02:08:06.431 --> 02:08:10.340
<v Speaker 2>They're killing machines and they enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and it's it.</v>

3042
02:08:10.380 --> 02:08:12.510
<v Speaker 2>They're beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying they're evil.</v>

3043
02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:16.870
<v Speaker 2>We should kill them all and eradicate</v>
<v Speaker 2>them from the face of war of the world.</v>

3044
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:20.320
<v Speaker 2>But there's something strange about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of animal.</v>

3045
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:22.510
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not necessarily,</v>

3046
02:08:22.511 --> 02:08:26.200
<v Speaker 2>they're not environmentalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not conservationists to fucking</v>

3047
02:08:26.201 --> 02:08:29.050
<v Speaker 2>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And wolves are dangerous.</v>

3048
02:08:29.110 --> 02:08:29.711
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3049
02:08:29.711 --> 02:08:32.980
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have an essential place in a very</v>

3050
02:08:32.981 --> 02:08:36.850
<v Speaker 2>diverse ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the top of the food chain is fucking</v>

3051
02:08:36.851 --> 02:08:38.350
<v Speaker 2>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

3052
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:40.240
<v Speaker 2>And when human beings decide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

3053
02:08:40.510 --> 02:08:44.510
<v Speaker 2>there's too many of these goddamn wolves</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are killing a hundred plus sheep in</v>

3054
02:08:44.511 --> 02:08:46.030
<v Speaker 2>a night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or my friend,</v>

3055
02:08:46.031 --> 02:08:49.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Hockridge who lives up in,</v>

3056
02:08:49.391 --> 02:08:50.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in BC,</v>

3057
02:08:50.771 --> 02:08:52.810
<v Speaker 2>his neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking cow,</v>

3058
02:08:52.811 --> 02:08:56.200
<v Speaker 2>got taken out at cal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got taken out by wolves and you're in,</v>

3059
02:08:56.201 --> 02:09:00.430
<v Speaker 2>in BC where he lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no tag limit for wolves.</v>

3060
02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:02.830
<v Speaker 2>You could shoot as many as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can shoot well,</v>

3061
02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:04.630
<v Speaker 2>you could be your hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

3062
02:09:04.631 --> 02:09:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I go bowling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shoot wolves.</v>

3063
02:09:06.100 --> 02:09:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking trying to take out as</v>

3064
02:09:07.631 --> 02:09:08.710
<v Speaker 2>many walls as they can.</v>

3065
02:09:10.190 --> 02:09:11.780
<v Speaker 1>When we were talking about coyotes</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

3066
02:09:11.781 --> 02:09:12.650
<v Speaker 1>and personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3067
02:09:13.090 --> 02:09:14.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've shot a few coyotes in my day.</v>

3068
02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:16.130
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3069
02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:16.993
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3070
02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:20.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's not something I could go on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue.</v>

3071
02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3072
02:09:21.801 --> 02:09:23.930
<v Speaker 1>necessarily it's more opportunistic or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3073
02:09:23.931 --> 02:09:28.931
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking with roadrunner and you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to take them out and anvil acme,</v>

3074
02:09:29.570 --> 02:09:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Doug's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3075
02:09:32.450 --> 02:09:33.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like the deer thing.</v>

3076
02:09:33.951 --> 02:09:37.000
<v Speaker 1>When I was listening to various</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments about a deer,</v>

3077
02:09:37.001 --> 02:09:38.350
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons we have so many deer</v>

3078
02:09:38.351 --> 02:09:43.070
<v Speaker 1>in Wisconsin and another agricultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas is because of agriculture.</v>

3079
02:09:43.071 --> 02:09:45.380
<v Speaker 1>And they are highly adaptive.</v>

3080
02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:47.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really big point because</v>

3081
02:09:47.411 --> 02:09:50.560
<v Speaker 2>they're not even essentially wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really kind of like a farm</v>

3082
02:09:50.561 --> 02:09:52.240
<v Speaker 2>animal and a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was one of the,</v>

3083
02:09:52.690 --> 02:09:55.630
<v Speaker 2>the things that Steve brought up on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show that we talked about,</v>

3084
02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:57.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it ever made the air</v>

3085
02:09:57.540 --> 02:09:57.840
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

3086
02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:00.040
<v Speaker 2>does that make the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were just talking about how these</v>

3087
02:10:00.041 --> 02:10:01.180
<v Speaker 2>animals are essentially</v>

3088
02:10:01.380 --> 02:10:03.570
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like a livestock almost.</v>

3089
02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Well non fenced in the trail camera</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures that I sent you have different</v>

3090
02:10:08.861 --> 02:10:09.750
<v Speaker 1>gear that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3091
02:10:09.751 --> 02:10:10.500
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3092
02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:11.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks.</v>

3093
02:10:11.031 --> 02:10:11.521
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3094
02:10:11.521 --> 02:10:13.800
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to see that out and of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

3095
02:10:14.150 --> 02:10:15.930
<v Speaker 1>or guitar or whatever or maybe you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3096
02:10:15.980 --> 02:10:17.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

3097
02:10:17.131 --> 02:10:18.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3098
02:10:18.271 --> 02:10:20.580
<v Speaker 1>they're very different than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mule deer that we were talking about</v>

3099
02:10:20.581 --> 02:10:22.260
<v Speaker 1>before the show started that Rinella</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed,</v>

3100
02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:23.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was on a show recently,</v>

3101
02:10:23.851 --> 02:10:25.830
<v Speaker 1>which is enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>

3102
02:10:25.831 --> 02:10:27.530
<v Speaker 1>majestic public land mule</v>

3103
02:10:27.530 --> 02:10:32.090
<v Speaker 2>deer that he killed a mule deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've found we'll travel 150 miles,</v>

3104
02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:34.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during season there.</v>

3105
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:36.240
<v Speaker 2>They really migrate in</v>

3106
02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:40.670
<v Speaker 1>probably for a lot of the same reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have to for food.</v>

3107
02:10:40.671 --> 02:10:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Food and for whatever.</v>

3108
02:10:42.621 --> 02:10:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Whereas an older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deer gets in our area,</v>

3109
02:10:45.710 --> 02:10:49.880
<v Speaker 1>at least my experience has been so the</v>
<v Speaker 1>older deer gets in our area,</v>

3110
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:53.260
<v Speaker 1>the less it moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a,</v>

3111
02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:55.250
<v Speaker 1>a buck that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3112
02:10:55.251 --> 02:10:58.640
<v Speaker 1>you're managing for bigger bucks and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start seeing one that maybe has a</v>

3113
02:10:58.850 --> 02:11:01.640
<v Speaker 1>distinctive antler or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can tell it from other ones,</v>

3114
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:04.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll begin to realize,</v>

3115
02:11:04.521 --> 02:11:05.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that great big one that I shot,</v>

3116
02:11:06.210 --> 02:11:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I saw that dear for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived in about a 40 acre area.</v>

3117
02:11:10.050 --> 02:11:11.130
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

3118
02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just waiting for him to slip up.</v>

3119
02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:17.220
<v Speaker 2>And he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of these hunting shows</v>

3120
02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:19.180
<v Speaker 2>where they named the deer's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3121
02:11:19.260 --> 02:11:20.011
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

3122
02:11:20.011 --> 02:11:22.730
<v Speaker 2>they'll call this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3123
02:11:22.740 --> 02:11:24.600
<v Speaker 2>old forkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

3124
02:11:24.630 --> 02:11:27.120
<v Speaker 2>and they'll have names for these animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll target them.</v>

3125
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:29.880
<v Speaker 2>We're looking for lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to get lucky know they'll</v>

3126
02:11:29.881 --> 02:11:32.700
<v Speaker 2>have these shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like this is so bizarre because it's</v>

3127
02:11:32.701 --> 02:11:36.240
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of ways you're like kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>farming because they have these gigantic</v>

3128
02:11:36.241 --> 02:11:39.750
<v Speaker 2>pastures that they call food plots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they'll do is they'll,</v>

3129
02:11:39.930 --> 02:11:43.200
<v Speaker 2>they'll plow the land and they'll grow a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of clover,</v>

3130
02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:45.900
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different different times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alfalfa,</v>

3131
02:11:45.930 --> 02:11:48.000
<v Speaker 2>different things that they know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dears,</v>

3132
02:11:48.030 --> 02:11:49.820
<v Speaker 2>we'll eat deers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3133
02:11:49.890 --> 02:11:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Deers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then they set up a tree stand and</v>

3134
02:11:53.041 --> 02:11:54.120
<v Speaker 2>a whack them out.</v>

3135
02:11:55.500 --> 02:11:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

3136
02:11:57.630 --> 02:12:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of what I do in my land management</v>

3137
02:12:00.061 --> 02:12:04.650
<v Speaker 1>service for people is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to help their property become more</v>

3138
02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:07.920
<v Speaker 1>wildlife friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I try to push to</v>

3139
02:12:07.921 --> 02:12:11.340
<v Speaker 1>people is that when we're doing things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like timber stand improvement or</v>

3140
02:12:11.341 --> 02:12:15.810
<v Speaker 1>invasive species management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or providing a wildlife food plots,</v>

3141
02:12:15.811 --> 02:12:17.460
<v Speaker 1>we're planting with wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food plots,</v>

3142
02:12:17.461 --> 02:12:19.530
<v Speaker 1>just not dear food plots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of those guys that,</v>

3143
02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:21.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I really want to steer well,</v>

3144
02:12:22.260 --> 02:12:23.880
<v Speaker 1>what's a concern at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3145
02:12:23.881 --> 02:12:26.910
<v Speaker 1>And what's good for deer is generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for a whole host of wildlife.</v>

3146
02:12:26.911 --> 02:12:28.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's a little bit different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3147
02:12:28.501 --> 02:12:29.161
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you mean.</v>

3148
02:12:29.161 --> 02:12:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I tend to name them afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that big one,</v>

3149
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:34.650
<v Speaker 1>big one that I killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3150
02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:36.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we called them the standard.</v>

3151
02:12:36.150 --> 02:12:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because also the standard by which</v>

3152
02:12:39.271 --> 02:12:41.230
<v Speaker 1>all after this we'll be judged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3153
02:12:41.910 --> 02:12:44.940
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3154
02:12:44.970 --> 02:12:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean that part of the relationship is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is uh,</v>

3155
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.710
<v Speaker 2>complicated man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is complicated,</v>

3156
02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:53.850
<v Speaker 2>but like all things involving life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd become complicated.</v>

3157
02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:54.920
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

3158
02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:56.100
<v Speaker 2>it's not as simple.</v>

3159
02:12:56.450 --> 02:12:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I talk about media or a little bit?</v>

3160
02:12:58.130 --> 02:12:58.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

3161
02:12:59.120 --> 02:12:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we did,</v>

3162
02:12:59.991 --> 02:13:00.930
<v Speaker 1>we shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3163
02:13:01.170 --> 02:13:02.830
<v Speaker 1>starting this Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a,</v>

3164
02:13:03.020 --> 02:13:05.180
<v Speaker 1>there'll be three episodes in a row that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were shot on the farm.</v>

3165
02:13:05.420 --> 02:13:06.320
<v Speaker 1>The first ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

3166
02:13:06.321 --> 02:13:08.510
<v Speaker 1>steve taken apart a couple of the deer</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3167
02:13:08.620 --> 02:13:11.300
<v Speaker 1>that he finally shot a couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our place.</v>

3168
02:13:11.301 --> 02:13:13.610
<v Speaker 1>And technically he'll say something</v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

3169
02:13:13.611 --> 02:13:16.880
<v Speaker 1>but during our hunting killed two deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he took them apart.</v>

3170
02:13:16.881 --> 02:13:21.881
<v Speaker 1>So it's a really informative episode</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the different kinds of cuts,</v>

3171
02:13:23.451 --> 02:13:25.790
<v Speaker 1>how well one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to just do it,</v>

3172
02:13:26.690 --> 02:13:29.510
<v Speaker 1>and then the different kinds of cuts in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the methods for doing this stuff.</v>

3173
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Just really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3174
02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I just watched it and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just really impressed by it.</v>

3175
02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:35.060
<v Speaker 2>And he's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really is.</v>

3176
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:38.710
<v Speaker 2>He's so God damn important because in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

3177
02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:43.800
<v Speaker 2>my mind on television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is the most prominent intellectual</v>

3178
02:13:43.991 --> 02:13:47.320
<v Speaker 2>voice for wild game management,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild game conservation,</v>

3179
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:48.850
<v Speaker 2>and for hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3180
02:13:48.851 --> 02:13:51.190
<v Speaker 2>he's a true conservationist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3181
02:13:51.370 --> 02:13:54.850
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy who really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly believes in public land hunting</v>

3182
02:13:54.910 --> 02:13:57.220
<v Speaker 2>and it goes way out of his way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3183
02:13:57.221 --> 02:14:00.460
<v Speaker 2>he gets plenty of offers to hunt on</v>
<v Speaker 2>private land.</v>

3184
02:14:00.461 --> 02:14:05.461
<v Speaker 2>He prefers to hunt on public land and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>prefers to do his best to try to do</v>

3185
02:14:06.101 --> 02:14:08.230
<v Speaker 2>whatever he can to help keep those lands</v>
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>

3186
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to promote that.</v>

3187
02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:10.670
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3188
02:14:10.670 --> 02:14:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things he likes about</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting on my place is that he knows</v>

3189
02:14:14.601 --> 02:14:17.540
<v Speaker 1>that after the fact we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3190
02:14:17.541 --> 02:14:20.720
<v Speaker 1>like when you were there and just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this pasture and every other year</v>

3191
02:14:20.721 --> 02:14:22.910
<v Speaker 1>there's a small group of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt opening weekend.</v>

3192
02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:26.630
<v Speaker 1>After that I start letting other folks</v>
<v Speaker 1>come in.</v>

3193
02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's our private land we're able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

3194
02:14:28.761 --> 02:14:32.570
<v Speaker 1>but it is the public's animal and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put restrictions on folks.</v>

3195
02:14:32.571 --> 02:14:35.930
<v Speaker 1>You can't shoot a buck or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be this big or whatever it</v>

3196
02:14:35.931 --> 02:14:37.440
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3197
02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:40.800
<v Speaker 1>and he's applauded that in the past and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>

3198
02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:41.673
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>

3199
02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>

3200
02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:44.710
<v Speaker 1>That's really important to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3201
02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:46.520
<v Speaker 1>because I struggle with that a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

3202
02:14:46.521 --> 02:14:50.450
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the alternative isn't very good.</v>

3203
02:14:50.451 --> 02:14:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Where you land is just wide open to</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who wants to come in on an</v>

3204
02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:55.040
<v Speaker 1>experience that no good.</v>

3205
02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:59.230
<v Speaker 2>What is the problem is you can't really</v>
<v Speaker 2>count on everybody to be ethical.</v>

3206
02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:03.370
<v Speaker 2>You can't really count on everybody to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of if your land with reverence</v>

3207
02:15:03.371 --> 02:15:07.810
<v Speaker 2>and dignity and the way you treat it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the liability,</v>

3208
02:15:07.811 --> 02:15:10.300
<v Speaker 2>you can't let every yahoo very</v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

3209
02:15:10.301 --> 02:15:11.134
<v Speaker 2>Very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3210
02:15:11.410 --> 02:15:13.630
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the animal they got winged in the neck</v>

3211
02:15:13.631 --> 02:15:16.930
<v Speaker 2>cause he's going by that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the coyotes took up part,</v>

3212
02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:19.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows who shot that,</v>

3213
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:22.420
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it was an ethical shot or</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bad shot.</v>

3214
02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

3215
02:15:23.190 --> 02:15:24.550
<v Speaker 1>that's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3216
02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:29.180
<v Speaker 1>so that's the first episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next two are two people that I,</v>

3217
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I hunted with us that I know and love</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we actually uh,</v>

3218
02:15:34.270 --> 02:15:36.220
<v Speaker 1>did a very similar thing to what you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian did.</v>

3219
02:15:36.221 --> 02:15:38.220
<v Speaker 1>The first time Brittany and Helen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3220
02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:43.660
<v Speaker 1>hunted was in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a year ago and sort of like a</v>

3221
02:15:44.290 --> 02:15:45.910
<v Speaker 1>steve did with you and Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3222
02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:49.090
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next hunt was to bring them to our</v>

3223
02:15:49.091 --> 02:15:51.550
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they went from hiking and working</v>

3224
02:15:51.551 --> 02:15:55.060
<v Speaker 1>hard and freezing and not seeing deer</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much to freezing her ass off,</v>

3225
02:15:55.061 --> 02:15:58.690
<v Speaker 1>sitting in a blind doing and the weather</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperated.</v>

3226
02:15:58.691 --> 02:16:00.420
<v Speaker 1>It was nearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not nearly as cold as well</v>

3227
02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:02.070
<v Speaker 2>or snowy though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3228
02:16:02.071 --> 02:16:06.550
<v Speaker 2>coincidentally I was in town the night</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the opening day and I was so</v>

3229
02:16:06.551 --> 02:16:10.340
<v Speaker 2>bummed out that I had scheduled it where</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to be in Colorado the next day and</v>

3230
02:16:10.341 --> 02:16:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I barely made it out of Madison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

02:16:31.741 --> 02:16:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next year we're going to manage it.</v>

3241
02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:34.360
<v Speaker 2>Alan and I were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

3242
02:16:34.361 --> 02:16:36.520
<v Speaker 2>we made a commitment to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about it.</v>

3243
02:16:36.521 --> 02:16:38.230
<v Speaker 2>What can we had so much fun two years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

3244
02:16:38.260 --> 02:16:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe we must do what I can to</v>

3245
02:16:40.361 --> 02:16:43.300
<v Speaker 2>make sure the weather is not as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't mind shitty weather,</v>

3246
02:16:43.890 --> 02:16:44.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people ask me,</v>

3247
02:16:45.150 --> 02:16:46.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it like with those guys?</v>

3248
02:16:46.431 --> 02:16:47.181
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3249
02:16:47.181 --> 02:16:48.840

3251
02:16:49.820 --> 02:16:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's shit on a stick.</v>

3252
02:16:51.291 --> 02:16:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Which is still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's still the number one</v>

3253
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:59.230
<v Speaker 2>mediator viewed huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had so much fun,</v>

3254
02:16:59.751 --> 02:17:02.030
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so fun just hanging out.</v>

3255
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Just [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am trying to interject.</v>

3256
02:17:03.921 --> 02:17:06.180
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with conservation was the mood.</v>

3257
02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:07.820
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so fun man.</v>

3258
02:17:08.310 --> 02:17:09.440
<v Speaker 2>So fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

3259
02:17:09.470 --> 02:17:11.810
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things about these</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>

3260
02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:16.370
<v Speaker 2>The comradery is almost as important as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hunting itself.</v>

3261
02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Like just to have a bunch of guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out,</v>

3262
02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:19.990
<v Speaker 2>having a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3263
02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.100
<v Speaker 2>on your farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3264
02:17:21.101 --> 02:17:23.720
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have such a beautiful piece of land</v>

3265
02:17:23.721 --> 02:17:26.840
<v Speaker 2>that when we're talking about earlier</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we use the term driftless.</v>

3266
02:17:27.350 --> 02:17:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what that means is that this is the</v>

3267
02:17:29.391 --> 02:17:34.370
<v Speaker 2>area where the glaciers passed over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't go through this area.</v>

3268
02:17:34.371 --> 02:17:38.720
<v Speaker 2>So you have beautiful rolling hills and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think of Wisconsin as being like</v>

3269
02:17:38.721 --> 02:17:41.130
<v Speaker 2>sort of a flat area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it is and some songs.</v>

3270
02:17:41.580 --> 02:17:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But where you guys are at,</v>

3271
02:17:43.071 --> 02:17:45.080
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking gorgeous.</v>

3272
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:49.800
<v Speaker 2>So much wildlife to Turk do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We saw Turkeys,</v>

3273
02:17:49.801 --> 02:17:51.510
<v Speaker 2>we saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we almost hit a Turkey on her way to the</v>

3274
02:17:51.511 --> 02:17:52.620
<v Speaker 2>airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's three of them,</v>

3275
02:17:52.650 --> 02:17:54.430
<v Speaker 2>big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would,</v>

3276
02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:56.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would have messed up our day.</v>

3277
02:17:56.430 --> 02:17:58.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if we'd have made it,</v>

3278
02:17:58.980 --> 02:18:00.300
<v Speaker 2>made it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would have made it,</v>

3279
02:18:00.301 --> 02:18:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I would have knocked the glass out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would put our goggles on.</v>

3280
02:18:02.461 --> 02:18:03.420
<v Speaker 2>We would have drilled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't be here.</v>

3281
02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason I got the fire in the</v>

3282
02:18:08.011 --> 02:18:08.641
<v Speaker 2>belly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3283
02:18:08.641 --> 02:18:11.430
<v Speaker 2>you said that goes on and drive all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

3284
02:18:12.690 --> 02:18:14.250
<v Speaker 2>They can't take out your windshield</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

3285
02:18:14.251 --> 02:18:14.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3286
02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3287
02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:16.353
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3288
02:18:17.010 --> 02:18:19.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we had such a good time with that.</v>

3289
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:22.240
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when Helen and Brittany,</v>

3290
02:18:22.241 --> 02:18:27.241
<v Speaker 1>who were a beginner hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to have that experience</v>

3291
02:18:28.270 --> 02:18:30.490
<v Speaker 1>similar to what you and Brian had in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana.</v>

3292
02:18:30.491 --> 02:18:30.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3293
02:18:30.791 --> 02:18:32.590
<v Speaker 1>we don't take it easy on us because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

3294
02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:34.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever women or whatever it happens to</v>

3295
02:18:34.931 --> 02:18:36.250
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would not take it easy on either</v>

3296
02:18:36.251 --> 02:18:39.230
<v Speaker 1>one of those two for any reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're just there.</v>

3297
02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:40.273
<v Speaker 1>They're bad ass</v>

3298
02:18:40.980 --> 02:18:43.040
<v Speaker 2>swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Helen's addicted to Jujitsu.</v>

3299
02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3300
02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:47.660
<v Speaker 2>She's been doing Jujitsu with Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Tony Bourdain.</v>

3301
02:18:47.661 --> 02:18:50.450
<v Speaker 2>They've been going fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She takes it all the time.</v>

3302
02:18:50.451 --> 02:18:52.790
<v Speaker 2>She's lost a ton of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She looks fantastic.</v>

3303
02:18:52.930 --> 02:18:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3304
02:18:54.210 --> 02:18:57.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we did a very similar thing,</v>

3305
02:18:57.791 --> 02:19:00.340
<v Speaker 1>although this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you recall when you guys were there,</v>

3306
02:19:00.341 --> 02:19:03.250
<v Speaker 1>we had these blind set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like pop up lines and stuff.</v>

3307
02:19:03.490 --> 02:19:04.323
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3308
02:19:04.330 --> 02:19:05.081
<v Speaker 1>Steve says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3309
02:19:05.081 --> 02:19:09.910
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to have them do ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>blinds and you know how hard that was</v>

3310
02:19:09.911 --> 02:19:13.090
<v Speaker 1>when we were inside those blinds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't really offer any heat or</v>

3311
02:19:13.091 --> 02:19:14.500
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it made complete sense.</v>

3312
02:19:14.501 --> 02:19:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we built these beautiful blinds.</v>

3313
02:19:16.980 --> 02:19:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one that Steve built will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>there after the</v>

3314
02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:21.810
<v Speaker 2>apocalypse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys built them while you were</v>

3315
02:19:21.811 --> 02:19:22.430
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3316
02:19:22.430 --> 02:19:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3317
02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Do just get some plywood.</v>

3318
02:19:24.370 --> 02:19:24.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3319
02:19:24.851 --> 02:19:25.191
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3320
02:19:25.191 --> 02:19:26.590
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just with what was there.</v>

3321
02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean of course</v>

3322
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:30.950
<v Speaker 5>Steve had to take some wire and baler</v>
<v Speaker 5>twine and stuff along and Brittany and I</v>

3323
02:19:30.951 --> 02:19:31.781
<v Speaker 5>just went off where I was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3324

<v Speaker 5>we'll just pull stuff together and kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of make them,</v>

3325
02:19:33.471 --> 02:19:35.930
<v Speaker 5>how many days did you do this for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The blinds?</v>

3326
02:19:36.590 --> 02:19:37.460
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a couple hours.</v>

<v Speaker 5>with my camera man and sat and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it didn't make the show thankfully,</v>

3341
02:20:11.541 --> 02:20:13.640
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will admit on the year that I took a</v>

3342
02:20:13.641 --> 02:20:16.910
<v Speaker 5>shot at a deer and just cleaned Mr and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell you,</v>

3343
02:20:16.911 --> 02:20:20.120
<v Speaker 5>I spent a couple hours at African him</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause I just couldn't believe I missed.</v>

3344
02:20:20.390 --> 02:20:23.720
<v Speaker 5>Well you did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well when we were there I fell and</v>

3345
02:20:23.721 --> 02:20:25.190
<v Speaker 5>fucked up my rifle scope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember?</v>

3346
02:20:25.191 --> 02:20:29.240
<v Speaker 5>And you actually helped me cite it back</v>
<v Speaker 5>in because I didn't know that was,</v>

3347
02:20:29.310 --> 02:20:31.520
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had an issue with the scope being</v>

3348
02:20:31.521 --> 02:20:33.950
<v Speaker 5>loose and it was set in whoever said it</v>
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>

3349
02:20:34.420 --> 02:20:36.410
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just because we change scopes,</v>

3350
02:20:36.411 --> 02:20:40.280
<v Speaker 5>I had a leopold and we put a vortex on</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when we changed the scope,</v>

3351
02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:42.440
<v Speaker 5>unfortunately it wasn't done right.</v>

3352
02:20:42.860 --> 02:20:45.620
<v Speaker 5>And there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so just some steps weren't taken to</v>

3353
02:20:45.621 --> 02:20:49.700
<v Speaker 5>secure it correctly and you float on it</v>
<v Speaker 5>real hard on it.</v>

3354
02:20:49.701 --> 02:20:51.350
<v Speaker 5>That hard man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause I was,</v>

3355
02:20:51.351 --> 02:20:53.240
<v Speaker 5>that was off man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was off bad.</v>

3356
02:20:53.241 --> 02:20:56.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like more than a foot or close to a foot</v>

3357
02:20:56.600 --> 02:20:58.510
<v Speaker 5>at a hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3358
02:20:58.750 --> 02:21:01.850
<v Speaker 5>a hundred yards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I wish I had that excuse.</v>

3359
02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:03.800
<v Speaker 5>I just cleaned miss that deer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

3360
02:21:03.860 --> 02:21:04.880
<v Speaker 5>I was a polk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3361
02:21:04.910 --> 02:21:08.840
<v Speaker 5>but she was standing still many a yards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about 400 yards.</v>

3362
02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:12.350
<v Speaker 5>It was a political,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I had a long fucking shot man.</v>

3363
02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:14.390
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

3364
02:21:14.660 --> 02:21:15.680
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I cleaned,</v>

3365
02:21:15.681 --> 02:21:17.630
<v Speaker 5>missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now do you use one of those,</v>

3366
02:21:17.631 --> 02:21:20.960
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ranch phone calculator apps where like</v>

3367
02:21:20.961 --> 02:21:23.660
<v Speaker 5>you have to like figure out like how far</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is,</v>

3368
02:21:23.661 --> 02:21:25.910
<v Speaker 5>the velocity of your gun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3369
02:21:25.911 --> 02:21:27.920
<v Speaker 5>what are you're shooting at 30 odd sex?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually,</v>

3370
02:21:27.921 --> 02:21:28.880
<v Speaker 5>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3371
02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:30.690
<v Speaker 5>a savage three windmills.</v>

3372
02:21:30.860 --> 02:21:31.800
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

3373
02:21:31.801 --> 02:21:33.890
<v Speaker 5>They thought for me to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3374
02:21:33.891 --> 02:21:35.810
<v Speaker 5>Savage is the sponsor of the show now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3375
02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:37.160
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Excellent guns.</v>

3376
02:21:37.310 --> 02:21:38.570
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wonderful family.</v>

3377
02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:41.840
<v Speaker 5>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that special trigger to like,</v>

3378
02:21:41.850 --> 02:21:44.510
<v Speaker 5>that's like the one step two step</v>
<v Speaker 5>process.</v>

3379
02:21:44.570 --> 02:21:47.480
<v Speaker 5>So they have a very light trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it won't go off accidentally.</v>

3380
02:21:47.690 --> 02:21:48.700
<v Speaker 5>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3381
02:21:49.610 --> 02:21:54.610
<v Speaker 5>the rifle was dead nuts and should say</v>
<v Speaker 5>these guys I know about this stuff</v>

3382
02:21:55.191 --> 02:21:57.900
<v Speaker 5>because of Steve and now his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's called the mediator podcast,</v>

3383
02:21:57.980 --> 02:22:00.420
<v Speaker 5>which I talked him into doing and now</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a,</v>

3384
02:22:00.470 --> 02:22:02.060
<v Speaker 5>now he's addicted to it too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

02:22:02.090 --> 02:22:04.100
<v Speaker 5>it's a great fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

3386
02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:07.970
<v Speaker 5>It's a great podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's so good at it.</v>

3387
02:22:08.450 --> 02:22:09.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You had the guys from vortex on there</v>

3388
02:22:09.951 --> 02:22:13.160
<v Speaker 5>talking about different things and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>learned a lot that day.</v>

3389
02:22:13.610 --> 02:22:14.630
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so anyway,</v>

3390
02:22:14.631 --> 02:22:16.570
<v Speaker 5>I cleaned mist and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3391
02:22:20.090 --> 02:22:22.950
<v Speaker 5>I know I've talked about this before and</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe the podcast and I've,</v>

3392
02:22:23.420 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 5>I said I've never regretted shot that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't</v>

3393
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:28.140
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Steve's like really,</v>

3394
02:22:28.700 --> 02:22:29.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you know,</v>

3395
02:22:30.390 --> 02:22:32.100
<v Speaker 1>incredulous about most of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I say,</v>

3396
02:22:32.101 --> 02:22:35.190
<v Speaker 1>but at most things everybody said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3397
02:22:35.191 --> 02:22:36.510
<v Speaker 1>he challenges you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

3398
02:22:37.020 --> 02:22:39.300
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took that shot and I kind of regretted</v>

3399
02:22:39.301 --> 02:22:41.910
<v Speaker 1>it because it was a long poker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a rifle that wasn't my rifle.</v>

3400
02:22:42.180 --> 02:22:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I would make that shot with my own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right over her back and she ducked</v>

3401
02:22:45.961 --> 02:22:47.940
<v Speaker 1>in the whole thing and I was sure I hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

3402
02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:48.983
<v Speaker 1>I went down there,</v>

3403
02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:51.870
<v Speaker 4>did she jump The gun?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like did she drop down?</v>

3404
02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:54.530
<v Speaker 4>Zynga Virbac</v>

3405
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:56.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3406
02:22:56.690 --> 02:22:59.620
<v Speaker 1>and we watched it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my camera man and I kept watching it on</v>

3407
02:22:59.621 --> 02:23:02.050
<v Speaker 1>the thing and so I went right down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spot where I marked exactly where</v>

3408
02:23:02.051 --> 02:23:04.570
<v Speaker 1>the spot was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had snow and everything and um,</v>

3409
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I just cleaned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>missed and,</v>

3410
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:09.580
<v Speaker 1>and it was a shot that in retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of wish I wouldn't have taken,</v>

3411
02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:11.800
<v Speaker 1>especially with what was happening right</v>
<v Speaker 1>then deer,</v>

3412
02:23:11.801 --> 02:23:13.300
<v Speaker 1>we're starting to come to the field and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

3413
02:23:13.301 --> 02:23:14.590
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the point was,</v>

3414
02:23:14.591 --> 02:23:16.570
<v Speaker 1>it was from that blind that you sent me</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that,</v>

3415
02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:18.790
<v Speaker 1>that hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where it lives is up there on</v>

3416
02:23:18.791 --> 02:23:19.930
<v Speaker 1>top of the lid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great spot.</v>

3417
02:23:19.931 --> 02:23:21.980
<v Speaker 1>You'll love it when you see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3418
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:24.860
<v Speaker 4>have you ever seen those bail blinds</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are,</v>

3419
02:23:24.861 --> 02:23:29.220
<v Speaker 4>they look like a bale of Hay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You sneaky go inside them and you're</v>

3420
02:23:29.230 --> 02:23:29.790
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>And we've actually made,</v>

3422

<v Speaker 4>You don't have guns and here we can't do</v>

3455
02:24:49.401 --> 02:24:50.930
<v Speaker 4>it during season,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's legal.</v>

3456
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:53.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't do it during the rifle season</v>

3457
02:24:53.210 --> 02:24:54.300
<v Speaker 4>during hunting season.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3458
02:24:54.860 --> 02:24:56.090
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ends at a certain date.</v>

3459
02:24:56.120 --> 02:24:56.953
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

3460
02:24:57.380 --> 02:24:58.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we did,</v>

3461
02:24:58.611 --> 02:25:00.890
<v Speaker 1>because the other problem with those</v>
<v Speaker 1>blinds,</v>

3462
02:25:00.891 --> 02:25:03.960
<v Speaker 1>as you might remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is pretty damn crowded in them and they</v>

3463
02:25:03.970 --> 02:25:04.840
<v Speaker 1>actually sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3464
02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:05.733
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3465
02:25:05.780 --> 02:25:06.531
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3466
02:25:06.531 --> 02:25:08.900
<v Speaker 1>blind now called shadow her blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a different other gray.</v>

3467
02:25:08.930 --> 02:25:09.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3468
02:25:10.020 --> 02:25:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I have a few of those around.</v>

3469
02:25:12.350 --> 02:25:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3470
02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:14.300
<v Speaker 1>and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are great,</v>

3471
02:25:14.301 --> 02:25:18.020
<v Speaker 1>but we couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't make sense to do that.</v>

3472
02:25:18.021 --> 02:25:20.480
<v Speaker 1>We had too many people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the filming thing.</v>

3473
02:25:20.481 --> 02:25:23.290
<v Speaker 1>So we built a little blinds for four</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3474
02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:23.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two people,</v>

3475
02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:26.320
<v Speaker 1>202 cameramen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't insulated then.</v>

3476
02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Ho they sure weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the day before while you were there,</v>

3477
02:25:30.161 --> 02:25:32.590
<v Speaker 1>you know what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was beautiful at the end before we</v>

3478
02:25:32.591 --> 02:25:33.970
<v Speaker 1>were out squirrel hunting in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

3479
02:25:34.540 --> 02:25:36.790
<v Speaker 1>and these girls were shooting squirrels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They were so much fun and they were just</v>

3482
02:25:42.341 --> 02:25:45.240
<v Speaker 1>so incredible squirrel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderers and,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You take it really seriously and Brian</v>

3514
02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:47.240

<v Speaker 1>I'm so close to it.</v>

3521
02:26:57.591 --> 02:26:59.150
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't necessarily say,</v>

3522
02:26:59.151 --> 02:27:01.610
<v Speaker 1>but we are very successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3523
02:27:01.611 --> 02:27:03.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to spoil it for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we put,</v>

3525
02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:07.580
<v Speaker 1>we put some deer on the ground and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

3526
02:27:07.610 --> 02:27:09.560
<v Speaker 1>they did a terrific job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3527
02:27:10.460 --> 02:27:12.960
<v Speaker 1>and I think it makes for compelling,</v>

<v Speaker 1>for a compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That show's always awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3530
02:27:17.881 --> 02:27:21.570
<v Speaker 5>what I wanted to ask you is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with all the wildlife that you have in</v>

3531
02:27:21.571 --> 02:27:22.640
<v Speaker 5>your area,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

3532
02:27:22.770 --> 02:27:24.180
<v Speaker 5>what are the seasons?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3533
02:27:24.181 --> 02:27:26.610
<v Speaker 5>I know you have more than one season of</v>
<v Speaker 5>deer.</v>

3534
02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:29.400
<v Speaker 5>So when does the season started?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's an archery season first.</v>

3535
02:27:29.430 --> 02:27:30.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Archery season starts ones.</v>

3536
02:27:31.110 --> 02:27:33.960
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>September 15th or the second Saturday in</v>

3537
02:27:33.961 --> 02:27:35.280
<v Speaker 5>September.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many archer?</v>

3538
02:27:35.281 --> 02:27:37.830
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a lot of archery hunt</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunters come out there?</v>

3539
02:27:38.130 --> 02:27:38.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot</v>

3540
02:27:40.380 --> 02:27:41.400
<v Speaker 1>on our place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3541
02:27:41.550 --> 02:27:42.383
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3542
02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:46.650
<v Speaker 1>but I'd be happy to have one or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even like rifle hunting that</v>

3543
02:27:46.651 --> 02:27:47.820
<v Speaker 1>much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3544
02:27:48.690 --> 02:27:53.160
<v Speaker 1>well the thing about archery hunting for</v>
<v Speaker 1>deer in our area is,</v>

3545
02:27:53.220 --> 02:27:54.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very well,</v>

3546
02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:58.510
<v Speaker 1>but you've learned all this to hunt with</v>
<v Speaker 1>cam is it's,</v>

3547
02:27:59.090 --> 02:28:01.770
<v Speaker 1>they've got to be closer and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>care how many of them there are,</v>

3548
02:28:02.570 --> 02:28:04.020
<v Speaker 1>they've got to be close and they've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come in.</v>

3549
02:28:04.021 --> 02:28:06.120
<v Speaker 1>You're going to spend some time out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and not much is going on.</v>

3550
02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:10.680
<v Speaker 1>But our archery season coincides with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first part of November,</v>

3551
02:28:10.681 --> 02:28:12.600
<v Speaker 1>end of October,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first partner in November where the pre</v>

3552
02:28:12.601 --> 02:28:14.880
<v Speaker 1>rutten rod is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of deer activity.</v>

3553
02:28:15.210 --> 02:28:17.220
<v Speaker 1>And so there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3554
02:28:18.270 --> 02:28:21.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can call and you can use sense and</v>

3555
02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:22.820
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff and they're coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>

3556
02:28:22.821 --> 02:28:25.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a completely different relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the animal.</v>

3557
02:28:25.190 --> 02:28:27.420
<v Speaker 1>We actually have crossbow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3558
02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:29.870
<v Speaker 1>now you can use a crossbow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not along Boeing personally.</v>

3559
02:28:29.871 --> 02:28:31.490
<v Speaker 1>That's what I use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3560
02:28:32.300 --> 02:28:34.040
<v Speaker 1>that's cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3561
02:28:34.041 --> 02:28:34.710
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3562
02:28:34.710 --> 02:28:38.500
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not archery.</v>

3563
02:28:38.860 --> 02:28:43.860
<v Speaker 5>That's a shitty gun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't fucking scope on it.</v>

3564
02:28:44.470 --> 02:28:45.700
<v Speaker 5>Sure does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sure does.</v>

3565
02:28:45.701 --> 02:28:48.790
<v Speaker 5>Cravings of magnification scope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You put the crosshair on,</v>

3566
02:28:48.791 --> 02:28:50.300
<v Speaker 5>you pull the trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd sit in on arrest,</v>

3567
02:28:50.470 --> 02:28:53.170
<v Speaker 5>you can rest it down like a candidate</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is not archery,</v>

3568
02:28:53.171 --> 02:28:54.850
<v Speaker 5>God it and drink beer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>While you're doing that,</v>

3569
02:28:54.910 --> 02:28:55.910
<v Speaker 5>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could smoke,</v>

3570
02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:57.770
<v Speaker 5>shoot heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shoot things.</v>

3571
02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:00.150
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to practice with them</v>

3572
02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:01.270
<v Speaker 5>much at all.</v>

3573
02:29:01.460 --> 02:29:04.100
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is certainly different than</v>

3574
02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:05.580
<v Speaker 1>shooting a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3575
02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:08.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm comfortable that 50 or 60 yards with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crossbow.</v>

3576
02:29:08.210 --> 02:29:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know people can shoot further in</v>

3577
02:29:09.641 --> 02:29:10.474
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I just,</v>

3578
02:29:10.580 --> 02:29:12.650
<v Speaker 1>ethically I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not interested in that.</v>

3579
02:29:12.980 --> 02:29:17.980
<v Speaker 1>But I am interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a boy of Cam was here.</v>

3580
02:29:18.861 --> 02:29:19.401
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3581
02:29:19.401 --> 02:29:22.940
<v Speaker 1>dragged me outside or maybe you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say that that bow hunting is for</v>

3582
02:29:22.941 --> 02:29:24.940
<v Speaker 1>people who don't have enough to do in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3583
02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:30.030
<v Speaker 5>It's true that it takes so much time to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be an ethical bow hunter.</v>

3584
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:32.930
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about gun was shot 200</v>
<v Speaker 5>arrows today.</v>

3585
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:34.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I shot all day to day.</v>

3586
02:29:34.850 --> 02:29:38.600
<v Speaker 5>I had a weight representative come to my</v>
<v Speaker 5>house and we're,</v>

3587
02:29:38.601 --> 02:29:41.370
<v Speaker 5>we're shooting era.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a whole three d setup in my yard.</v>

3588
02:29:41.371 --> 02:29:43.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shooting a rubber elk all day to day.</v>

3589
02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:45.170
<v Speaker 5>My arms are sore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3590
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:46.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be an asshole.</v>

3591
02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:49.790
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to be committed to it.</v>

3592
02:29:49.970 --> 02:29:51.180
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And yes.</v>

3593
02:29:51.530 --> 02:29:54.040
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hardest thing for me during that</v>

3594
02:29:54.041 --> 02:29:57.850
<v Speaker 1>time of the year on the farm is to sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a tree and wait for a deer to come</v>

3595
02:29:57.851 --> 02:29:59.260
<v Speaker 1>by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3596
02:29:59.500 --> 02:30:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I've got all of these other things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to be doing that during that</v>

3597
02:30:02.621 --> 02:30:04.210
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at my,</v>

3598
02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:07.120
<v Speaker 1>at my work and in Madison or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

3599
02:30:07.121 --> 02:30:11.290
<v Speaker 1>but on that farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm actually moving a little bit more</v>

3600
02:30:11.291 --> 02:30:13.840
<v Speaker 1>towards in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during archery season is because I've</v>

3601
02:30:13.841 --> 02:30:17.020
<v Speaker 1>not had a whole lot of archery and we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a couple of guys over the years.</v>

3602
02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:20.980
<v Speaker 1>But to start the host people come home</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm gonna be there anyway.</v>

3603
02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:23.470
<v Speaker 1>I might be partaking in it and myself.</v>

3604
02:30:23.670 --> 02:30:26.790
<v Speaker 5>Well that's my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's actually more attractive to me</v>

3605
02:30:26.791 --> 02:30:31.050
<v Speaker 5>then even coming on an opening day now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long does the uh,</v>

3606
02:30:31.120 --> 02:30:34.650
<v Speaker 5>archery season last until the 1st of</v>
<v Speaker 5>January.</v>

3607
02:30:34.740 --> 02:30:36.750
<v Speaker 5>Til the 1st of January.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it goes straight through.</v>

3608
02:30:36.930 --> 02:30:38.070
<v Speaker 5>Well you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3609
02:30:38.071 --> 02:30:41.250
<v Speaker 5>you can bow hunt during the gun season.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I could have come down and bow hunted</v>

3610
02:30:41.251 --> 02:30:42.630
<v Speaker 5>when those girls were shooting</v>
<v Speaker 5>squirrels.</v>

3611
02:30:42.631 --> 02:30:43.530
<v Speaker 5>I could have bow hunted.</v>

3612
02:30:43.620 --> 02:30:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they were shooting deer,</v>

3613
02:30:45.271 --> 02:30:47.460
<v Speaker 1>you could have bow hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just had to wear orange jacket</v>

3614
02:30:47.461 --> 02:30:48.570
<v Speaker 1>rather than the camouflage.</v>

3615
02:30:48.650 --> 02:30:51.770
<v Speaker 5>But before that I could work cammo yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I could,</v>

3616
02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:52.633
<v Speaker 5>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3617
02:30:52.850 --> 02:30:56.180
<v Speaker 5>I could archery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hunt and then bail and then take off</v>

3618
02:30:56.181 --> 02:30:57.130
<v Speaker 5>right before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

3619
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:59.840
<v Speaker 5>Oh that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's end of October.</v>

3620
02:30:59.841 --> 02:31:00.390
<v Speaker 5>The first part,</v>

3621
02:31:00.390 --> 02:31:01.380
<v Speaker 1>November.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3622
02:31:01.410 --> 02:31:02.580
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>

3623
02:31:03.890 --> 02:31:05.940
<v Speaker 1>the act of rod is going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3624
02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:07.080
<v Speaker 1>that's the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

3625
02:31:07.140 --> 02:31:09.260
<v Speaker 1>what's the deal with a black powder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that still separate?</v>

3626
02:31:09.270 --> 02:31:11.010
<v Speaker 1>That's after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After everything.</v>

3627
02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:12.970
<v Speaker 1>After the gun season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then it lasted black</v>

3628
02:31:12.970 --> 02:31:14.050
<v Speaker 5>power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Black power.</v>

3629
02:31:15.220 --> 02:31:17.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>

3630
02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:20.100
<v Speaker 5>people know we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're talking</v>

3631
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:21.170
<v Speaker 2>about muzzle loaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3632
02:31:21.370 --> 02:31:24.900
<v Speaker 2>For some strange fucking reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay to use a primitive,</v>

3633
02:31:24.901 --> 02:31:27.480
<v Speaker 2>stupid weapon that you should never use</v>
<v Speaker 2>in real life.</v>

3634
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:32.340
<v Speaker 2>You put a ball and you pack the powder</v>
<v Speaker 2>in like you're living in the fucking 18</v>

3635
02:31:32.341 --> 02:31:34.680
<v Speaker 2>hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you shoot this stupid thing?</v>

3636
02:31:34.890 --> 02:31:35.461
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing,</v>

3637
02:31:35.461 --> 02:31:38.430
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing about muskets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the weird thing about them.</v>

3638
02:31:38.850 --> 02:31:43.290
<v Speaker 2>They're real fucking accurate now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like real accurate to like 200 yards.</v>

3639
02:31:43.530 --> 02:31:46.950
<v Speaker 2>So they're basically a rifle that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't make a good ethical followup shot</v>

3640
02:31:46.951 --> 02:31:48.750
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like,</v>

3641
02:31:50.100 --> 02:31:51.690
<v Speaker 2>I get it old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

3642
02:31:51.691 --> 02:31:54.450
<v Speaker 2>you shoot in this fucking giant cloud of</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke in front of me.</v>

3643
02:31:54.451 --> 02:31:56.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

3644
02:31:56.431 --> 02:31:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Where's the animal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3645
02:31:57.421 --> 02:31:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Did he hit it low?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking,</v>

3646
02:31:58.501 --> 02:31:59.334
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3647
02:31:59.370 --> 02:32:00.690
<v Speaker 2>there'd be plenty of people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to,</v>

3648
02:32:01.080 --> 02:32:02.510
<v Speaker 2>you're going to hear it from the Congo.</v>

3649
02:32:02.770 --> 02:32:04.160
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened.</v>

3650
02:32:04.280 --> 02:32:07.110
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is definitely more accurate and</v>

3651
02:32:07.111 --> 02:32:10.770
<v Speaker 2>better than a bow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point is use a fucking gun.</v>

3652
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're shooting one of those things</v>

3653
02:32:13.201 --> 02:32:15.420
<v Speaker 2>and it's accurate to several hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>yards,</v>

3654
02:32:15.650 --> 02:32:19.260
<v Speaker 2>I know people that have shot a deer at</v>
<v Speaker 2>250 yards with a musket,</v>

3655
02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:22.080
<v Speaker 2>so with a muzzle loader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're getting to that kind of a</v>

3656
02:32:22.081 --> 02:32:24.030
<v Speaker 2>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what does that really,</v>

3657
02:32:24.090 --> 02:32:26.190
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're got a rifle to shitty rifle.</v>

3658
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:30.090
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking about a bow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you shot something at 200 yards,</v>

3659
02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:32.460
<v Speaker 2>you're basically closing your eyes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting up at the sun.</v>

3660
02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:34.740
<v Speaker 2>You know who the fuck knows where that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arrow is going?</v>

3661
02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:37.860
<v Speaker 2>You're shooting 250 yards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both a musket or a muzzle loader.</v>

3662
02:32:37.861 --> 02:32:41.520
<v Speaker 2>You can put the crosshair on that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can accurately judge just like he</v>

3663
02:32:41.521 --> 02:32:44.430
<v Speaker 2>came with a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is it takes you like 15 to</v>

3664
02:32:44.431 --> 02:32:47.380
<v Speaker 2>20 seconds to reload as opposed to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>going straight.</v>

3665
02:32:47.730 --> 02:32:49.440
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to make a followup shot with</v>

3666
02:32:49.441 --> 02:32:50.580
<v Speaker 2>a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3667
02:32:50.581 --> 02:32:54.370
<v Speaker 2>or there's a lot of people now that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting with semiautomatics,</v>

3668
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:56.130
<v Speaker 2>whether you're going Pang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pang,</v>

3669
02:32:56.131 --> 02:32:58.800
<v Speaker 2>Pang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can shoot a deer three times in two</v>

3670
02:32:58.801 --> 02:33:00.980
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll think about the black potters.</v>

3671
02:33:00.981 --> 02:33:02.790
<v Speaker 2>You've got to have your bayonet for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>finish.</v>

3672
02:33:02.830 --> 02:33:07.200
<v Speaker 2>That's the civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're on the run.</v>

3673
02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to have a flint?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hits the thing.</v>

3674
02:33:10.171 --> 02:33:11.980
<v Speaker 2>It makes us Johnny Reb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3675
02:33:13.050 --> 02:33:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has their preference</v>

3676
02:33:15.190 --> 02:33:18.340
<v Speaker 1>thing on my or my family's farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3677
02:33:18.341 --> 02:33:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm the captain and the captain gets to</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide what happens.</v>

3678
02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

3679
02:33:22.410 --> 02:33:23.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

3680
02:33:23.861 --> 02:33:24.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3681
02:33:24.381 --> 02:33:25.480
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3682
02:33:25.481 --> 02:33:27.970
<v Speaker 1>this is the way it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not absolute about anything.</v>

3683
02:33:27.971 --> 02:33:29.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over time things kind of ebb and flow</v>

3684
02:33:29.891 --> 02:33:31.090
<v Speaker 1>and change and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3685

<v Speaker 1>I want to be out there in that first</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that first part of November.</v>

3688
02:33:37.210 --> 02:33:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to practice everyday I k</v>
<v Speaker 1>camp where I live.</v>

3689
02:33:40.780 --> 02:33:43.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to become a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I readily admit it.</v>

3690
02:33:43.690 --> 02:33:44.081
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3694
02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:51.670
<v Speaker 1>20 yards about it where I feel like I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can make an ethical shot.</v>

<v Speaker 2>maybe a late eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laundry wheels for fucking laundry.</v>

02:34:12.250 --> 02:34:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>mid eighties for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3705
02:34:16.210 --> 02:34:17.080
<v Speaker 1>mid to late eighties.</v>

3706
02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:20.010
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it was early nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure I'll hear.</v>

3707
02:34:20.020 --> 02:34:22.050
<v Speaker 5>She was a slingshot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you have any rocks you going bro?</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's just not my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3711
02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:33.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my priority and,</v>

3712
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:34.660

<v Speaker 5>and I have a lot of ways,</v>

3713
02:34:35.560 --> 02:34:39.220
<v Speaker 5>I have a lot of respect for bow hunters</v>
<v Speaker 5>who spend the time to become that</v>

3714
02:34:39.221 --> 02:34:41.920
<v Speaker 5>proficient at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you end up spending a lot of</v>

3715
02:34:41.921 --> 02:34:43.660
<v Speaker 5>time whitetail hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I are is,</v>

3716
02:34:43.661 --> 02:34:45.560
<v Speaker 5>there's guys who spent a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing that.</v>

3717
02:34:45.561 --> 02:34:46.570
<v Speaker 5>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't,</v>

3718
02:34:46.670 --> 02:34:49.730
<v Speaker 5>I totally understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I totally understand.</v>

3719
02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:52.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm totally bust your balls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not something that I would add.</v>

3720
02:34:52.790 --> 02:34:54.610
<v Speaker 5>I don't think anybody should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about that?</v>

3721
02:34:56.150 --> 02:34:58.390
<v Speaker 5>I'll go hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's too much work and it's too</v>

3722
02:34:58.391 --> 02:34:59.570
<v Speaker 5>addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>

3723
02:34:59.571 --> 02:35:02.080
<v Speaker 5>and forget about bow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I never hunt again for the rest of my</v>

3724
02:35:02.081 --> 02:35:02.380
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

3725
02:35:02.380 --> 02:35:04.660
<v Speaker 5>Archery is massively addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

3726
02:35:05.140 --> 02:35:05.973
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm shooting,</v>

3727
02:35:05.980 --> 02:35:08.440
<v Speaker 5>I shoot every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so much fun to me.</v>

3728
02:35:08.441 --> 02:35:11.560
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a nice peaceful like meditation</v>

3729
02:35:11.590 --> 02:35:14.320
<v Speaker 5>type of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they have like ranges out here.</v>

3730
02:35:14.380 --> 02:35:14.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3731
02:35:14.970 --> 02:35:15.803
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3732
02:35:16.060 --> 02:35:17.580
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>

3733
02:35:17.581 --> 02:35:19.840
<v Speaker 5>a big one off of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the two 10.</v>

3734
02:35:19.841 --> 02:35:22.060
<v Speaker 5>So she's fucking huge long distance</v>
<v Speaker 5>range.</v>

3735
02:35:22.061 --> 02:35:23.380
<v Speaker 5>But I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3736
02:35:23.410 --> 02:35:24.910
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a nice meditation.</v>

3737
02:35:24.911 --> 02:35:27.790
<v Speaker 5>It's nice to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when it comes to compound bows,</v>

3738
02:35:27.970 --> 02:35:32.110
<v Speaker 5>man is really the difference between of</v>
<v Speaker 5>both from the 1980s and a modern like</v>

3739
02:35:32.111 --> 02:35:35.400
<v Speaker 5>2016 hoyt defiant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He might as well be shooting a mosque.</v>

3740
02:35:35.401 --> 02:35:37.930
<v Speaker 5>It versus like a modern savage arms</v>
<v Speaker 5>rifle.</v>

3741
02:35:37.931 --> 02:35:39.300
<v Speaker 5>It's not that much difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3742
02:35:39.510 --> 02:35:40.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3743
02:35:40.210 --> 02:35:41.020
<v Speaker 5>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3744
02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:45.280
<v Speaker 5>the amount of power that these things</v>
<v Speaker 5>have now and the speed in which they</v>

3745
02:35:45.281 --> 02:35:46.840
<v Speaker 5>shoot arrows and the accuracy.</v>

3746
02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:49.900
<v Speaker 5>There's so much technology and</v>
<v Speaker 5>engineering going into bose,</v>

3747
02:35:50.290 --> 02:35:52.900
<v Speaker 5>it's really kind of amazing because it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the few pieces of hunting</v>

3748
02:35:52.901 --> 02:35:55.480
<v Speaker 5>equipment that literally changes and</v>
<v Speaker 5>improves every year.</v>

3749
02:35:56.350 --> 02:35:59.080
<v Speaker 5>Couldn't sell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We think about that when I hear these,</v>

3750
02:35:59.190 --> 02:36:00.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bowhunting purist friends who are</v>

3751
02:36:00.911 --> 02:36:04.030

<v Speaker 5>me shit about,</v>

3752
02:36:04.090 --> 02:36:06.330
<v Speaker 5>about bow hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is great.</v>

3753
02:36:07.150 --> 02:36:08.880
<v Speaker 5>They're going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well this is a real purist.</v>

3754
02:36:08.890 --> 02:36:11.110
<v Speaker 5>The thing I'm a pussy because he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a compound bows.</v>

3755
02:36:11.130 --> 02:36:14.590
<v Speaker 5>They recur cause they like not being</v>
<v Speaker 5>accurate at all.</v>

3756
02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:17.260
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like fucking hoping they hit</v>

3757
02:36:17.261 --> 02:36:18.094
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

3758
02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:21.200
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

3759
02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:22.840
<v Speaker 5>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get mad at me right now.</v>

3760
02:36:22.870 --> 02:36:27.870
<v Speaker 5>Full</v>
<v Speaker 5>shoot a real bowl man with you of going</v>

3761

3763
02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:37.000
<v Speaker 5>Wrap it around your fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually think that Steve was talking</v>

3764
02:36:37.001 --> 02:36:40.400
<v Speaker 5>about on this upcoming butchery one</v>
<v Speaker 5>about how he was taking,</v>

3765
02:36:40.510 --> 02:36:43.720
<v Speaker 5>how they used to take the silver skin</v>
<v Speaker 5>off of meat and they'd get the long</v>

3766
02:36:43.721 --> 02:36:46.870
<v Speaker 5>strips of it and that's what they made</v>
<v Speaker 5>their bow string trains with.</v>

3767
02:36:47.050 --> 02:36:47.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sinew.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>

3769
02:36:49.350 --> 02:36:51.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should dry it out and roll it and</v>

3770
02:36:51.851 --> 02:36:52.840
<v Speaker 5>turn it into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Where the fuck did he go?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bolivia.</v>

3774
02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:00.653
<v Speaker 5>Bolivia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3775
02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:02.770
<v Speaker 5>God Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was an amazing show.</v>

3776
02:37:02.771 --> 02:37:04.190
<v Speaker 5>Two part episode.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3777
02:37:04.191 --> 02:37:06.700
<v Speaker 5>They went to Bolivia and the traditional</v>
<v Speaker 5>bows,</v>

3778
02:37:06.701 --> 02:37:11.020
<v Speaker 5>those guys use to kill animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had these really heavy,</v>

3779
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:16.110
<v Speaker 5>really long arrows and these stick bows</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they had made themselves</v>

3780
02:37:16.730 --> 02:37:20.420
<v Speaker 2>and he showed up with a hoyt carbon</v>
<v Speaker 2>spider and he's drilling.</v>

3781
02:37:20.450 --> 02:37:20.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

3782
02:37:20.961 --> 02:37:21.860
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3783
02:37:21.890 --> 02:37:23.370
<v Speaker 2>balls of these guys had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3784
02:37:23.371 --> 02:37:24.670
<v Speaker 2>look at that errol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3785
02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:25.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

3786
02:37:25.791 --> 02:37:28.550
<v Speaker 2>They had these really long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really heavy arrows and notice how</v>

3787
02:37:28.551 --> 02:37:32.330
<v Speaker 2>there's no fledglings on the Arrow and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got the followup Arrow right there</v>

3788
02:37:32.331 --> 02:37:33.110
<v Speaker 2>in his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3789
02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:35.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they keep them in their hands.</v>

3790
02:37:35.700 --> 02:37:40.160
<v Speaker 2>And I remember on this episode how he</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggled to,</v>

3791
02:37:40.940 --> 02:37:42.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit the fish because the,</v>

3792
02:37:42.571 --> 02:37:46.290
<v Speaker 2>how the water reflect the Arrow and</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>

3793
02:37:46.291 --> 02:37:48.890
<v Speaker 2>you're just nailing them when after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just that,</v>

3794
02:37:48.891 --> 02:37:51.200
<v Speaker 2>it's not the water deflecting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the image.</v>

3795
02:37:51.330 --> 02:37:54.560
<v Speaker 2>It looks different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fish is actually,</v>

3796
02:37:54.590 --> 02:37:57.290
<v Speaker 2>it could be as much as six inches lower</v>
<v Speaker 2>than what you think.</v>

3797
02:37:57.320 --> 02:37:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Ah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause the refraction in the water from</v>

3798
02:37:59.331 --> 02:38:01.670
<v Speaker 2>your looking down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it almost like a lens.</v>

3799
02:38:01.970 --> 02:38:04.610
<v Speaker 2>So it's like distorted where the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish is.</v>

3800
02:38:04.611 --> 02:38:06.950
<v Speaker 2>So if you shot right at the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would never hit it.</v>

3801
02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to shoot like below it.</v>

3802
02:38:08.751 --> 02:38:09.950
<v Speaker 2>It's real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever,</v>

3803
02:38:09.970 --> 02:38:13.170
<v Speaker 2>do you ever see the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that people use in America?</v>

3804
02:38:13.171 --> 02:38:14.690
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a trident.</v>

3805
02:38:14.770 --> 02:38:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a big,</v>

3806
02:38:15.980 --> 02:38:16.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're your,</v>

3807
02:38:16.741 --> 02:38:19.670
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of making up for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3808
02:38:19.671 --> 02:38:23.120
<v Speaker 2>you got some more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have all these prongs and they shoot</v>

3809
02:38:23.121 --> 02:38:26.450
<v Speaker 2>these arrows that like they split when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing sturgeon.</v>

3810
02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:29.830
<v Speaker 2>The shocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3811
02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:30.530
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3812
02:38:30.530 --> 02:38:32.750
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to shoot carp up at the end of</v>

3813
02:38:32.751 --> 02:38:37.110
<v Speaker 2>the lake and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is the sh waters real shallow</v>

3814
02:38:37.111 --> 02:38:38.870
<v Speaker 2>and they'd go up there and just raise</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell and their backs,</v>

3815
02:38:38.871 --> 02:38:41.750
<v Speaker 2>it'd be out of the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'd be dealing with it,</v>

3816
02:38:41.751 --> 02:38:42.140
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3817
02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:42.590
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3818
02:38:42.590 --> 02:38:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to live near Lake Charles in</v>

3819
02:38:46.430 --> 02:38:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Boston and there was a area by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>waterfall with the carpet pool up and it</v>

3820
02:38:51.471 --> 02:38:52.370
<v Speaker 2>was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3821
02:38:52.371 --> 02:38:56.300
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at like these 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 pound fish and there's dozens of them</v>

3822
02:38:56.301 --> 02:38:59.420
<v Speaker 2>just stacked together and you see him on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the surface of the water,</v>

3823
02:38:59.930 --> 02:39:02.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a junk fish to us,</v>

3824
02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:05.930
<v Speaker 2>but a delicacy to people in the UK and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Asia.</v>

3825
02:39:05.931 --> 02:39:07.940
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what one person?</v>

3826
02:39:08.290 --> 02:39:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one person decides it's a good fish and</v>

3827
02:39:11.271 --> 02:39:12.330
<v Speaker 2>then in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3828
02:39:12.331 --> 02:39:16.370
<v Speaker 2>and the problem was they were an</v>
<v Speaker 2>invasive species and a lot of the North</v>

3829
02:39:16.370 --> 02:39:20.330
<v Speaker 2>American rivers and lakes and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like them for whatever silly</v>

3830
02:39:20.331 --> 02:39:22.040
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are very good fish to eat</v>

3831
02:39:22.041 --> 02:39:24.200
<v Speaker 2>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you prepare it properly,</v>

3832
02:39:24.970 --> 02:39:25.820
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3833
02:39:25.821 --> 02:39:27.520
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>

3834
02:39:27.530 --> 02:39:30.110
<v Speaker 2>one of the things about grass fed beef</v>
<v Speaker 2>is um,</v>

3835
02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:31.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times it doesn't have the fat.</v>

3836
02:39:32.090 --> 02:39:33.920
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to know how to cook it.</v>

3837
02:39:33.921 --> 02:39:35.000
<v Speaker 2>You can't overcook it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3838
02:39:35.001 --> 02:39:36.370
<v Speaker 2>That's a big point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3839
02:39:36.380 --> 02:39:37.670
<v Speaker 2>you can say about any kind of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3840
02:39:37.671 --> 02:39:40.100
<v Speaker 2>people fuck up a really good piece of</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>

3841
02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:41.240
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3842
02:39:41.241 --> 02:39:43.940
<v Speaker 2>especially if a real lean piece of deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>venison,</v>

3843
02:39:44.090 --> 02:39:45.590
<v Speaker 2>elk or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moose,</v>

3844
02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:49.040
<v Speaker 2>same thing mean you what you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>barely like singe the outside of it</v>

3845
02:39:49.041 --> 02:39:49.910
<v Speaker 2>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just,</v>

3846
02:39:50.210 --> 02:39:53.450
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and knowing like how to prepare it as a</v>

3847
02:39:53.480 --> 02:39:55.430
<v Speaker 2>big part of the responsibility of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>

3848
02:39:55.750 --> 02:39:58.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to have this meat that</v>

3849
02:39:58.731 --> 02:40:01.670
<v Speaker 2>you've got from this animal and you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much reverence for the death of this</v>

3850
02:40:01.671 --> 02:40:04.220
<v Speaker 2>animal and then you just prepare it like</v>
<v Speaker 2>an asshole.</v>

3851
02:40:04.540 --> 02:40:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to put almost as much</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought into the cooking.</v>

3852
02:40:07.700 --> 02:40:09.680
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things I really love</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Rinella show.</v>

3853
02:40:09.710 --> 02:40:12.290
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the episode that I watched last</v>

3854
02:40:12.290 --> 02:40:14.040
<v Speaker 2>night about that mule deer that</v>

3855
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:18.180
<v Speaker 5>he shot this enormous dear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was it really focused on at the end of</v>

3856
02:40:18.181 --> 02:40:19.200
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how we prepared it.</v>

3857
02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:21.540
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he showed you how to prepare it and how</v>

3858
02:40:21.541 --> 02:40:24.720
<v Speaker 5>to cook it properly and how you can tell</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it's done and all this different</v>

3859
02:40:24.721 --> 02:40:25.440
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Neil,</v>

3860
02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:28.860
<v Speaker 5>he'll go through the butchering process.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll go through the cooking process and</v>

3861
02:40:28.861 --> 02:40:30.750
<v Speaker 5>that's something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of these shows they don't even</v>

3862
02:40:30.751 --> 02:40:32.730
<v Speaker 5>touch man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get the dear luke at him.</v>

3863
02:40:32.731 --> 02:40:36.060
<v Speaker 5>He's a real Iowa giant and they take a</v>
<v Speaker 5>picture with this animal.</v>

3864
02:40:36.061 --> 02:40:40.070
<v Speaker 5>They show the antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at his fourth son is fifth and Brow</v>

3865
02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:44.460
<v Speaker 5>Tine is sticking up black pass or don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>intend the tower during the tower down</v>

3866
02:40:44.461 --> 02:40:45.440
<v Speaker 5>in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3867
02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:47.100
<v Speaker 5>well there's a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of donating,</v>

3868
02:40:47.190 --> 02:40:49.860
<v Speaker 5>a lot of donating and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I suppose that's a good thing,</v>

3869
02:40:49.861 --> 02:40:51.030
<v Speaker 5>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is a good thing.</v>

3870
02:40:51.030 --> 02:40:52.710
<v Speaker 5>But there's also shows where they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretend,</v>

3871
02:40:52.740 --> 02:40:54.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're out here hunting and you know,</v>

3872
02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:56.780
<v Speaker 5>you gotta use fucking piles of corn out</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

3873
02:40:56.790 --> 02:40:59.400
<v Speaker 5>whether you're waiting for these animals</v>
<v Speaker 5>to come to and you're,</v>

3874
02:40:59.401 --> 02:41:01.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just kind of shooting at these spots</v>

3875
02:41:01.321 --> 02:41:01.651
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3876
02:41:01.651 --> 02:41:03.300
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't that,</v>

3877
02:41:04.290 --> 02:41:06.780
<v Speaker 5>that's always an interesting part of any</v>
<v Speaker 5>discussion about hunting,</v>

3878
02:41:06.781 --> 02:41:07.471
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3879
02:41:07.471 --> 02:41:09.960
<v Speaker 5>where the ethical lines yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because guys will say,</v>

3880
02:41:09.961 --> 02:41:12.420
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we cause baiting is illegal by us</v>

3881
02:41:12.421 --> 02:41:14.940
<v Speaker 5>because of a chronic wasting disease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3882
02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:18.560
<v Speaker 5>when you put a pilot corn out there</v>
<v Speaker 5>exchanging saliva and that's how they,</v>

3883
02:41:18.580 --> 02:41:20.670
<v Speaker 5>that's how it spread.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting cause,</v>

3884
02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:26.010
<v Speaker 5>but you guys do have some deer farms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is where people think the origins</v>

3885
02:41:26.011 --> 02:41:28.060
<v Speaker 5>of chronic wasting disease or from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3886
02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:30.450
<v Speaker 5>I heard an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3887
02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:32.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>discussion about that recently and one</v>

3888
02:41:32.821 --> 02:41:35.520
<v Speaker 5>of the things they talked about is that</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were these protein blocks being</v>

3889
02:41:35.521 --> 02:41:37.020
<v Speaker 5>put out and that may have been there.</v>

3890
02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:39.050
<v Speaker 5>They've never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3891
02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:42.450
<v Speaker 5>there've been a few different ideas of</v>
<v Speaker 5>where it came from.</v>

3892
02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:43.313
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3893
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:45.460
<v Speaker 5>one is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3894
02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:48.030
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the deer farms and other is these</v>

3895
02:41:48.031 --> 02:41:51.530
<v Speaker 5>protein blacks that maybe got put out</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's got an animal byproduct in it.</v>

3896
02:41:51.531 --> 02:41:55.560
<v Speaker 5>And maybe that's how it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so is it like a prime thing?</v>

3897
02:41:55.590 --> 02:41:57.210
<v Speaker 5>Is it something that's exactly what it</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

3898
02:41:57.211 --> 02:41:59.640
<v Speaker 5>is a priority.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's similar to mad cow disease.</v>

3899
02:41:59.641 --> 02:42:01.020
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3900
02:42:01.470 --> 02:42:03.130
<v Speaker 5>so would that have come?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3901
02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:04.160
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3902
02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:06.950
<v Speaker 5>and I've even heard it said that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3903
02:42:07.410 --> 02:42:10.350
<v Speaker 5>there are places where they were and</v>
<v Speaker 5>tried to improve the genetics of the</v>

3904
02:42:10.351 --> 02:42:11.700
<v Speaker 5>deer herd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they were bringing in,</v>

3905
02:42:12.380 --> 02:42:13.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bigger bucks and releasing him.</v>

3906
02:42:14.220 --> 02:42:16.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't have any proof of any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So those,</v>

3907
02:42:17.150 --> 02:42:20.850
<v Speaker 5>that could be the case that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are very concerned with people that</v>

3908
02:42:20.851 --> 02:42:23.580
<v Speaker 5>release these animals from these farms</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

3909
02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:26.280
<v Speaker 5>But there's some fucking place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I got contacted by this guy,</v>

3910
02:42:26.281 --> 02:42:28.110
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come hawn tent my place.</v>

3911
02:42:28.380 --> 02:42:31.200
<v Speaker 5>And then I looked at his instagram page</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm like,</v>

3912
02:42:31.201 --> 02:42:33.760
<v Speaker 5>that's not even a fucking cage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3913
02:42:33.761 --> 02:42:35.490
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3914
02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:37.400
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to talk shit because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3915
02:42:37.401 --> 02:42:37.831
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3916
02:42:37.831 --> 02:42:39.150
<v Speaker 5>I don't know this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why,</v>

3917
02:42:39.151 --> 02:42:41.820
<v Speaker 5>but it's a high fund fence operation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3918
02:42:41.970 --> 02:42:43.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't even want to say what state it</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

3919
02:42:43.290 --> 02:42:45.190
<v Speaker 5>but these are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're barely deer.</v>

3920
02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:47.820
<v Speaker 5>There are these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these deer that have these fucking</v>

3921
02:42:47.821 --> 02:42:49.230
<v Speaker 5>bushes growing out of their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3922
02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:51.480
<v Speaker 5>If you see what their antlers look like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

3923
02:42:51.481 --> 02:42:53.010
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not even real.</v>

3924
02:42:53.140 --> 02:42:57.810
<v Speaker 5>Have you get Jamie pull,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pull up this a ridiculous antlers in a</v>

3925
02:42:57.811 --> 02:42:59.680
<v Speaker 5>deer farm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3926
02:42:59.790 --> 02:43:02.310
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're growing these animals and their</v>

3927
02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:05.340
<v Speaker 5>trophy trophy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you call them trophies?</v>

3928
02:43:05.341 --> 02:43:09.510
<v Speaker 5>But essentially they're manipulating the</v>
<v Speaker 5>genetics of these animals so that they</v>

3929
02:43:09.511 --> 02:43:10.890
<v Speaker 5>have all these antlers.</v>

3930
02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:15.010
<v Speaker 5>So these are rich assholes can go and</v>
<v Speaker 5>shoot these things and like this hundred</v>

3931
02:43:15.011 --> 02:43:18.340
<v Speaker 5>acre fenced in area where they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>letting these animals out of their</v>

3932
02:43:18.341 --> 02:43:19.010
<v Speaker 5>pants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like look,</v>

3933
02:43:19.010 --> 02:43:20.650
<v Speaker 5>see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is that?</v>

3934
02:43:20.860 --> 02:43:23.440
<v Speaker 5>What are we looking at here for one</v>
<v Speaker 5>reason,</v>

3935
02:43:23.530 --> 02:43:25.480
<v Speaker 5>which is free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you could put that on your wall.</v>

3936
02:43:27.100 --> 02:43:30.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you could kill it and it would</v>
<v Speaker 5>taste just like a regular deer.</v>

3937
02:43:30.461 --> 02:43:31.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they're delicious and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably,</v>

3938
02:43:32.200 --> 02:43:36.700
<v Speaker 5>but look at this man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're growing these insane antlers</v>

3939
02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:40.150
<v Speaker 5>via supplemental feeding them</v>
<v Speaker 5>supplements and feeding them this shit</v>

3940
02:43:40.151 --> 02:43:44.170
<v Speaker 5>that makes their like antler steroids</v>
<v Speaker 5>that makes their antlers grow.</v>

3941
02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:45.840
<v Speaker 5>They don't look like antlers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Matt.</v>

3942
02:43:45.841 --> 02:43:47.240
<v Speaker 5>It looks like two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3943
02:43:47.580 --> 02:43:50.020
<v Speaker 5>like all nut.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Doug said,</v>

3944
02:43:50.021 --> 02:43:52.390
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's criminal.</v>

3945
02:43:52.570 --> 02:43:55.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean Doug's very strong opinion and</v>
<v Speaker 5>needed about that.</v>

3946
02:43:55.721 --> 02:43:58.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's what's critical here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Be Careful</v>

3947
02:43:59.970 --> 02:44:00.370
<v Speaker 5>Cajun.</v>

3948
02:44:00.370 --> 02:44:01.520
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cajun Amanda.</v>

3949
02:44:01.540 --> 02:44:03.210
<v Speaker 5>And then having a three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3950
02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:06.230
<v Speaker 5>300 acres isn't that big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you've got this 300 acres cage,</v>

3951
02:44:06.260 --> 02:44:08.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not hunting fish in a barrel.</v>

3952
02:44:08.801 --> 02:44:11.920
<v Speaker 5>That's fish in a barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said earlier with that on 40 acres.</v>

3953
02:44:11.921 --> 02:44:14.200
<v Speaker 5>That's where that that you're true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know what?</v>

3954
02:44:14.201 --> 02:44:16.540
<v Speaker 5>You could live that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>leave that 40 acres warning if he wants</v>

3955
02:44:16.541 --> 02:44:18.310
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's a big part coming to a bait</v>

3956
02:44:18.311 --> 02:44:19.780
<v Speaker 5>pile or any of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3957
02:44:19.790 --> 02:44:21.220
<v Speaker 5>that's where it part of ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3958
02:44:21.221 --> 02:44:22.570
<v Speaker 5>And I figured him out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3959
02:44:22.571 --> 02:44:26.500
<v Speaker 5>And I guess that's where I was getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>to is you know where those lines are.</v>

3960
02:44:26.501 --> 02:44:28.420
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the hunting that I grew up with.</v>

3961
02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:30.310
<v Speaker 5>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never hunted,</v>

3962
02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:31.930
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>outside the Midwest.</v>

3963
02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:35.380
<v Speaker 5>I really only hunted outside of our farm</v>
<v Speaker 5>twice.</v>

3964
02:44:35.590 --> 02:44:40.330
<v Speaker 5>Why have a friend who hunted in Texas at</v>
<v Speaker 5>a ranch that has 10,000 acres fence?</v>

3965
02:44:40.330 --> 02:44:42.010
<v Speaker 5>Den.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like bolts as far as I'm concerned.</v>

3966
02:44:42.011 --> 02:44:44.530
<v Speaker 5>Those are wild animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>10,000 acres.</v>

3967
02:44:44.531 --> 02:44:46.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's not a fucking animal on</v>

3968
02:44:46.721 --> 02:44:48.910
<v Speaker 5>earth that's going to travel that far</v>
<v Speaker 5>other than a mule deer.</v>

3969
02:44:48.970 --> 02:44:50.860
<v Speaker 5>There's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not an animal on earth is going</v>

3970
02:44:50.861 --> 02:44:52.690
<v Speaker 5>to migrate further than that and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>lifetime.</v>

3971
02:44:52.691 --> 02:44:57.220
<v Speaker 5>You essentially have this gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 5>fenced in habitat and their idea about</v>

3972
02:44:57.221 --> 02:44:57.731
<v Speaker 5>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3973
02:44:57.731 --> 02:45:01.330
<v Speaker 5>we can manage the wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sustainable wildlife inside.</v>

3974
02:45:01.331 --> 02:45:03.620
<v Speaker 5>We're not feeding them anything they</v>
<v Speaker 5>live off is,</v>

3975
02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:07.060
<v Speaker 5>but we're just keeping people out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not keeping the animals in,</v>

3976
02:45:07.090 --> 02:45:08.440
<v Speaker 5>keeping people out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3977
02:45:08.441 --> 02:45:10.540
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can buy that song.</v>

3978
02:45:10.541 --> 02:45:11.374
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3979
02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:12.890
<v Speaker 5>Is that a lot in this eye line of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>song?</v>

3980
02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:16.440
<v Speaker 5>The put up the fence fucking music out</v>
<v Speaker 5>or all the new showroom.</v>

3981
02:45:16.570 --> 02:45:19.660
<v Speaker 5>Oh</v>
<v Speaker 5>God was here.</v>

3982
02:45:19.661 --> 02:45:23.050
<v Speaker 5>He tell it to your face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Manage some kind of sin.</v>

3983
02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:26.500
<v Speaker 5>Says hippies though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's hippies you want to fucking get</v>

3984
02:45:26.501 --> 02:45:27.660
<v Speaker 5>on your land.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

3985
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:30.610
<v Speaker 5>I hear that the bit where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

3986
02:45:30.770 --> 02:45:33.430
<v Speaker 5>the part about the sign,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sign said,</v>

3987
02:45:33.770 --> 02:45:37.300
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody caught trespassing will be shot</v>

3988
02:45:37.301 --> 02:45:38.900
<v Speaker 5>on sight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3989
02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:40.120
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a radio bit,</v>

3990
02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:41.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

3991
02:45:42.430 --> 02:45:43.930
<v Speaker 5>and then it ends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the end of the song.</v>

3992
02:45:44.110 --> 02:45:48.430
<v Speaker 5>It's a complicated business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a complicated business and these</v>

3993
02:45:48.431 --> 02:45:50.120
<v Speaker 5>ethical lines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3994
02:45:50.590 --> 02:45:52.290
<v Speaker 5>are difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3995
02:45:52.710 --> 02:45:54.400
<v Speaker 5>it's something that you have to think</v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

3996
02:45:54.401 --> 02:45:58.960
<v Speaker 5>It's something you have to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we'll be willing to teach your mind</v>

3997
02:45:58.961 --> 02:46:01.400
<v Speaker 5>sometimes to a baiting bears is a big</v>
<v Speaker 5>dog.</v>

3998
02:46:01.540 --> 02:46:03.530
<v Speaker 5>Baiting bears is a big one because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3999
02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:05.680
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of places where the only</v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

4000
02:46:05.681 --> 02:46:07.750
<v Speaker 5>especially in the spring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're ever going to kill a bears if you</v>

4001
02:46:07.751 --> 02:46:08.980
<v Speaker 5>bait.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they,</v>

4002
02:46:09.140 --> 02:46:10.010
<v Speaker 5>to control the population</v>

4003
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:11.720
<v Speaker 2>of these barriers because the bears are</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing Moose.</v>

4004
02:46:11.721 --> 02:46:14.030
<v Speaker 2>They're killing calves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4005
02:46:14.060 --> 02:46:17.150
<v Speaker 2>they're killing Fonz from deere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the killing all sorts of things.</v>

4006
02:46:17.180 --> 02:46:18.980
<v Speaker 2>And they're killing cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're killing each other.</v>

4007
02:46:18.981 --> 02:46:20.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bears are killing machines.</v>

4008
02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:23.780
<v Speaker 2>So when they have these in environments</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they have to control the</v>

4009
02:46:23.781 --> 02:46:27.320
<v Speaker 2>population and they allow baiting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why they allow baiting is to</v>

4010
02:46:27.321 --> 02:46:30.980
<v Speaker 2>make a successful hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And recently I think in Maine it was,</v>

4011
02:46:31.310 --> 02:46:34.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they passed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were trying to pass no baiting</v>

4012
02:46:34.311 --> 02:46:36.230
<v Speaker 2>on bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why they were doing it is</v>

4013
02:46:36.231 --> 02:46:38.960
<v Speaker 2>cause anti hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were trying to stop people from</v>

4014
02:46:38.961 --> 02:46:42.020
<v Speaker 2>hunting bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the way they would essentially make a</v>

4015
02:46:42.021 --> 02:46:44.210
<v Speaker 2>hunt completely ineffective was saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>no baiting.</v>

4016
02:46:44.510 --> 02:46:46.890
<v Speaker 2>So cause as soon as you can't bait find</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

4017
02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:48.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not gonna have any success.</v>

4018
02:46:48.491 --> 02:46:49.960
<v Speaker 2>You don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't find any success.</v>

4019
02:46:49.961 --> 02:46:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4020
02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:52.470
<v Speaker 2>I have friends who live in Michigan and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were telling me,</v>

4021
02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:56.050
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could go a fucking decade without</v>

4022
02:46:56.051 --> 02:46:58.600
<v Speaker 2>seeing a bear in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile they're everywhere.</v>

4023
02:46:58.670 --> 02:47:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just don't find them.</v>

4024
02:47:00.341 --> 02:47:03.050
<v Speaker 2>You go near him that you hear the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hear a snap and twitter.</v>

4025
02:47:03.090 --> 02:47:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4026
02:47:04.540 --> 02:47:05.373
<v Speaker 2>And they</v>

4027
02:47:05.420 --> 02:47:07.300
<v Speaker 5>so quiet.</v>
